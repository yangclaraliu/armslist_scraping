Also comes with a Glock brand 22 round magazine and a KCI brand 15 round mag. 5 magazines total. Also has a 3.5lb polished lone wolf trigger connector and trigger spring installed, the trigger bar and the safety plunger have also been fully polished, this makes for a super nice trigger. Also i have 925 rounds of ammo to go with it, bellow is a list of the ammo i have for it. Exactly 500 rounds have been fired through this gun. Only reason I am getting rid of it is because I do not like the recoil characteristics of the 40 s&w round. I want to trade everything for a 9mm gun, either a full size or competition size Glock or Springfield XDM + cash, or a nice 45 acp. 1911. May also be interested in various assault rifles.

I am selling a few Mossberg parts I no longer have use for. These were originally for my Mossberg 590. They are:

Speed Feed I stock. This stock has places on each side that fits 2 shells each, making it hold 4 total.

Mako-Fab Tri Rail Forend. The side rails are removable, they are just a little tight and require some muscle to pop off after removing the screws. Make sure your forend is removable and that your slide tube is 7 5/8 inches long!! Will not fit the shorter tubes without an extended castle nut.

Archangel 7-shell side saddle. Each shell holder has it's own screw to individually adjust tension on each shell.

Screws required for installation are included for all parts. If purchased online, together these parts will cost you around $150+ total. I will only accept cash offers. 

If interested and/or have questions, you can email me at REDACTED. I would prefer to sell the whole set together rather than just part of it. Thanks."

I purchased way too many of these lights for an organization that didn't need all of them, so my loss is your gain.  The flashlights are new in box, but they do have a small engraving on them.  On the side it says ""United States Air Force Academy"".  Unfortunately, the club didn't need as many as they thought, so I'm trying to sell these so I don't lose too much money.  These lights usually MSRP for $80, and I believe they are currently on sale for $70.  Either way, this is a heck of a deal!

US 869 is a true spherical rifle powder that works great with heavy projectiles in big, overbore rifle cartridges.  US869 is a dense propellant that allows the shooter to use enough powder to create maximum velocities in cartridges such as the 7MM Remington Ultra Magnum, .300 Remington Ultra Magnum, .30-378 Weatherby Magnum and others.  US869 is superior in the .50 Caliber BMG where it yields high velocity and great accuracy with 750 to 800 grain projectiles.  This is a great 1,000-yard match propellant!  Lastly, US869 is minimally affected by varying temperatures.

The 7828 brand was designed as a big magnum powder.  The slow burning provides real magnum performance in the large over bored magnums such as the .300 Remington Ultra Mag, .30-378 Weatherby Magnum and the 7MM Remington Ultra Magnum.  IMR 7828 SSC magnum rifle powder has the exact same burn rate as standard IMR 7828 and uses the same data.  However, due to the super short kernels, metering is virtually as good as a spherical powder.  This allows up to 4% more powder space in the case and in many loads yields more velocity than standard 7828.  These loads are marked with an asterisk in the IMR data to show where standard 7828 will not fit.

This is a 16"" barrel DPMS LR-308. I am the second owner. The first owner put about 50 rounds through it, and I have put 75 - 100 through it.

I know what I have in this rifle and I don't need the money so bad that I would sell it for less. It also comes with 40 rounds of .308 ball, if I remember correctly the mfg was ATI or something like that. I was not planning on selling the case; that will be $30 extra if you want it.

Felons say the one thing scarier than hearing the pump action, is picking your body pieces off the ground when you're running for the door because there wasn't a sound before the blasting occurred.

This rifle will handle the .223 Rem, the 5.56 NATO, as well as the 80 grain .223:

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of (semi) automatic weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56×45mm NATO military ammunition. Coincidentally, it shoots the relatively long and heavy 80-grain (5.18 g) bullets commonly used in the sport of Highpower Rifle Competition very well and is one of the preferred chambers for that use. The Wylde chamber is used by a few rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers.

$1,699.00

Specifications:

A model developed after the M4 pattern rifle, the PWS MK114 Rifle has quickly become the crowd favorite for those wanting a compact package without the NFA paperwork associated with shorter barrels. The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached Triad 5.56.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

692,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2156692,For Sale:  Buffalo Bore Ammo - .45 ACP +P Ammo - 230 gr. J.H.P.

45ACP+P ammo is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 ACP ammo and can be fired in any 45 acp firearm that is in normal operating condition. However, the greater pressures and power of the +P ammo will give you greater slide velocity and if you are going to shoot more than a box or two of +P ammo, you should consider replacing your recoil spring with a Wolf Spring that gives roughly 4 to 6 lbs more spring weight than factory stock springs. A shock buffer might also be a good addition although it is not too necessary if you use the stronger spring.


The below velocities were fired from my personal Colt Gold Cup 1911 (5 inch)


1. 45185-----------1180 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. 45200-----------1078 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. 45230------------979 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. 45230FMJ------981 fps (230gr. Fmj-FLAT NOSE)
5. 45255------------960 fps  (255gr. HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)


As always, with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give real world data and results. Laboratory test barrels tell you little about what kind of speed you can expect from your stock firearm.

All our 45 ACP+P loads utilize flash suppressed powders so that you will not be blinded by your own gunfire should you need to fire in the dark when the criminal element is at work.


The three JHP loads are design for defense against humans, while the two non-expanding loads are designed to shoot through large shoulder bones or the skull on a black bear. These non-expanding bullets also work well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.

A Kimber Ultra Raptor II in Stainless Steel. It comes with 3 Kimber Stainless 7 round mags, a leather IWB holster, and hard case. It is in 99% condition, and is well cleaned after every range visit. It has around 200 rounds through it. Then I have a Springfield Armory Lightweight Operator with 2 factory 7 round mags, the 11 Gear paddle holster and 2 mag pouch. I have also ordered the Viridian X5L Gen.2 green laser and tac light for it. The laser alone was $350.00, and has to be traded with the gun unless I'm trading for something it will fit on. The Springfield is brand new, and has only fired 14 rounds. It is in mint condition. Then last is the Custom glock 27 Gen.4. It has had many upgrades, and is worth a lot more than a stock Glock. If you want a stock Glock this isn't the Glock for you. It has a black on black Zev-Tech Fulcrum Tigger with adjustable pre travel, and over travel. It can be adjusted with no play for competition or with minimal play for self defense or a long trigger pull as a safety precaution. It has a KKM Precision stainless match grade barrel that was match fitted by KKM. It has a Tungsten double spring recoil assembly which is 5x heavier than the factory recoil spring and 2x heavier than a stainless one. It has a skeletonized polished striker pin that has maritime spring cups on it. It has brand new Trijicon night sights, and the front sight tool. It has a polished titanium safety plunger with a reduced power plunger spring. It has a 3.5 Ghost Evo connector with a 6 lb. trigger spring, and a 6 lb. firing pin spring. I also have a 5 lb. and 4 lb. firing pin spring that will take the trigger weight down. It has all polished internals, and a vickers Tactical Tangodown mag release, and slide catch. It is set up with a 3.5 lb. trigger pull for self defense, but can be adjusted from 2 lbs. to 6 lbs. it shoots great and functions flawlessly. I also have all the factory parts I replaced like the barrel, trigger, etc., and it has 3 10 round mags with the +1 Pearce Grip Extension. I have a lot of spare springs in different weights and extended slide stops also. This Glock is more accurate than the Kimber, and has a better trigger than any other gun I've ever shot. It was money well spent on this gun. It also has an I-Tac button release paddle holster, and a Comp-Tac Minotar Hybrid IWB holster that was $100.00 by itself. 3 great guns, but I want to see what else is out there."

If you are not familiar with the FHN brand, they come with ambidextrous magazine release, slide release and manual external safety. This makes it easy and convenient for right and left handed shooters. None of these items get in the way of the opposite side when shooting.
These guns have been used by the military for years. They are Striker Fire like Glocks, so they are easy and simple to fieldstrip, clean and put back together."

Proofed in September of 1925.  The German Gun Collectors Association believes this is what is known as an ""apprentice"" gun.  It was likely made in the town of Suhl.  An apprentice gun is a ""final exam"" for an apprentice under a master gunsmith.  This is a 16 gauge 2 9/16"" chamber.  It is Nitro proofed so modern 2 3/4"" shells work just fine.  I shot most of a box to make sure everything worked.  One firing pin stuck a little.  I put some oil down in there and the problem cleared up.  Beautiful hand engraving on every metal surface of this gun.  There is some wear to the engraving.  It was used as a hunting gun for Quail for some time.  There is a makers mark on the gun, but the Collectors association did not have notes for the mark.  That's why it is believed to be an apprentice gun.  Apprentice guns usually run half as much as a noted maker.  That puts this gun in the $1,500 range.  Hopefully a maker can be found out by the mark someday!  Cash Only, No Trades.  $1,200 OBO"

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
