Comes with hardcase, 3 mags, an improved spring that has been installed, also has the original spring. Perfect CCW.
I will trade both of these for an AR 15 & a cheaper but quality CCW semi auto. Will also consider a quality AK 47 & CCW semi auto. Reason I'm wanting to trade is because I wanna surprise my wife (I have too many toys & she doesn't) they are my 2 favorite pistols but rather see her happy. Anyway if you have what I'm looking for let me know by email or txt me @ REDACTED for faster response. Thanks. Must be 21, No Felonies & CCH preferred as I am."

* Krieger Barrels, Inc. manufactures precision single-point cut-rifled
 barrels, which is the oldest and slowest method of rifling a barrel.
The cutter removes approximately .001"" at each pass, thus taking
several hundred passes to rifle a barrel. This produces near perfect
concentricity between groove & bore, a very uniform twist rate, and
induces no stress into the steel which later has to be relieved. The
barrels are hand lapped after reaming and then again after rifling to
finishes under 16 micro-inch in the direction of bullet travel.

I am trying to sell before the Madison gun show on Easter weekend as I would like to buy a Mossberg 930 Jerry Miculek version for 3 gun, or another high cap semi auto. I do not need to sell this gun but would like to.

As is the custom with armslist I expect the low ball offers to roll in, those will be ignored. Thanks

Here is an imgur album of the gun.

I also have a full size Springfield XD in .45 that is in 96% condition as well. This gun shoots beautifully and has a very low round count. I like this gun a lot, has box and everything that came with it new, I just want to get a 9mm to be more cost effective as I would like to shoot 3 gun. Thanks. 450 or trade for full size 9mm.

Sure as autumn arrives, the Model 870™ Wingmaster® rises to meet another day in the upland fields and woods of America. The Model 870 is so smooth and reliable that today – nearly 60 years after its introduction – it’s still the standard by which all pump shotguns are measured. With a receiver machined from a solid billet of steel, it is the model of enduring strength. True to its original design, the pump glides with silky surety on two twin action bars for the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. These characteristics, along with its flawless balance and natural pointing qualities have made the Model 870 the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – of any action type, from any manufacturer. As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon.

 It has a custom-quality finish and handsome American walnut woodwork. The receiver and barrel are richly blued and highly polished for classic appeal.

Comes with hard case, grip panes, manual and two 15rd Mags.  We can ship this pistol to any FFL in the US for $25!

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.
Key Features:

Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

What I have for sale is a very rare piece of history, a Winchester model 1911 SL 12 gauge semi auto shotgun. It was manufactured in 1913 and all serial nubers match. It was winchester's first attempt at a semi auto shotgun and trying to work around John M. Browning's patents of the time!!! It cocks from the barrel instead of a charging handle. It was dubbed ""the widdow maker"" due to a series of accidents caused by poor gun handling techniques.

This firearm has a 5 round capacity and features a 26"" full choke barrel. All original blueing(very worn) and all original parts. This gun was used a lot by my great grandfather and shows the wear. It still functions properly.

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for 
people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™,
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter
exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs."

The Finnish did cut the stock in half and resplice it's front end with a Finnish type of wood, giving it a neat finger jointed look to the bottom of the stock.  They then refinished it which gives it a nice dark color. 

It came from the factory with a blued bolt, some people suspect the Finnish did it during re arsenal.  It's possible, I have seen only one other 1938 with a blued bolt on a popular forum that was not a Finnish capture.  Maybe they did it for a small run of rifles?  There was probably a few more of them but they were lost to WW2 or had the blued bolts replaced with freshly sanitized and restamped bolts.

The original bluing on this rifle is pretty nice.  I suppose it was only dropped once then picked up.  Lots of Finnish capture 91/30's ended up in Finnish artillery units so that could explain it's rather nice condition.  Bore is excellent.  because of that.  Sharp, crisp rifling with no pitting.  Shiny.  The Finns also sighted it in without the huge bayonet on.  If you don't have bad marksmanship you can reach out to some impressive distances, as far as your eyesight allows accuracy.  :)  I can repeatedly hit a man size brightly colored gong at a little over 300m with this no problem!

It is specifically designed to adequately cover a low profile gas block on a carbine or mid-length gas system barrel.  The MFR 12.0 has been engineered to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability.  Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run ""slick"" with an unitterupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don't.  The slim profile of the MFR 12.0 keeps the  shooter's support hand close to the bore which aids in firearm manipulation, and the design and construction allow for the attachment of Picatinny Rail Sections at standard 90 degree or offset angles.
