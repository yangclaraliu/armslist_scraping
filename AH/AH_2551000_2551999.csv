See other post or the title of this one says it all. Brand new, never fired, all papers etc.
Will send pictures on request. Feel free to ask any questions.
Might consider trades if it is the right trade. Send me what you have. Looking for m1, m1a, ak, 9mm pistols, pocket pistols, and I love antique guns. 
Gun is for sale primarily. If you have a trade I like then maybe we can discuss something. 
I was just at Erie Sports Store yesterday. They have the same gun, but the grade below this one for 995. So for $55 more, you get a brand new gun with a better quality stock.... or you could go buy a used one from them for essentially the same price. Sounds like a no brainer to me.
Thanks for looking."

The military arsenals mitigate this by using different techniques and components to include different primer sensitivity specifications from their commercial counterparts.

Matching numbers with original chrome-lined military barrel, Nodak Spud receiver, and excellent wood furniture. Beautifully finished in METACOL III (see http://www.arizonaresponsesystems.com/finish/pagefinish.shtml for details about this excellent finish). Usual top-notch quality, attention to detail, tuning of trigger, etc. by Mr. Graham.

This is a good-looking, rugged AK74 rifle built by one of the top AK builders in the country. It is unfired except, of course, for the test fire and zero. Perfect for showing off or shooting! Ammo is plentiful and inexpensive (widely available right now at 18-20/rd at the usual places).

Rifle comes with ARS test fire sheet, three (3) total 30rd bakelite magazines, and 90 rounds of steel-cased Russian 7N6 ammo.

Asking $1,350 cash FTF. You can buy a brand new Russian AK-74 at http://www.k-var.com/shop/SGL31-43.html for $1,249 + shipping and you would be getting a terrific rifle. Or you can buy this one, which is comparable in pedigree (both Russian and Bulgarian are top-tier AKs), built by a master gunsmith with factory tooling and gauges, with a much better finish (Arsenal paint is not very durable), better wood furniture, three (3) total hard-to-find bakelite magazines (versus one (1) magazine from K-Var), and some dependable ammo to get you started.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

Sexy little shooter here for the finicky gun guy.
This is a 1976 Date coded beauty I traded for just today from a mature collector.
Fresh from the heated safe of a long time collector and gun aficionado.
These little guns are spectacular shooters, light weight, flawless operating beauties.
This is a gorgeous checkered wood stock, and engraved receiver example.
Nearly flawless, you will be proud to show it off to all your gun buddies or family!
Maybe you will want to tuck it away in your safe for your own private drooling!
It is a nifty takedown model that loads through the stock and ejects out the bottom.
This gun comes with a folding, adjustable rear sight, and is factory tapped for scope mount. This gun appears to never have had a screw turned on it anywhere, beautiful!
These guns are very sought after and rarely will you find one any nicer, much less from this time frame. An original ,never molested with or monkeyed with top shelf example.
These guns are only going up in value and collectability. Nice guns only appreciate.
I will include 100 rounds of CCI ammo with it at the asking price so you can shoot it today if you wish. The owner I got it from said it has been shot less than a full box of ammo in it's lifetime, and I believe it based on it's outstanding condition. No disappointments.
I am a private collector, shooter, hobbyist, so no taxes, fees or permit hassles here.
I am available by cell at REDACTED. Feel free to text, some times I cannot answer the phone, but I will return all calls and answer all texts. Thanks, Joe"

The Mora 2000 is a high-quality knife with a profile-ground, multi-functional stainless steel blade as well as a patterned high-friction grip handle. Mora Stainless steel options are ideally suited for marine, fishing, outdoor and construction applications, where knives see hard use and are commonly exposed to dirt and moisture. The chromium content of stainless steel makes them less susceptible to corrosion and oxidation than carbon steels, giving them a longer life overall. Mora Knives are made from high-quality Sandvik steel. Sandvik knife steels are characterized by ultra-fine carbides that result in superb forging and hardening properties. The absence of large carbide deposits promotes excellent edge sharpness for optimum cutting performance. Morakniv has been manufacturing the highest-quality knives in Mora, Sweden since 1891. Professionals worldwide trust the quality materials and fine craftsmanship of Mora Knives. Mora knives feature ergonomically-designed handles and employ premium-quality knife steel that is optimally adapted to the task for which the knife is intended.

All items are new and unused. The blade still has it's factory edge, which is VERY sharp!"

It is estimated that Around 85% of these were purchased as private sidearm use by mainly Union Civil War officers and Soldiers and a few to Confederate Soldiers there is also several sets known to have been presented to Confederate Officers in recognition ceremonies. Only made between Early 1860 & Mid 1863. serial 50XX.
There were only approximately 8 thousand of these belt revolvers made by D. Moore before Smith and Wesson started a lawsuit in 1862 and won it in 1863. At that point all of the revolvers were marked Manufactured by D. Moore for Smith and Wesson and the serial numbers were restarted under the revised new patents.

I am selling my Core 15 CXV along with all the accessories and ammo I have for it as a package deal. I purchased this gun in October and since then it has probably had about 200 rounds through it. I recently lost one of my jobs and am needing the extra money. If I wasn't in this position I wouldn't consider selling it, but my loss could very well be your gain! I have found that while Core is not a wildly known brand, their appreciation for quality definitely shows in their guns. Not only has it functioned flawlessly since the first shot but it also comes with a lifetime guarantee regardless number of owners or rounds through it. I bought and installed accessories that I felt were tailored made for a personal defense rifle as well as a sporting rifle. Between the upgraded grip/stock/fore grip this rifle is very comfortable to shoot and has plenty of places for even more attachments. Here is a list of the things I have for it.

Core 15 CXV Rifle (Lifetime Warranty) - $750
Nikon P-223 3x Scope (Lifetime Warranty) with NcStar quick detatch mount - $175
Magpul STR Stock with cheek rest and battery storage (Forest Green) - $85
Magpul Foregrip (Forest Green) - $40
Hogue Grip - $25
Hard Case - $30
Total of 3 Pmags and one traditional metal Mag (2 Pmags I bought extra) - $40
Ammo - 234 Rounds in 5.56
            131 Rounds in .223 = about $150

This rifle has been cleaned each time it was fired and is in practically new condition.

383,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2551383,For Sale:  Custom Foam Cutting for Pelican Hard Gun Cases - Hot Wire,"Madison West/Verona, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, March 14, 2014",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello,
Do you have a pelican case but are too lazy or don't have the tools to make the custom interior?  I can help you out.  I do custom foam cutting on Pelican cases and am located in Madison, WI.  I'm a full time shop teacher in the area and do this on the side.  I'm also an hunter and will treat your firearms like my own.  I do not sell the foam inserts, I just custom cut the foam to fit the firearms or accessories.  My process starts by tracing your guns/accessories onto cardboard, then cutting them out with an exacto/utility knife, and finally using a custom made foam cutter to complete the pattern.  Foam cutters leave much nicer cuts than doing this with a knife. This is all done by hand, and is not as precise as a laser cutter.  It is also a fraction of the cost and looks almost as good.  To be clear, I cut through the entire middle layer of foam on a 3 piece foam system.  I've had people ask me to do 2 piece foam cases, and I don't do those, because I can't cut to a specific depth - only all the way through.  You'll know what I mean if you have a pelican.  I recently finished a case for a buddy of mine and will attach some picts.  He had a Colt M4 6940 and Springfield XDM45 with some accessories.  I charge $50 to do a case and can make house calls for an extra fee.  Takes about 2 to 3 hours to do a case from start to finish.  We can discuss details, so if your interested, shoot me an e-mail and I will get in contact with you."

I had one before which was an excellent little carry gun, and I missed it, but I miss my Shield more. It is in excellent condition. Previous owner was the original owner and stated he fired 100-200 rounds through it and that appears to be the case. I put a couple of magazines through it for function and it ran flawlessly. It will come with the box and 2 magazines, along with a Don Hume IWB holster. I can email pics on request. It is in great shape, just there are a few scuffs on the slide.

As far as trades, S&W Shield goes to the top of the list. Other trades I may be interested in are a Sig 938, XDS in 9mm, or other small single-stack 9mm. I would be interested in a Glock 30S as well, and I have plenty of 9mm I can throw on top for trade fodder as the Taurus is the only 9mm I own. I have other things I can throw on top as well such as an unused BHK Bushcrafter in a Scandi grind, along with other things. Obviously I can add cash on top at fair trade value. If you value your Shield at $550, I am not interested as I can pick them up new for $400. 

As far as sale, it will be $300 for the pistol and holster and I will need a BOS. Sale is around the Ashburn/Herndon area. I'd be willing to do a little more travelling for trade. Any questions, let me know."

From the Manufacturer's Website:

The 7.62x51 NATO (.308 Winchester) PMAG 20 LR/SR GEN M3 is a lightweight, cost effective, high reliability magazine for SR25/M110 pattern rifles featuring true 20-round capacity, constant-curve body, anti-tilt follower, and snap on Impact/Dust Cover. Designed specifically for military-issue MK11/M110 rifles and mil-spec ammunition (including M118LR), the PMAG 20LR/SR is less than half the weight of standard issue steel magazines and maintains a service life round count approximately equal to the rifle barrel itself.

US 869 is a true spherical rifle powder that works great with heavy projectiles in big, overbore rifle cartridges.  US869 is a dense propellant that allows the shooter to use enough powder to create maximum velocities in cartridges such as the 7MM Remington Ultra Magnum, .300 Remington Ultra Magnum, .30-378 Weatherby Magnum and others.  US869 is superior in the .50 Caliber BMG where it yields high velocity and great accuracy with 750 to 800 grain projectiles.  This is a great 1,000-yard match propellant!  Lastly, US869 is minimally affected by varying temperatures.

I paid over 400 before tax. I'm by no means an SKS expert, but I can tell you the thing is pretty clean, I've gone through it, and it appears to have been cleaned regularly, including the gas tube and piston. Pretty darn clean... Function checks just fine, and firing pin floats freely, no binding or issues. I will say that the coating on the top of the Bolt group has lost the silver look? doesn't look corroded but the finish is back to a blued type look. Maybe this is common after a lot of rounds? The general impression I have is someone probably used this around a farm or what not. (pretty much why I bought it, just to take with me as a hog gun essentially, and plinking.) However, it seems to have been taken care of, and the bore is SPOTLESS! It looks better than my Mosin-sadly... :(  I haven't fired it, mostly because I just don't have a place or time to get to one, but if you provide the place to shoot it... I have 60 rounds of Tulamo that will sell with it, or... can be used to test fire it? The original steel removable mag has a bent feed lip. Was sold to me that way. Might be fixable? I bought a 20rd Tapco at Bass Pro along with the ammo. (have a receipt. $40)  Although, I don't think the tapco will feed well, just my impression pushing rounds into it, again, I don't know SKSs that well. Make an offer, let me know what you have to trade. Things I'm interested in.... 
Bows (recurve or compound) Car audio, instruments/audio equipment (particularly, currently, basses, if you have a nice peavey T40/60 I'll trade you staright across) Nexus Tablets, newer Verizon smartphones, Android with minimum dual core, or a Nice Lumia. Or.... windows tablets, need one for school.
Guns- pretty much anything... Huge fan of KelTecs, glocks, glock parts, anything really. I just like guns. Also willing to offer a better deal if you trade with precious metals. (No, I'm not joking... Silver in particular is of interest to me.)
Oh, and good 17"" tires, or tires and wheels with a 5x100 bolt pattern.

US 869 is a true spherical rifle powder that works great with heavy projectiles in big, overbore rifle cartridges.  US869 is a dense propellant that allows the shooter to use enough powder to create maximum velocities in cartridges such as the 7MM Remington Ultra Magnum, .300 Remington Ultra Magnum, .30-378 Weatherby Magnum and others.  US869 is superior in the .50 Caliber BMG where it yields high velocity and great accuracy with 750 to 800 grain projectiles.  This is a great 1,000-yard match propellant!  Lastly, US869 is minimally affected by varying temperatures.

Basically this is an upgraded version of Ruger's own 10/22 Target model.  Very nice gun but I'm just cleaning up and assembling some projects form the various parts I've bought and never used.  Wish I could tell you how it shoots, but then it wouldn't be new, so I have not had the pleasure of trying it out.  I have used this same model barrel in other builds and they shoot very nice - 16mm 5 shot group at 50 yards.
