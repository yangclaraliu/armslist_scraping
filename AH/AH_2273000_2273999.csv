It now wears the M14 Big Red Birch (last photo) with all the metal from Fred’s. Condition category as stated by Fred “excellent-plus with excellent or better buttplate”; thats the best condition out of the issued stocks. I havnt weighed it but its certainly heavier than the synthetic/fiberglass, makes a great bench rifle. And it fits the receiver nice and tight much better than the fiberglass. Comes with issued/used extra upper handguard(I was going to have it dipped to match the camo or in woodgrain but never did).

The black fiberglass stock had a hairline crack when I bought it which is why I purchased the other stocks. Ive been told one can fix it easily enough and that the fiberglass GI stock is preferred to the commercial Mossy Oak, I dunno-you decide, I like the birch.

It has a Sadlak Tactical magazine latch and has Tubb’s Chrome Silicon springs(hammer spring isn’t installed yet but included). Original spring is included as is the original mag release.

Comes with 10rd and 20rd SA mags and two 20rd kits by Checkmate Ind.
Has a 'Harris Bipod' adapter stud made for M14 stocks and a Caldwell 6”-9” bipod.

I never intended to sell this rifle but due to unfortunate circumstances Ive decided to sell it. Get it before I change my mind. Meet in Sac.
No trades - cash only. Thanks."

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame."

Questions: Message me on here or txt @ REDACTED

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assemblies. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door."

Picture 1-3 Rifle, Razor Mark (common for the Kimbers compliments of ""Sgt Slasher"" during inventory 1990) , Bolt, Frt and Rear sights, Manual with Inspection certificate, Trigger Adj Instructions and CMP Certificate of Authenticity

(This is not a Star Grade rifle)
Rifle as it came from CMP with new Truglo 36X44mm scope (No Rings included as rifle is new unfired other than factory test)

Rifle includes everything that came with it from CMP (Rifle, Front and Rear sights, autheniication letter, inspection certificate and supplied trigger lock, packing box and shipping box)

On inspection, this rifle has all it's parts and the rifle itself. On careful inspection (I had to look over couple times) to find a very light razor mark 3-3.5” long on the left forearm. There is a couple bumps on the right side of the forearm, but they must be felt with fingers as not visible to the naked eye. Not to say that under a magnifying light, they could not be distinguished as blemishes to the wood. Considering the way these were handled in the 90’s under inventory control. This one is very nice. Bolt and Rifle serial numbers match and this one is GM001xxx.

I hand picked and purchased several of these rifles in August and the first one I used was a good shooter, so I am going to sell a couple of them. 

I will transfer the rifle at this point, one of three ways. I will ship to your FFL dealer if they will receive from an individual. If not then I will have the rifle shipped through my local FFL dealer. The fee depends on how much he charges me. Or I will do a FTF transfer in Sebastian, Florida. I can legally ship person to person using USPS within the state of Florida ONLY.  Buyer is responsible for all shipping cost. Cost within the state is $30 insured and priority 2nd Day.

Some information in regards to the Kimber Model 82 Government Rifle:
http://www.odcmp.com/Sales/kimber82desc.htm

**************Added note: The factory trigger with no modifications can be adjusted to as low as 13oz. If you have a gunsmith disassemble, add the available replacement trigger spring (which goes with the rifle), and hone and polish both the trigger foot and sear. The trigger can go down as far as 5oz I believe. The one I shoot is 10oz with replacement trigger spring. The receiver is dovetailed to accept a scope*****************

All I wanted to buy was about 100 rounds of each 22 mag and 22 Long rifle to take my son shooting.  Haven't done that because I work so much and finally have a chance this mid week.  Is there anyone with some 22 Long Rifle and 22 Magnum that they are overstocked on or have sold their gun?  I'm off Tuesday and would gladly come and get it, and even pay just a bit over retail.

First, for those that don't know, these are far more desirable than current production rifles because they are all three built from USGI M14 select-fire rifles from government arsenals. They are predominantly GI parts of a superior grade to the commercial parts used in the modern M1a. They include parts from the original Springfield armory (not the Inc.), TRW and H&R. Two are in GI fiberglass stocks that are much stiffer than the polymer used today. One is in a GI type walnut stock that is a civilian replacement. It is very nice. All are suitable for shooting, collecting or custom builds. There is no better hog gun!

All three are caliber 7.62mm x 51mm (.308 Win), headspaced by SAI to shoot both. It is impossible to convert these back to select-fire, though dummy selector kits allow you to make it appear that way. The first two are pre-ban rifles that still have the bayonet lugs. All three have chrome lined barrels. Each will include a modern GI magazine, and I have a few extras that we might work into the deal.
I am only selling two. The last of the three will be saved for a custom build.

#1- Serial number 073xxx, converted by SAI in 1993 or 1994, G.I. fiberglass stock with trap-door butt plate used in early production (stores cleaning kit and for shouldering with grenade launcher), selector cut-outs have not been filled, TRW bolt, M1 Garand type rear sight with locking bar, this rifle is unfired except for proof firing. That would have been 2 rounds at SAI, and 2 rounds by me. No magazine was loaded and you can see zero wear internally.

#2- Serial number 077xxx, converted by SAI in 1993 or 1994, G.I. fiberglass stock with rubber butt plate used in late production, selector cut-outs HAVE been filled, SA bolt, M14 rear sight, this rifle is unfired except for proof firing. That would have been 2 rounds at SAI, and 2 rounds by me. No magazine was loaded and you can see zero wear internally.

#3- Serial number 086xxx, converted by SAI in late 1994, G.I. type walnut stock with trap-door butt plate used in early production (stores cleaning kit and for shouldering with grenade launcher), selector cut-outs were never cut in this replacement stock, TRW bolt, M14 rear sight , this rifle has a VERY low round count, perhaps 60. It has almost no wear internally. No bayonet lug, as this one was produced immediately after the 1994 AWB went into effect. It includes a GI web sling. This is the gun I selected to customize. It will be the most expensive of the three because it has a high number of TRW parts.

The optics are not for sale, but I can tell you where the best price is. (this means I may sell them, but not at a loss)

I also have an extra TRW barrel with complete GI gas system from my last build. $350 It was grouping 1.5 MOA when I pulled it to install a new barrel. It has had about 300 rounds through it. The bore is chrome lined with no measurable erosion or flaking of the chrome."

The physics changes dramaticaly with most reviewers claiming that the pistol tends to behave in a manner where the force comes almost directly back into the hand rather than exhibiting the usual barrel climb of a standard design.  The fit and finish on this revolver are outstanding.  It also comes with 4 moon clips so it can shoot .380 as well as 9mm and .38 cal.  Talk about a versatile revolver!

The shot gun has had about 5 or 6 boxes of shells run through it.  It will hold from a 2 3/4 up to 3 inch shell. It is a semi Automatic and will cycle a shell just about as fast as you can squeeze your finger. I would say that the most interesting thing about the Vinci is that it is designed to cycle the next shell from the recoil of the last shot. For instance if you held the shot gun at your hip and fired at a clay, it would not cycle another shell into the chamber.  However, up on your shoulder its practically instant. I have it in the original case still along with all manuals and factory warranty. Comes with chokes and soft camo gun case.

Im looking to either sell or trade and split the difference. Im open to all offers but I would really like a Ruger or Smith and Wesson revolver.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality.

Featuring two levels of tactical illumination, ambidextrous switching, a slender ergonomic design, and legendary SureFire reliability and durability, the DSF-870 is the ultimate WeaponLight for Remington 870 combat shotguns.

This compact, lightweight system replaces the weapon’s original factory forend and features a recoil-proof LED that generates 600 lumens of blinding white light at maximum output, or 200 lumens with twice the runtime on its high setting. The LED’s light is focused by a precision reflector to create a smooth, wide beam perfect for closer-range shotgun applications typical in law enforcement and home defense—with enough reach and surround light to properly identify threats and maintain situational awareness.

The DSF-870 features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switches on both sides for precise control by left-and right-handed shooters. Selecting the LED’s output is achieved by activating the light in constant-on mode and then pressing the output-mode selector switch until the desired output level (600 or 200 lumens) is set. The selected output can then be left in constant-on mode or switched to momentary activation, and it stays at that output level until reset. Every DSF-Series WeaponLight also features an integrated system-disable switch to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth operations.

A lightweight but strong aluminum module protects the optics, LED, and sophisticated electronics, minimizing length with side-by-side placement of the two lithium batteries that power the system. The module has a Mil-Spec hard anodized finish to protect against scratches, abrasion, and corrosion, while O-ring and gasket seals keep out moisture, dust, and debris. The slender forend body is made from extremely tough polymer and is textured for a secure hold and features large, tactile momentary and constant-on switching on both sides for precise control by left- and right-handed shooters.

The DSF-870 provides unmatched power, versatility, and control, making it a must-have on Remington 870 shotguns used in combat, law enforcement, or home defense.

Fits: Remington 870 shotgun

Want to sell this, or possibly trade out of it with cash on your end, to take care of some bills we incurred while purchasing 40 acres and a new doublewide three months ago.

This is an EMP 9 I got brand new. Phenomenal carry gun, just trying to take care of some things and possibly trade down to something less expensive. Bright Trijicon night sigts. No more than 700 rounds through it. Probably less.

There has been some work done to it to increase reliability. These come far too tight from the factory. It couldn't even feed FMJ when I got it. I did some polishing work to get it running for the break-in period while working at SGM Grips. Pedro Ortiz, the 1911 master himself, did the work needed to get this to feed HP ammo reliably. 

Some minor high spots, but nothing has broken through the finish. I did have to use a touch-up pen on two areas, though. The first is the trigger guard. The plastic tie that came on it from the factory had rubbed a small spot off. The second is on the ambi side of the ambidextrous safety where it was rubbing the finish. No other issues to speak of.

Gun comes with a Galco pancake OWB holster in oxblood, box, docs, and everything it came with from the factory. These are going for $1100+ new on Gunbroker. You won't find a better price.

ONLY TRADE INTERESTS would be a stainless XDs 9.  Might do a stainless P290 with NS, a P938, or maybe another pocket 9.

Gonna sell a few things to pay off some bills we accumulated buying 40 acres and a house a three months ago. Great timing, huh?

This is the ultimate  SA M1 Garand package (gun, gear, and 504 rounds). It shoots great (tears up a 2 liter Coke bottle at 100 yards with Greek surplus). This gun, judging by serial numbers and parts, definitely saw action in World War II and Korea. Gun is in great shape with a conservative 85% finish and no rusting.

Though it's a service gun, it is ALL Springfield Armory from what I can tell. That's hard to find on a service gun since most were rearsenalled with a mismatch of parts after WWII. Stock was refinished or replaced at some point (no cartouches), but appears to have the original wood on top of the barrel. The lack of cartouches is common on replacement stocks sent abroad.

Bullet still sits in the muzzle with the proper 1/16""+ gap between bullet and brass. Again, this is a tack driver for a 67 year old gun with a 59 year old barrel!

I did install a Schuster adjustable gas plug recently to reduce operating pressures. It cycles Greek HXP just fine. Comes with the original gas plug as well.

I work long hours and don't have time to reload the way I used to. I purchased all of these items in July 2012 in an effort to get back into reloading.

Everything you need to get started, except primers and powder.  All in excellent condition, stored indoors in a climate controlled room and not a garage. Includes lots of stuff, too much to mention: Lee Classic turret press kit, Lyman media tumbler and separator, dies and sizing equipment for 308, 223, 9mm, 38, and 7.62.  Miscellaneous equipment like trimmers, scales, digital callipers, funnels, trays, lubricant, case cleaner, etc. Also includes some factory loaded ammunition. There are multiple turrets so you can set your dies and leave them in. I have tried to list everything below. Some items like the tumbler and separator are not pictured. The  brass and bullets are stuffed in a drawer, so it's hard to judge how much is there based on the photos, but they have been weighed and counted. New brass is still in the package I purchased it in. 

Any questions or clarifications please ask. Local only, no trades. No phone calls or texts, email only for initial contact please. All of this priced at 75% of what I paid for it 18 months ago with a Midway and Grafs dealer (C&R) discount. $1200+ worth of equipment and brass for 900. I can separate out some of the brass and bullets, and some of the matching dies, but I'm trying to keep this simple so I can focus on work. I will update this listing as individual items are sold if needed and update the price as well.
