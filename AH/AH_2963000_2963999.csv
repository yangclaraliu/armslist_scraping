It has a vented rib with a mid bead and a red fiber optic front sight.  Great sight picture- you pull it up and it is there!  It comes with the original owners manual, stock shims to adjust the gun to fit you, 4  interchangeable screw-in chokes, choke wrench, and a hard case.

this is basically sigs version of the glock. the recoil , spring  and barrel lay right into the slide like a glock , its breaks down as simple as a glock and in my opinion its got a better feeling double action trigger too .the p250 also feels great in your hands , comfortable to shoot even though is a compact .45. it also has metal sights . I payed 501 for the gun new at my local gun shop.
comes with box , tags , that sig armband that's wrapped around there guns , one mag and manual.

In 1873, Colt’s single-action Army (SAA) revolver became the Army’s standard sidearm. Cavalry troopers were armed with the new revolvers. Lawmen and outlaws alike were quick to adopt the handy new 6-shooter which earned the nickname “Peacemaker.”

The single-action Army was most widely produced with a color case-hardened frame and blued barrel. Meanwhile, a nickel-plated version was issued to Indian scouts. And a bright charcoal blue finish was available from the factory. But with years of use, the old 6-guns took on a well-handled soft gray patina. All of these classic finishes are available in the 1873 Cattleman.

Designed by Major General George Schofield, the Smith and Wesson Model 1870 ""Schofield"" was a revolutionary design that broke open, ejecting all six spent cartridge cases automatically while providing easy access for re-loading. Fast re-loading being a distinct advantage in his line of work, Jessie James bought a pair as did John Wessley Hardin and Wild Bill Hickok.

Although the U.S. Army purchased 3,000 S&W Schofields with an improved top latch for cavalry troops, it was the Russian government that really embraced the new sidearm. With a slightly modified grip, lanyard ring and distinctive trigger-guard spur, the Czar ordered over 41,000 of the new S&W revolvers.

A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel. Barrel is finished off with a PSA 15"" SQR Free float rail, low profile gas block, and A2 flash hider.

Barrel is made for PSA by FN right here in South Carolina.

If you read reviews, you will find that this is an EXTREMELY reliable .22lr that will shoot any ammo you give it. Unlike most ""tactical"" .22's, the upper is all metal (except for the handguard), the lower is a nice, thick polymer. The Sig 522 is also a great choice for a tactical .22 because it doesn't use expensive proprietary magazines. It uses AR15-22 conversion magazines such as the ones from Black Dog Machine (BDM). It comes with two 25-round and one 10-round BDM magazines. Well cleaned and oiled. Excellent cosmetically AND mechanically. The only issue 522's have ever had was a problem with the recoil rod using an e-clip where it attaches to the bolt. Sig offered a free upgrade that replaces the e-clip with a new drilled rod with a roll-pin tapped into it. This rifle HAS the new recoil assembly (even though I never had problems with the old one). $475 for just the rifle, $565 with the 1400 rounds of ammo"

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

46 Senators vote to disobey, ignore, or over turn the constitution. 


The U.N. Resolution 2117 lists 21 points dealing with firearms control, but perhaps of most interest is point number 11: “CALLS FOR MEMBER STATES TO SUPPORT WEAPONS COLLECTION, DISARMAMENT ---”
HOORAY - 53-46 vote - The U.S. Senate voted against the U.N. resolution.


This is that brief, glorious moment in history
when everyone stands around...reloading. 


Now, Which 46 Senators Voted to Destroy Us? Well, let their names become known !! See below. If you vote in one of the states listed with these 46 “legis..traitors”… vote against them. 


In a 53-46 vote, the Senate narrowly passed a measure that will stop the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.  The Statement of Purpose from the Bill reads:  ""To uphold Second Amendment rights and prevent the United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.""  The U.N. Small Arms Treaty, which has been championed by the Obama Administration, would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms.  The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this,on all private guns and ammo. 


Astonishingly, 46 out of our 100 United States Senators were willing to give away our Constitutional rights to a foreign power.

I have been looking for a solid carry for awhile and keeping an eye on this board, after sending some emails I wound up corresponding with George (I believe) from 802 firearms. I knew nothing about them and seemed pretty set in what I wanted. I met him however at his shop and he had all of the pieces layed out that fit my criteria and budget. 

He was polite and professional and knew a lot about guns, and his prices were unmatched. He didn't pressure me to buy and was happy to just talk about guns. What made the experience great was his inventory. He has some obscure guns for VERY affordable prices. I had never seen the EAA distributed ""witness"", and in this pictures it looked okay, but in person it's another story. I decided I needed one eventually and added that and a ride he has stocked to ""to buy"" list. 

I seriously recommend anyone to give this place a shot, if there's something you need he will make it happen and for a price you can feel good about. If you have a large or small budget, from hi point to a kimber 1911 he's got you, and he is right in downtown Burlington (However just a heads up that it's by appointment only!!). I was hesitant to check it out as well, but if you're shopping for a new firearm, do yourself a favor and go there first, even if you don't get something you'll discover there's something you didn't know before that you ""needed"". 

I have no affiliation, I just appreciate hard work and good customer service. We need more shops like this."

I operate NOCO Hydrographics here in Fort Collins. If you're looking to get a firearm hydrodipped, I offer both the best prices as well as the best quality materials. I know how important quality is when it comes to any firearm work, and that's why I strive to be the best in the business. When you bring me one of your firearms, you can rest assured that the job will be done right, and come out looking great. After the pattern is applied, the part is coated with a high-strength clear coat with an internal flex agent. This means that the clear will flex without cracking when the gun is fired, and will last through many years of use.

I have over 700 patterns available in categories such as:
Camouflage
Carbon Fiber
Wood Grain
Stone
Metal
and Designer

This is the exact same as the Beretta Cougar. When Beretta started making the polymer PX4, they moved their tooling to their Stoeger factory so they could keep producing the Cougar. Beretta, Stoeger, Benelli, Franchi, & Uberti are all the same company.

Now that that's out of the way...this is basically brand new. It's been to the range one time. I'm only selling it to fund other stuff.

This is bar-none...the softest shooting 40 S&W I've ever shot. The mechanics behind the Cougar design make it absorb the recoil quite well. The barrel rotates 30 degrees when the slide cycles, then rotates back and locks in place with locking lugs. (just like a M14 / Mini14) This is exceptionally nice for the 40 S&W because of the high pressure round's inherent muzzle-flip. With less recoil and less muzzle flip, your follow-up shots are much quicker than a standard blow-back design.

The single action / double action trigger is so much better than today's striker-fired pistols. It has the De-cocker / safety and even a half-cocked feature if you want to carry it with the safety off, but not go through the entire DA travel. (genius) The safety can easily be converted to a decocker only via some quick video online.

I was skeptical at first, but recoil is noticeably less...and more accurate than other 40 S&W's I've shot.

I just noticed that the slide has a spot that the finish is thin. (If that bugs you)

I'm not in a hurry to see this one go, but if you can meet my price, then I'll get moving on my other project, I guess.

I just never shoot it anymore.  Was used only for range practice and never carried.

I have replaced a few items on the pistol, but anyone familiar with 1911's can easily switch them back to the OEM parts.

1)  The Taurus hammer was replaced with a Nighthawk skeletonized hammer.  The OEM hammer has the keyed safety built into the hammer and I found that it occassionally wanted to rotate to the lock position while shooting which would disable the firearm.  The OEM hammer and Taurus keys are both included.

2)  The OEM straight-eight sights were replaced with a Novak rear adjustable to make this a 3-dot sight.  I tried the straight-eight setup, but it just was NOT for me and my groups were not tight.  The replacement Novak sight is cut to Taurus's proprietory slide cute and are a direct replacement.  Meaning, the OEM sights will slide right back in if you desire the straight-eight setup.

3)  A Smith-and-Alexander flared mag well was added.  This pistol just seemed to need one so I added it.  It swaps easily with a single pin removal and the OEM mainspring housing is included if you want it removed.

4)  I added a pair of G10 grips that are black/grey in color along with new black allen head screws.  The OEM grips are included.  Grips are just a personal preference and the allen head screws just dress it up.

5) A paddle holster designed specifically for the railed Taurus 1911 is included.  Mint condition as I never wore it except for while at the range.

Besides the not trusting the OEM hammer on this pistol and replacing, the only thing that I had a problem with was the ambidextrous thumb safety.  A common problem with ambi safeties is that the right side can become loose.  I believe that the OEM Taurus ambi safety is a metal injected part and simply not as strong as a milled part.  Because the OEM safety became loose, I attempted to tighted the ears with a little pressure and it broke.  A phone call to Taurus indicated that they would NOT sell directly me anything related to the safety system on the firearm and would only replace if I shipped them the pistol.  Therefore I searched for a replacement ambi safety that is shaped the same as OEM.  The model used is a Cylinder-and-Slide ambi safety which is a milled part instead of metal-injected.  I was mainly selected because it matched the OEM safety in regards to shape and design.

Both OEM magazines come with the pistol.  Included is the OEM carry case with an un-used cleaning rode.  Both security keys for the Taurus OEM hammer are included.  I have the original warrenty card as well as the instruction manual.

I would rate this pistol in excellent condition (ie. that's one step down from mint in my opinion) simply because I have shot this pistol.  Normal wear points on the slide and barrel are all that is different from this pistol being brand new.  There are no signs of abuse or damage, nor any scratches due to disassembly.  I would estimate this firearm to be a low-round-count with less than 500 rounds.

Overall, it's a great gun but I just don't believe that I'm a 1911 person.  The price is FIRM.

All laws will be followed for this sale.  I will need to see a CWP or a pistol permit with matching identification from North Carolina.  A receipt will be written and provided to both parties.  A location will be agreed to meet that is near Concord.  Cash only will be accepted."

It's a 1939 Ishvehk with a round receiver. Fires well, bolt sticks a little after a few rounds. Cosmo has been mostly cleaned off. Mostly matching numbers; the bolt and receiver both match which is the important thing anyway. 

Comes with bayonet and ~110 rounds of new manufactured non-corrosive ammunition. 

Sure you can get one off of Buds for $140 right now, but after FFL and taxes it'll still be $200 and won't come with any ammo and you'll have to clean off the cosmoline.

It now comes with a second set of grip, they are black SIG grips.

Information from Sig: 
The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. 

The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail.

Email, call, or text me at 615-4five;six- 458five.

A variation of the the P38, the P1 was one of the world's first true double-action pistol and proved to be an exceptional military pistol. The weapon is robust, accurate and well balanced and field stripping and maintenance are simple and rapid. The P1 uses a double-action trigger design similar to that of the earlier Walther PPKs, and a loaded chamber indicator is also incorporated. The fixed-barrel design mechanism operates by use of a wedge-shaped locking block underneath the breech. The standard safety also acts as a decocker, and is located at the left side of the slide. When German manufacturer Walther was no longer able to produce firearms after World War II thanks to Allied sanctions, they passed the design and materials for the P38 and P1 over to French firearms company Manurhin. This pistol is import-marked and features synthetic grips, fixed open sights, and an 8-round magazine. Its grips, metal, and bore are all in very good condition.
