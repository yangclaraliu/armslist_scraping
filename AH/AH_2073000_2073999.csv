A fine piece of american history and outstanding  milestone of engineering. I got a bryco/jennings .380 dumped on me in an ar15 ammo deal. Pistol was rusted brick like in functioning as in totally frozen. After much tender care polishing refitting the slide replacing firing pin spring with one from a glock and machining new exteactors with a dremmel and inserting a forged steel plate crossways through the slide and polishing reworking the inside of the mag and magwell i believe ive gotten this one 100% reliable to cycle every rnd in the 7 shot mag. Wich was my modest goal here instead of chucking off a cliff... If i were to guess id say i put 72 straight hours of failure retry gunsmithing into this sad excuse for a firearm however after i do the extractor itll be a smooth functioning soft shooting 2 or three pound pistol. It seems to be turning out ok finally. I basically reworked every godamn part of this thing, trigger, firing pin, drilled small holes in blank sights filled with neon hilighter then clear epoxy filled in for 'hi vis' sights. My neighbor is offering me 150 for it. Unfortunatly hes a d bag and wakes me up after ive had to work three days with 2 hours sleep. Dont let me sell this unique little ugly duckling that could to the dbag neighbor. Someone offer me 175 obo for this thing. It might be ugly and a bryco but with the effort and key parts replacement i think itll run for many many rnds. To be fair it has a crisper trigger than a baretta 9mm or especially my glock. Trigger is not bad actually. Accuracy is ok for sd distances. Fuctions smooth yet i did melt the safety with b12 chemtool as it was inferior plastic.  Just have the extractor left to polish let me know if mildly interested. I have no doubt it'll do what its made to do. With some decent hollowpoints itll fit someones punk ass pretty quick. After the polishing i did it will feed an EMPTY SHELL CASING. No dangerous case bulge etc tho it does pop a primer occasionally, causing smoke to rise from inside. Ive shot it about 30 times and not something thats dangerous just a bit annoying. Ive seen ppl sell these with slam fire issues. It does not have any dangerous issues.  Listed as hi point because no bryco on list and its of that 'class'. Paint or looks may change as its my fun gun and i work on it everyday.thks for lookin ^.^ REDACTED"

It is an all original, complete, numbers matching real sword. Not a replica. I've been collecting over 10 years and letting go of some things. 

This type 95 was made between late 1938 up to mid 1941. Late 1938 they changed the tsuba or guard to the 9mm thick brass from the 11mm thick brass of the first issue. And then in mid 1941 they changed the guard to the black iron style. 

Has the aluminium tsuka or handle. These are machine made blades, not handmade and signed on tang. Has matching serial number on blade and scabbard throat. 

The Blade was made by the Nagoya arsenal. Two arsenals made the blades, a third kokura did not make any but was a supervising arsenal of the type 95 project and their mark will be found at times along with the nagoya or tokyo first arsenal. This blade and sword were made by nagoya and you can tell on them by when you read the serial number. when you read the number the cutting edge of blade is facing up and it faces down as you read number on the tokyo first blades. 

The Fuchi Stampings, the piece right under the guard is stamped with three symbols, Gifu, Nagoya and Kokura. Gifu is the corporate logo of the group within the arsenal, there were six of these altogether. This one is Gifu, Second is the Nagoya Arsenal stamping and third the Kokura arsenal stamping which sometimes accompanies. 

The blood fuller is full length and the tip is correct, scabbard is correct and the blade is in good shape. few small dark spots but overall nice shape. 

I know what they sell for, if you can get them for 200 at your local gun show then I would advise you to just go buy it there or buy it for 200 and sell it to me for 400. Double your money. I will not ship either. Face to face. I will meet in wisconsin rapids or mauston.

Would also sell the kart out right feel free to offer me either way. Low balls will not be replied to and that is anything less than $650. I have a second brand new engine that has not been ran, still sitting in its box that I will include. Also three spare rims. & many other unlisted installed upgrades on the kart that have to do with tune-ability.
 This kart features a Buller frame that was over $1200 alone, has a disc brake in the rear that gives plenty of stopping power, the go kart idles well and starts easily. The engine is a 7hp harbor freight predator engine, one is mounted and running great, and like I said I have a second in the box with a two year warranty ready to go. This frame is made for left hand oval which is what is raced around here anyway, but I have adjusted the tie rods to have great turn in both directions, this kart is easily tunable, and with such a low center of gravity safe and fun for all ages. Reliable, fun, and fast are the primary traits of this kart. 
 I just picked up the hand gun itch after selling my SKS and buying a CZ52, and still I cant seem to get rid of it, I can answer any other questions you may have, feel free to send me pictures of what you've got to offer, as long as it is a handgun in 9mm, .40, or .45, of equal value or with cash added. Really looking for a glock though.

This shotgun comes in camo finish and also includes an extended magazine tube and a modified choke tube. The magazine tube only adds a few ounces of weight so you can leave it on all the time, but pull the plug, load it up, and get ready for some snow goose action! Great all around gun since it is light and easy to handle and will reliably shoot 2 3/4"" through 3 1/2"" ammo. Being a used gun, it shows normal signs of wear, but no signs of rough wear or abuse. A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments.The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system, reducing recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less. On average, that’s more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest shooting and most reliable shotgun ever. Bid NOW and own the most reliable shotgun possibly ever built, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II 12 Gauge!!!

From Uberti’s site: “The Uberti Top Break is true to the original, designed by Major George Schofield at the Smith & Wesson factory in 1869. The Schofield revolver was created as a cavalry pistol. Its efficient, break-open design could be operated one-handed. That made it easy to eject all six spent cartridges and reload the single action revolver while on horseback. The U.S. Cavalry was slow to see the merits of the top break, but Jessie James, John Wesley Hardin, and Wild Bill Hickok saw the fast reloading capability as a distinct advantage in their line of work. After numerous trials, the U.S. Army finally purchased three thousand top breaks with an improved top latch design.”"

Basically, this rifle was made by Remington Arms in 1942. Only God knows where this rifle served.
A gunsmith once told me that none of the Remington's had the problem with the badly tempered steel that Springfield Armory and Rock Island did. You should check this on your own though.

Only a slight bit of damage as some damn fool cut a notch in the stock for the bolt and put a Lyman sight on here (which has been removed).

Rifle belonged to my Dad. He never fired it and neither have I. But the effects of military use are easily seen upon closer inspection.

Hard Cast Wadcutter @ 1050 fps - 20 Round Box,"azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 3, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=269

This load is designed to cause disabling terminal effect, combined with the penetration required to cause fast incapacitation on human sized targets from any angle. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue as it passes through, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living material. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and thus deep. The hard cast construction will not deform on flesh and bone at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant along with bullet path and terminal damage. Full wad cutter profiles in large calibers (like .45 and .44) hit like a truck and do massive permanent damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer and gun fighter Jim Cirillo used full wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his targets with certainty. See our Item #20D (38 SPL).

Expect about 24 inches of straight-line penetration in living mammalian material with this load.

We test our ammunition in real world over-the-counter firearms to establish our published velocities so that our customers can know what this ammunition is doing in the real world, not a laboratory where long test barrels are used and give false high velocity readings. See our below velocities fired from my personal firearms.

1057 fps - Ruger Vaquero 2006 large frame 5.5 inch barrel
1062 fps - Freedom Arms mod. 97 5.25 inch barrel
  951 fps - S&W MT. Gun 4 inch barrel
  850 fps - Taurus Titanium 2 inch barrel
This load is “standard pressure” and is therefore safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 Colt and 454 Casull firearms. The bullet construction is hard cast (not lead) and properly lubed and will not substantially lead your barrel, even if you fire hundreds of rounds.

Im not sure when it was made but I would guess its from at least the early 90's.  Cosmetically I would rate it between 85%-90%.  This is due to some dings in the wood.  Mechanically the gun is in perfect working order.  It has reliably fired and cycled every kind of ammo I have put through it.  I know it's set up for chokes but I'm not sure what kind it currently has installed. Nor do I have any other chokes for it. (I'm not much of a shotgun guy).

It's a Colt D.A. 38 revolver. According to Colt, based on the serial number, this gun was made in 1897. It is not in good condition and is priced accordingly. It could use a good cleaning. I'm not sure if the gun was designed this way, but to get the double action to work, you need to pull the hammer back a little. The rod that holds the cylinder in is also difficult to remove and re-insert. The gun potentially has other issues as well, but I'm by no means an expert. To me it's just a cool old gun to look at, not to shoot.

According to Magnum Research, this gun is one of the first 100 Stainless guns ever to be imported into the USA and the frame is stainless and the slide and barrel are nickel plated chromoly steel. This gun is Magnaported and wears Millet adjustable sights. This gun comes with the original box, cleaning tools and paperwork. It also comes with an additional mag (blued), which usually run ~$60 each.The right side of the frame was modified by a previous owner to remove the sharp crest at the trigger pin. The gun is 28 years old; there is some normal finish wear near the muzzle. Overall condition would be VG+

Needless to say, this isn't your run-of-the-mill Desert Eagle. You won't find one like this; I know firsthand because I searched for years before finding this one. Lots of blued ones out there changing hands for $900, but very few ""stainless"" guns and even fewer with factory Magnaport and Millet sights.

Judging from the last time this was posted, I'm not going to bother trying to sell it. Too many low-ballers who think this should be priced as low as the Plain Jane blued model. Equal amount of folks thought I would trade this for a $400 Glock. Let's not waste our time...

Shoot me a text, or give a call. I live in the country, so leave a message if no answer. Service is spotty.
