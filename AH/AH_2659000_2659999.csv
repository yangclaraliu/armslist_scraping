She  has only fired 80 rounds through it.
30 for the class and 50 rounds of practice at the range for the class.
Like I said she shoots my guns at the range.
Its a great little concealed carry firearm.
Its tailored to the ladies that don't shoot regularly.
Put in a loaded clip,cock it and shoot.

I used this as a turkey gun for about 5 years. Got it in a trade and its served me well. Excellent home protection gun, short barell and shoots 3"" loads. This particular rifle has the shortest length at ""22 of these models which makes it great for home defense or a truck gun. But Ive also laid out turkeys with no problems as well. I have a buttstock recoil pad and shell holder as pictured. I will include about 18 rounds of remington 3"" turkey load, 25 rounds of federal premium Prarie Storm ($21 box new) and 25 rounds of target winchester shells. Shows some scratch and use from the field, but overall decent condition. I will follow ALL FIREARMS LAWS and Bill of sale will be signed. 
CASH ONLY PLEASE. The lowest I will take is $135. The ammo and accessories are worth $55 so that puts the rifle at under $100 which for a package like this is a great turnkey deal. gunbroker has the lowest price at $135 for the shotgun not including any fee or shipping costs and has no accessories with it."

The distinctive characteristics of the C96 are the integral box magazine in front of the trigger, the long barrel, the wooden shoulder stock which can double as a holster or carrying case and a grip shaped like the handle of a broom. The grip earned the gun the nickname ""Broomhandle"" in the English-speaking world because of its round wooden handle, and in China the C96 was nicknamed the ""box cannon"" because of its square-shaped internal magazine and the fact it could be holstered in its wooden box-like detachable stock.

The Mauser C96, with its shoulder stock, long barrel, and high-velocity cartridge, had superior range and better penetration than most other pistols; the 7.63×25mm Mauser cartridge was the highest velocity commercially manufactured pistol cartridge until the advent of the .357 Magnum cartridge in 1935.

Mauser manufactured approximately 1 million C96 pistols."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

(1,550 FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX","Azusa, California, United States",$ 35,"Listed On: Thursday, February 6, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=232

Buffalo Bore's Deer Grenade 44 Mag. +P is a 240gr. Massive, Hollow Nosed, 12 BHN cast bullet with a gas check traveling at the below velocities out of stock, real world, over-the-counter firearms:

1. 1935 fps -- Marlin 1894 20 inch

2. 1897 fps -- Marlin 1894 18 inch

3. 1871 fps -- Marlin 1894 16.5 inch

4. 1578 fps -- Ruger Super Blackhawk 5.5 inch

5. 1535 fps -- Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch

6. 1466 fps -- S&W MT Gun 4 inch

This load is designed as the world's premier deer load for 44 mag. The cast bullet is not considered soft, but it is not really a HARD cast bullet either as it only has a BHN (Brinell Hardness Numnber) of 12 so, it could be termed a medium/hard cast bullet. It performs as follows:

At an impact velocity of 1,100 fps it will mushroom to about 75 Cal. and should push right through any deer with a broadside shot.

At an impact velocity of 1,500 fps it will mushroom and some of the mushroom will fragment off and send bullet particles flying through the deer, but much of the mushroom and shank will remain intact and should push through any deer hit broadside.

At an impact velocity of 1,900 fps the entire mushroom will turn into shrapnel and send bullet particles all throughout the deer. The shank will remain intact, but will re-mushroom and do horrific damage inside the deer and will probably push through any deer hit broadside.

Of course all these results will vary depending on how much bone, if any, you hit, etc. This load was designed specifically to do horrific damage to deer sized game and as such does not penetrate like a hard cast flat nosed bullet. This bullet only penetrates about 30% as deep as a typical flat nosed hard cast bullet, which is perfect penetration for shallow game like deer, and medium sized pigs or black bear. This load is your best bet for immediately anchoring any deer with the 44 mag. cartridge that is not CNS (central nervous system) hit.

This bullet is properly alloyed, lubed and is gas checked; it will NOT lead-foul barrels.

This load is designed to be safe in ALL/ANY, all steel firearms that are in normal operating condition. We do not recommend its use in lightweight alloyed revolvers as the bullets may jump the crimp."

I ordered this last year from E.A. Brown and received it today.

I sold my TC Encore last fall, so do not need this.

From E.A. Brown website:
""6mm BR Norma - The 6BR was THE Benchrest favorite until 6mm PPC came along. 
But now, Benchrest competitions are going to longer distances, and there is a resurgence in popularity of the 6mm BR using the heavier 100-105 gr. bullets and renamed to ""6mm BR Norma"".
Our 6mm BR Norma barrels are throated for these long, heavy bullets and done in a 1:8 rifling twist especially to suit 100-105 gr match bullets.

Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action. The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 
) Barrel. Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for accuracy. The Inox  models feature stainless steel barrels.
2) Slide. Machined out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.
3) Sights. Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.
4) Frame-mounted. Manual, conveniently thumb operated.
5) Contoured Tang. Top of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate the shooter’s hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.
6) Frame. Made of a special alloy, noticeably stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than stainless steel. In all other models the frame is made of special aluminum alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.
7) Tip-up Barrel Latch.
8) Trigger Pull. Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action. 
9) Snag Proof Design. Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw.

Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy.

used, good condition, two new screws in the grip, mag extender for bigger hands (only have one mag but 2 extenders), safety spring is new, lubed the other day, fits in a pocket so it is great for concealed carry. cash only."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.
