It comes with a manufacturer warranty that I've left blank so the purchaser may file it with Colt.  Colt also guarantees this rifle to have sub-MOA groupings, and I can attest to this being true.  These rifles sell for anywhere from $1350 to $1500 and they do not have any of the following upgrades.  Included upgrades include rail guards, a trigger upgrade (4.5lb. single stage), and optics (as shown the rifle has an Sightmark 3x magnifier set behind an Sightmark multi-reticle reflex sight).  

I purchased the rifle new and have owned this rifle for nearly 4-months.  I love it and it is very accurate however having added to my collection, I do not get enough use from it and I need some extra cash for upgrades in my other guns.  If the wife hadn't made me agree not to spend any more on this hobby, I'd keep it but as they say ""happy wife, happy life"" and that is very true.  

This rifle has only been  to the range twice and with our weather during the period I've owned it, there haven't been any other places to shoot.  I estimate the total number of rounds fired downrange would be 300 or 10 mags on the high end.  Ideally I'd like to sell the rifle but I may be interested in a trade or partial trade for custom AR builds or high end ARs.  Please email pics of the weapon if you seek to trade.

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions and four rails positions for mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found traditional handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating 16.1” chrome lined barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range shooting.

The price is $1,275 obo.  Please email any offers you would like me to consider.  If you have interest, please email me at REDACTED.  Alternatively, I may be reached at REDACTED.

I am taking a loss for no reason, but I have my mind set on something else right now.

I have a RIA 1911-A1 .45 for sale. It has less than 100 rounds through it. I recently installed Hogue Grips on it, and it is amazing the difference between the standard walnut grips (included). The sights are dead on, and can group less that one inch at 25 yards, and  groups okay at 50 yards with Winchester white box ammo. That certainly isn't high vel ammo, and 50 yards is quite a distance for a .45.  And, if you can't shoot them, you can bash them in the head with this all-steel gun. ;)"

It does have a single 30rd mag, collapsible folding stock, pistol grip and a flash suppressor. It also has a free float style handguard, and Troy Flip Up Sights. The stock comes factory set up to fold left and will fire in the folded position left, or can be reversed to fold right however this will block the ejection port.

Uses standard many standard AR parts including trigger, hammer and springs, rear take down pin, fire control selector and mag release button, catch and spring.

The TROY Pump Action Rifle takes the ergonomics and versatility of the country’s most popular rifle design, the AR-15, and employs them in a new type of manually operated rifle. The TROY PAR allows for great sporting and defense applications in areas where legal ownership of the standard, semi-automatic modern sporting rifles such as AR series have been legislatively limited.

The M1941 Johnson Rifle is an American short-recoil operated semi-automatic 30-06 rifle designed by Melvin Johnson prior to World War II.
The M1941 rifle uses the energy from recoil to operate the rifle. As the bullet and propellant gases move down the barrel, they impart a force on the bolt head that is locked to the barrel. The barrel, together with the bolt, move a short distance rearward (3/8"") until the bullet leaves the barrel and pressure in the bore drops to safe levels. The barrel then stops against a shoulder allowing the bolt carrier to continue rearward under the momentum imparted by the initial recoil stage. The rotating bolt, which has eight locking lugs, unlocks the bolt. The Johnson rifle utilizes a unique 10-round rotary magazine, a two-piece stock, and the same 5 round stripper clips used by the M1903 Rifle. This system has advantages over the M1 Rifle, including less perceived recoil, greater magazine capacity, reloading without taking out of battery, ease of cleaning, no gas operating mechanisms to wear out or foul, etc. The barrel is simply and easily removed for cleaning from the breach end!"

Runs cool and stays on target for double taps, zero muzzle flip.

The 5.56 Carbine Tactical Elite 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.5"" rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block. This one is the 12.5"" rail gives you an additional 2.5"" rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own. Rail covers not included for posted price.

The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$. 

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but not offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade.

This gun was made in very small quantities compared to the other colt snake guns. These guns do NOT come available much these days. The viper and boa are ususally the last guns that people acqurie when trying to complete their snake gun collection. No collections is complete without the COLT VIPER.

This particular gun is in good condition overall. Please understand it is not in mint condition. There are some scratches, handling marks and some rubs. The timing, lock-up and bore all are great. Original viper grips are in very good condition. This makes for a great gun to take out, shoot and enjoy, without being so worried about getting it damaged. Overall, a good example of a very RARE and desirable colt.

2) Colt Diamondback, 4"" barrel, .38spl, no box or papers, made in 1968 per Colt's website. This is also a gun that does not come up for sale or trade very often. It is good condition overall. There is some wear noted in the finish towards the end of the barrel (likely from holster use). Cylinder movement and lock up are very good. These guns are great investments. Track the value of these guns over the last few years and you will be shocked. The Diamondback very much resembles the python in looks.

My friend's grandfather reloaded it and passed away. He had a Garand so I am assuming that is what he loaded it for. There are slips of paper in the boxes he keeps the ammo in that give the date (April 3rd 1979) Primer (CCL) Powder (H335) Weight (49.2) and Bullet (150 grain). About half are round tip and half are spear tip. There are 13 M1 Garand clips holding some of this ammo. There is also 11 (5) round stripper clips holding ammo that is included. This is all on good brass and we shot 20 rounds with no issue to make sure it was good. I have shot this man's reloads all my life and never had a problem. He is asking .80 cents a round which would total $224. All ammo comes in 20 round boxes and is secure less the stuff on clips. Thank you.

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting."

Smaller in length and height than the standard HK45, the HK45 Compact (HK45C) uses a slim-line grip profile, otherwise is nearly identical in features to the full-size HK45.

The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 and HK45C can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45C is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system, providing an enhanced double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45C is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics::
Integral MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
ERGO (HK45 full-size) and slim-line (HK45 Compact) grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
8-round metal magazine is standard for the HK45C, common high-capacity (10 rounds) that fit both the HK45 and HK45C also available
Ambidextrous controls with dual slide releases and enlarged magazine release
Uses the proven modified Browning linkless recoil operating system
O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and better accuracy
Polygonal rifling for longer barrel life and increased accuracy
Improved ergonomic control levers (safety and/or decocking)
Low profile drift adjustable 3-dot sights
Contoured and radiused slide with forward slide (grasping) grooves and anti-glare longitudinal ribs
Black polymer frame

As I said this has been my primary carry weapon, it does show some signs of leather wear and there are a couple of minor scratches on the slide (can't feel them, but they can be seen in the photos), a tiny nick in one of the cocobolo grips, and a minor ""idiot mark"" on the slide (scuff in finish only, cannot be felt).

I have replaced the main spring housing with a flat one , I have put a stainless steel guide rod and spring in the slide, I have 4 magazines and have replaced all 4 with followers that allow for 14 rounds instead of 10. I have put on a Sig 1911 adjustable target sight. All totaled including shipping and tax there is over $650 in this. I know I wont get all of my money out all of the upgrades and extras so I think my asking price is extremely fair. you can buy this one and be done or spend more and buy a new one then do all the upgrades eventually anyway. If you read the reviews, they almost all recommend these upgrades as the factory parts are not the best quality to try to keep the cost down. I have all the factory parts and factory box and book. Sig's 1911-22 is over %80 mil spec so a majority of the parts from any 1911 will fit right in.

500 Rounds for $179!!!

The Bear Ammo brand has its history dating all the way back to 1869 when Russian Emperor Alexander I ordered the opening of the first cartridge plant in St Petersburg. During the Russian Civil War the production facility was moved to the Moscow region from St Petersburg. Finally during WWII, Russia moved the factories to Barnaul in South-Central Russia to avoid the threat of losing the plants if Moscow was to be besieged by the German Forces.

The Zinc plating on this ammunition helps the casing resist corrosion and it helps make sure you get a smooth feed every time a new round chambers. You can't get a better brand-new 45 ACP cartridge at this price!.

This product has a zinc-plated steel casing, utilizes a Berdan primer, and is non-corrosive."
