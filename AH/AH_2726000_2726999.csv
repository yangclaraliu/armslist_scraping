   Other production variations include a '200th Year' USA bicentennial KBP-7 with scroll engraving and carved grip panels, and a change in 1985 from aluminum to steel grip frames on the blued models. Another change introduced to all of Ruger's firearms is the addition of their infamously verbose safety warning stamped on the side of the barrel, a warning which garners such adjectives from gun owners as 'ugly', 'nasty' and 'sissy'. The safety warning was added to Ruger's entire product line over the course of a few months, from late 1977 to early 1978.  manufactured in early 1977. Such pre-warning Rugers command a modest premium over otherwise identical post-warning examples. For more details on earlier Old Army variations, refer to the table below, originally published in The Ruger Collectors' Journal, June 1980.

This lot includes two S&W 14 rd factory mags in very good used condition and five Eagle Alpha brand 16 rd mags.

The S&W factory mags both function perfectly in all aspects of operation.  The Eagle mags function properly when loaded but some will not hold the slide open when empty and some will not allow the slide to close when empty without dropping the mag.  Some will not drop free and must be pulled out by hand.  For the amateur gunsmith, a Dremel tool or file would probably fix these issues.  The Eagles would be good only for target practice and are sold as is.

Selling all as one lot;  will not sell individually.  The two S&W mags alone would cost more than the price of this whole lot.

The gun was just torn down and meticulously cleaned and lubricated with CLP. The gun will come with all of the accessories listed below:

2 finger extension and 2 flat magazine baseplates (finger extension baseplates have been stippled)
13 rounds of Speer Gold Dot hollow point rounds (6 for each magazine plus 1 for the chamber)

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

I have a nice Kimber Classic Custom I would like to trade for a smith 357mag with a shorter barrel. Any 27, most 28's 66's 19's 586's 686's....... Can have the internal lock but prefer the older stuff.
Kimber was built in 1999 and hasn't seen much action. Mostly a safe queen. Still, it shows
it's age and I have taken the time to photo anything that distracts from the finish.
It has (weak) wilson combat nite sites, a wilson combat hammer/sear to give it a 2.5lb trigger pull. 
Comes with original box and wrench, and one magazine. Thank you.
I value the Kimber for the trade at 650.00... I believe this is quite fair.
Just send me your email if you want to see more pics....."

This is the target version with a 26 inch heavy barrel, accutrigger, and solid single shot reciever for rigidity. Incredibly accurate almost boring to shoot. I could consistantly shoot golf balls at 200 yards with it. Cheap tasco 6-24 scope that has held true on this caliber. Will come with reloading dies that have never been used, the once fired brass ive shot and about 40the factory rounds. Only selling because ive had another 20 caliber itch and am having a gun built to scratch it. Would consider trade for xds 45 maybe others but im pretty particular so i may just say no thanks."

706,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2726706,For Sale:  PhaZZer Enforcer (higher quality than TASER,"Minneapolis/St. Paul; USA, Minnesota, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Monday, April 14, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The PhaZZer Enforcer is a new conductive energy weapon (CEW) that is competing aggressively with TASER. To sum up the following information, this device performs at an equal, if not higher, capacity than that of the TASER X26 and for less money and more features.  

NOTE: You are getting a BLACK Enforcer in this listing for $600 (plus MN sales tax), compared to an MSRP of $630. With FREE SHIPPING you are saving an additional $15, effectively bringing the price down to $585! But this is only for ONE WEEK (4/14 - 4/21)! Multiple quantities can be purchased, simply contact for purchase. Available to anyone (besides felons) in the state of Minnesota or other states in the Continental U.S. 

The PhaZZer Enforcer CANNOT be shipped to: MASSACHUSETTS, MICHIGAN (requires CCW permit), NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK, RHODE ISLAND, WISCONSIN (requires CCW permit), ILLINOIS

Here are some of the features and benefits of the Enforcer:

•	Considerably less expensive and has equal if not higher quality to that of the TASER X26 (PhaZZer Enforcer is $630 MSRP VS. TASER X26 at $999.99); there is an approximate savings of 40% when compared to the TASER X26. 
•	It has a comparably brighter light (160 lumen high intensity LED) to that of the TASER X26 (70 lumens)
•	It has a rechargeable battery, unlike the X26, which can save you hundreds over dollars over using digital power magazines (DPMs)
•	Three fingered placement non-slip textured pistol grip, allowing for better handling in extreme weather conditions
•	Has a variety of specially designed cartridges besides normal darts, also compatible with the X26, M26 & M18 TASER models
•	Safety circuit shut down technology after three 5-second cycles to reduce liability and increase safety
•	Ambidextrous sliding trigger for activating the 160 lumen LED light; great for left or right-handed users
•	6 degree angle spread (PhaZZer) vs. 8 degree angle spread (TASER), allowing for greater accuracy in hitting a target compared to the TASER

The PhaZZer Enforcer uses a 7.2V rechargeable lithium ion battery, which is good for 3000 five-second discharges. 

Probably the most innovative aspect of this device is the creation of multiple types of cartridges: Dart Pro (15”, 21” & 25”), Pepper ball, Pepper Powder, Rubber ball and training cartridge. All of these are compatible with the Taser X26, M26 and M18 models. Having access to such a wide variety allows you to deploy different cartridges suitable for your specific situation (e.g. pepper powder for dispersing multiple targets). 

Choice of holsters to fit the Enforcer include a clam-shell comprised of nylon 66 that contains a carbon fiber and fiberglass composite, Grade-A Made in USA leather duty belt holsters, as well as shoulder harness and thigh holsters.

Available in Black, Yellow or Pink.

Complete set includes:
•	Hard shell case
•	The Enforcer
•	3 Cartridges (1 15’ conductive, 1 21-foot non-conductive training, 1 Pepper powder)
•	Nylon Belt Holster
•	A/C Charger
•	Operator Manual & Warranty Card 

Why put down a thousand bucks when you can get a device that does the same job and has more features than the competition? The Enforcer is an excellent choice for self-defense, security, and law enforcement.

This rifle was made when John Noveske was still with us (RIP). It originally came with the SWS Noveske rail which I had switched out and replaced with the Noveske 13.5"" NSR to lighten it up. This gun has gone through a Costa Ludus carbine course at the beginning of 2013, and then through a Vicker's carbine course in November 2013. The gun has performed flawlessly in both courses, and currently has about 5000 rounds through it. I have found it runs well with Gen 3 Pmags and C Products stainless steel magazines. Since it is the original Gen 2 rifle, you need to shave any Gen 3 Pmags to fit in the magwell.

This is an incredibly smooth and flat shooting gun due in part to the midlength gas system and the Spikes Tactical Dynacomp Extreme. During the Vicker's course, some students thought I was running a full-auto gun with how fast I was able to shoot.
This is a really fun gun that I enjoy shooting, but I tend to grab other guns in my safe whenever I go to the range. I am in no rush to sell this excellent firearm. Free shipping out of state included."
