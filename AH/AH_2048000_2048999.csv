48,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2048048,For Sale/Trade:  Federal Auto Match 22LR,"Beloit Township, a few miles south of, Janesville, Wisconsin",$ 30,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 27, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I spent the last 8 months acquiring the AUTO MATCH while shooting my cheaper ammo and was saving it for when the cheaper stuff was all shot. The cheap stuff was recently used up and I just found out that while my Ruger 10/22 semi-auto loves the Auto Match, my Marlin XT-22 bolt actions' don't much care for it.
I would have thought a bolt action .22 would not care what you ran through it, but my Marlins are picky.
If you've got a semi-auto pistol or rifle and want a great cycling and clean burning ammo that does not gum up the action and leave everything covered in a heavy coat of gritty residue, the auto match is great stuff. I'm keeping one case of it for my Ruger.
The other case I would like to trade for 36 grain copper plated Federal Champion. My Marlin bolt action rifles cycle the 36 grain Federal Champion fine and don't care that it's dirtier.
All my Auto Match for trade is new and unopened, and I would like the same of what I trade for. No loose rounds in zip lock bags please. Also, no aguila or Remington Thunderbolts.
As a last resort. I will consider selling the Auto Match outright for $30 per box, then searching for and buying the ammo I want. I would much rather just trade.
So if anyone out there has any of the 36 grain Federal Champion 22LR, and it just doesn't cycle their semi-auto as good as they'd like, make a trade with me.
I'll trade straight up, round for round of Federal Champion. Got something similar? Make me an offer."

Considering I have been using it for hunting for five seasons, it is in great shape.  There is some normal wear on the bolt body, trigger guard, and stock but nothing major.  I've only put 49 rounds through it.  This would be a good first high-powered deer rifle.

There is no scope included with the sale of this rifle. However the one piece Leupold base and 1"" rings are still on it.  Unless the buyer specifies otherwise, they will be included with sale.  I believe I have the box to the gun in the attic, but don't feel like digging through the pile of junk up there, unless it is a ""must have"" for a buyer. It can also come with the remaining 11 rounds of ammo that I was using, at the buyers request.

Please keep in mind this gun has been carried a lot and shot very little the wear on the bolt is simply from loading and unloading it 100”s of times over the last 5 years. It has always shot true regardless of the conditions. It held 3.5 inch groups out past the 300 yard mark consistently with factory ammo.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with the rifle, I just no longer have a need for it as I finished a custom Mauser that I'll be using from now on.  No problems with the gun, just hate to see it collect dust.  I'm asking $450 firm.

It is pretty much impossible to find anyplace unless you go on gunbroker and are willing to pay about $900-$950 for one. CZ hasn't shipped any new ones in months and no dealers have them.

 This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired. Great gun for the range or home defense. Competition grade.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

This is an early Generation 2 universal which basically means that it's got a mix of USGI and Universal specific parts. The gun has two recoil springs. It sits in an under folding wood stock which puts the entire length at 26 1/2"" folded. It shoots great and does not jam. This would make a great truck, backpacking, nightstand gun.

Now for the bad. One of the things universal did was stop using the cupped operating rod and went to a cutout to operate the bolt. This is known to be an inherent weakness in the design. Sure enough, this one has a crack. I have shot it with it cracked, but it needs welded, smoothed and reblued to be right. 
The second problem is the pistol grip broke off at some point. It was doweled and glued and has not been an issue since I've owned it, but there is a hairline crack all the way around the grip. It sits on my reloading bench on the grip for the past year or so with zero problem, but it's noticeable. I was debating just cutting the damn thing off flush and putting an AR grip on it, but never got around to it. I think it would be an improvement.

Manufactured between 1977 & 1981.  24 inch barrels chambered for 2 ¾” & 3” shells.  Both tubes are choked Full.  Both bores are excellent.  The barrel selector is on the hammer.  Silver bead front sight.  LOP=14 1/8”.  The receiver is color case hardened.  Factory checkering on the pistol grip & on the underside of the forearm.  The condition of the metal is 95-98%.  The wood would be considered the same except for a hairline crack where the shoulder stock meets the left side of the receiver.  From a shooting standpoint, I don’t believe this should be of concern since this gun is chambered for .410 ga. shells.  It retains the factory butt plate. this is the lower gun in the picture.

It came with the thumbhole sporter stock, but will accept standard AK stocks and pistol grips. The wood is nice though, and the sporter stock has a longer length of pull than regular AK stocks, and has more cheek support. Definitely much more comfortable to shoot. The rifle's construction is top-notch and it's a straight and reliable shooter; definitely a league above WASRs. Bore is in pristine shape, not many rounds through it. 

Mostly fishing for trades but will entertain cash offers, $900 will definitely take it away from me.

It holds six rounds of .22 short in the magazine and one in the chamber.
These small framed, Beretta pistols use a super simple blowback action. 
This also means the gun has a pretty stout recoil spring to keep the 
action pushed forward and a short slide—and this makes it hard for 
some to grip. 
To get around this, Beretta used a barrel with a pivot pin that pops 
up and out of battery when a latch is depressed. 
With the barrel tipped up, you can load, unload, reload, and 
check to see if you have a loaded chamber with the flick of the lever.
The .22 Short models were discontinued after 1992.

One of the many on-line reviews: ""These are the newest imports to the American AK market, and probably the best bang for the buck right now. These rifles are produced for and imported by M&M Arms, located in Colorado. They feature Romanian receivers opened up to accept all standard AK mags and chrome lined, hammer forged Romanian barrels. They also feature a unique gas block/front sight combo, front rail system, and Hogue grip. They are available chambered in 5.45x39 or 7.62x39. There are two configurations, one with a fixed stock (pictured), and one with a side folding Romanian wire stock. The wire stocked ones are a tad more expensive. The fit and finish on these is very good, and they are solid step up from the Century WASR imports. They can be found in the $650-$850 range depending on caliber and configuration.""

****UPDATE****
4 Collectors at the gun show this weekend has told me that there is nothing wrong with the finish on the rifle. All 4 has told me not to re-blue in order to keep it in it's original condition for collection purposes. The rifle is a post 64, made in 1981 and is in great shape for being that old. Action is excellent, very smooth for that year of production and the wood finish other then minor marks is in excellent condition beautiful grain. 3 of the 4 gave me the same price range to sell it for and the last was higher, however I'm not changing that asking price, and going to leave the price low

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
I ship  handguns by USPS for a flat fee of $25 and all rifles by UPS ground for a flat fee of $35. Alaska and Hawaii are more. The turn-around time once payment is received is generally within 24 hours unless a weekend or holiday."

I have a very nice Dan Wesson 744V 8"" barrel stainless hand cannon. Gun was made in Monson, which is preferable. This gun has a polished finish instead of the factory brushed finish. Gun is in very, very good condition... you would be hard pressed to find a finer one than this one. And ridiculously accurate as well. All around a phenomenal gun. Barrel shroud is ported but the barrel itself is not.

$800 obo. I also have tons of .44 ammo I can sell with the gun or include in a trade.

Will consider trades. No junk guns and no lowballs. These guns are getting harder and harder to find, especially in this condition. I'm not going to just give it away but I will try to be fair. 

Would love to trade on a Ruger SR1911 or a Springfield XDM 45 bi-tone plus boot."

This rare example is chambered in 25 acp, whereas most of these were chambered in 32. A antique arms dealer examined it and told me that the low, 5-digit serial number indicates a manufacture date in the 1920's. These fine German pistols are serialized on just about every part...and all numbers match on this gun. This is also an early import gun, that made it to the states before 1968, as it doesn't have the gaudy importer's mark (Importer's name, city and state), but rather simply says ""Germany"" on the top of the barrel. The blued finish of the gun is in great, original condition, with about 75-80% remaining finish, and all proof marks are clearly legible. The wood grips are in great condition, as are the original holster and single magazine that come with the gun. The barrel has good rifling, and this gun functions flawlessly. This will be a great addition to your historical collection, and you will find it's sheer uniqueness to be fascinating.

This bow is unusual in that it has a aluminum arrow rest assembly that is machined to accept the two arrow guide strips that form a slot to accept the fin adapters and arrow. The string of the bow travels down the center of the rest. Also attached to the rest is an arrow holding spring to keep the arrow in place at all times before the shot. The release is a dual caliper model with a pistol grip handle and trigger. When the bow is drawn the release, rest, string and arrow are all in equal motion. At release only the string and arrow move forward. The rest is mounted to the bow using an aluminum fixture equipped with five rollers. These rollers allow the rest to be drawn with no noise. The attachment fixture is also hinged to allow the bow to be placed in the stored/resting position.
