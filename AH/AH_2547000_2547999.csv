Full Metal Jacket, Green Tip Penetrator, Federal Premium ammo from the Lake City factory. It is loaded to Military specifications and this particular load is the 62 grain Steel Penetrator with the painted green tip for easy identification. It is first run quality non-corrosive, boxer primed, re-loadable brass cases.
It is headstamped 2012 and it comes packed loose.

This is not the normal .223 55 grain associated with the American Eagle brand.  It is the higher grade military penetrator ammo.  This round has the potential to punch holes through steel plates. The price is below market average for this type, so don't try to convince me that you can get the 62 grain Penetrator for same price as 55 grain somewhere else.

Price is for 1,000 rounds, loose in the box. I am willing to break up the batch at 500 rounds, but nothing less. Basically .50 per round. Market is averaging at .54 per round.

Muzzle velocity: 3104 fps
Muzzle energy: 1326 ft/lbs
Uses: Personal Protection or Self Defense

Note: This item is manufactured in the Lake City Plant currently run by Federal ATK. The ammo is brand new, brass cased, boxer primed, non-corrosive and re-loadable. It is made to military specifications which require the cases to be annealed. Unlike civilian production ammo, the military requires to see evidence of annealing on the round itself. This is why the cases will appear to be discolored. This is done on purpose in order to meet the military requirement for overall strength and durability of the finished round."

This is a Very Rare and Beautiful Schneider & Glassick Confederate Cased Revolver, with a Large Bowie Knife to match. In Excellent plus condition and was made in 1976 by High Standard, who usually made all the Second Generation Confederate Revolvers. Only 1000 of these sets were made in 1976, and you very rarely see one on any auction, or, anywhere else as well. The original Schneider & Glassick was manufactured in Memphis, Tennessee, for the Confederate Army during the Civil War. This is a Rare and Beautiful Cased Set - don't miss this one.
This Revolver has not been fired to my knowledge; it does have a very-very slight turn ring on the cylinder. The Bowie Knife is in perfect condition and is a beautiful and stunning collector set. In actuality, this set is more collectable than a Colt - Since only 1000 were made and most are in the hands of collectors that do not want to part with them.

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. ***COLORADO RESIDENTS WILL ONLY RECEIVE THE 2X5RD MAGS AND $150 WILL BE DEDUCTED FROM THE PRICE.

This is a youth model and is very good gun for children or smaller stature people.
I bought it in 1992 and my wife used it for skeet shooting.
We haven’t shot it in years. 
The gun looks new. I have the original box. 2 choke tubes – modified and improved skeet.
This is a nice little gun we just don’t shoot it anymore.
I’m located in Walton KY
$275 or best offer
Thanks for looking.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

There is a little wear on the front end of the slide from taking it in and out of the holster but after all the mods it shoots a lot more smoothly than factory LC9s. I know I am not making a profit on this gun, but I would like to get the majority of my investment back. So the price is $500 or any combination of trade and cash. Will also pay a little extra for a 1911 someone might be wanting to get rid of.

This is a great conceal and carry weapon and I never had any problems with it jamming or misfiring.

Holster is super comfortable and very low profile.

If you have any questions as to why the upgrades were done, contact me and I will let you know."

I'll start by saying this pistol is extremely reliable and and very accurate. I bought the PX4 from a friend of mine, who was the original owner, about a year or so ago. This PX4 is a ""Type-C"" which basically just signifies it as a DAO pistol. No safeties, and a bobbed hammer from the factory. Otherwise, it is the same as the rest of the PX4 line. It is a full sized firearm, chambered in 40 S&W to give you 14+1. Comes with Trijicon night sights installed (still glow nicely), 4 Beretta Mags, and a Fobus holster. It has very minimal holster wear and some barrel hood wear from cycling (the usual). I am taking offers at this point, but please don't low ball. If you would like more pics, just send me a message and I'll send them over to you! Thanks for looking.

I would like to meet FTF as I do not want to ship the pistol, and preferably local. I am free for morning-early afternoon transfers, and weekends are no problem. Buyer pays transfer fee. Any questions on anything you see, don't hesitate to ask!"

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World
Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for
competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened
recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced
performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front
sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots.
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load
combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass
which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be
used.
