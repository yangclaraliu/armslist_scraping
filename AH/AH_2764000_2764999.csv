If you have any questions just reply to this posting. I can take detailed pictures of anything upon request.


I can remove all previously mentioned accessories and just sell the rifle with the standard plastic M4 type handguards and Magpul Sight and adjust the price to $675 with shipping or FTF (THIS PRICE AND OPTION MUST BE SPECIFIED or I will assume you are buying the whole set up).  I can ship but it must be to a verified FFL.

The PK380 is not just good looking. It is small and good looking. That makes the PK380 excellent for concealed carry. Its small grip is ideal for shooters with small hands. The slide is easy to operate, making it a good choice for women. The light weight goes unnoticed in a pocket or purse. Credit Walther Performance Design for another hit. Small is indeed beautiful.

Descendents of the original Derringer Pistol, these double-barrel personal-defense firearms are ideal for carry in a pocket, purse, tackle box or pack. Sturdy stainless steel construction and handsome hardwood handles. Chambered to shoot .45 Long Colt cartridges or .410 bore shotgun shells, they’re among the most powerful handguns of their kind. Barrels are interchangeable with other calibers available from Bond Arms. Automatic extractors facilitate quick reloading. Rebounding hammers allow fast follow-up shots. Retracting firing pins and crossbolt safeties add peace of mind. Spring-loaded, cammed locking levers create a tighter frame-to-barrel fit. All have blade front and fixed rear sights. Made in Texas by Texans.
• Snake Slayer IV – Identical to the original Snake Slayer, but with a longer 4.25"" rifled barrel.

Carried a few times, No wear scratches etc. Have two 6 round mags, two 10 round mags.  90 rounds of 230gr wwb hollow point. 45 rounds of 230gr umc fmj. 17 rounds of 185gr hydrashok. And 15 rounds of 200gr speer gold dot. Total of 167 rounds of quality ammo

For those who arent familiar with 45 gap. Its ballistics is equivalent to the 45acp +p round. Except its in a smaller frame size. This one is the exact same frame as the glock 26, 27, 33. The slide is a tad more wider. This gun is not for the prepper/SHTF crowd who only shoot common calibers. This gun is hard to find. I Searched for a while but now I'm looking for something new to play with.

 contact only if serious....Will respond soon as I can thanks



Last pic is for size comparison to the fullsize glock and xdm 3.8. Im sure you guys know what size a g26 is though"

Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.



New Adjustable Sigths Kit


Other PX4 Accessories
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

Starting from a solid bar of stainless steel, the slide is bead blasted to a smooth satin finish, ensuring a non-reflective surface that is highly resistant to the elements (barrel is black). Mated to the highly refined, techno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frame, the Px4 Inox is optimized for use in the most challenging environments.Together they create a two-tone finish that is not only practical and functional, but distinctly attractive.These features make the Px4 Inox perfectly suited to humid climates or harsh environments.The Inox continues to maintain the proven features of the Px4 line of pistols.The three interchangeable backstraps make fitting most shooters with different sized hands quick and easy.The magazine release is easily changed to accommodate both right- or left-handed shooters, and the unparalleled reliability of the in-line feeding system keeps the Inox running shot after shot.The Px4 Inox epitomizes functional elegance for the most demanding shooter.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.



New Adjustable Sigths Kit


Other PX4 Accessories
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction).

Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

Looks wicked and shoots great. Outstanding overall condition. Very fast handling.

Just to be clear, this is not a ""parts"" firearm. It is a factory complete Rock River LAR-15 Mid-length A4 that has been augmented with carefully chosen add-ons.

The object of this project was to build out a rock solid AR platform with quality upgrades that made sense for a CQB or Homestead Defense POU, maintained a clean, streamlined look, and improved overall handling markedly. No silly quad rails or exotic mods that just get i n the way.

Aside for close quarters handling, it also had to be able to reach out and touch a target at 200M with MOA accuracy. The Wilson match barrel, two stage trigger, and carefully adjusted headspace made that happen easily.

IMHO it was an unqualified success...there's nothing left to improve, aside from adding a nice scope for sustained long range use if you wish.  It's time for me to stop tweaking the accuracy of this rifle and move on to something else…I have some ideas about the Tavor platform which should be fun (but expensive).

Here's what you are getting:

Genuine factory matched RRA upper and lower 
16"" OAL 1:7 twist RRA Match Grade barrel (14.5"" Wilson - Wylde chamber, Stainless Steel with pinned compensator for AWB compliance)
Two stage RRA trigger
USA Magpul MOE fore-end
USA Magpul MOE Vertical Grip
Rock River Tactical CAR Stock with optional buttpad
Israeli Command Arms Stock Saddle/Cheekpiece
USA Magpul Ergo Grip w/compartment cover (holds included sight tool).
USA Magpul BAD Lever
USA Troy Industries enhanced trigger guard
GI MATECH BUIS rear sight [May substitute my Midwest Industries BUIS if you prefer...I like the Matech as it's effective out to 600m]
Elzetta USA ZFH1500B-T AR15 Tactical Flashlight Holder with Thumbscrew, Matte Black
Streamlight 88850 Polytac LED TAC light
Perfectly co-witnessed Bushnell TRS-25 Red Dot reflex sight w/quick release riser
[You may substitute my Bushnell AR Optics 1x MP Illuminated Red/Green T-Dot Reticle Riflescope, 1x32mm...looks great but does not co-witness and is a bit heavy for my tastes]

Also included:
2 new 30 round pmags
Intrafuse AR Multitool
Real Avid Multi Scraper
Original RRA blue factory case

That's over $500 of top tier add-ons that you can enjoy or part out to lower your overall cost.

I recently ""tuned up"" the upper by re-staking the bolt carrier group using professional tools, replaced all critical gaskets, springs, and ejector, and installed a new buffer spring and upgraded to an H2 buffer weight to improve felt recoil and ejection timing. Cases eject at 1:30, just like they should. No FTEs or FTFs. A pleasure to shoot."

Remington 700 BDL in 7mm Remington Magnum. It is built for a high caliber, lightweight hunting rifle for traveling when hunting for big game, but could easily be set up for a Bench/Target rifle. It features a Boyds Featherweight Thumb-Hole Pepper-Wood stock (Original nice BDL stock is included). Stock is lightweight but has nice recoil pad made for the stock so the recoil is not bad at all. When using the high grain 7mm mag ammo, it is comparable to a 30-06. It also has Leupold base and rings and a Leopold Vari-X III 4.5x14x40 (with objective yardage dial-in focus and Duplex Reticle) sighted in at 100 yards. I also have two boxes of HORNADY Red ballistic tip (high and Medium grain), Winchester Silver-tip ballistic tip high grain, and one box of Winchester brass rounds (High grain) for range. Also has Claw sling installed. Stock also has additional forward lug for a Bi-pod. Total amount invested in rifle is below. The bolt is very smooth (like new), the gun is very clean (inside barrel is like new), very flat-shooting, very powerful. Blueing is 90% from use, but overall round count is less than 40. I am someone who takes very good care of their things, this gun was no exception (regular cleanings/lubricating even when not used just to remove dirt particles from air inside cabinet). Carried more than shot. Spends most of its time in gun cabinet. Can send more pics from if needed.

There is some slight wear on the outside of the barrel, from being carried through the woods, but the stock has been refinished and is like new.

831,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2764831,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD FREE 45-70 MAG. +P 300 gr. TSX-FN (2350 fps) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 60,"Listed On: Monday, March 3, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=306

This is a super powerful 45-70+P loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on to them) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese Mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 300gr. TSX long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as they typical 350+gr. lead core expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and gives flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 2200+ fps is screaming and is powerful and for those that understand the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit to many shooters, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

2215 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22 inch barrel
2201 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18 inch barrel
Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

Im not willing to break these up at this time.  I will also trade these, please see below for what I am interested in.

1) S&W 44 American made in 1872 Top Break 6 shot. This gun was only made 3 years and is extremely rare as it is a double action and was made years before the first gen double actions were made. This gun was made for the US Army and they got the work as Colt did not have a patent for one. The gun locks up good, finish 75-80% riflings are good and has a 4 digit serial # (Blued finish) 4 7/8 barrel

2) S&W Top Break 38 OTG 5 shot double action, finish 50% with patina lock up tight solid riflings visible (Blued finish) 5"" barrel

3) H&R Top Break 32 in Chrome, 5 inch barrel 4 digit SN finish 95% Double action locks up nicely

4) H&R 44 webley Chrome 2 1/2 barrel double action 5 shot 4 digit SN finish 90%

5) H&R 32 low 4 digit SN 5 shot finish 50% with load latch missing double action and functions freely 2 1/2 barrel

6) This is a very nice and unique Slocum Civil War era revolver. This front loading .32 rimfire, five shot pistol is gold plated over the brass frame. There is enough gold left to clearly see it was plated. Original blue finish remains on the 3"" barrel. Manufactured in Brooklyn, N.Y., by the Brooklyn Arms Company, the Slocum revolver was a unique design with individual chambers in the form of sliding tubes within cutouts on the cylinder. Chambers slide forward one at a time over a fixed rod on the right side to expose, load and eject. This pistol was built this way to evade the Smith & Wesson-held Rollin White patent on bored-through cylinders. The .32-caliber Slocum was a popular Civil War-era choice for personal protection. These were only made from 1863 to 1864. This Slocum revolver is much better than many you will see. The revolver is also known as the Slocum Separate chambers revolver.

7) (Velo)  Chrome Pocket derringer; hammer less in very nice shape. The caliber appears to be 32. The gun is extremely tight (like new) and has a 1 3/4 barrel and a pearl handle

8) Maltby Henley 32 5 shot. 60-65% finish chrome 3 3/8 barrel 5 digit serial #, the gun function as it should. 

9) Austro Hungarian –(Velo)  It has a 1 3/4 barrel and it is missing the safety which will not let the trigger move forward. The finish is blue and about 80%.  The barrel looks like 60%"
