What is different about our Missouri Concealed Carry classes?

    -- Every CCW class is developed individually by the certified instructor.  They are not all equal and do not all contain specific information needed by women. Rebecca is very much an everyday woman and understands fully about women and concealment issues.
    -- Retired law enforcement and ex-military teachers share experiences that are intriguing but unrelatable to civilian moms. Our examples & discussions relate to the daily issues of women.
    -- Women have specific body shapes and concealment needs not usually addressed in a co-ed classroom setting. We bring out the wardrobe and spur on the ideas.
    -- Our curriculum is designed for diverse learning modes utilizing proven retention methods that engage our students from student handbook exercises, interactive discussions, videos, power point presentation and more.
    --  Also, 10% of every student's tuition costs goes to teh A21 Campaigns to rescue children from human trafficking.

Tell your guys you want this class as a gift for Christmas and send your guys on over to our site at momsandguns.com to download a special Christmas Gift Certificate. 

You do not need to own a firearm to take this class.  We actually help you select a handgun that's right for you in class.  We provide pistol, revolver, ammunition, eye/ear protection, targets, student handbook, classroom & range time.  If you do bring your own handgun, you will need to provide your own ammunition. Thank you!"

My wife, I discovered absolutely hates guns, so mine is now for sale. AR styles in this price range are nearly impossible to find. It comes with a 25 round clip. I have a barrel of 144 Remington Hollow Ppoint 22LR and 200 other hollow points and 250 target rounds available for market value. This ammo is currently difficult to find and in some cases, more expensive than usual. I'm sure this will adjust again once we all get stocked up. I think 200 rounds of self defense rounds should be sufficient to be considered armed for any situation. Most of the ranges have rounds available for use on their range at a good price. I always pick up an extra box or 2 so I have some available. I have ordered a bore sight for the 22 to keep my sight or possibly a scope zeroed in. I have an available case at no charge. It will fit a handgun too plus room for a bit of ammo. I understand I must make an adjustment for this rifle because it is used. They seem to run 4249 to $279 and I will sell it for $210 plus the cost of the ammo if you are interested. There is virtually none available online and Walmart, Academy, Cabellas and Bass pro have it for about 30 minutes after their bi-weekly truck arrives. The hollow point isn't even on the shelf. I have enough that you would be fully stocked on self defense and a good supply of target if your range is out. I can be texted at REDACTED . I would appreciate your business. This is a much more affordable than the look alike AR's that are $700 to $1,000. Good for Christmas."

What is different about our Missouri Concealed Carry classes?

    -- Every CCW class is developed individually by the certified instructor.  They are not all equal and do not all contain specific information needed by women. Rebecca is very much an everyday woman and understands fully about women and concealment issues.
    -- Retired law enforcement and ex-military teachers share experiences that are intriguing but unrelatable to civilian moms. Our examples & discussions relate to the daily issues of women.
    -- Women have specific body shapes and concealment needs not usually addressed in a co-ed classroom setting. We bring out the wardrobe and spur on the ideas.
    -- Our curriculum is designed for diverse learning modes utilizing proven retention methods that engage our students from student handbook exercises, interactive discussions, videos, power point presentation and more.
    --  Also, 10% of every student's tuition costs goes to teh A21 Campaigns to rescue children from human trafficking.

Tell your guys you want this class as a gift for Christmas and send your guys on over to our site at momsandguns.com to download a special Christmas Gift Certificate. 

You do not need to own a firearm to take this class.  We actually help you select a handgun that's right for you in class.  We provide pistol, revolver, ammunition, eye/ear protection, targets, student handbook, classroom & range time.  If you do bring your own handgun, you will need to provide your own ammunition. Thank you!"

What is different about our Missouri Concealed Carry classes?

    -- Every CCW class is developed individually by the certified instructor.  They are not all equal and do not all contain specific information needed by women. Rebecca is very much an everyday woman and understands fully about women and concealment issues.
    -- Retired law enforcement and ex-military teachers share experiences that are intriguing but unrelatable to civilian moms. Our examples & discussions relate to the daily issues of women.
    -- Women have specific body shapes and concealment needs not usually addressed in a co-ed classroom setting. We bring out the wardrobe and spur on the ideas.
    -- Our curriculum is designed for diverse learning modes utilizing proven retention methods that engage our students from student handbook exercises, interactive discussions, videos, power point presentation and more.
    --  Also, 10% of every student's tuition costs goes to teh A21 Campaigns to rescue children from human trafficking.

Tell your guys you want this class as a gift for Christmas and send your guys on over to our site at momsandguns.com to download a special Christmas Gift Certificate. 

You do not need to own a firearm to take this class.  We actually help you select a handgun that's right for you in class.  We provide pistol, revolver, ammunition, eye/ear protection, targets, student handbook, classroom & range time.  If you do bring your own handgun, you will need to provide your own ammunition.

As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it’s transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining zero. The rifle’s M1913 optics rail has a 27 MOA taper to take full advantage of the scope’s elevation travel.

Emergency iron sights provided. Nerves of steel are not.

This is a very gently used gun, has very few rounds through it. It is an Express Magnum with walnut police stock and grip, Remington rifled barrel, and a Remington receiver mounted top rail. It is in overall excellent condition with the exception of two problems: I stored it improperly one year, and it developed a small amount of rust on the left side of the receiver, but NOWHERE else. Also, the front iron sight on the barrel is partially broken, so a person would need to get it replaced (it's just a dovetail) or sight in a scope. Otherwise, it's a great gun, available immediately for gun 2 and antlerless; Just got a buck with it today, in fact. Will need to see permit to purchase or carry. 

Also, I would be willing to work out a deal on an inexpensive scope that's been on it in the past, and I also have a metal case that it has been stored in."

If you're tired of the same-old AR platform that everyone else has and are looking for something a bit different then check this out. This gun is basically the love child of an AR, AK and FAL. Uses FAL adjustable gas system, AK style gas piston and AR style bolt/FCG. Uses normal AR STANAG magazine (e.g. GI mags, PMags, etc). These guns are super reliable.

These were imported by Kimber in the 90s (lower is stamped 'Kimber'). They had hideous thumbhole stocks and ugly handguards. I converted to use adjustable M4 style stock and TuffForce FAL handguard. Also put on a StormWerkz optic rail. These guns are floating around out there but you're not likely to see very many. Only time I've ever seen another one in person was in the hands of a 14 year old Guatemalan military soldier when I was in Guatemala earlier this year. I noticed it, yelled ""Daewoo?"" and he raised the gun in the air and gave me a thumbs up.

Anyway, I'm asking $1,250 firm for this. Located in Lawrence/Maury County and will not travel far."

This gun is still soaked in cosmoline and in the box direct from the importer. This is a great project gun and one on of the best SKS's ever made. These are the closest to the Russians - nearly identical. If you have not had a chance to shoot one, they are fantastic. Like an AK-47 but much higher quality. All milled parts and a short-stroke piston system. Internal 10 round magazine, but larger, removable ones can be purchased. Has an attached blade-type bayonet.

For those unfamiliar with these awesome handguns, they are walther ppk clones, but shoot the slightly larger 9mm mak round, which provides better knockdown power than a .380 but less recoil than a 9mm Luger. As with all my guns, it's not 100% stock. I had my gunsmith smooth and round the back of the slide (they come from the factory pretty sharp and have been known to cut a thumb or two, just like the older ppk's. This rounding and smoothing has fixed that problem.)

Gun is probably 95-98% condition, and comes with both mags stamped with matching serial numbers, same as the gun.

Also included is a nice leather bianchi IWB holster, which helps make this gun into one of the BEST carry pistols made. I have literally forgotten I had it on me before.

It also comes with 150 rounds of ammo: 100 rounds of Brown Bear 94 grain FMJs, 25 rounds of Wolf 100 grain FMJs, and 25 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 95 grain FTX.

All of that for the low, low price of $275!

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!

For the first one to show up with cash, I'm throwing in a GunVault locking pistol case. The pistol and spare mag fit in it perfect, and the foam liners prevent them from moving around. The mag doesn't even slide around!

So act now, because this gun will be gone very soon. Don't let yourself pass this deal up and spend the rest of your life filled with regret. At prices this low, you can't afford NOT to buy this!

Located in loganville, and will not travel far."

The HSGI™ Small H-Harness is included with the Chest Rig. This allows the weight to be distributed evenly, and creates a level of comfort over and above the X-Backed shoulder straps found on most small chest rigs.

This is a .25 cal air rifle.  I have added a very nice scope that has the option of lighting the crosshairs green or red.  Has a laser attached to the scope for quick sight ins.  Has two extra rails under the gun.  One with a bipod and one with nothing on it that is at the end of the air service port under the barrel.  I had a custom shroud made that holds 6 extra baffles (stock and the one I made are in the pic, you can see the diffrence in length).  I have also added an internal part that decreases the sound.  This thing sounds like a .22 rifle.  But you put the extended shroud and baffles on.  It sounds like a empty coke can being dropped from waist height.  This gun can be shot out your bedroom window, crack the skull of a coon and never wake a soul.  True ""urban"" rifle if you like taking out stuff but live close to town.  No joke, a red rider makes more noise then this thing.  A picture of some types of rounds I have are included next to a 9mm bullet.  Comes with an air take.  Can service the rifle about 40 times and each service gives about 20 shots.  Comes with soft case.  Magazine holds 8 pellets and this thing is a bolt action air rifle.  Will consider trades but would prefer to sell.  Check out www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUEwxg32s6Y. This is a video of a guy using the same gun I have but stock kill a hog!  This is my baby but my its Xmas time and need to free up cash."

As the title states I have a like new Mini Draco that I'd like to sell or trade. I bought this gun back in 2011 and have only fired 66 rounds of it since then. It was going to be an SBR project but, I'm thinking of going another route with less hassle... 

I've had several ""upgrades"" done to it. They are as follows (starting from the back of the gun to the front):

Custom made ""Fat Cap"" (
Hogue HandAll slipped on over that for a more ergonomic and comfortable grip.
Midwest Industries Mini Draco Rail
FAB Defense (Mako group) PTK grip. (Basically an Isreali AFG). Looks better than the magpul one IMHO.
PTK support piece that I turned into a finger rest.
M6X Light and Laser Combo.

I have 2 drums available as well as over 30 different kinds of AK47 magazines (30 rounders and up from the USA (Tapco, Promag), China, Europe).

I am specifically wanting to trade this for a SAIGA 12 converted, or a VEPR 12 (With the folding stock and capability to shoot with the stock folded). Hell I'll even take a one of those Fury shotguns. Basically I need a converted semi-automatic 12 ga of kalashnikov pattern. No Akdals please. I have a project lined up for it but I need the base shotgun to work with.

I am willing to match magazines, throw in money, accessories etc etc to meet a fair deal. 

If you'd like to buy it I'm asking 1200 for the pistol with 2 drums, 10 magazines, and all accessories currently on it.

Price can be adjusted to suit your needs as well as mine.

All I ask is please, please. please.... no low ball offers. I am not doing this for any kind of profit. I just want enough to get a Saiga 12 converted and a few things I'll need to buy to get my project up and running or the VEPR12 I mentioned above.

Please feel free to ask any questions thru PM and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can."

What I have for sale is a lightly used Ruger SR 1911. If you have never seen one of these you need to. Ruger out some quality parts on this bad boy right out of the box, I will admit I was surprised and impressed. It had a sketonized trigger and hammer, and has black controls on a stainless lower and slide. I added a Wilson combat buffer plug and spring. The trigger pull is light and crisp. This beauty has Novac dot sights, and beautiful wood grips. This was my 1st 1911, and I am looking to get a kimber, colt, etc. Comes with 2 factory mags, box, manual, etc. I am the original owner and I paid 820 for last May. The price is discounted because of a small Blemish on the slide where I caught some splashback at the range. It is hardly noticeable, and a Gun Smith at the pistol pair told me it should come out no problem. I would consider trades, but mind you I am looking for quality. Email or text 808 343 nine nine 94 for more pictures or questions. Price is 740, with what I listed. Hit me up, worst I can say is no!"

-- Every CCW class is developed individually by the certified instructor. They are not all equal and do not all contain specific information needed by women. Rebecca is very much an everyday woman and understands fully about women and concealment issues.
-- Retired law enforcement and ex-military teachers share experiences that are intriguing but unrelatable to civilian moms. Our examples & discussions relate to the daily issues of women.
-- Women have specific body shapes and concealment needs not usually addressed in a co-ed classroom setting. We bring out the wardrobe and spur on the ideas.
-- Our curriculum is designed for diverse learning modes utilizing proven retention methods that engage our students from student handbook exercises, interactive discussions, videos, power point presentation and more.
-- Also, 10% of every student's tuition costs goes to teh A21 Campaigns to rescue children from human trafficking.

Tell your guys you want this class as a gift for Christmas and send your guys on over to our site at momsandguns.com to download a special Christmas Gift Certificate.

You do not need to own a firearm to take this class. We actually help you select a handgun that's right for you in class. We provide pistol, revolver, ammunition, eye/ear protection, targets, student handbook, classroom & range time. If you do bring your own handgun, you will need to provide your own ammunition.

There are 3 presses included in this offer.I have many pounds of brass,powder,primers and bullets included with this setup.I use LEE presses combined with Redding and RCBS Dies. Any issues that LEE has been known to have like the auto priming on their turret presses have been resolved by me with proper fixes so this setup is very reliable and you will be able to have ammo ready to shoot within an hour or so of getting it home.


INVENTORY LIST 

LEE Load Master 5 Station Turret Press
 with auto priming of both large and small primers and 4 tube auto loading brass station with sorter at the top to allow you to dump your brass in and it corrects the orientation and readys the brass for easy pressing. This press also comes with the powder hopper to allow you to do everything and generate 1 complete round per pull of the handle. 

LEE Auto-Disk Charge Bar (New In Package)
for use with the powder hopper. This bar allows you even more precise powder loads as it's adjustable.

LEE Breech Lock Challenger Press (Priming system is still NEW IN BOX)
this press has an auto priming system that allows for easy priming of large and small primers utilizing a gravity feed system.This is a single stage press and comes in handy for other things you may wish to set up so that you don't have to change out your 5 stage or the other single stage press.This press also includes a powder hopper that you can manually dispense measured powder charges. This is awesome for rifle calibers and makes things go fast and easy.

LEE Single Stage Press
Having an extra press is never a bad thing. I utilized this press most often to set up the Bulge Buster station that properly sizes the 45 ACP rounds after they expand in a large battery chamber such as Glock would have.

LEE Bulge Buster 
this is a great way to fully size your brass by pressing it all the way through a sizing die and getting a factory sized brass. Removes any and all warp and bulge.

RCBS Stuck Case Remover (New In Packaging)

Hornady 3 In 1 Electric deburring and primer pocket cleaning station. 
this unit makes fast work of deburring 223/556 rounds and can even clean out the primer pocket. Fully automated so all you have to do is hold the brass to it and it does all the work.

The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ's Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

Below is from the manufacturer
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

As the title states I have a Hard Chromed AK47 that I'd like to sell or trade. It is a Romanian WASR10 that has been customized by (classic firearms believe) with an industrial hard chrome finish. Definitely a shootable rifle. I believe they only made about 1000 of these but I could be wrong. I am the second owner of this rifle, I purchased it unfired before I deployed in 2012. Since then I have put 120 rounds through it.

All matching numbers. Trunnion is dated 1968 and has the ""arrow in triangle"" mark. 

I have 2 flip drums available (as of now since I have another listing, if this changes I will edit the number) as well as over 30 different kinds of AK47 magazines (30 rounders and up from the USA (Tapco, Promag), China, Europe).

I am specifically wanting to trade this for a SAIGA 12 converted, or a VEPR 12 (With folding stock capability or fixed stock but please not the welded open one). 

I am willing to match magazines, throw in money, accessories etc etc to meet a fair deal. 

If you'd like to buy it I'm asking $1000 for the rifle with a drum, 10 magazines, and all accessories currently on it.

Price can be adjusted to suit your needs as well as mine.

All I ask is please, please. please.... no low ball offers. I am not doing this for any kind of profit. I just want enough to get a Saiga 12 converted and a few things I'll need to buy to get my project up and running or the VEPR12 I mentioned above.

Please feel free to ask any questions thru PM and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can."

It has fewer than 1,000 rounds through the firearm and has been well maintained. Comes with:

- Pistol itself
- 5 magazines (modified for old Chicago law, READ BELOW)
- Competition case lined with foam
- Large, medium, and small grip backs (large currently installed)
- Original competition accessories [belt holster, magazine pouch]
- Replacement fiber optics in green and red
- Lock cable with 2 keys

All 5 magazines were permanently modified to only hold 12 rounds to be in compliance with Chicago law. This was done with bracket material and J.B. Weld, so is essentially irreversible. If you shoot USPSA Production, this is not a problem as you can only load 10 rounds anyway. The magazines function perfectly, but have a reduced capacity.

The pistol has a Talon wrap-around grip applied to the grip, which can be removed if you desire. The only marks on the pistol are from the slide rubbing the barrel as the action cycles during normal use.

FREE BONUS ACCESSORIES include a Butler Creek UpLULA magazine loader/unloader and a bore snake.

I am selling because I no longer use the pistol. Cash or credit card, which I can take through Square. No trades. FOID and 72 hour waiting period required by Illinois law.

Price is OBO. Located in the northern neighborhoods of Chicago."

So I recently came across this Smith & Wesson Model 57 (.41 Magnum - No Dash) from an aunt who no longer wanted it. She got it from the original owner back in the 80's and has kept it in a safe ever since. Besides the occasional rub down this thing is untouched. I'm looking to sell it as it is just not my style. Lovely gun but I prefer to have something a little smaller. My loss is your gain. It comes with a holster as well. Lets try to find this thing a good home.
