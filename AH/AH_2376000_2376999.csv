Purchased this gun in 2010 from Gander Mountain in Hattiesburg ""off the shelf"" as it was the last one in stock and is no longer in production.

I have fired it exactly 3 times. I cleaned it and it has remained a closet queen for nearly 2 years. This gun is as close to a NIB as you are likely to find. I have the original box, the owners manual, the hammer extender for use with scope, and the Marlin action lock.

I also have available for purchase with the gun 97 rounds of Hornaday LEVERevolution 325 grain FTX for $120 ($150 value).

It actually fits nicely, and makes the SKS look a lot more modern, like an M1A or Mini 14.  I just don't shoot the SKS that much, and I wanted to put it back to original form. I also never installed the upper heat shield portion.
This is a very good quality stock that sold for $60, but they quit making them.  Actually, Butler Creek now only makes stocks for 2 different carbines, and 2 different shotguns, and all 4 of those stocks are steel folding stocks for $140-$180.

From the Cabela's website:
Dress up your SKS with this featherweight synthetic stock that is precision molded to fit perfectly. Designed for fast drop-in at home, this stock delivers maximum quietness and strength and is unaffected by weather extremes. Slim, comfortable pistol grip area with double palm swells for right or left-handed shooters. The raised diamond checkering gives firm grip, while the lengthened trigger pull enhances shooting comfort. Each also has a non-glare texturized finish, a quick-disconnect swivel stud on the butt end of the stock and a molded recoil pad.

I am putting up my brand new Mossberg 500 Door Breacher. It has an ATI six position collapsable stock. Standard 5 round mag tube. I bought this weapon back in july and I have not fired it yet. Still have the box and everything that comes with it. The weapon does have slide marks. Which mossberg is notorious for. And the very end of the crown on the barrel is slightly worn from leaning against the wall but it is hardly noticable. I would like 450 cash but I am willing to do a trade. I would be interested in a Gen 3 Glock 17 or 22. Mossberg 590a1 with an 18 1/2 in. Barrel. However the Glocks are prefered. I will not ship this weapon unless you make a damn good offer on it. If anyone is at all interested please text me at REDACTED. Stay safe and stay armed everyone.

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

Apologies to previous readers; this is Spurred hammer (DA/SA) not LEM (with no external decocker). This weapon is obviously BA, so by taking this piece into your hands you are guaranteed a winner for life. How many others can boast over 91,000 rounds?

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

    Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates

I do require that you supply your own receiver as it is the ""firearm"" of the rifle and requires that you pass the 4473. Supply your own stripped or complete lower and I will build the rest under your budget. Also, I will NOT build any NFA items such as SBR's, attach suppressors, and of course no automatic firearms (although if you want like automatic I recommend looking at the Tac-Con 3MR trigger or a slide fire solutions stock that is ATF approved). If you want any NFA you'll have to to do those last steps yourself.

Works well, in very nice shape. I've only taken it out to shoot a few times, although it was used when I bought it. It's mostly sat in the nightstand ever since. Well cleaned and taken care of. As you know, it fires .45 Colt and up to 2 1/2"" .410 shells. It's a whole lot of fun to toss up some clays and shoot them  with this, too! Good home defense firearm for men and women alike - it's easy to operate, and the recoil is not as bad as you'd think - the grip cushions it more than I thought they would. Still...it does fire shotgun shells. I'm selling it because I don't really shoot it. And I got a Bond Arms .45/.410 derringer, and while EVERYONE needs one .45/410 pistol, having two might be a stretch. :)

Same as usual: Please have been alive for at least 21 years. Please be a resident of the Great State of Florida. If you are in the military, thank you for your service, and thank you for bringing your PCS orders with you :)

    I like to shoot a variety of firearms, and would happily entertain trade offers (FOR FIREARMS). Please, no junk guns! Trades I would think about:

I like older ""metal and wood"" guns, interesting guns, cowboy guns, Russian/Combloc pistols in original and nice condition, and maybe a Glock 26 or a Mossberg 590A1. Please be realistic about what the trade is worth. I searched Armslist and didn't find any Glocks I though were worth $600 used, or any $500 SKSs with ATI stocks that I thought were a real bargain. Unfortunately, I also didn't find any $1000 Taurus Judges, so I had to price mine realistically too :(. Obviously cash would need to go different ways for most of these trades.

Comes with an Uncle Mike's holster I wouldn't really recommend, a soft case, and a box of ridiculously overpriced Winchester PDX ammo.

The mum is not intact and the stock has not been sporterized but the bubba who owned it before me decided it was a good idea to sand it down so it could probably use a bit of a refinish. The rifle is in awesome condition with strong rifling. I got the rifle and it was covered in cosomoline and took me 5 hours to clean but I have not shot it yet. I only have the rifle and nothing else. I am looking to trade this rifle for other military surplus rifles except for Mosin-Nagants because I have one already and I  do not care for having any more of them unless it is a Finnish M39 or a M44 carbine. I can also accept trades for other guns like a pump action 12 guage but please no .22s or Hi-points or if it comes down to it I can sell it outright.

Previous owner had the slide and frame PROFESSIONALLY Ceracoated and installed a Wolff spring kit and custom carbon fiber grips.  I added a touch of Hi-Viz paint to the front sight blade.  This is a very nice looking pistol.  Breaks down for cleaning easier than any other automatic pistol I've ever owned, including Glock and SIG.  Took it to the range and fired 100 rounds through it without a single jam, very tight groups at 30 feet right in the bullseye, very light recoil.

From my cursory research, it is an early model of this gun ranging from 1899-1904.  ALL patent dates are pre-1899 on gun top.

Serial numbers all match and are identifiable - gun visually looks great.  It's in complete condition, with a great patina on the blued finish.  It is all original and has matching serial numbers from the grip to the barrel and revolver assembly.  It needs some minor work with the catch and trigger assembly.  The trigger pulls, but sometimes sticks -- the catch that spins the revolver is also non working.  Both issues are related.  

Overall it is in good condition consistent with age.   Would make a nice piece for anyone looking for a project or a H&R collector.  Great for Christmas gift!

From my research online, in top condition this is around $280ish.  Please see detailed photos for your own research - I used the specific patent dates on the barrel top along with the side barrel markings for my research.  I have a ton of more photos than the 3 that I can include on here.

***I have been advised by a local gun dealer that no paperwork is required for this gun and it can legally be sold as parts.  No paperwork exists, it's an antique.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time-proven design.  High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 

•	Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.

•	Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.

•	Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

•	Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.

•	External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

•	No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

•	Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.

•	Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.

•	High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm."

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing.

SB-47
AK Pistol Stabilizing Brace

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
No Tax Stamp Required! Innovation & Added Functionality!

The SB47 stabilizing brace is an awesome invention that secures AK style pistols to the forearm of the shooter and assists in firing the pistol the way it is intended - with one hand. Using the SB47 in this way, recoil is reduced significantly, resulting in more accurate shooting without compromising safety, comfort or control. Designed and made by a U.S. Military veteran with help from a top V.A. prosthetic specialist, the intent and design of the stabilizing brace is to help America's wounded veterans enjoy large frame handgun shooting again. The concept was to invent and create a device that would act as an extension of one's own arm - so it is like a part of your body. Well the SB47 did that - and more! Not only did it help our wounded heroes regain their confidence and handgun skills, it was wicked fun for anyone to use! BATF approved for everybody, the SB47 does not require any special permits, doctors notes or SBR tax stamp! Will fit PAP M92 PV, PAP M85 PV, Draco and C39 Pistols. Condition: New.

Ohio residents add 7.25% sales tax. Can be picked up in person by appointment or shipped to you for $8.99 if needed.

It is a light shooter, meaning there are maybe 120 rounds thru it.  Kahr says that you need to put 200 rounds thru in order for the weapon to be broken in.  So essentially, its a baby.

I love this pistol and hate to see it go but I don't have all the cash for the shotgun I would like to get.  If you interested in this handgun then have your PTC or PTP and an ID available.  

Also, I would be willing to throw in some cash in addition to the Kahr if we need to even out a deal.  No prob.
