Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers.   Plus P Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.   Taurus Security System (TSS)rs Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.   Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

I have been using an aftermarket magazine and it feeds LR rounds fairly well. It shoots well and the trigger is good. Again made by Mossberg (model 350KA) and probably early 60's.3. Springfield 187S, semi-automatic, 22LR and tube fed. This rifle has a good trigger and shoots very well, no problems with cycling or firing. It also comes with a 4x, tip-off mount Springfield scope. This was made post '68 as it has a serial number.I recently disassembled each of these and cleaned them thoroughly. After that I fired ~20 rounds through each to prove function and cleaned the bores.

Both are brand new in the box (never even been set in rings) - the only time they've been out of the gun safe was to take pics for this thread. I bought these right after deer season ended with plans to install them sometime this summer on my rifles. I had no plans whatsoever to sell these, however an opportunity has come along that is gonna be hard to pass up and I need $$$ to fund that deal. With that said, I could possibly be talked into trading one of the scopes for the right 7mm-08 bolt gun... PM me if interested. Both scopes are Vortex Viper Precision Shooting Tactical (PST) Riflescopes, both are 6x24x50mm with First Focal Plane (FFP) reticles, and both have 30mm tubes. The ONLY difference between these two scopes is one has the EBR-2C(MOA) reticle, and the other one has the EBR-1 (MRAD) reticle.  When looking at both you can't tell the difference between the two from the outside - the ONLY difference between the two is the reticle. What sets these scopes apart from others is two things: 1. Both are First Focal Plane (FFP) reticles. 2. Both have the illuminated reticle (battery has not been installed in either scope). Also note that the reticles in both are etched glass. MSRP on each scope is $1,149 (see Vortex link below). Retail at BassPro is $949 for either (see BassPro link below). I'm looking to get $850 cash for EACH for these scopes. I' prefer to do a face-to-face deal in Huntsville, and will require meeting at a public place. PAY ATTENTION TO THIS:  the price is $850 EACH (per scope) - NOT $850 for both. These scopes are covered under Vortex's unlimited lifetime VIP warranty.

I bought quite a few of these when they came out and this is what I have left. I can tell you they are a blast to shoot and can actually handle more rounds then you think. Everyone young or old will enjoy shooting these. I have three of the ""bleeding"" series these ones are filled with paintballs and two of the targets are reactive and your hits turns orange! These are nice targets as well. They are pretty much life size and can be shot for an extended period. Please look up reviews online for specific sizes and # of rounds. The company who makes these is called zombie industries and they are known to be a good company. You might have even seen these targets on some of the popular Youtube channels. The bleeders go for $90 retail and the reactives  $60-$70. So over 400+ retail without tax or shipping. That being said I would like to sell these the next day or two so make me a reasonable offer and they're yours=) will also look at good trades for all related gear. I have 6 wooden stakes to hold the targets up. Some of the targets have scratches from being dropped and on the wolf the paintballs roll loosely through the body. Not a big deal as they are targets lol. Also I be posting another listing for zombie industries tannerit exploding targets!! These are 1/2 lb jars that fit perfectly into the back of the targets. So after a fun day of shooting zombies, step back a little, hit a headshot blow them up and don't even worry about picking up the mess.More pics on request it only let me load one. Best way to get a hold of me is call/text at 314 nine 74 805 one. Thanks,Nick. Check my other listings!"

378,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5517378,For Sale/Trade:  Trijicon TA41-NLAW-CW rare 2.5x20 ACOG / missile launcher sight with MM07 base,"Glen Rock, York, Pennsylvania","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, May 25, 2016",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Good day, For sale is a rather uncommon, possibly even ""rare"" ACOG. This is a model TA41-NLAW-CW, a 2.5x20 ACOG designed exclusively for the NLAW anti-tank missile launcher. The TA41-NLAW-CW is unique mostly in the fact that it is built on a unique 2.5x20 chassis that is not offered by Trijicon in any other way shape or form. The reticule on the scope is an inverted 'V', probably as a reminder to strike armored targets from the top. The tip of the 'V' is illuminated with Trijicon's famous dual-illumination system. I have no way to date this particular sight, but the Tritium is still ""burning"", and visible in darkness. There is a rubber eyepiece on the aperture of the sight, but it can be removed very easily (just held on with mild adhesive) to give you the standard peripheral vision. Lastly, the ACOG has special markings on the left side and bottom, not common to other ACOGs. The base of this sight is compatible with Trijicon's ""special ring"" mounting systems. Trijicon has since discontinued this mounting system, but mounts are still readily available. I am including on brand new MM07 mount (realistically, a $75-100 value) with this, a low-height adapter for picatinny rails. About a dozen other mounts are available elsewhere otherwise. These sights are used as optics on the MBT-LAW / NLAW missile launchers, used in the Untied Kingdom, Finald, Luxembourg, and Sweden. This ACOG normally folds up into the body of the launcher on a special bracket. The NLAW launchers are single-shot devices, and disposed of after firing. About 18 months ago I had the opportunity to get one of these sights (pictured) from an un-claimed freight auction. I have been using it on a SBR Beretta CX4 Storm in 9mm for the past 17 months, with no issues. It is resistant to water, hot & cold temperatures, recoil, and everything else you would expect from a legendary ACOG. It tracks well, and holds it's zero perfectly. The glass is every bit as crisp as you would expect from any other ACOG (trust me, I have owned 6 others). *This particular* sight should be brand new. They come in plain cardboard boxes with generic foam inserts. No manual, no mount, no frills. Just a label on the outside with a serial number. ...despite me telling you this, I do not have the box available for *this* one I am selling. They ship from the factory with the turrets both at their extreme outside positions, and must be turned in once prior to being used (I just did it on this one). They also come with a generic warning sticker on the side of the objective, but this (and it's residual adhesive) was removed. It has not been shot yet. Add a fun, functional, and unique optic to your collection! Shipping will be actual cost to US only via USPS. Insurance is available at exact cost, should you opt for it.Thank you for looking!"

It has a metal follower on top.  This would date production on this ""Colt AR-15"" magazine to between 1969 and 1979 (as in 1980 the company switched to plastic followers in these style of magazine).  This magazine is clean and complete.  It has some small scratches and average wear.  There is some loss of bluing on the sides of the magazine due to use over the years. As I do not own an AR style rifle, I can not test to see how well this magzine will operate.  However, the spring feels fairly strong.  This vintage 1960's/1970's ""Colt"" magazine is a must for anyone who owns an older ""Colt AR-15"" rifle.  I am asking $25.00 or will be willing to take best offer for this neat old ""Colt AR-15"" magazine.  I will take cash, checks, money orders or Paypal payments. I can arrange to meet to deliver in person in the Wichita, Kansas area or can ship by mail anywhere in the U.S.  Please contact me by e-mail for more information or additional photographs of this cool vintage rifle magazine!!!"

The need for advanced optical sights is especially vital in close quarter combat where the use of both eyes is critical.   Users• Military• Law Enforcement• Civilian Market - Hunting   Our SolutionThe MEPRO 21 provides instant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.

The MEPRO 21  is also designed to work in tandem with a magnifying scope like the MEPRO MX3 - mounted behind it for ultimate accuracy.   Advantages- Always ready for action – no batteries or switches.- Aim & shoot faster than ever - with both eyes open!- Self-illumination means always available- Operates under all weather and temperature conditions- Large 30mm diameter lens assures large FOV - Rapid target acquisition means quicker shooting in urban areas - Quicker shooting in urban areas and rapid target acquisition- Can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye- Effective use of sight under extreme conditions such as bad weather,    firing after physical stress and firing under pressure   Used by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)   4.3 MOA Red Dot"

Silver nitride finish steel receiver with high-relief engraving, polished blued barrels, and oil finish grade II/III walnut, standard Invector choke tubes. What makes White Lightning? The term ""left in the white"", or simply ""white"" has been used for decades describing the color of shotgun and rifle parts. ""In the white"" means that firearm parts were not blued or color case-hardened or colored in any way, but left in the natural, polished color of the metal, such as steel. Often times, the bolt, top lever, slide, ejectors and other parts are left in the natural color of the metal, providing a luxurious contrast to the rest of the shotgun. In this way, the Browning's Citori White Lightning receiver and action offer a fine choice as opposed to ""blued"" over-unders. But don't be afraid that the steel receiver is unprotected: the natural color steel receiver and trigger guard are protected from corrosion by a durable coating process called a ""nitrided"" finish, offering similar protection to bluing. Just with a uniquely elegant and attractive look. A well-rounded pistol grip for performance. The Citori White Lightning's round knob or pistol grip allows the shooter to position his hand at the same, solid place for each shot, thus offering better control for fast-flying waterfowl upland game, sporting clays or trap and skeet. Matching the rounded pistol grip is the forearm. It is nicely rounded and together, they give the name to this over under gun as ""Lightning Style,"" or the Citori White Lightning, a classic style indeed, a timeless style. Specifications: 12 Ga, 28” Barrel Length, 8lbs 2 OZ, 3” Chamber, Chokes Included Full, Modified, Improved Cylinder. Please feel free to ask for more pictures and specific pictures if you would like.

The 20"" barrel, and all steel components, are manganese phosphate coated for complete protection against exterior corrosion or rust. The latest M16A2 rear sight system is incorporated offering dual flip-up apertures: the short range aperture (0-200 meters) has a larger opening for greater light gathering as well as better moving target visibility; the smaller aperture is designed for maximum accuracy at longer ranges. Knobs adjust the sight for windage and elevation - the elevation knob is graduated from 300 to 800 meters so that range adjustments may be made without the need to compensate for bullet drop. The receivers, of 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum, are precision machined from forgings for maximum strength. The upper receiver includes an integral cartridge case deflector and a last round bolt hold open feature to alert the shooter of an empty magazine. The ribbed front handguard offers increased control and heat dissipation and is molded of mil. spec. polymer thermoset composite."

I am selling what could be the game changer for an apocalyptic situation. This AR-15 brings tears to the enemies eyes when seen through the Eotech 552. The upper was hand built by the men of Bravo company manufacturing to turn this simple rifle into a spartan that is lightweight and fluted to defend its homeland against any foreign or domestic opposition. The KAK buffer tube isn't there just to rest your girly shoulder upon. It's there for the chief of all chiefs to saddle up and hold on for the smooth and crisp ride that takes you into the sunset over the Colorado Rockies. The Anderson Manufacturing lower will put a smile on your face as it reigns terror through the complete LPK trigger pulling mechanisms onto the target the lies ahead of it. This Surefire G2x Tactical light when pressed will turn the darkness of hell around as it shines on its target. You may think this is the end, but it comes with 3 handcrafted out of the earths resources Magpul PMags that will bring you utmost joy for 60 rounds of straight American freedom. This rifle isn't for the faint of heart, nor the unforgiving liberal that can't handle words of criticism. No it's for the man out front in the battlefield taking fire from every direction, but at the end with both hands raised high, one with this hard-hitting, steroid using, bred from the hard working hands of an American rifle, and the other hand filled with a straight stainless steel pole with the Freedom of Old Glory flying at its peak. I'm asking $1600. Obo. Also with 300 rounds of 2nd Amendment."
