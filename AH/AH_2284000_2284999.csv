I brought it home, shot it, took it skeet shooting and it was GREAT FUN until the thing broke after 100-200 shells. 

Oh well, it was fun for a while.

The issue is the piece that pushes the firing pins back snapped from old age/fatigue. Now the firing pins are permanently in the forward position as they'd be right after firing a round (or two). They don't go back. Because of this, the gun doesn't open or function.

This is still a cool old gun (1957 made according to the date code) that is beautiful and would look great over someones mantle. I'd keep it for that purpose but as I'm sure you can understand, I'd rather NOT look at it.

Still has many uses however:

1) Fix it... I'm sure theres parts out there somewhere, or maybe this is weldable. Gun has a shiny bore thats in great shape, and shoots really well... atleast it did.

2) Mantle Gun

3) Gun-Shaped club for Home Defense. Even tho its not currently operational, it would still suck to get hit over the head with this thing.

Asking $175 obo. Would consider possible trades for 7.62x54R ammo, or 5.45x39 as well. Possibly 12 gauge ammo for ya know, the guns I *HAVENT* broken yet. Might be willing to trade for another Mosin and I may be willing to add cash to this 12 gauge for the right deal.

Email only.

Even tho this thing needs some work, its still technically a firearm, so bring your valid Ohio drivers license with you."

Many of you have probably never seen one or heard of one. Its a Winchester model 1905 semi-automatic rifle. It and it's variants were only produced for 15 years (a total of about 30,000 were made). The Model 1905 was only made for 2 years! before it was replaced by the 1907 (which was a larger caliber). It was designed from the rim fire model 1903. The gun is significant because it was Winchester's FIRST semi-automatic center-fire gun. Its a semi-automatic 5 round box magazine (which I have). 
It shoots a .35 WSL which stands for Winchester Self Loading. This round is not to be confused with .35 whelen or .35 Remington or .351 wsl. This ammo is very hard to find most people have never heard of it. It is not sold in stores.  Sometimes people will list the ammo on forums and armslist and not realize what they have and you can get a great deal on it. I do actually have ammo for it. I have roughly 60 rounds. If your interested in the gun I will tell you were I get my ammo. The ammo I buy is safe and reliable its made using new materials but made to original specs. Where I get my ammo is not too pricey either... comparable to shooting a 30-06 cost wise. I personally don't think the ammo is hard to find. You just have to order it instead of picking it up in the store.

Do a google search of the gun and read what ever you can its a very interesting gun. A lot of prison guards and police officers used them. 

This gun is very early it was made in 1905 Pre WW1 its nearly 110 years old. Serial number is 1xxx. Its a great piece of history.

Makes a great small game gun too. I used it for coyote, raccoon, possum from time to time.

This barrel is an ""AR Stoner,"" from a time when they were using ER Shaw barrel blanks. The profiling, fluting, threading, and installation of stainless extension were by AR Stoner.

I did a very lengthy break-in, and only ever used high quality lapped 5.56. It was snaked every 20 rounds or less, and meticulously cleaned after every ~100 rounds. Close to 1,000 rounds through this barrel; like any high quality gun, the first thousand rounds just smooth things out and break it in. 

I am intending to build a Rem 700 in 300wm or maybe a 416 barrett, so mid range precision is obsolete for me if I have a platform easily able to reach twice the effective distance of 5.56, thus making this barrel unnecessary for me.

This revolver is Double Action Only, but the gunsmith who did the job left the spur on the hammer. It was a professional job and did not affect the smoothness of the action in any way.

Whoever carried it dinged the cylinder quite a bit. There are also scratches on the frame and some light pitting under the grips. However, the bore and cylinder chambers are very nice. The action is smooth and locks up as it should.

The grips on it are factory new production, but it will also come with the black plastic Hogue monogrip that used to be on it. A HKS speedloader is also included.

Overall this revolver is in excellent working condition with some cosmetic issues. These pre-lock pieces are getting to be a pain to find, but I can't justify having more than one S&W in this caliber.

This is a beautiful nickel plated Airweight with original box, papers, and cleaning brush.  I think he may have fired only 10 or 15 rounds through it and then it sat in his desk drawer for 50 years.  Rarely carried, always in a soft leather holster.

Serial number shows 1961 manufacture, which means it's just over 50 years old and qualifies as a Curio/Relic exempt from the new law.  I'd call the nickel finish and original wood grips 97% . . . very faint marks from drawing from the leather holster are evident under a strong light.  This is practically a brand new gun.  Model 37 (no dash), firing pin on the hammer, hammer spur has NOT been bobbed and no-one has messed with the mainspring.  Pristine, unmolested piece of Smith & Wesson history.  Very lightweight.  Timing and lockup are perfect.  Zero defects.  There are some incredible stag grips on eBay that would look great on this.

Comes with two Bianchi IWB holsters and a mostly full box of range ammo.  I can also throw in a box of standard pressure hollowpoints and 5 rounds of Winchester Silvertips.  This gun has a steel barrel and cylinder, and while you can fire +P ammo through it you probably shouldn't.  This classic Model 37 needs to go to a good home, not someone who want's to stick it in as Kydex holster and shoot high pressure reloads through it.  Will include a microfiber polishing cloth to keep the nickel looking good.

Asking $575 CASH.  Not terribly interested in trades.  Would consider SIGS and ambi 1911s, possibly a G36, can add cash to the right trade.  Also have a S&W 4506-1 available for sale or trade.  WILL NOT SHIP.  I reserve the right to withdraw this item at any time or refuse to sell to anyone I don't like.  Thanks."

Once stored they claim that it will float, though I haven't built up the courage to test this one yet. The compact design makes it ideal to throw in backpack and go camping with because it doesn't take up as much room as a traditional rifle. This one is the camouflaged model with Realtree camo from the tip of the barrel to the bottom of the buttstock. The finish is a little worn in some places but the undercoat is olive drab so it doesn't really stand out. It comes in the original box with all the original paperwork. These are supposed to be issued to the Air Force and the markings seem to support this. The box is olive drab with ""Henry US Survival"" in large black letters. ""Henry US Survival"" is also stamped on the receiver and the serial number is even ""US - XXXXX"". $250 OBO."

(does it ever stop?) At $225 this is a great deal for a reliable semi auto. New ammo available @ $15 ea box of 50.

The CZ Vzor 70 was made in Czechoslovakia and used by the Police and Military This is a used pistol showing some wear in good+ condition. The frame and slide serial numbers match. The grips have no cracks or chips but do show scratches and nicks. The bore is clean. The included holster is in as new condition showing little to no signs of wear. The pics give good example of condition but honestly it looks better in person.

This firearm is very similar to the Walther PP. It has the safety and de-cocking system. This would be a great conceal carry gun. It is 6 1/2 inches long and has an eight shot capacity in .32 ACP caliber. There is a PW ARMS REDMOND WA mark on the right side of the slide. It is a straight blowback design and very easy to field strip and clean. It comes with one magazine. This particular pistol was manufactured in 1973.

The gun is very reliable and has performed flawlessly. It's all steel and built to last. I am only selling it as I need to thin out the herd. Along with this I can also offer several boxes of ammunition @ $15.00 per box.

I am not a dealer or FFL. This is my personal piece. While I've had no issues with this gun no warranty is expressed or implied with purchase. Gun is sold ""as is"".

The ultimate Home Defense shotgun! If you hear the news in South Florida, there's home invasions pretty frequently. As a homeowner, you need a shotgun like this to keep yourself and your family safe! Its only got 50 shells though it, still looks and feels new, and was cleaned well after its 2 trips to the range.

Induded:
*In addition to just the weapon, as you an see in the pics, I am also including a pistol grip, and an extra additional forend. So you can convert it from a tactical shotgun to a pistol grip rifle, and use the extra forend for some experimentation, as a backup,  or just sell it.

*I am also including a TruGlo red/green dot scope, set on a UTG picatinny top rail, all installed. Works great, and fun to shoot with.

*I have also upgraded the stock to an ATI 6-position collapsible. It's got an awesome cushioning pad and definitely takes a lot of the recoil away. 

*On the stock, I have installed a shotgun shell holder! Holds 5 shells, plus the 8 total that the shotgun chambers.

This is possibly one of the more well built 12 ga shotguns on this site, without being ""tacti-cool"". 

For ALL OF THIS, I could ask $450 or $400 like I see so many other people doing, but I'm asking just $350 for it, and I should have no problem getting it. Comes in its original box with all the original paperwork/materials and the lock, still sealed in the bag.

In the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol that later became known as the Contender in his basement workshop. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters. As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle"

This pistol is in very nice shape. A few minor handling marks and holster wear, but no scratches or dings. Sights were touched up with Hi-Viz paint, but that comes right off if you don't like it. Does not have original box or papers, but comes with a gun case, an extra factory magazine, 50 rounds of Ranger T-series +P law enforcement ammo, 25 rounds of +P Golden Saber ammo.

Asking 500 cash for everything. WILL NOT SHIP. Might consider swapping for a P230, or trading towards a P220 or ambi 1911, possibly even a G36. Great pistol that belonged to my Dad, but just a bit bigger and heavier than I'm comfortable with. Was shooting very tight groups at the range last week. This is a great 45 for recoil sensitive shooters, and fits smaller hands fairly well. Rubber Hogue grips can be installed for greater comfort if desired, and factory mags are widely available for under 30 dollars each. These pistols run perfectly and never break or jam.

I'm told that these were manufactured by Springfield Armory for Smith and Wesson.  It is marked: "" Eastfield Model 916-T"", ""MFG. by Smith & Wesson"", Springfield, Mass., USA"", "" Proof Tested 12 GA"", and ""3 inch Chamber, Full Choke"".  This is the take-down model, so with a simple twist of the magazine tube nut the barrel can be turned a quarter turn and lifted out of the receiver.  The wood is nice Walnut.  The nice part about these shotguns is that the receiver is steel, not aluminum like a lot of later pumps.  The action works very smoothly and locks up tight.  It also produces a pellet pattern.  It's chambered for 3"" shells.  The bluing is worn on the receiver, less so on the barrel.  The bore is bright and shinny, and there is no rust anywhere on the shotgun.  I think the tube holds 5 rounds with plug removed.

I'm located in North Bel Air area. When you email me give me a number to call or text and a good time to reach you."

This is the 9mm Glock magazine version.  Can come with up to 10 17 round magazines and 5 33 round magazines (all factory Glock).  Also can come with Primary Arms micro dot with riser for right trade.  Has the Red Lion Precision handguard on it with one continuous picatinny rail on the top (you can add them on the other three sides, too), Red Lion precision ""compensator"" and the adapter for the barrel so the weapon still locks shut.  Shoots great.  Just the magazines alone are about $525 in today's (normal) prices, the RLP hand guard is $178 with one rail, RLP compensator and adapter are 47.50. Primary Arms Micro Dot is $80 and the riser for it was $40.  I am not including what shipping or tax would be since it's irrelevant.  What I am saying is this is not a run-of-the-mill Sub2K with the nearly 1k in extras and it will not be sold or traded as such.  May consider a cash offer.  Only interested in dealing with legal Missouri residents that can own a weapon."
