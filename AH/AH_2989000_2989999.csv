This was an awesome piece but after putting it together it is too bulky for my all Spikes build. I am letting the lower set go minus the buffer/stock. Spikes limited edition includes a short produced Spider Grip very similar to the Magpul MOE.

I prefer gen 3 but I will consider others. 
For trade I have:

Ruger LCP - LNIB, box, manual, spent factory shell, etc. low round count - approx 70 flawless rounds through this gun with FMJ and JHP. I purchased an extra mag and have ran both mags through it with no issues. LCP was 349.99 +tax (still have receipt). extra mag was 29.99 and Uncle Mike's pocket holster was $12. I have 131 rounds of .380 (108 Winchester white box, 18 CorBon, 5 Hornady Critical Defense). retail on ammo, no mark up is $95. That's over $500 in package deal. 

so around $425ish trade value. I can add cash or ammo (.40S&W, .22lr) to even out a deal.

CMMG AR-15 M4 LE A3 Flat-Top Upper Assembly 300 AAC Blackout 1 in 7"" Twist 16"" Barrel Carbine Gas System WASP Melonite Finish CM with M4 Handguard, Single Rail Gas Block, Flash Hider
Product #: 892556 CMMG #: 30BF85F UPC #: REDACTED23

Product Information
 This CMMG AR-15 M4 LE Upper Assembly is chambered for the exciting new 300 AAC Blackout cartridge and is ready for instant, drop-in use on any standard small pin lower receiver. Perfect for a myriad of different uses from hunting, to personal defense, to competition or just plain fun, the 300 AAC Blackout offers shooters 30 caliber firepower in a standard AR-sized envelope. The M4 LE features a Forged 7075-T6 Aluminum A3 Flat-Top Receiver that is ideal for adding an optic and/or rear iron sight, and comes equipped with a 16"" Medium Contour Barrel with a 1 in 7"" twist for easy stabilization of heavy match projectiles. The upper comes complete with a receiver height single rail gas block, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle and M4-style polymer handguards. Magazine not included. 

The Chrome Moly Steel Barrel is finished inside and out with CMMG's durable Weapons Armament Surface Protection (WASP) Melonite treatment. The WASP Melonite process surface-hardens the metal, extending barrel service life by reducing friction in the bore and lessening bore surface wear. Also referred to as Salt Bath Nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, making for easier cleaning and maintenance. Nitriding converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. 

This 16"" 300 AAC Blackout Upper utilizes the versatile Carbine Length Gas System, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most Subsonic and Supersonic loads, fired from either a Suppressed or Unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure.

The original M1911 was a single- action, semiautomatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun."

Most of these ended up as issued duty guns and the majority of them I've seen have been pretty tired looking. Not this one. I bought this gun from the estate of a collector who usually bought new, shot a range session, cleaned and carefully stored his guns; never to be shot again. This alloy framed stainless slide pistol is nearly new, in it's original box with an unopened tool kit, manual, warranty card and spare magazine. Just like it came from the factory.

I bought this gun, shot a few boxes of ammo through it with my girlfriend and realized she is a much better than I am so I'm selling it before our next argument LOL! In reality I was laid off due to downsizing and my girlfriend says I need a roof over my head more than I need this gun. I was thinking about getting rid of her and keeping the Glock since it's a lot more reliable but like I said, she's a much better shot than I am. 

I will only sell the gun legally. The gun must be transferred by a licensed gun dealer to s buyer who can legally own a handgun. Don't even bother me for anything other than a legal transaction. No checks or credit cards. I will only take cash or paypal payment.

Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic.

With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever.

The Smith & Wesson Bodyguard .380 is also the first in personal protection featuring a built in laser sighting system. Insight is a world leader in the design, development and manufacture of tactical lasers, and they have teamed up with Smith & Wesson to specifically produce an integrated handgun laser for the Bodyguard series. Located in the dust cover of the Bodyguard .380, the laser features both strobe and constant on modes.

The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard.

I build M1 Garands, Carbines, and M1A's for many VFW and Legion members through out the state and I built them well. I am a disabled veteran and soon plan to open a firearms business.  I use only USGI parts or equivalent for initial builds. Top quality parts are not cheap. An unused USGI barrel costs $700-$800 alone, not to mention a to spec receiver and slide. Most of these parts were purchased via Riverbend Armory. I advertise extra made military rifles 2 or 3 times a year on this site.

647,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2989647,"For Sale:  AK-74 with 2500 rounds, mags, accessories, etc.","Fort Campbell, Clarksville, Tennessee","$ 1,500","Listed On: Sunday, May 18, 2014",Rifles,no type,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The Gun:
Bulgarian AK-74 originally put together by Tennessee Guns International on a NoDak Spud receiver with quality K-VAR furniture and a surplus parts kit. It was struggling when I first got it (3-5 malfunctions per mag) so I sent it to a gunsmith who fixed it for me by replacing the barrel and some of the surplus parts. He said they jacked it up during initial manufacture. I don’t know anything but that it works fine now. Since then I’ve put about 2000 rounds through it with no issues. I have cleaned it within hours of every single time I’ve fired it. 
Mods I’ve done/had done to it:
The same gunsmith installed a scope side mount.
I installed a G2 trigger group and stainless steel shepherds crook.
I Dremmelled out a bolt-hold-back in the safety lever so I wouldn’t get yelled at when I was at the range.
Hogue grip (In my opinion, far superior to the Russian grip, which is like holding onto a broomstick. I can throw on a surplus or K-VAR grip if you don’t want it)

Since I got it fixed two years and ~2000 rounds ago this rifle has been 100% without malfunctions. I don’t shoot from a rest at paper much so I can’t give you MOAs or anything, but I could regularly ring a steel target at 200M while standing or prone, and that’s really all you can ask from an AK.

Magazines:
Four (4) Tapco 30-round magazines in various colors
Two (2) Tapco 10-round magaines
One (1) Promag 30-round magazine
Seven (7) surplus 30-round magazines
One (1) is an orange Bakelite (East German?), the rest are polymer (Bulgarian?).  Some have been painted with jungle green or OD Krylon.
One (1) Bulgarian Circle 10 45-round magazine

Some of them have numbers written on them in black or white paint pen so if I had a magazine-related issue I could write down or remember which one was giving me trouble. None of them ever had any issues.

Ammo:
330 7N6 on stripper clips
15 7N6 loose
115 Hornady V-MAX on stripper clips
2 sealed cans of 1080 7n6 (2160 rounds)

2620 total  rounds

Accessories:
30 15-round stripper clips
5 stripper clip spoons
UTG 5th generation double rail scope mount
Buttstock cleaning kit (rusty, never used)
Surplus leather sling
Bayonet with scabbard, frog, etc. (I’ve never been able to get it on the rifle. It’s definitely an AK-74 bayonet, but it might be that I’m just too retarded to make it work.)
Surplus 4-mag pouch
Surplus 2-mag pouch
Oiler
Official Soviet AK Manual

What I want:
I’m looking to switch straight-up from 5.45 to 7.62x39, so I’d like an AK-47. The following features are preferred:

Stamped receiver
G2 trigger
Bolt-hold-back on the safety lever
AK-74-style muzzle brake (will consider AKS-74U-style flash hider or even a slant brake)
Scope side mount
Quality K-VAR or polymer surplus furniture, fixed or side folding. I will consider wood. I will NOT consider fake “tactical” like Tapco, any wire/metal side or under folding stock, or a big cheese grater on the front.

Basically, if you have an Arsenal SLR-107, you have exactly what I want. Otherwise, send me the details and I will let you know.

I also want magazines (metal and polymer surplus preferred) of any and all sizes (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 75, etc.), ammo (steel, brass, FMJ, HP, AP, paper patched, I don’t care), and accessories (bayonet, sling, pouches, stripper clip spoons, etc).

I DO NOT want to split this up since I’m getting out of 5.45mm. Trade value is $1500. I would much prefer to trade it rather than sell it, unless you can make me a sweet offer. I am a KY resident (stationed at Fort Campbell), so we will need to meet at a gun store and get a NICS check to transfer. I have a concealed carry permit."

Up first is a Mint Condition KelTec PF9. The gun spent its whole life tucked away in the glove box of my truck. There are no nicks, scratches, or any other imperfections that I am aware of. I bought this gun new in October and at most put 50 rounds through it. Comes with original hard case, 1 mag, lock, mag butt plate, and manual. Gun is the blued version with black polymer grips. The slide looks shiny but its just the light. 
      Price for PF9 is $240. 

Next is a Brand New Mint Condition Ar15 chambered in 556/223. Has a forged upper from psa with forward assist and dust cover, mid-length gas tube with 8 1/2 inch quad rail. Barrel is 1:8 twist and is not chrome lined. Lower is a polymer New Frontier multi cal lower with a 6 position stock. Will come with 1 20 round mag. Gun has been fired exactly 20 times to test functionality. 
        Price for Ar15 is $650 

Last is my YUGO SKS. Gun is in decent shape and equipped with bayonet, grenade launcher sight, flash suppressor, original wood stock, and sling. Was having an issue cycling Hollow Point ammo and when I did some research, sks's were designed for FJM ammo and not hollow points. I dont have any fmj laying around to test the theory. The fixed mag has been removed to accept 20/30 round mags. Gun will come with 1 Polymer 30rd mag and the original fixed mag. The gun is not numbers matching. 
        Price is $350

I will be willing to sell all 3 for $1100 face to face around Lancaster, PA.  I will not ship. The pistol will need to be transferred.
