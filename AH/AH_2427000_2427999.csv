The rifle is a Gweher 98 Muaser chambered in .300 win mag. The stock is a hand carved roll-over stock. This rifle is fitted with a custom made free floated heavy barrel. This is one amazing rifle! My grandpa had this rifle hand made in the 1950's i believe. He had a very extensive firearm collection that i was lucky enough to inherit. He always said that he had commissioned this rifle to be made to his specifications and it cost him nearly $4000 to do so.  I hate to part with it but i am really looking for something i can use to further my training instead of my collecting.

They are using criminal tactics in order to do so. They will contact you and try to bait you to sell a firearm to a felon who comes along with them but does not mention he is.

Make sure to ask any potential buyer if he is legally allowed to purchase firearms. Ask the questions on the 4473. Make sure to check ID for VA residency for hand guns(long guns can be purchased by out of state buyers but I'd stay away). If these people ask you to find them more guns or if you have more to sell they are HIGHLY LIKELY to be criminal ATF operatives trying to entrap.

To all ATF agents who stumble upon this, know we are watching and conducting counter surveillance on you. The next time you try to entrap someone it might just be you who is actually being fooled. You have been warned."

The only reason I am selling it because I need money to help pay for school. The firearm itself is in mint condition. Took it to the range twice and its been sitting in my safe ever since as I don't have much time to shoot while class is in session. When I do get a chance I tend to take my AR to shoot over my handguns. This gun is as close to brand new as you will find. Price is $700 firm with everything that is pictured. The gun alone is $720 at Cabelas plus each mag was $40 a piece; obviously this is a really good deal. Priced to sell. My number is 630.363.eight-eight-nine-seven."

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semiautomatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ button rifled barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. 

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

The only cosmetic flaw is one that every Sig 556 possesses; Due to the aggressive ejection mechanism of the AK-47 like action cases have a tendency to spin out of the chamber and leave a brass mark on the side of the upper right behind the action. Small, hardly noticeable, you can see it in the picture if you look hard enough, you be the judge. I'm including a bunch of extras with the rifle, you'll be all set up with just one purchase.

Comes with:
Redfield Revolution 2-7x33mm Nitrogen filled variable zoom scope (manufactured by Leaupold and covered under their lifetime guarantee) 
Fixed front Iron Sight
Rotary Diopter rear iron sight
TLR-1 rail mounted tactical light/strobe with pressure pad
2 30 round Pmags
1 30 round factory Sig mag
Magpul foregrip
Single attachment point bungee sling
2 quad rail gaurds

MSRP of the rifle with none of the add-ons is 1399, I'm asking 1400 OBO. Quite a steal, around 500 dollars worth of gear added on, and the added bonus that I can personally guarantee the rifle functions properly, not surprising from a Sig though."

A brief history of the Astra Modelo 400 (1921)

In 1912 the Spanish Armed Forces selected the Gampo-Giro Model 1913 as their standard issue sidearm. In 1920 the decision was made to replace the Gampo-Giro with a new pistol, three designs were considered. The Astra Modelo 400 (1921) was one of these pistols and was selected in August 1921 to be the new standard issue sidearm of the Spanish Armed Forces. It remained the standard issue sidearm until 1946 when it was replaced by the Star Model A.

During the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) both sides utilized the Astra 400. Realizing that the Astra factory would not be able to keep up with demand, the Republican government authorized two additional factories to produce Modelo 400 pistols. The Tarrasa arsenal produced approximately 8,000 pistols under the name F. Ascaso and a private firm in Valencia produced approximately 15,000 pistols under the name Republica Espa�ola. Both of these variants can be identified by their different crest atop the slide and distinctive grip panels; F. Ascaso grips marked F. Ascaso, and Republica Espa�ola grips marked RE.

Total production of genuine Astra 400 pistols was just over 105,000 covering sales to the Spanish Government (Republican/Loyalist), Spanish Government (Nationalist/Rebel), Chilean Navy, Euzkadian Government, Nazi German Government, and individual sales. The year of production for 400s can be determined by both the serial number and Year of Proof markings. Production of the Astra 400 ceased in 1946 and there are no known sources of new parts for them. However, used parts are available from several sources."

For sale is my 14.5"" Mid length gas AR-15. I've built this rifle with performance and quality in mind. I've put less than 300 rounds in this rifle and runs smooth. This rifle has a melonite/nitride barrel to increase reliability and accuracy. Nitride is harder than chrome lined barrels and as accurate as stainless steel barrels. I was able to get sub MOA with match ammo. I guess I was flagged because I said ""sub Moa"" in my previous posting but it's the truth. This rifle has a Nickel Boron Upper receiver and carrier group for increased lubricity (can run dry). The upper receiver has top black coat. Barrel is pin and welded to 16"" with XTC Muzzle brake for fast follow up shots (very low muzzle rise - by my own experience anyhow). This rifle will eat up steel cased ammo - it's the only ammo I've used - I used match ammo only to calibrate my optics.

This is a real posting and if you don't like it, go cry to your mommy and tell her you saw a real scary AR-15. 

For sale is my 14.5"" Mid length gas AR-15. I've built this rifle with performance and quality in mind. I've put less than 300 rounds in this rifle and runs smooth. This rifle has a melonite/nitride barrel to increase reliability and accuracy. Nitride is harder than chrome lined barrels and as accurate as stainless steel barrels. I was able to get sub MOA with match ammo. I guess I was flagged because I said ""sub Moa"" in my previous posting but it's the truth. This rifle has a Nickel Boron Upper receiver and carrier group for increased lubricity (can run dry). The upper receiver has top black coat. Barrel is pin and welded to 16"" with XTC Muzzle brake for fast follow up shots (very low muzzle rise - by my own experience anyhow). This rifle will eat up steel cased ammo - it's the only ammo I've used - I used match ammo only to calibrate my optics.

The package includes a KAC SR-15,a custom, hand made dual action OTF auto knife , pelican case and mags all custom painted to match. This is an awesome package deal that will make all of your friends jealous. The pieces of this package will not be sold separately. SR-15E3 IWS LPR
The KAC Light Precision Rifle (LPR) is the answer for 5.56mm shooters who want a light match system. The LPR utilizes an 18” Match Stainless Steel barrel with a Custom Match chamber, along with our IWS lower. Shooters will find that this weapon system offers a capable Competition System or Precision Perimeter Weapon for the Law Enforcement Sector. 

E3 Enhanced Bolt
The E3 Enhanced Bolt from Knight’s Armament features a number of components designed to make this bolt the most durable and reliable bolt available. It is a proprietary bolt specifically designed for our SR15 and 16 models. The E3 Bolt boasts several features that add to the its overall performance such as the enlarged bolt face, rounded lugs, reduced cam pin, and proprietary extractor and firing pin designs. 

This E3 Bolt is manufactured with an enlarged bolt face that provides more positive engagement in the chamber and lugs which are rounded to help to reduce chipping, cracking and snapping. This strengthened design helps to increase the life of the bolt and ensure a proper seating each time the weapon cycles.

The E3 Bolt’s extractor design is also a unique achievement that helps to provide an extremely reliable component. It’s shaped like a rounded ‘T’ and sometimes referred to as a ‘butterfly’ shape. The pivot point of the extractor is shifted forward to help balance out the extractor and apply constant pressure on the shell which reduces cases of extraction failures. Another strong feature of the unique design of this extractor is the use of two full size extractor springs, as opposed to the standard micro spring. This allows for a reduction of relative compression while the extractor is in motion and provides a failsafe in case one spring fails. The bolt will continue to function properly and afford a user the opportunity to continue with their mission or firing schedule. 

The E3 Bolt is designed with a thinner Cam Pin and Firing Pin whose overall size has been reduced. The thinner Cam Pin allows for a thicker bolt web which is a common failure point in normal bolts. The reduction of the Firing Pin size is to accommodate the thinner Cam Pin.

The full capabilities of the E3 Bolt are realized when exposed to full auto or extremely high cyclic firing rates yet the bolt performs gracefully under casual firing conditions. This component was designed to be exposed to the most stressful and unrelenting conditions and exceed expectations for durability and service life

Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-side bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon’s controls from the non-operating side.

Two-Stage Match Trigger
 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance

The first stage is a ‘no-poundage’ stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle.

This weapon is a limited edition, and i am selling it at a cheaper rate. You can never get this offer anywhere."

Here are some of the new upgrades: 

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it. 

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant. 

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail. 

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet. 

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod. 

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic. 

*More potential investment value as it has the same rollmark as our military gets, with the M107A1 designation. We see with our Knights Armament Rifles, Schmidt & Bender scopes, Remington Defense rifles, etc. that military markings always drive up price further down the road when the rifles are no longer offered. 
Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor. 

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. 

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability. 

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side. 

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. 

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. 

Features: 

Suppressor-ready muzzle brake. Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. Accepts M1913 accessory rails. Thermal cheek guard. Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail. Model:M107A1 Caliber:.50 BMG Operation:Semi-Automatic Rifling Twist:1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm) Magazine Capacity:10 Rounds

I purchased this gun new last year (2012) and it has never even been out of it's original blue plastic case since I have owned, with the exception of being removed to take pictures for this ad.  This 1911 was an impulse buy and I never felt the desire to shoot it after purchasing it.  I now have several new Wilsons on order and need to make some room in the safe before they are finished.

The gun is absolutely perfect, as you would expect from a NIB firearm.  There is not a scrape, scratch or ding anywhere on the pistol with the exception of the unavoidable small scrapes on the side of the grip safety from being held while it was for sale at my local gun shop.  Even the light scrapes on the barrel hood that occur when the slide is racked are almost non-existent.  Everything the gun came with is included in this sale.  That means the 1911 itself, the original blue plastic case, two 7-round Colt mags, gun lock, owner's manual and every single piece of paperwork that was there when I bought it.

Truly a perfect Colt 1911 that would make an excellent Christmas gift for a friend or loved one.  They will appreciate the fact you bought them a brand new pistol and you will have managed to save money off of the original purchase price as well as avoided the taxes and fees associated with buying a gun new from your local gun shop.  I have plenty of high resolution pictures uploaded to Photobucket, just ask and I will email the link.

Must be over 21 years old and able to legally purchase a firearm in the State of Ohio.  Will need to see a valid Ohio driver's license at time of purchase.  CCW holders are preferred and will get first priority but are not required.  Price is $950 cash and I am located just a few miles west of the Akron-Canton Airport.  Again, this is a cash only sale and I am not interested in any trades at this time.  Thanks for looking."

This awesome battle rifle comes in the mighty 7.62x39 caliber and is in unfired condition and comes with 6 30 round mags. If you are looking for an AR platform rifle that has a lot more stopping power than the 223 and don’t want to jump on the .300 AAC BLK bandwagon (that you can’t find ammo for) then you will absolutely love this rifle. This rifle is set-up to shoot the hard primer Russian ammo which is plentiful and cheap and has proven stopping power from deer to humans alike. Take this hunting or keep it for protection either way with the heavy bull barrel you will been astonished at the accuracy this thing produces and the curved mags makes it an eye catcher when you are shooting it. If you are an AK-47 fan and an AR-15/M16 fan then you get the best of both worlds in this rifle. RRA calls this type of rifle the LAR-47 but I like to refer to it as the AR-K since it wasn’t built in 1947. Remove the carry handle and put a good optic on there and extend the range of this rifle even more.

Description

M620V
The compact M620V Scout Light® produces 150 lumens of brilliant white light or 120 milliwatts of invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps; attaches to Picatinny rail with a Swing-Lever™ rail clamp. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M620V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. Comes with a momentary/constant-on pushbutton tailcap switch and a momentary-on pressure-activated tape switch with a 7"" cable that can be positioned where you choose. Also available are optional dual SR pushbutton/pressure pad switches. The M620V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission, the M620V is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-proven and built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black or Desert Tan. 

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.)

This awesome battle rifle comes in the mighty 7.62x39 caliber and is in unfired condition and comes with 6 30 round mags. If you are looking for an AR platform rifle that has a lot more stopping power than the 223 and don’t want to jump on the .300 AAC BLK bandwagon (that you can’t find ammo for) then you will absolutely love this rifle. This rifle is set-up to shoot the hard primer Russian ammo which is plentiful and cheap and has proven stopping power from deer to humans alike. Take this hunting or keep it for protection either way with the heavy bull barrel you will been astonished at the accuracy this thing produces and the curved mags makes it an eye catcher when you are shooting it. If you are an AK-47 fan and an AR-15/M16 fan then you get the best of both worlds in this rifle. RRA calls this type of rifle the LAR-47 but I like to refer to it as the AR-K since it wasn’t built in 1947. Remove the carry handle and put a good optic on there and extend the range of this rifle even more.

Texas  Defender Derringers with a 3 inch barrel in .45 Colt and .410 shot shell caliber. 
The .410 shotgun shell and the rimmed .45 Colt cartridge share the same bore diameter.  Thus, given the right chamber setup, such as what is found in Bond Arms guns, the two different cartridges can be fired interchangeably without adjustment from the same barrels. 
The Texas Defender is a beautiful piece of work, and came with tasteful Texas Star laser engraving and checkering on its Rosewood grips. Bond Derringer grips are designed to distribute recoil over the large surface of the palm of the hand. Also the stainless steel finish is just right; a cross between a bright polish and matte finish.  The  Defender comes with a removable trigger guard, for the traditional derringer look, it can be removed with an Allen wrench(included).
  How many guns with partially rifled barrels can shoot both .410 shotshells and solid .45 Colt ammo with slugs or even CCI .45 Colt shotshells?  Not many.  This allows you to deal with snakes with no legs and the two-legged snake variety just by swapping out loads."

 To keep things legal, I'll only sell to fellow Georgia residents over age 21 (must show ID). I'm a 50 year-old Georgia resident with my Ga. concealed carry permit, so everything is good on my end. I can sell to an Ala. resident, but we'd have to do an FFL transfer. It's not very expensive or difficult to arrange.

I bought it brand new, so I am the only owner thus far.

Made by armalite/eagle arms, I have put about 2500 rounds through this rifle, rifling is still good.  Only problem I have ever had with it is occasionally a round will hit below the feed ramp and stop, but that's because of the magazine getting worn out, not the rifles fault.

looks great, just a few dings you have to look closely to find, it's not a safe queen, I have had it out quite a bit over the years.  Good for 223 and 556

Its an early AR, and really it's what you would get issued in basic training if you went.  Full stock, carrying handle, 300/600 meter iron sights, etc etc

it's a great rifle, but I have an m4 too, so I'm getting rid of this one to fund another project, or maybe just get other toys out of it :)"

Mauser 8mm that has had a lot of work done to it. Boyd's walnut stock stained light black, Pentax 3-9x50 scope, barrel professionally cut to a lil over 17"", glass bedded, free floating barrel, drilled and tapped receiver. Excellent balance. Shoots 1.5""-2"" groups with the right ammo. $400.
Winchester 1300 12ga. 24"" smooth bore. 2 chokes. Modified and full. Choke key, ghost ring fiber optic sights. Very light and the pump action is very smooth and quick. In awesome shape and shot very little. $285.  
Bersa thunder .380cc. (Not pictured) This is the concealed carry model. Shorter barrel, finger groves, low profile three dot sights. One mag, 60 rounds.  IMO the best ccw .380 for size, shooting, accuracy. Disappears on me and I'm 5'11"" 170lbs. $250
I've decided I will only sell or trade these as a lot. Got through Christmas and don't need the cash so bad now. I'm definitely open to gun trades. But only in military calibers. 9mm, .308, .45, .223-5.56, 7.62x39
Thanks! Happy shooting and merry Christmas! And happy new year!"

http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_2_382/220668_.html

The rifle it came off of is just 8 months old and only made it out to the range 5 times. No damage whatsoever to the rail - only flaw is some paint visible on the BOTTOM rail from the VFG I had attached to it (circled in red in the pic below). The paint could come off with some elbow grease, I'm sure. Includes all hardware necessary to mount on your rifle including the barrel nut, bolt up system, bolts, and rail. The lucky buyer will also receive a great condition Daniel Defense front sight base included (but no taper pins - lost them).

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.

Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

Norman, REDACTED, 300 OBO

Hey everyone,
This listing is for a SCCY CPX-2 Bi-Tone 9mm. It has had less than 50 rounds down the pipe and has given me zero issues. It will come with the gun itself, and two magazines with the pinky extensions on them. Only selling because I already have a compact 9mm or I would keep her. Great shooting little gun. Barely bigger than my PF9 and holds more rounds! Also, for the right offer I can include ammo or a case for it. Please shoot any offer to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Will need to meet in or very close to norman due to my time constraints."
