Multi Use Monocular/ Mini-14 Gen3 L3 Autogated Night Vision Monocular
The Multi Use Monocular is a fantastic combination of versatility, performance, and price. The MUM (also known as the MiNi-14) is also the lightest night vision monocular on the market. Developed as an alternative to the US Military issue AN/PVS-14, these units offer extreme operational performance and are waterproof down to 60 feet. The unique MUM system is powered by a single 3V CR123 battery, but can be fitted with an included adapter to run off a single standard AA. While not compatible with standard PVS14 accessories, the MUM system has its own compliment of gear that makes it adaptable to any mission requirement.

These MUM units feature an L3 Gen 3 Autogated image intensifier tube, producing ultra clear images and are currently in use with elite Law Enforcement and Military units. The innovative housing is extremely robust, yet lightweight, making the MUM the most comfortable NV device to wear over extended periods. A built-in IR illuminator increases image clarity in low light situations.

Export of Night Vision Equipment or related accessories (such as manuals) is strictly regulated by the US Department of State in accordance with the guidelines of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). It is a major crime to ship or carry US manufactured night vision devices outside the borders of the United States, punishable by fines and prison sentences. Ignorance of these regulations will not hold up in court. By purchasing night vision equipment from TNVC, you attest that you will not attempt to export or carry this night vision equipment outside the borders of the United States. Also, it illegal to allow a non-US Citizen to look through US Gen3 Night Vision Devices, even on US soil. Again, this is a crime punishable by fines and prison sentences.

I love this gun but I have made the decision to stick with one caliber so my .40 stuff has to go. I also have 400 rounds of high quality hollowpoint ammo and 100 rounds of fmj to add in as well for a total of 500 rounds.

Gun has run excellently, I've just realized that I prefer to carry my 357mag SP101 over a compact 1911. 

Gun is completely stock and as it was when purchased new, with the exception that I tossed the crappy factory ACT-mag and replaced it with a Wilson Combat 47OX 7 round officer magazine. I have 3 additional Metalform flush fit 6 round magazines and a Galco King Tuk IWB holster that has light use.

The gun has light holster wear around the leading edges. Other than that it is in great condition, has been well maintained. Always cleaned and lubed after being shot. I only use Tetra Gun Grease for smooth operation. About 500 rounds down range, with a fresh Wolff gun springs 22 pound recoil spring and new firing pin spring installed last week. 

I paid $639+$20(ffl) for the gun, plus $65 for the King Tuk, $35 for the Wilson Combat mag and $50 for the 3 Metalform mags. Over $800 invested.

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style

Will throw in (unattached) third party rail-mount front and rear sights, two 30-round magazines, and one malfunctioning 75-round drum magazine.  (The follower broke off the spring assembly, I don't trust my welding skills to make it functional again.)

Will also include a case of ammunition (probably about 400 rounds, in standard style ammo can.)  Note, this ammunition is cheap stuff, and jams after 3-5 rounds on this rifle, and ~10 rounds on an otherwise known-to-be-perfect Russian SKS.  So not even asking anything for the ammunition.

I assembled it myself from bare parts purchased separately.  It could probably use a complete strip and reassembly, though, the fore grip seems a bit loose.

Target pictured was the first firing after assembly - 100 yards on stock unadjusted iron sights."

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style"

I've got a collection of Harley belt buckles and matching hat/vest pins for most of them. About 20 years old. Below is a list of them individually and if they have matching pin or not. 
A couple of these have been on Ebay for $300.00 each.
This entire collection is worth somewhere between $800.00 and $1,500.00. It would just take the right buyer that wants them to get the full $1,500.00.
I don't know how to find that buyer. I don't know what to expect here, but I'm not giving them away, I'll say that up front. They are all new, never worn/used.

These were a gift but I have no use for them, I don't wear a belt. Had them a few years, want them gone.
Someone makes a LEGIT trade offer, they get them all.

Shoot More, Pay Less With .22 LR Ammo For Practice

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.
Durable Melonite QPQ Finish for increased wear resistance.

Recommended ammunition:

For sale is my 640KA Chuckster .22 mag bolt action rifle, it comes with one 5 round magazine, sling mounts and leather sling. 

Stock is American walnut that has been refinished in a hand rubbed oil finish. The gun is amazing considering it was made during 1960-1968 (no serial #) The gun is rated at 95%+ original finish with some minor bluing loss in normal rub areas. 
The gun has a 24"" barrel and is an absolute tack drive. It has dove tail scope mounts on top of the receiver. 
Its a very nice rifle for long range shooting with a 22. I had my fun with it shooting golf balls at 50-75 yards with it and target practice at 100 yards. 
I'm asking $250.00 for the rifle, these are ones you don't see for sale everyday.
Firm price, cash sale FTF in the Hampton Roads area, may entertain trade offers. FYI, reasonable offers do not include 1/2 price requests, or offers way below $200.00. Do your research on this rifle, most are selling for $300.00 and my asking price is more than reasonable for this gun.

This is the best adjustable sniper stock on the market, fully adjustable for cheek rise as well as length of pull. Works with any Mil-spec AR15 lower receiver. Installation is super easy and takes just a few minutes. Features a bottom picatinny rail for mounting a bipod and sling mounts on both sides for ambidextrous use of a sling.

Manufacturer's Info: The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

Comes with the original trigger hardware and the receipt for $195 & extras from Vanek. Also has a heavy, tungsten guide rod assembly, reducing recoil significantly; original guide rod assembly included as well. It has the ""plug"" installed on the grip for smoother magazine feeds. Comes with a total of 5 17 rd magazines, a 5.11 tactical holster w/paddle & belt attachments, an El Paso Saddlery leather holster & a Fobus 2-mag holster. Also the original box and everything that it came with it from Glock. I've put around 350-400 flawless rounds through it & I never have the time to shoot it anymore so I'm looking for something that I can carry. I have a valid Ohio concealed carry license, FYI. The Glock is kept immaculately clean and shows no wear whatsoever. I'm looking to trade, not pressed to sell, but I suppose $850 could take it. What I'm really looking for is a QUALITY, CONCEALABLE firearm & I'd prefer it come with, at a minimum, a concealment holster & ammo. I have plenty of quality hollow point ammunition to trade for yours, so it'll be fair. I don't want $700. I don't want $800. I'll take a revolver of less value with the extras mentioned so long as there's cash involved to even up the trade. I'm mainly looking for a quality, concealable revolver, like a S&W or a snubby Colt, or something comparable to those items. By ""concealable"" I don't mean a 4"" barrel; 2 1/2 or less for revolvers, please. I'd also be interested in quality, compact/sub-compact 1911's or 9mm pistols with the aforementioned accessories. Maybe you have something of equal value that I'm not even considering, so feel free to offer. If you see the ad, it's still available. If you're considering offering cash in the amount of less than $850, don't waste either of our time."

Stock:           Tapco 6 position adjustable butstock
Lower:         DSA ZM4 billet
Upper:	 A-4 flattop upper billet
Barrel:          16""    5.56/.223 1x7 M4 CHROME MOLY 
Handguard: Samson Evolution 11” Free-float aluminum handguard. 
Flash Hider: Yankee Hill Phantom
BCG:           Millspec Complete Bolt Carrier Group	
Gas Block: Low Profile gas block

I have personally touched every single piece that has gone into this gun as I have built it (don’t worry I have built MANY reliable ARs before) so if you would like to know anything else please feel free to ask.

I just have my test TRU GLO red dot sight on it in the pictures. It does not come with it. However if you would like it since it’s already sighted in at 50 then I will throw it in for an additional $50.
This will also come with the following
(2) 30rd mags.
What ammo I have left… I believe 30 or so rounds
Since I am trying to get this sold for my wife’s gift then I will be willing to REASONABLY negotiate. That does not mean lowball me that means work with me and I’ll work with you.
I will meet locally or I will ship to an FFL for you to pick up from (you cover shipping) 
ANY questions please feel free to contact me.
Contact me by email, text or call but text is preferred.
Phone: four one seven-766-1zero3zero
Note: any blotchiness you see on the gun is not the finish. I recently oiled it."

It's common knowledge that black rifles require constant companionship to lead a full and healthy life.

Have you considered adoption?

This poor semi-automatic rifle is looking for a good home. It's originally from the mean streets of Romania where it spent a hardened life surviving on copper-clad 7.62x39 bullets and abusive powder. It landed in America with nothing more than cosmoline in it's pockets and a gleam of hope in its barrel. It was once fostered by Century Arms, where it was tortured and branded as a WASR 10/63. 

 Give this rifle the home that it deserves.The adoption fee is a mere $775, to ensure that it does go to a good, providing home.

This 130gr., hard cast, 327 Federal load, is the direct result of customer request for such a load. It is designed primarily as an 'outdoor' load as it penetrates deeply and does not expand. It will perforate a large bear's skull and will also serve well for any application that requires very deep penetration. This load utilizes flash suppressed powder, so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to fire in low light situations.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses stock over-the-counter firearms to determine our published velocities, so the shooter will know what to expect in the real world. The industry wide practice of using extra-long laboratory test barrels, that generate unrealistic and exaggerated velocities, is dishonest to the customer. The below velocities were fired from my personal stock, out-of the-box revolvers.

This is a Kowa 88mm High Performance TSN-884 Spotting Scope with Kowa TE-10Z 20-60X Zoom Eyepiece, and Gitzo Carbon 6X Tripod for sale or trade. Asking price is $2,200 cash or trade value of $2,500. This is about a $3,100 value.  I would consider a trade for a Springfield M1a standard with a Leupold Mk4 scope, or a Remington 700 SPS with the same Mk4 or rifle of similar type.

The 884 features the pure fluorite crystal “PROMINAR” 88-mm objective lens, the Kowa TSN-884 offers simply unsurpassed light throughput for the brightest, aberration free images. Despite the huge lens, the durable magnesium frame helps limit the weight of the Kowa TSN-884 to less than 54 oz. Kowa’s inner focus system shortens the prism box on the TSN-884 scope, giving it a compact 13.5 inch length. The Kowa TSN-884 spotting scope features a dual focus system with separate knobs for coarse and fine focusing, an eyepiece locking mechanism, and a tripod mount that adapts to accommodate either a 1/4- or a 3/8-inch mounting screw. With its superb optics and Kowa’s special adapters, the TSN-884 makes a great digiscoping rig. The Kowa TSN-884 scope is completely waterproof and nitrogen-purged to be internally fog-proof. 

The Gitzo tripod features a 6X carbon fiber tube, made of a unique structure of 6 crossed layers that maximises rigidity, vibration absorption and lightweight performance. 6X tube has a high density structure made of top quality ultra-thin carbon fibers (7mm or 0.007 mm). Built-in Anti Leg Rotation is now a feature of the whole carbon fiber range. Tripod also has a Gitzo G1177M series 1 Center Ball Head."

Chuck Hawks comment about this gun....."" In fact, its velocity is solidly in the realm of high velocity centerfire cartridges. In a sense, Winchester's new .17 Super Mag completes the range of .17 caliber varmint cartridges that began (commercially) in 1971 with the .17 Remington.""

I have one of my own, and it is one of the sweetest shooting rifles I have ever fired.

Lots of character! 6 cylinder 3VZE engine ensures startling performance (well, startling to the people you pulled out in front of. . .) with fuel economy that is simply incredible(ly low. . ..). Original paint (well, most of it at least. . .) and cold AC.
OK, here's the low down -- I've got a high mileage (229K) 4WD 4-Runner for sale. This has the common 6 cylinder engine in that is dead nuts reliable but it sure isn't gonna win you any prizes at the track, though it will pull you out of some nasty mud holes if need be. Top end was re-built about 50K miles ago - I am getting an intermittent check engine light on it.
The paint looks like a typical 18 year old Toyota -- clear coats gone on the horizontal surfaces & it's thinned down to rust (surface, no perforation) on a few places on the roof. Interior is worn, but not absolutely skanked out -- Again, this an 18 year old much loved truck. Decent stereo with a 2004 era Pioneer head unit. This was one of the higher end units at the time & is set up for XM radio (No service at this time).
Tires are in pretty good shape with well over 50% tread remaining. Running gear is solid, I've used the 4 wheel capability to get in and out of some holes at the ranges I shoot at. AC works.
For this classic piece of mid 90's Japanese technology I'm asking $2500. Catch me between paydays & you may find this price to be negotiable. Offer me something that goes bang & we may consider a lower price. Please do not offer chickens, goats, your daughter, wife or girlfriend, or the stranger you found at the truck stop. Definitely not looking to trade for other vehicles (I've got to many at this time. . .).

Purchased because it has an adjustable draw length - no need for new cams or modules and the Center Pivot model Captain, is ""self-pressing"" just backing out the limb bolts approximately 3"" relaxes the bow so you can even remove and replace the string and cables with out needing a bow press. One of the best features of the Captain is the draw length adjustability of the bow without the need for additional draw-length specific modules. The Rotating Mod system makes this feature possible. By simply rotating the module clockwise or counter-clockwise, your draw length can be adjusted in 1/2"" increments. Reason for selling. The bow has 60 to 70 limbs, thought I could pull 60+, but even with the smooth draw cycle, after 5 shots I cannot pull this weight safely, so have gone back to my old bow with a 50lb draw-weight. My loss could be your gain. I also have a new ($100) RipCord rest installed, as well as a TruGlow pep site with different size inserts to match your sight ring, and of course all of the manuals etc.

It has a few scratches but overall I would call it good condition.  I bought it to take it dove hunting this year, shot a box through it to practice and then ended up just taking my 12ga. It has the bird plug, and two chokes a modified and a improved that comes with it. It will shoot 3inch shells. Never had any problems with it and cleaned it after I shot it. The best feature about this gun is it only weighs 5.5 pounds. Easy to carry and easy to shoot.
