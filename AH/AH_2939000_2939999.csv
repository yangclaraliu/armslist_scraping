This model has the 10” bull barrel and target sights, it is in very nice condition and bluing looks great, the only marks are a couple right around the chamber, but nothing serious, just want to be as accurate as I can. Not in a hurry to get rid of this one as it will only go up in value, but I have a few other .22lr pistols and rifles, so putting this up to see what is out there.  Who needs a .22lr rifle when you have this beauty, if you look at 22lr ballistics, the 10"" barrel gives you close to the same velocity as the 16""-19"" rifle length barrels.  This will allow you to get rifle like performance from a pistol.  You can also have it tapped for a scope for longer target shooting or varmint hunting.

I'm looking to sell my AR-15 I just built. It has Aero Precision upper and lower receivers. The upper receiver has the mil spec Laser engraved T markings. (Btw Aero Precision manufactures Spikes Tactical receivers as well as some other companies) It has a Ice Arms mid-length 16in 5.56 NATO M4 contour 1X8 twist Stainless Steel barrel. A YHM Phantom 5 port flash hider. A Ice Arms M16 Bolt Carrier Group with a 9310 MPI Bolt. A BCM Gunfighter extended large charging handle. A PSA mil spec LPK. All Magpul MOE furniture (Stock, Grip, Handguard). Mil spec A2 F marked clamp on front sight base. Dual point sling attachment plate. A flip up rear sight. This is a quality rifle that I've only shot a few times and it performed fantastically with great groups. The round count is 60 rounds through it. This would be considered above a standard mil spec rifle. I'm looking to get $1200 for it, especially with what i have tied up in it. I don't have to sell the rifle, so please no low balling. I live in Poplarville, Ms."

Please no hate mail from you Springfield guys. Custom builders tend to agree with me on the issue of receiver quality. The internals were replaced with match grade parts. Then I ordered the $800 Sage EBR mod 0 chassis system in coyote tan and waited for 6 months for it to become available. This version was very hard to come by. After it came in I ordered a Sadlak quick detach scope mount which is the best on the market. I also threw a claymore break on the end of the barrel.

Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics, such as distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and fore-end in place of conventional checkering, complement the Nova’s innovative engineering. Nova Pump incorporates its polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova will handle anything from target loads to 3½"" magnums.
To dampen the recoil of today’s super-heavy magnum loads, the Nova 12-gauge is specially designed to accept a Benelli recoil reducer. Black Synthetic stock, the Benelli Nova is the most versatile pump-action shotgun ever made — and just when everyone thought the pump gun couldn’t be improved.

Standard chokes included with the gun: IC, M, F.
Push-Button Shell Stop, The button on the underside of the forend activates a shell stop, allowing a chambered shell to be removed without releasing rounds from the magazine.
Grooved Grip Surface, Checkering is for wood stocks, but the Benelli Nova Pump use distinctive grooves that give both an unmatched gripping surface and an unforgettably distinctive look.

I planned on making it my summer carry gun, but my plans have changed. It comes standard with sig night sights, a 6 round flush mag, and 7 round extended mag. All paperwork and stuff that came with it when I bought it new. My change in plans = your gain. I also have a Remora type Sticky holster that is good for Pocket or IWB carry. If you would like that just add 10 bucks to the price. Thanks for looking.

This is a super nice gun.  I'm looking to trade this gun for a very nice Semiauto CCW, something along the lines of a Sig 938.  I would also consider a couple of guns, one being a CCW style, like a Shield, LC9, Bodyguard, etc, along with another Semiauto, Semiauto is really all I'm after for this trade.  Just from quickly looking around, it would appear that the value is around $650-ish, but I'm not looking for a cash sale.  Not looking for anything that has been beat to death, and no High Points at all, nothing that isn't quality, send me some offers."

This Muzzle Brake works on .375 / 9mm and smaller caliber rifles with 5/8-24 threads.

There are 25 holes facing the sides and up, which keeps dirt or dust from blowing into your field of view when lying prone.

Use for target practice, plinking, tactical, competition, hunting, Etc.

Don't forget the crush washer.

ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

The cocked-and-locked SAO trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places.

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-132
Possession of a handgun by a person under the age of 18 years

Georgia law only covers possession of handguns by those 
""Under"" the age of 18 with varying circumstances, as well as those 21+. That means a person 18-20 can legally ""posses"" a handgun.


O.C.G.A. § 16-11-101.1
Furnishing pistol or revolver to person under the age of 18 years

This law relates to the sale of handguns in Georgia through a private party (you and I) sale. Once again, it only refers to those ""under"" the age of 18. The rest of the laws that apply to the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in Georgia are federal laws which only apply to an FFL or manufacturer.

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-126
Having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons; license requirement; exceptions for homes, motor vehicles, and other locations and conditions; penalties for violations

A person of age 18-20 is treated as an adult who does not have a Georgia Weapons Carry License, and must abide by those same rules. Those rules, in short, mean that the handgun may not leave the confines of my home (property of said home included), motor vehicle, and/or place of business"

Asking $125 or best offer.

This Versa Mec is similar to the ""600"" and ""700"" models. The press is already set up for 2 ¾"" shells with AA hulls, WAA12 wads, #28 powder bushing, and 1 1/8th oz of shot. I have loved this formula for sporting clays thus far and the press has never crimped a bad round on me.

My dad used this one after I bought it and was so impressed he went out and bought one himself! I can always use his so I am selling this one. It is in good condition, a little dirty from powder residue, but it functions flawlessly. This whole setup, including the universal bar, sells new for $250. I know why I got into reloading- to save money and have fun! This is a great option to do just that, especially with the way prices have been lately.

Includes:
1X Versa Mec press, single stage, multiple stations
1X 1-1/8 oz, red charge bar (For lead shot)
1X 1 oz, black charge bar (For steel shot)
1X Universal shot/powder charge bar (For lead shot)
3X Shot/powder bottles (One marked for steel shot)
3X powder bushings (Clays powder range- 28, 29, 32, and )
1X Primer catch bin
1X Particleboard base (pre drilled, not shown)

I'm sure I'm not alone in that regard, especially in these days. Anyway,this is a 2010 model Rem 700 in 223 cal. It is in excellent shape and what you would call a ""safe queen"". It has had little use except to the range on rare occasions which is due to my health & financial situation. (Acute Rheumatoid Arthritis). This piece has had some professional work done on it which made a good rifle into the BEST shooting rifle I’ve ever owned. It shoots far better than I am capable of for sure. It is a true ""tack driver"". I have put one round over the other on occasion, but you get my meaning. (Even a blind squirrel finds a nut once in awhile). You can hit a dime sized target at 100 yds with no problem whatsoever. The model 700 has a reputation for being the most accurate rifle you can buy right out of the box. Well this rifle takes it to the next level. This can be attributed to the barrel being free floated and glass bedded. The difference before and after the work had been done was amazing. I've never owned a rifle that was capable of this kind of accuracy!The trigger is another hi point (Jewell), you will feel NO movement in it at all. Currently set at 3 1/2 lbs its almost scarey, it breaks so clean. I have shot 10 or so boxes of shells through it.The gun is barely broken in good really. The Scope is a BSA Platinum 6 X 24 X 44 w/ standard cross hair that is good out to 400yrds. I understand BSA isn’t the quality of say a Nikon or Leupold scope but it is their top of the line model. It retails for around $139-$149. You’ll find it to be more than adequate.The laminated stock is a thing of beauty, no scratches or nicks. The satin bluing on the heavy 26in varmint barrel (1 12’ twist) is flawless. You want to go out and pop a yote, brush wolf, pdogs, groundhogs? If you can see him, you can kill him, simple as that. 200-300 yard shots are a piece of cake. 400 or more is doable if your a good shot. I'm not that steady anymore, too crippled up. If you are really interested, please

If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that gets even smoother the more you shoot it.

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring the Spike’s Spider logo.

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip.

This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower.
