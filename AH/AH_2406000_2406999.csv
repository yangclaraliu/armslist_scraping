I'd be surprised if this has more than 250 rounds through it. To give you an idea of how this firearm has been cared for: anytime it has been used it has been carefully cleaned afterwards (and I doubt it's been to the range more than 5 times).

The Mosquito is 90% of the size of the P226 and is a great gun. Easy (and inexpensive) to shoot. 

I have a friend who had never really fired a handgun before who was going through her CCW training course. With barely any practice (less than 10 rounds) she qualified with this firearm.

Why did I buy it? It's a Sig Sauer. Plus, a 22LR. And, it has a thumb safety (important feature for me: I know, lots of people don't use them and I understand). However, I haven't purchased any other Sig Sauer's and am now standardizing on Ruger's (and the Ruger thumb safeties flip the opposite direction).

You can see in the photos that the gun is in mint condition. Included with the gun:
- 2x 10-round Sig factory magazines
- A Fobus paddle holster
- The original case
- Registration card, user manual
- Ruger gun lock
- Spare recoil spring (the reason many semi-automatic 22's have a reputation for not reliably feeding ammunition is the varying quality of 22LR ammunition - to give you an idea of Sig Sauer quality: they knew that is what causes issues with semi-automatic 22's and included two springs with the Mosquito --- a stiffer one that works best with higher-powered/premium 22 ammo, and a looser spring that works better with bulk/regular 22 ammo). Speaking of how the firearm handles 22 ammo: it's done quite well, and I just use bulk 22 (not the higher-powered 22). I don't know if I have the stiffer or looser recoil spring in the firearm.

I'm listing it at $380 but would consider a $360 offer."

It is a Springfield receiver and by no means matching.  It does have an old import mark on the muzzle end of the barrel.  It does fire fine....cycles and ejects fine.  If I had to guess I would say it was an old ""rack grade"" or something.  The stock is a newer Boyds American Walnut.  The barrel is starting to get tired...but still shoots fairly well.  I can honestly say I would have no problems keeping it...but pistols interest me more.  That being said, I would be interested in a trade for a good 9mm for target shooting.  So, no compacts or sub-compacts.  Prefer large frame pistols.  Ideally I would really like the get a Witness Match in 9mm again....but open to others.  Run it by me you never know.  I would also consider trades of a 9mm and say a .22 rifle or combination of pistols....but definately want a semi auto 9mm.  Oh, and some may say this is blasphemy, but no Glocks.  They just don't do it for me :)"

Winchester M-1

This is a very nice rifle with good finish that I would rate at 80-90% overall. I believe the finish to be original across the rifle. The barrel is WRA and gauges a 1.5 or so at the throat. I don’t have a muzzle gauge. The rifling is very strong in the barrel. The chamber face is not parkerized. 

I bought this rifle as-is except for the stock that is on it. The stock that it came with was a beater DAS stock and I don’t have any clue why what looks to be a nearly complete WRA rifle wound up with the wrong wood on it but this stock is nicer and has good grain. It is not a WRA stock. 

I can’t remember all the ins and outs of Garands anymore so please email me if I get something wrong or if you have a question.

I believe all the parts are WRA except for the stock, its hardware and the hammer is an SA -2.

The op rod is WRA and is uncut with the angled bolt housing outer face. The follower rod is a short fork. The gas system is all WRA I believe and it has the early plug. The front sight is wider than an SA and so I think it is WRA. The safety is a WRA -4 flat-top. The bolt is WRA -1. If I remember right the rear hand guard of a WRA has a small indent where the op rod angles under and this has that. The bands appear to be WRA. The hammer spring plunger does not have ears so I am not certain that that is original or not. 

Like I said, please ask any questions you might have and let me know if I made a mistake on any of the identifications.

You can see an album of photos of the Winchester at this link:
http://s200.photobucket.com/user/hzamar/library/WRA%20M1?sort=3&page=1

I am asking $2200 for the rifle. I am located in Glendale, AZ if anyone is local and would like to see it in person.

Thanks,

Bought it new a few weeks ago, have only put around 300 rounds through it. Shoots well like all glocks do. I bought a Ghost 3.5 trigger connector for it which considerably smooths out and lightens the trigger pull, however it caused some reliability issues so I put the stock connector back in it. Will come with the gun if you're able to do some slight fitting on it to get it working properly. Also comes with 4 magazines as well as the box and everything that comes in it.

Buyer must have LTC, all laws will be followed. Email me with questions or offers. Thanks for looking!"

You cant find the tactical styles like this in stores. I had to buy it stock and wait for back order parts to arrive but was well worth the effort. This shotgun is designed to be the fastest pump shooter in its class. Unlike the Remington and Mossberg, the Winchester Super x Pump allows you to retract the pump action just after pulling the trigger. The other two names have a safety that makes you first release the trigger before the pump is released. This allows you to use the momentum of the blast to pump it allowing you to fire it very quickly. Watch youtube videos and check out the main site. 
I also have 30 or more 12ga 2 3/4 inch boxes of ammo I will sell at a great discount of $2.00/box. Various types including buckshot, birdshot, and rifled slug.

Called the “Poor Man’s P226″, It offers less weight, looks great and shoots as well as any $700 gun you can name.  Accuracy is what you’d expect from Sig. And for a $475.00 price tag, that’s pretty damned good.  I really like the way it feels, and it takes down much like a 1911. It's a touch top heavy thanks to the metal slide and polymer grip, but it works. And if you don’t like it there are always replacement grips available.  Overall for the money, this might be one of the best handguns on the market.  In fact, this sexy SIG made the top 20 list for the best selling guns this year.  It is definitely my go-to recommendation for first time 9mm handgun owners.  Sig Sauer quality with a sticker price below  Glock’s “perfection.”   $425.00 Cash.

This optic is brand new (2013 manufacture and never used). I had originally purchased it to replace my Eotech XPS2 because I wanted a KISS optic that didn't run on batteries or have electronics of any kind. Turns out that I have an astigmatism in my right eye that isn't apparent with the Eotech but comes out with this optic and I am not willing to switch to shooting predominately left handed to overcome this. My loss (and visit to the optometrist) is your gain. I will ship this optic, buyer pays shipping costs for method of your choice. Asking $400 firm, no trades please (MSRP is $563 for this optic). Call or text me at (620) 2 THREE five - SiX 9 1 EiGhT

From the manufacturer:

The M21 Reflex sight provides constant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the M21 was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat.

M Revision - Latest Model available

It is battle proven, reflexive to use, deadly accurate, and totally reliable.

The M21 features a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open.
Reticle illumination is achieved by a protected fiber optic light collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The M21 is night vision compatible.

This reflex sight offers shooters the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open. It is also designed to work with a magnifier.

The M21 is the optic of choice for the Israeli Defense Forces."

I will accept Cash ONLY, NO TRADES, and please do not send lame offers - I won't even respond to them.  Below is some specs regarding the FN Scar:

Experience the long-range accuracy, downrange power, exceptional reliability and match winning versatility of the FN SCAR® 17S, the semi-auto only version of the U.S. Special Operations Command’s newest service rifle. Chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO (308 Win.), the FN SCAR® 17S features a free-floating, cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel with hardchromed bore. Fully-ambidextrous operating controls instantly adapt the FN SCAR® 17S to any user or any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of scopes, electronic sights, tactical lights and lasers. The telescoping, side-folding polymer stock is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull, making it ideal for Heavy Metal 3-Gun matches."

I have plugged it in, tested it and applied the updates from online so you won't have to do that.

I do also have a lot of dvd movies, some blu ray, if anyone is interested. Will sell them for cheap or will add them in trade. Perhaps 50 movies? A lot of sci-fi stuff.
