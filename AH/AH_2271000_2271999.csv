Never jams and is practically indestructible . . . more reliable than Glock.  Heavy stainless steel frame keeps recoil soft and permits use of +P ammunition.  5"" barrel ensures outstanding accuracy.  8+1 capacity, fixed sights, no MIM parts, very low round count.

This pistol is in very nice shape.  A few minor handling marks and holster wear, but no scratches or dings. Sights were touched up with Hi-Viz paint, but that comes right off if you don't like it.  Does not have original box or papers, but comes with a gun case, an extra factory magazine, 50 rounds of Ranger T-series +P law enforcement ammo, 25 rounds of +P Golden Saber ammo.

Asking 500 cash for everything.  WILL NOT SHIP.  Might consider swapping for a P230, or trading towards a P220 or ambi 1911.  Great pistol that belonged to my Dad, but just a bit bigger and heavier than I'm comfortable with.  Was shooting very tight groups at the range last week.  This is a great 45 for recoil sensitive shooters, and fits smaller hands fairly well.  Rubber Hogue grips can be installed for greater comfort if desired, and factory mags are widely available for under 30 dollars each.  These pistols run perfectly and never break or jam.

It was going to be a 3-gun rifle originally but I had another by the time I finished it, and now I am changing over to 7.62 NATO rifles mostly so it is no longer needed and I would like to put a little cash back into my account. The rifle is built on a Del-Ton lower with most of the upper parts being from Palmetto State Armory, with the exception of the rail from Yankee Hill and the furniture from Blackhawk. The barrel is truly free-floated and has a 1:9 twist rate at 16"". It is a great rifle for the money and I hate to see it go but I need the cash more. It has only had one magazine fired through it that I shot as a function test once it was complete. Price is $900 as it is seen in the picture, also included will be a Grippod bipod/foregrip that is not pictured. Thanks for looking. Face to face deals only as I do not ship, and must sign bill of sale."

Auction includes all three items!

-Blade tech nano holster is in great shape worn for two weeks. This is a right handed IWB in the waist band holster for a full size government 5 inch 1911. Have had tons of holsters and Blade Tech is by far the best IWB on the market. Small, thin, light, comfortable, while being extremely strong and durable. Sweat will not get through this and it won't creek like leather. 

-Bianchi 18796 Triple Threat double mag pouch for single stack mags. Work for around six weeks in overall great condition.




Our Nano IWB holster is one of our most popular concealment holsters. It is ultra-thin, being constructed of the same tough materials we use on all our Classic handmade, custom and semi-custom holsters. It is made from our thinner .080 material, resulting in a narrower more comfortable and concealable holster with a very minimal print signature. The “Pull the Dot” snap IWB belt loops are adjustable for FBI Cant and Straight drop carry and can be adjusted for belts from 1 ¼” to 1 ¾”. On the Nano we have eliminated the second tension screw reducing the Nano’s side profile while still keeping our tension adjustment feature. The Nano will not collapse making re-holstering sure and easy. It features a full length sweat guard to prevent pistol to body contact while still providing a full combat grip. The Nano is another great choice for concealed carry over long periods of time. Buy one today and CARRY CONFIDENT!

Dual IWB loops with secure ""Pull the Dot"" snaps that are situated a wider distance apart for increased stability, especially when situated over a belt loop. The snap feature also allows for convenient and easy on & off
IWB loops adjustable for FBI Cant & Straight Drop carry as well as for belts from 1 ¼” – 1 ¾”.

""Back in 1980, Bill Wilson asked me to test some of his new Wilson-Rogers .45 magazines. He explained that he felt they had solved the problem of cracked feed lips and that their new magazines fed much more reliably than any others on the market. Well, it's 30 years later now and I'm still using some of those original 6 prototype magazines that Bill sent me… Through the years they have proven without a doubt to be the most reliable and durable 1911 magazines on the market. I have personally used specimens from various production runs through the years and have yet to see any quality variation or have one let me down in any way. They are my first and only choice as well as the choice of the elite special forces units I train. I trust my life to a Wilson Combat® pistol and 8-round Wilson magazines; so can you…""

I have for sale here a nicely upgraded Bushmaster AR-15. This is the ultra-lightweight Carbon 15 model, 14.5"" M4 Style Barrel with 1/9 Twist, with Izzy Brake permanently pinned to make it a legal 16"" length‚ with the picatinny riser as well. It's the V1 Carbon 15, which is unique for not having a forward assist or dust cover. There's probably less than a handful around the country for sale--these are HARD TO FIND!

This AR is so lightweight its almost hard to believe its real, the Bushmaster website says its just 5.5 lbs. It's extremely accurate and reliable, and has amazing reviews from professionals and actual owners.

I have upgraded the grip to a UTG ergonomic grip, and added a UTG ergo foregrip as well. The boring stock round handguard was changed to a top-quality carbine length quad rail by Omega Tactical, with Magpul ladder rail covers.

The upper, bolt carrier group, and charging handle are all original Bushmaster.

The lower, trigger group, and all parts are also all original Bushmaster.

6 Point Collapsible Stock

CARBINE LENGTH QUAD RAILConstructed Out of T7A Aluminum with a Triple Hard Coat Anodized Bead Blast Finish.

Mil-spec military 2-point sling

3 30round magazines (1 metal, 2 polymer)

Can also include a box of PMC 5.56, so you can stop by the range on the way home if you can't wait.

Lastly, if this is your first AR-15, I'm OK with spending a little while showing you the basic functions and how to break it down for cleaning, including disassembly and reassembly of the bolt carrier group.

**The optic is not included in the price** The sight is a Hakko Panorama MK-III, a top-quality optics manufacturer in Japan that has recently been acquired by Tasco. The sight features both a red and green dot reticle, made from solid aluminum and extremely rugged--not some cheap Chinese knockoff like you see all over eBay. Dust proof, waterproof, fog proof. This one was made in Japan and sits on top of a riser so that you're able to use either the optic or the iron sights at the same time. It retailed for $200, and sells used for $100 to $120. I will include it for just $50 more.

Properly cleaned and maintained, and only has about 500 rounds though it. Asking only $950 (without the optic). I'm pretty confident in the price--there's other people selling there's for a lot more and not even as nice as mine.

Proper Florida ID is required, and a Bill of Sale is preferred.

They are used by the worlds' most Elite U.S. Army SPEC OPS unit, FBI SWAT, Thunder Ranch and professionals worldwide.

Our magazine springs are specially fabricated from the highest tensile strength heavy duty spring wire for long service life enhanced feeding and positive slide stop operations. Our magazine bodies are manufactured from .027"" (the thickest in the industry) aircraft grade certified 17-7 PH stainless steel and heat treated for maximum durability and service life.

""Back in 1980, Bill Wilson asked me to test some of his new Wilson-Rogers .45 magazines. He explained that he felt they had solved the problem of cracked feed lips and that their new magazines fed much more reliably than any others on the market. Well, it's 30 years later now and I'm still using some of those original 6 prototype magazines that Bill sent me… Through the years they have proven without a doubt to be the most reliable and durable 1911 magazines on the market. I have personally used specimens from various production runs through the years and have yet to see any quality variation or have one let me down in any way. They are my first and only choice as well as the choice of the elite special forces units I train. I trust my life to a Wilson Combat® pistol and 8-round Wilson magazines; so can you…""

I would be willing to trade it for a gen 4 glock 19 or gen 4 glock 26 or a springfield XDm 3.8. I can add cash for your gun. It comes with 2 15 rounds mags and 10 rounds I have laying around somewhere. Also has original paperwork. Sorry if the pictures arent great, there are a couple oil smudges i didnt wipe off. I can send you more if youd like. Text me at REDACTED with ANY offers."

He is a very smart kid, but has Asperger's Syndrome and previous visits to ranges in the Wake county area have been a bit of a disaster. He is under 10 years old, and interested in rifles, but doesn't like the loud noises of larger bore rifles (he will get used to this) and is especially freaked out by all of the people at the range. We would restrict to just using single shot, short 22LR rounds and an air rifle. We would be interested in 25 yards or less. I would pick up every single shell and clean up any trash on your property (including that left by other people) in exchange. We would leave nothing behind us. I would bring targets onto the property. If you have a natural gully or ditch, we would shot into that (nothing into the air). We would not shoot small game or birds, just paper targets. Ideally, we would be looking to shoot somewhere west of cary/pittsboro area.

I bought it because it's really cool but that has worn off and I have no use for it.

The SureFire M900L Vertical Foregrip WeaponLight delivers the tactical advantages of increased weapon control plus 500 lumens of ultra-reliable LED illumination. The light output is focused by a TIR lens into an intense, comparatively tight beam capable of illuminating mid-range targets and beyond, along with providing significant surround light for peripheral vision. The M900L also features two low-output LED navigation lights. Three switches control the primary beam: two momentary-on pressure pads on the vertical grip itself (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), and a constant-on rotary switch at the rear of the light housing. The navigation lights are activated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. A rotary system-disable switch at the bottom of the grip turns all lights off to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage

Millet DMS 1-4x24 Designated Marksman Red-Dot Riflescope in Burris PEPR Mount (Non QD) used w/o box or papers. Item is cross listed. I will update with pic's this evening.

That's what the manufacturer says anyway.  

Now for the honest review. The optic generally can be found for around $230 for the scope and $70 for the mount or a new retail of about $300 for the package. I obtained this optic used in trade. When I received it, it was sprayed camo. I have since sprayed it flat black. I originally planned to use it for starting out in 3gun but haven't gotten around to it yet and am looking to fund another purchase. I had it on an SPR build before replacing it with a Vortex PST2.5-10x32 fpp.  Recently it has sat on top of my plinker MP 15-22.The glass of the vortex blows it way but it should since it costs around $700. It did hold zero on my AR just fine. You can find a lot of reviews online if you want more information on the scope. For the price, it is hard to beat. 

Always interested in trades or other firearms or optics, plus or minus boot. 
Firearms I am currently looking for : Browning Buckmark, Ruger 22/45, CZ75 Kadet. 
Optics I am always looking for: SWFA SS10x42 or 12x42, Aimpoint Pro, Eotech 512, 516, 553, Xps, etc.

He apparently wants to WHINE LIKE A BABY because he thinks everyone is charging to much for their items or wants to tell you to go to GUNBROKER FOR HOW TO SALE YOUR ITEMS and to tell you that you paid to much for your items and basically you're over charging everyone. He probably doesn't have enough money to buy anything so wants you to give your items for free to him I wish he was more concerned about how to eliminate the SCAMMERS on here than what the good honest folks here are asking for their items. I personally wish there was some way to completely block JERKS like him from Gun related items Completely because its idiots like him who ruin it for the rest of us. My Best Regards to ALL at Armslist and all you good gun guys out there. Please let these KNOW NOTHING WANTABEE  FOOLS FIND THEIR STUFF ON GUNBROKER AND LETS KEEP THIS SITE STRONG!!!!!!!

Picked it up as a project to work on, and am ready to move onto something else.

Locks up tight as a drum with no wobble in the receiver. Refinished wood with dark stain and a polyurethane seal. Medium amount of pitting on the left side of the barrel, not enough to affect the function of the shotty (hey, its a 60+ year old side by side!). Overall is a nice, old double barrel.

Bought it with the intention of cleaning it up and chopping it down into a ""mad max"" type shotty, but after working on it a little bit seems like a shame to do so. Would like to see it go to a good home!

The value of these shotties vary wildly, but I'm only going to place it at 250$ due to the pitting on the outside of the barrel. Fair condition overall, so a fair price as well.

Located in Norman, OK. Only interested in a face to face transaction. Call/text REDACTED if you're interested.

I've got two mags for it and they are HARD to come by (just the factory 6 round mags) and have 2 extended floorplates that fit my whole hand/ 1 factory extended floor plate and one flush floorplate. Gun will come with two different size pocket sleeve type holsters, a desantis tuckable IWB holster and two pictured kydex holsters from AT Tactical. 

The kydex holsters were custom made for this gun and fit like a charm, you will NOT have to worry about getting a holster for this gun as these fit the bill better than any other. 
I'm sure I'll have a random assortment of self defense ammo to go with it, just ask and I'll see what there is. 

I'm the second owner since the gun was purchased new and haven't had a chance to shoot it but have carried it a few times, just realized I was leaving my M&P at home and didn't like doing that so I have to sell it!
