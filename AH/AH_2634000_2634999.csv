It has a 22"" Stainless Steel Barrel and Bolt with a PROFIRE adjustable Trigger and black synthetic stock.  I purchased it new from Dominion Outdoors in Fishersville Va in Nov 2012 for 290.00.  I have the receipts and box it was purchased with.  It came with a stainless steel 7 round clip.  I also purchased 2 new 10 round stainless steel magazines extra which I am including in the sell.  The gun was shot approximately 50 times to make sure it worked the way it was supposed to.  Since then, I have decided that I want to replace it with a .22 magnum which will better suit for the distance that I am shooting and want to sell this rifle.  I recently purchased a new BSA SWEET 22 6 x 18 x40 scope and rings which have been mounted on the rifle and will go along with the sell.  It has the .36, .38, and .40 grain torrents and is specifically designed for .22 rifles.  It has not been used, only mounted on the riffle.  The scope was about $100 and the rings $20.  The extra magazines were more than $25 each and are top quality stainless steel.  

I am willing to sell for $310 and include all of the extras.  I am also willing to trade for something else.  I would ultimately enjoy having a .22 mag that is either tube fed or has a magazine that is completely in the stock.  I want a rifle that doesn't have a magazine hanging down so that it can more easily be shot from a rest.

I will expect to see proper ID and sign a simple bill of sell."

-New Tapco 6 position stock
-New bolt cover with tri-rail system
-New bolt cover pin
-New 6-24X50 illuminated sniper scope with dual mount posts

-Trigger assembly removed, cleaned and oiled
-Original Yugo Blued muzzle break
-NEW - Four 20 round mags
-I will also throw in 300+ rounds of ammo (some hollow point some full metal jacket)
Anyone that knows about the SKS platform already knows what i have invested in this rifle based on the list above.
I am NOT trying to make money here. Only trying to recover some of my investment which is MORE than my asking price.
I am asking $750.00 for it all..... Is there room for negotiating? Maybe but not much!"

The truly unique part of the MGI Hydra is the lower receiver. The problem with multi cal AR15s always revolves around the magazine well. 7.62x39 ar15 magazines are renowned for their unreliability, Pistol calibers for their finicky magazine blocks, and limitations of calibers by the size of the mag well. MGI fixed that in this design. The magazine well slide into and locks on machined rails in the receiver. Yes...the magazine well is removable.

The Colt 380 Mustang XSP and Mustang Pocketlite are small and lightweight,
and they boast enhanced durability, reliability, and accuracy, making
either an ideal handgun for personal protection. The precise machining
process, use of high-quality materials, and improvements in design make
these pistols two of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the
market. The slide and barrel are CNC-machined from solid bar stock for
precise tolerances, and with loaded magazines, each weighs less than one
pound. These pistols feature high profile sights, a commander-style hammer,
a solid aluminum trigger, and a lowered ejection port. The minimal weight
and length, short single action trigger, grip designs, frame designs, and
firing pin safety block combine to make the Mustang pistols ideal for
personal protection.

Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

System is the world’s first Adjustable-Zero fast-attach silencer mounting system. This revolutionary mounting system is designed to offer the operator the choice of instantly choosing between silenced or unsuppressed firing, while also providing the ability to adjust zero-shift. The M.I.T.E.R. System Blackout flash eliminator provides reliable precision accuracy and the ability of installation or removal of the silencer in seconds in the harshest military environment. The over-the-barrel design has minimal affect of the weapon’s center of balance and maneuverability. The extreme durability of the SPR/M4 & SCAR-H SD is maximized by CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed fire possible. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. As a final step, tapered-bore EDM technology is utilized to ensure precise bore alignment resulting in enhanced accuracy and maximum performance. By removing approximately 97% of the muzzle report, the SPR/M4 eliminates the need for ear protection, preserves field communications, and masks the location of the shooter. Eliminating muzzle signature in combat saves lives.

For sale an AZ Rapid MKII PCP Air Rifle in .22 with engraved action by Allen Zasadny. This is a one of a kind item of collector quality. This is my most accurate gun, period... Always holds zero and under 1/2"" CTC at 55 yards. This rifle was made by AZ for a friend of his. I understand he picked the most accurate barrel and the best looking stock for the gun. This is the only Rapid I have ever seen engraved by Allen. Barrel is 21"". Gun overall is 49"" It is very quiet. It is basically the supreme sniper. Bottle is 500cc and good for approx. 60 -70 really good shots with a 3200 psi fill. Holds air perfectly.

Up for grabs is a early model Colt Cobra with the Blued Finish and the 2in Barrel. This thing is 100% NIB Condition with no signs of having wear, use, or being fired. These Early Models dont turn up very easy these days and when they do it seems like they are in very ""USED"" condition due to the Cobra models where generally used as service revolvers. This one is New In Box Condition"

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

It also comes with two K98 ammo pouches that are in great condition and a reproduction Mauser bayonet. I also have a Wolf firing pin spring thats a 22lbs. I bought it to fire the hard primer yugo ammo. This rifle is really nice piece of history and I hate to see it go. I'm moving on to the AR-15 world. I'm not comfy on shipping it, so I really prefer FTF. I'm asking $350 dollars for the whole kit, I originally payed $300 for the rifle, so no low balls. If your just interested in the rifle, I guess I can just sell that. Thanks and have a nice day."

Remington M-11 12ga Autoloader, John Browning licensed Remington to manufacture and sell gun in 1905, John Browning design.
Shotgunn is a 12ga autoloader with 28"" barrel.  This is the solid rib version, (not ventilated), and the metal is blued matte finish.  This shotgun is in really nice shape.
 The action works flawlessly and is smooth and not a speck of rust, (or dirt for that matter), anywhere that I can find.  Has a slight patena to it but overall very nice.  The stock is  beautifull.  You won't be disappointed in this one and I think you would be hard pressed to find another one in this shape.  The guy that owned these before really knew how to take care of firearms and his passion was shotguns.  He passed away in May and left these with his wife and I ended up with them to sell for her.  The stock is rich with a really nice finish.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out. Your payment, by cash, Personal Check, Certified Check, USPS Money Order, and now we accept Credit Cards as well. I wouldn't recommend cash but if you must send cash, go ahead, I'm honest and will accept cash as your payment.  Personal Checks must clear my bank and I will not ship until I get confirmation your check has cleared, usually about a 7 to 10 day wait after deposit. Certified Checks must also clear but usually have a shorter wait time. USPS Money Orders must also clear but usually very fast and sometimes I can cash them at the Post Office. All major Credit Cards are accepted, except Discover, but you must call me to give me your CC information, number, expiration date, CCV and Name on the card. There is a 3% up-fee/surcharge on Credit Cards on the full amount including shipping but as soon as the funds show up in my account I will ship. Usually about 24 hours.

Your payment is due in our hands or account within 7 calendar days after you agree to buy.  NO excuses, NO extensions accepted. Call me or e-mail with your information. If you do not pay within the 7 days as agreed I will re-post this firearm.  Your call or e-mail will not change this. Longuns, Rifle, or Shotguns  etc., firearms will be shipped UPS Ground for $38.00, paid by you so add to the amount of the firearm, and Alaska is an extra $10.00 with a signature required on all firearms. Insurance and other shippers are optional and may cost extra.  I almost always add insurance to the shipping.

The name of my company is ""Gid-R-Dun Rod and Gun"" and we will Gid-R-Dun!

Please if you cannot or will not pay on time please don't tell me you will.

Also note that we will provide prompt service and ship as soon as the funds and  confirmation allows us to do so. I will attempt to ship within 2 business days after your payment is confirmed and I have a legal FFL in my hands and I have verified his FFL.

We reserve the right to end this sale early at any time if there are no inquiries or e-mails regarding this sale.  If you want to buy this firearm please let me know ASAP.  The first person to contact me has the first right of refusal.  I will only take this firearm off the site when I have money in hand for the purchase.  Only then will the firearm be taken off our shelf waiting for your payment to clear. This firearm will remain on our ""For Sale"" shelf until that time. Please ask all questions before buying. My name is Brad, REDACTED or e-mail me at REDACTED

I support the NRA and so should you. Membership is $35.00 for one year but I can sign you up for one year for $25.00 and I'll pay the extra $10.00 for the one-year membership. We need the NRA more than ever right now so I urge you to join if you are not already a member.  If you are not a member and sign up through me ask about our extended NRA discount on this sale.

If you don't want to lose your gun rights and you don't want more Government CONTROL, and you want to be able to buy guns and ammunition, and you want your gun stores to stay in business, - JOIN THE NRA!!!  Let's vote them out of there, and ""God Bless America""
If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales tax, on top of everything else. You can come into my shop and buy direct and save the shipping if you live in Washington State but read everything above.  You will need to fill out a form 4473 and pass a background check if you want to come in and buy direct.

I will not ship anything anymore to CA, MD, Hawaii, DC, NY, NJ, MA, Colorado or Connecticut now, or some cities in Illinois. Not my problem that you live there. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know the laws of your area, local, City, State or Federal. If this firearm is illegal for you to own in your area, you will be charged a 25% re-stock fee if your FFL Dealer cannot transfer to you. Not my problem. You will pay shipping to and from.  Thanks for looking!

This 1911 is not one of the ""problem Kimbers"" I have heard about. I probably have somewhere around 4-6k rounds through it, and I cannot remember it having any non-ammo-related malfunctions. The 1911 is in 100% working order and all original parts. There are some light scuffs on the front strap and some holster wear on the leading edge of the slide. 

With the gun, I'll include 8 magazines (5 Wilson Combat, 1 Kimber seven rounder, and two others which I have forgotten the names of), approximately 250 rounds of .45 (about 40 of which are defense rounds that are currently in the magazines), a leather De Santis pancake holster, a Blackhawk Serpa holster, and two magazine carriers. I have all the original paperwork in the case as well. The price for all of this is $700

I'm selling this to fund some Jeep upgrades, so the only trades I'll consider will be new (or like new) winches or winch bumpers (for a JK). 

Will meet at an FFL of your choice (preferably in the South Metro area) for that bullshit background check that is now legally mandated."

Salem ILL
LC07 headstamp

1.	223 brass was uniformly cut off with a  mini chop saw and jig.
2.	It has been ran through a full length sizing die TWICE. The die was set using a Wilson Case Gauge and a Sheridan Gauge. SAMMI specs.
3.	Brass was cleaned inside and out with a sonic cleaner. ( some of the brass does still have minor stains on the inside, outside looks new.) From this point on, latex gloves were worn every time the brass was handled.
4.	Brass is tumbled to a brilliant shine.
5.	Primer pockets are swaged and squared up.
6.	Brass is trimmed to 1.358 inches + or – 0.002
7.	Brass is then properly annealed on a Ken Light annealer.

There is quite a bit of 300 blackout brass being made, but check out how it is being made….

1.	Has it been properly full length sized to SAMMI specs, by full length resizing it TWICE, the necks are more uniform and the shoulders are squared up more rather than being rounded off. 
2.	I see a lot of military brass being sold where the primer pockets have not been cleaned, swaged and squared up. 
3.	Most of the brass out there has not been annealed. Annealing will add to the life of the brass and also help with proper neck tension when seating the bullet.

 NOTE: This brass has been sized to SAMMI 300 ACC Blackout specs, it may not be properly headspaced for single shot , break open guns such as T C Contenders or Encores. I have an older T C Encore in 300 Whisper, it is not correctly headspaced for this brass. It is your responsibility to check the headspacing on your gun.

This shotgun is in really nice shape.  The action works flawlessly and is smooth and not a speck of rust, but if you look really close you can detect there might have been som slight pitting?  There is a petina to the gun as seen in the picture but the picture does not do this gun justice.  The flash showed it to be colored more than it really is.  But no rust anywhere that I can find.  The stock is chekered and beautifull.  You won't be disappointed in this shotgun either.  And I think you would be hard pressed to find another one in this shape.  Great gun for the collector.  This shotgun is a really nice.  The guy that owned these before really knew how to take care of firearms and his passion was shotguns.  He passed away in May and left these with his wife and I ended up with them to sell for her.  The gun is blued and the stock on this one has a really nice finish and has really nice woog characteristics to it.  Ver rich with a really nice finish.  Has a 28"" blued barrel and is a Slide Action Shotgun.  It has on the left side of the receiver """"WARDS WESTERN FIELD"" ""Montgomery Ward""  And ""Model 35"".  It is of the  ""HAMERLESS HUMPBACK"" version Slide Action shotgun.

A fine gun for home defense use and hunting in the brush where you need a shorter barrel for maneuverability. 12 gauge is a good idea for home defense because there are several ""less than lethal"" loads available, as well as the standard buckshot and birdshot loads. The action has been tested with ""dummy"" shells, and everything works as it should; action, slide bar, extractor, ejector, firing pin all are in good working order. Bore looks just fine. The wood is in good shape with very little wear markings. The metal is in good shape also, with only a few small areas of wear visible on the barrel and receiver. Capacity 5+1. 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells.

This is most likely the highest-quality, most accurate rifle ever built by CZ in the 452 / 453 / 455 lineup, and won't be made ever again, since they switched the 455 system.

This 45-three (not 452) means that it has the single-set trigger, which was the less-common version in these.  This Varmint model has the 20.5"" heavy/bull barrel with the beautiful walnut stock with widened forearm and nice tiger striping.  Comes with one 5-round mag.

This rifle was purchased new by me and has a very low round count, under 80 rounds.  It is excellent or maybe excellent+ condition; I'd say about 91% - 94%, but not exactly sure (I'll let you decide; ask if you want more pics).  I also have the box and papers but will need to find them.

This rifle is a proven sub-.700 MOA performer with genuine 5-shot groups at 50 yards averaging around .340 CTC.  Deadly laser to 125+ yards on any small game.

Comes with or without (your choice) mounted Swift Premier 3-9x50mm. Excellent condition with box, papers, sunshade, lens covers. Very light mounting marks. This big objective lens gathers a lot of light for dusk and dawn hunting. This scope is around $236 plus shipping new - see for example: http://swfa.com/Swift-3-9x50-Premier-Rifle-Scope-P7280.aspx
The rings are all-steel, very high quality CZ-brand rings.

Old Price:  $650 with scope / $570 without

New Price:  Yours for $610 for everything, or $540 for rifle without scope, BUT WITH the steel rings.  I believe this is an excellent price for this discontinued, sought-after, uncommon configuration, between the Varmint profile, set trigger (453), and chambering of .17 HMR.  So no need to offer less unless it's boot money with a trade offer, please.

Those are FTF prices.  Add $30 for shipping to your door if you are Okla. resident via FedEx ground, or to your FFL's door anywhere in CONUS if not an Okla. resident.  Please note that if I send to you directly rather than to FFL, as allowed per BATFE regs, I need to see some proof of residency (text me pic of driver's license), and I do my own OSCN background check for felony convictions.

I will also sell the Swift Premier scope separately for $90 shipped to your door.

I also have the following ammo for sale, which you can buy or not if you get the rifle:  
1.  75 rounds (1.5 boxes) of CCI TNT Explosive 17 gr. JHP
2.  72 rounds (1.5 boxes) of Federal Premium V-Shok 17 gr with Speer TNT HP
3.  175 rounds (3.5 boxes) of Hornady 17 gr V-Max

Walther PPS 9mm
What a saweet carry gun, I carry it with me frequently and love it. 8 + 1 super slim and the cross breed super tuck deluxe holster is amazing. I put a box of rounds through this gun the other day and it performs amazing. 

I was planning on keeping both guns for a very long time but after seeing a colleague's Kimber custom carry, I have the itch again and would like to invest in a nice carry 1911 and I am willing to let both guns go against the right 1911. It should come with a nice inside the pants holster but this is not a deal breaker. It should be a .45 but I may consider 9mm as well. One gun that I would definitely consider is a browning hi-power, preferably of Belgian vint, I will consider some Argentine models but they need to be in good shape. Not exactly a carry gun but I have wanted one for a very long time. Other than that,nice springfields, and nice Kimbers and what have you. No subcompacts, will only consider compact and above (I have big hands). Thanks!

As all of you have experienced on armslist, prices vary and I try to be fair. Looking for 1000 value out of the guns together. Low ball offers will be ignored. I don't want your AR or your O/U shotguns, I don't want your nice deer rifles, I only want a 1911 or a hi power."
