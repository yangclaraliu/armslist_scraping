This stock is used to decrease the overall length of your shotgun's stock without leaving it vulnerable to pistol-grip only firing. It has a button on the left side of the stock to fold it up or down depending on the user's preference. It is also factory pre-drilled to accept a 5-round shell caddy. A sling mount can be found on the left side of the stock as well.

104,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2396104,For Sale:  Rare Crosman 1100 Trapmaster CO2 Shotgun  PRICE DROP,"Central, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 175,"Listed On: Monday, January 6, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One of the more interesting guns from the venerable firm of Crosman was their Trapmaster 1100 shotgun. Powered by a pair of 12 gram CO2 cartridges and firing a reloadable .38 caliber plastic shotshell filled with #8 shot, the Trapmaster wasn’t a huge commercial success, being made only from 1968 through 1971. It was sold not as a hunting gun, but as part of suburban trapshooting set, using a hand thrower and two-part, snap-together plastic “pigeons.”

Of course since it was made, airgunsmiths have found it to be an excellent platform for customization. 1100s have been converted to bulk fill and re-valved to increase power. Changing the valve spring or making a new, lighter, valve would increase opening time and the the volume of gas released. The guns can also, with no conversion, fire a .375″ lead ball over a couple of wads. One owner, writing in (I think) the now-defunct Airgun News, claimed 100 ft-lbs of muzzle energy for his conversion. A more realistic power level of 42 ft-lbs (465fps with an 80gr ball) is claimed at this web site. Whatever the capabilities, the 1100 was one of the best made, best looking guns Crosman ever produced, with a solid heft that put you in mind of a medium caliber firearm.
This comes from an estate and the 1100 is in fantastic condition and would make an excellent addition to a collection. It is untested. Photos and description from internet. Wads and cups are available on e-bay from time to time."

Unknown round count but not much wear on the internals so I would guess it is pretty low. Runs like a top. I just replaced the extractor spring and gas rings with new BCM parts. I also recently installed an ALG QMS (Quality Mil Spec) trigger to replace the gritty factory unit. The furniture has also been replaced for better ergonomics. It has the Magpul MOE forearm, Magpul MOE grip, Magpul MOE trigger guard, and a B5 Bravo stock.

Need to make room for a new rifle in the safe but I have plenty of room for another handgun so I'd like to trade my rifle for your handgun.

The frame is the comfortable full size you’re accustomed to in your traditional 1911 pistol, but with the shorter slide the result is excellent concealability.

It includes the best of several models, enhanced with a 4 1/16” version of the hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel pioneered on Tactical Elite. With this barrel, we have reduced the slide length by a full inch, giving you a speed advantage in target acquisition with the shorter sighting plane. The frame is the comfortable full size you’re accustomed to in your traditional 1911 pistol, but with the shorter slide the result is excellent concealability. An excellent choice for daily carry, The Elite Professional provides the rapid shot-to-shot recovery and reduced recoil one would expect from a compensated pistol. You can be sure of 100% functional reliability, fast handling, rapid shot-to-shot recovery and accuracy when you need it.

HK P30 V2 9mm Pistol.The P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation-one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. •Caliber: 9mm •Weight: 1.63 lbs. •Safety: Ambidextrous safety lever •Sights: Fixed 3 point •Magazines Included: 2 •Magazine Capacity: 15+1 •Grips: Black polymer, interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates •Slide Finish: nitro-carburized steel •Frame Finish: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer

The BVL280 provides an incredible 280 lumens of light in momentary or constant-on mode. Both models have a sophisticated electronic power management system that delivers maximum output for up to 2 hours, then backs down the output to give you up to 24 hours of usable light from one set of batteries. It even reduces the power if it senses the light is overheating - amazing!
Both lights come with three color filters (red, green, and blue) to make the BVL highly adaptable to different illuminating tasks, plus rubber rings that you can slide over the body to serve as finger stops when employing the popular “syringe” grip technique. The free-spinning lanyard loop rotates a full 360° so the lanyard (also included) won’t get tangled."

Any caliber from .17 through .50 cal (not including .50 cal).  

Standard cases:  .05 / each
Magnum cases:  .07 / each

If you'd like I can clean your brass in stainless media, for $10 / 1000.  It will make it shine like never before, and remove all the carbon and dirt from both inside and outside of the case. I do this as a hobby and have had many many satisfied customers from all over the U.S.

Annealing is the process of heating the neck / shoulder area of the brass to 750 degrees, which changes the internal structure of the brass back to it's original properties.  As brass is fired over and over, it hardens and will eventually crack.  It will also lose neck tension, resulting in lost accuracy.

Bottom is stamped ""Browning"" not ""Lightning Browning etc"". The serial number is extremely low if that is the serial number underneath the release?

The barrels look clean except in the middle. I believe that's from use they do not look pitted. The exterior has rust on maybe 5% of the gun, the stock has no major nicks I can see. The buttpad is well used and I would replace it.

The new 22PLY has been redesigned with sleek new lines and a polymer frame—weighing in at a mere 10.8 ounces. Both feature a blowback action and tip-up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round. If light and fast are your priorities, the 22PLY is the pistol for you. Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Selling price is $260.00/Chillicothe, Ohio."

I would not use these in certain pistols. It is your responsibility to know what your gun is built for. I called the folks at Springfield Armory and they told me that it is fine to use these loads in their XD/XDM line in limited quantities, meaning not thousands of rounds. I used an XP recoil spring just to be sure. I have heard of people using these in XD/XDM/XDS , Glock, and H&K without problems, but again, do your own research.

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

   And of course, these weapons feature the same No-BS Lifetime Warranty as the RTA Carbines! Prices start at $660*, get your 1911 started today!

   We will be debuting our custom, hand built Series13 1911 line next year, and we're extremely excited about that! But I've been looking for an affordable production model that featured the frame-to-slide fitment and material quality that would provide a solid platform to build off of. 

   The idea was to have an affordable custom-tuned line of 1911s to compliment our RTA carbines. And we have found our winner, the Bersa/Metro ""American Classic"" 1911. While I expected it to function beautifully, the additional features, fit & finish, and perfect balance of this gun took me by surprise.

  The RTA Edition 1911 starts with the Commander platform, and is improved in stages to suite various budgets. Within each model, you have plenty of options to help you personalize your sidearm!

A self defense rifle has to perform the first time, every time. The ultra-reliable A.R.G.O. system incorporated into the new Benelli MR1 does it for the U.S. military, and makes the MR1 the best home defense rifle available. MR1 self defense guns are chambered in 5.56 mm NATO (.223 Remington) and use the battle-proven Auto Regulating Gas Operated (ARGO) system—the same system developed by Benelli for the M1014 (M4) and used for over a decade in multiple conflicts by the United States Marine Corps.
Built to the same tough military specifications and embodying the solid reliability that the U.S. Marines rely upon, the MR1 has no equal among home defense weapons. It features a stainless steel, self-cleaning piston that operates directly against the proven rotating bolt, thereby eliminating the need for complex linkages found on other, inferior gas systems. This piston-driven system, perfected by Benelli, incorporates a gas port located just forward of the chamber, where the gases are hotter and cleaner, resulting in less fouling and more reliable cycling. The result—a Benelli carbine with features rivaling all other home defense rifles, including Marine—tough reliability and the ability to function in the harshest environmental conditions
