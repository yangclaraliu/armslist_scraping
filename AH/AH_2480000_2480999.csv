54,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2480054,For Sale:  2 Surefire Gun Lights,"Long Island , NY, Long Island, New York",FREE,"Listed On: Sunday, December 22, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"1. SureFire M900V-BK-WH, Vertical Foregrip Incandescent WeaponLight with IR Navigation LEDs, Throw Lever Mount & 1.62"" Bezel, 125 or 225 Lumens, Black 
The Vertical Foregrip LED WeaponLight - M900V from SureFire features white-light and infrared primary-illumination as well as white-light secondary/navigational illumination. The vertical grip delivers significant gains in weapon-control during sustained-fire and tactical maneuvering.

Twisting the self-locking selector ring on the M900V's dual-spectrum V-series head selects the WeaponLight's primary illumination mode. The operator can choose from a hard-hitting 150 lumen screaming tunnel of blinding white-light, or a 120 mW IR illuminator beam for use with a night vision device. In either mode, the M900V's TIR lens produces a tight beam that is well suited for CQB and medium-range targeting applications.

The M900V is fitted with very efficient recoil-resistant LEDs that are virtually immune to failure - they have no filament that can burn out or break. The WeaponLight's housing is constructed from a combination of Nitrolon polymer and Mil-Spec anodized machined-aluminum to ensure battle-worthy reliability. The entire system is o-ring and gasket-sealed for optimum weather-resistance.

To control the primary illumination system, the M900V is configured with two tactical switches that provide momentary/constant on operation. Additionally, the M900V also has a rotary switch that provides constant-on operation with a lock-out/deactivate option. The M900V also features low-output white-light navigation LEDs that can be activated by a momentary-on pressure-pad thumb-switch.

Secure and reliable mounting of the M900V is handled by its integral quick-release throw-lever mount. The M93 mount is compatible with most Picatinny or Weaver systems. The self-adjusting clamp accommodates off-spec rails, and it's configured with a recoil-resistant lever-lock that keeps the mount tight.

2. SureFire M600 Ultra Scout Ultra-High Output LED Weapon Light with extras.
M600U-A
Compact and extremely powerful, the M600 Ultra Scout Light® uses a virtually failure-proof LED to produce 500 lumens of output, and it continues producing blinding tactical light for 1.5 hours on a set of batteries. This brilliant output is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens into a far-reaching beam with an intense 13,000-candela central area that also provides significant peripheral illumination, making it ideal for close- to longer-range applications. 

LU60A
The LU60A is an incandescent lamp module for the SureFire Scout Light®. It is interchangeable with this WeaponLight's KX2C LED head, allowing the Scout Light, when also outfitted with a SureFire FM63 infrared filter, to be used in stealth operations involving night vision devices (NVDs). Since white light LEDs produce negligible infrared radiation, they cannot be combined with an IR filter for use with NVDs.

FM63
The FM63 is an infrared (IR) filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.47"" diameter bezel. Cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. For military or law enforcement infrared applications, SureFire also recommends the M1 Illuminator, as its dedicated infrared design may be more appropriate for mission critical tasking. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight.  $450 Shipped"

I have a very nice Springfield Armory Milspec with a NM Serial Number. I was going to use this as a base gun for a custom build, but I decided to go a different direction. It is a great shooter and its slide to frame fit is just as tight as my Colt Wiley Clapp commander, and Springfield TRP. I replaced the Mainspring housing with a ED Brown flat housing. 

It comes with the box and one Chip McCormick 8rd stainless mag. 

I would like $600.00 OBO FTF in NE Ohio. I will ship on the buyers dime. 

I will consider trading for

I figure most of us have daughters or granddaughters that would jump for joy at seeing this on Christmas morning. This is a wood Barbie 3 level playhouse. It is almost 5' tall and 40"" wide. This was not a cheap plastic toy when it was purchased many years ago. It has been played with but has now been outgrown. It comes with literally hundreds of dollars of accessories and dolls. I would be interested in trading it for a firearm..but please do not low-ball me. If sold separately these items would be worth well over 1000.00..but I am realistic and would place the trade value at much less. Just imagine the smile on that little girls face. It can be disassembled for transport if need be..I also have a table that it will sit on that you can also have. Indy east/Irvington area."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This is an ex-dragoon, and being a late-1920s Tula with a hex receiver, is more desirable than the wartime Izhevsks that you see everywhere.

The dragoon was a shortened version of the original 1891 pattern. The later 91/30 (the most common Mosin-Nagant we see now) was the same as a dragoon, except for the sights. This rifle most likely saw action through all of WWII as a dragoon, and was updated to 91/30 status sometime after the war. The update merely involved changing the front and rear sights, though they probably arsenal refinished it at the same time.

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 combines smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot.

Has matching numbers. Has threaded barrel. Chromed bore. Gun has a few minor scratches and handling marks. Comes with 3-30rd magazines (1-new Polish, 1-new Tapco, and 1-Chinese, used but in good condition). This gun/variant is getting hard to come by lately. It has new Ironwood Design/made upper and lower handguards. However, upper handguard has split in the middle (pictured) but glued back together. The wood furniture has an iodine red finish (like a red orange finish). In addition, I'll throw in a matching Ironwood pistol grip, including the hardware (metal ferrule and grip bolt) with it. Thumbhole stock is not original to the gun. I took this gun on a trade and had a regular buttstock on it, and decided to install a thumbhole stock for compliance with the AWB/922r. The gun also comes with an extra new set of handguards. Upper handguard latch tip is broken. But the latch itself is still functional, and won't affect the gun function wise. Brand new handguard latch is included with the sale. This Hungarian SA-85M was imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's. Sorry about the pictures. I’m not a good photographer. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. Must be at least 18 years old, or older (with proper ID) only to buy this gun. Thanks for looking.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.
