So my duck hunting days are going to be put on hault for the next couple of years and I'd rather someone enjoy it instead of it going to waste just sitting in the yard. I'm an honest fella and I honestly value the boat at around $1700-$1800 and also understand a lot of people are less fortunate to be able to afford a good reliable boat due to our wonderful government do such a fantastic job in creating jobs and keeping taxes at a minimum for the working man.

SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun is operated using delayed blowback principle, which is rather unusual for shotguns. It employs roller-delayed action with two-part bolt and two rollers in its head, which enter recesses in the barrel extension. This action is very similar to that found in many older weapons by Heckler & Koch (such as G3 or MP5) based on WW2-era German Stg.45(M) design.Model 1216 shotgun is built using bullpup layout, with polymer housing / stock and steel upper receiver, connected by cross-pins. Ejection ports are located on either side of the receiver, with one which is not in use being closed by removable ejection port cover. Normally Model 1216 shotgun is set up to eject to the right, although user can disassemble the gun and set it for left-side ejection, if required. One of most unusual features of the SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun is its feed system. It employs detachable rotary magazine with four channels, each containing its own spring and follower. Each channel can hold up to four rounds in the same manner as any common tubular shotgun magazine. When magazine is inserted into the gun, it is located below the barrel. To feed the weapon, magazine should be rotated until one of its compartments is in topmost (12’o clock) position and aligned with feed port in the gun. Once it is done, cartridge retainer in the topmost compartment is disengaged, and first cartridge is pushed rearwards from magazine and onto the lifter platform in the gun. Once all four cartridges from topmost magazine are expended, bolt hold-open device engages the bolt in its rearward (open) position, indicating that magazine compartment is empty. After that, user shall push the indexing lever(s) at the front of the magazine, and manually rotate it 90 degrees to either side, until next full compartment is aligned with the feed port. Once it is done, fresh round is automatically fed from magazine and bolt hold-open device is released, chambering the round and making gun ready for the next shot. Once all four compartments are empty (or firing is done), rotary magazine cam be removed from the gun by pushing magazine release button, located in front of the magazine, below the muzzle. Empty or partially loaded magazines can be topped up only when removed from the gun.Other features of the SRM Arms Model 1216 shotgun include conveniently located manual safety, which can be set on left or on right side of the gun, and set of integral Picatinny type rails, which can be used to install variety of sighting devices (Red Dot or iron sights), as well as laser aiming modules and/or tactical flashlights."

Its great for learning or teaching basic shooting or for those shooting for a long time.  Awesome for self defense when panicking makes it easy to miss your target.  I would still take a great self defense course though.



It has a $350 Laser Max internal guide rod laser so you can carry it concealed.  It has night sites that still work but are a little faded.  If the average glock sells around $550 with night sites plus $350 Laser max, this gun retails for around $900 plus tax $63 and FFL.  I would trade it for around $775-800

3 mags.  Original Plastic Carry Case. 



Asking $750.   Trade options at bottom of ad too.  Email your number and I can text pics if you want more but gun works great; If you don't here from me in 2-3 hrs between 8am-9pm. I didn't get email so resend. I always check my spam filter but use aol, so dont always get messages.  Low ballers ignored. Please don't ask my bottom line. Looking for offers. And please don't offer me your $400 gun as an even trade


I can only meet in Clermont.



It's west of Orlando.   Im Located near Hwy 50 & 27 


Please only contact me if you are willing to come here to pick it up FTF.  I apologize but family health stuff keeps me from being able to drive outside of town right now. 
 

The price is already lower to accommodate me not meeting half way so please no low ball... 
FTF must pick up in Clermont.  FL DL required. CWP takes priority No Felons. Must be 21 and FL resident.  



I would really like an inexpensive or great valued AR 5.56/.223 or .308.  Prefer any of medium to high end brands and possibly local brands like Spikes.  Only want Ar's that upper and lower are matching from factory, not mismatches please.   Unless its just too good of a deal to pass up..... 
Other trades I would consider would be basic Glock plus cash trades . Tactical Rifle (w/ scope preferably) in .223 or .308 plus cash 1911's   Kimber, Smith, Sig, Colt or other cool 1911 that is a great deal plus cash on my side or (p938 lower cost models plus cash) )or other cool tactical weapon................ Can't add too much on my side so must be fairly close in price.  Not looking for any real high end guns unless price is close to mine. 



If you have something else cool to trade that you gotta great deal on that is too good to pass up. I might consider. But looking for great functioning weapons.



no mossberg shot guns,    no lcp's, no keltec pistols............not interested at this time in xd's, m&p's, taurus, baretta unless its just an awesome deal on my side

Bought this NEW at gander mountain, Not even 2 weeks ago. Since I attached it to my gun, I cannot return it. I shot maybe 50 shots with it at the range to sight it in, but I have Astigmatism and some scopes just don't work with my eyes, so anything past 100 yards is hard to distinguish.

I paid damn near $200 for it.

Reason i am selling or trading is cause i have 2 other very similar size guns and would like a nice compact 9mm or 40.All together this set up would cost somewhere in the mid $900.00. Will need to show permit and dl for transaction trades that I am most interested in are sig p228/229 and hk handguns would prefer p2000sk but will consider others worst I can say is no.

As you can see from the pictures it's in good shape. It's mechanically and cosmetically in great condition. You can tell it's been holstered a few times, but nothing that can be picked up on camera. Comes with 5 mags (2 Beretta 15-round mags, 2 Mec-gar 20-round mags, and 1 Beretta 30-round mag.) Also comes with 2 holsters, one Galco belt holster and one Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster. Also has a pair of VZ grips on it which make the total grip width narrower and more comfortable for those with smaller hands. I have somewhat larger hands and these grips feel great to me too. Any white/silver on the gun in the pictures are just specks of dust, and isn't a spot where the finish was damaged or blemished.

Will consider cash and trade offers. Not in a rush to get rid of, just testing the waters and fishing for offers.

The receiver has light scratches all over it like it was dragged around the dirt, but not through to the metal, just imprinted on the black paint surface. If looks are an issue you can have it painted or Cerakoted, but otherwise it runs flawlessly like an AK47 should. This is a rare AK so it will continue to raise in value as compared to regular american built AKs that are out now.
it has a Mako buttstock, CAA grip, aluminum quad rail, and aluminum top rail from rear sight to rear trunnion that allows take down while holding zero and a back up rear peep sight that flips up, also has a recoil buffer added to the action spring. It also has a compensator brake, I added a piece with the swivel stud for your bipod, it adds to the looks quite a bit. also has a magpul angle grip. +2 30rd tapco mags. scope included.

some idiot tried to shoot up a school with an AK47 (maybe government/media ploy) you know they will try to outlaw these again very soon. Get one while you can."

Remington's response to my inquire was, ""We are producing this ammo so fast to meet the demands we can't maintain our standard of quality control, there are going to be failures.""

The dealers response was to immediately replace the box of ammo. As of the last conversation with the manager at that location, Remington has never replaced the ammo.

The bottom line, Remington is running junk ammo just to fill orders. Maybe what you buy will run fine, maybe you will damage your gun, or worse, get hurt yourself. Is it worth that to you? From my experience, fortunately my gun was strong enough to absorb the failure without damage, but with Remington's attitude and disregard for my safety, I will never buy a Remington product again.
I don't know run dates, but if I was buying 22 ammo, that normally comes in a 50 round box, I sure as heck would not buy a bulk run bucket!!"

Great pocket pistol, perfect for low profile carry/ccw, or even a back up pistol.  Has a heavy double action trigger pull so it will be very safe, and when the hammer is cocked in single action, it is a smooth light trigger pull.   
So as a whole you get:

-Taurus Ultralight model 85 5-shot snub nosed revolver chambered in .38 special

-Blackhawk CQC right handed leather holster that fits like a glove

-14 rounds of Speer Gold Dot Jacketed Hollow Point 125 grain +P

-33 rounds of Remington FMJ target ammo

-1 HKS 5 round speed loader

-Uncle Mike's single speed loader holster

I'm selling this as a package, not really interested in trades, but let me know what you got.  Worst I could say is no.  This won't last long, so if it's listed I still have it.  Not desperate to get rid of it, so no low ballers.  Also will have to present state drivers license and sign a bill of sale.
