It is worn from me taking it on and off for storage purposes. I would recommend getting a new side mount with adjustable elevation since the one I am selling does not allow you to use your iron sights. Great optic. I've shot it about 6 times. Everytime I'm done at the range I took it off to clean my rifle, and each time I put it back on it held zero at 25 yards perfect. Only reason I'm selling it is because I upgraded to an EOTech. Both the optic and mount do add a nice touch with the Russian lettering and ""Made in Belarus"" etching, if you are going for a pure look. I am also throwing in 10 CR2032 batteries as well.

Found out my wife was pregnant while I was building the rifle to how I like it. You are getting the ultimate Mini 14 set up with the best accessories and mods in the market. The mini 14 is hard to buy on top of it. The best part is that I took the time to research, and put it together as well as pay for all the shipping of the parts. I did all the hard work. You get to enjoy it right away.

The mini 14 has the same accuracy as the AR, but is more reliable which in my opinion makes it a better rifle.

Do not bother offering less then what I am asking. I know someone out there appreciates this bad ass rifle I built and I will hold out patiently until they find this rifle."

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

NOVESKE NSR HANDGUARD 
--Hard Coat Anodized Aluminum 
--Ultra Light and Robust Design 
--1913 Continuous Top Rail 
--Innovative Keymod Modular Direct Attachment System 
--Steel Barrel Nut 

Includes: 
--Handguard 
--Barrel Nut 
--Mounting Screws 
--T25 Wrench 
--Instructions 


BARREL NUT WEIGHT:3.1 oz. 

Made in USA 

The NSR handguard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating forend option to the M16 family of weapons. The width of the NSR handguard before accessories have been installed is only 1.48"" The NSR handguard is available for sale as standard equipment on our rifles and upper assemblies, as well as a separate component for sale to the public. Available in 7"", 9"", 11"", 13.5"", and 16.7"" lengths. 

The KeyMod inter-locking rail system is a collaboration between Vltor Weapon Systems and Noveske Rifleworks. Separately, both companies were in development of their own systems, but later realizing that both systems were similar, a standardization of the KeyMod system came to be. 

The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard."

 INSTALLED IN LESS THAN 5 MINUTES COMES WITH MINI SCREWDRIVER & ALLEN WRENCHES TO ADJUST LASER IF NEEDED

 SEE PICTURES FOR AWESOME ACCURACY RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WITHOUT ANY ADJUSTMENTS

 NO ON/OFF BUTTOM TO REACH FOR AS LASER IS ACTIVATED ONLY BY HUMAN TOUCH

THIS LASER IS MADE VERY WELL & STAYS SECURE ON PISTOL WHEN FIRING

 GREAT FOR HOME PROTECTION & LOW LIGHTING SITUATIONS
The ArmaLaser TR10 is the only laser system available for the SCCY CPX-Series.

Featuring a 5-year warranty, the TR10 turns on by human touch, not by a mechanical switch or button. As soon as you grasp your pistol, the True-Touch Activation sensor will turn the laser on and keep it on as long as you're grasping the pistol grip. Move your middle finger forward and the laser will shut off.

It is seamless and immediate and requires no button to be pushed or secondary operation.

The TR10 features a convenient battery door to replace its single CR1/3N battery (also can use 2 357 watch cells) so you won't lose any of the laser's ''zero'' when replacing batteries like with other lasers.

A master kill switch is recessed into the DuPont Zytel fiber-reinforced nylon housing (same material used in the SCCY grip/frame) to allow practice without the laser if needed.

Incredible 5 hours of run time and up to 2 years of standby time even if the TR10 is placed in ''ready to activate'' mode.

The laser module is a full 5mW, 635nm red laser which is the highest available by law and up to 5 times brighter than the 650nm competition. There is a very big difference in laser brightness between a 635nm laser and the 650nm one used in the TR10's main competitors, especially during daylight.

Incredibly strong and sturdy, the TR10 fits the CPX with incredible abuse-absorbing rigidity.

Requires no tools, pin removal, or gunsmithing. Installs easily in minutes and is simple to adjust to point of aim. Best of all, it stays adjusted no matter how many rounds you fire.

  ADD 3% FOR CREDIT CARD SALES
WILL ONLY SHIP TO STATES WHERE LEGAL

The TR10 can also switch between a steady laser beam mode and pulsing beam mode

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

I believe I'm the second owner and the gun appeared to be a safe queen when I acquired it.  I've shot less than 200 rounds with it.  Finish wear IMHO is 95%+ with only typical claw mark wear and a small area around the optional ejection port buffer distracting from the finish.  Bore is bright and shiny and bolt gap measures .016"" which is right in the middle of the normal range.  Date code is HH.

Included with the rifle is an original, new (never issued), Hensoldt Z-24 scope.  Hensoldt was the military arm of Zeiss and this scope is of the 3rd generation of optics used on this rifle.  These are becoming increasingly hard to find in the surplus market in new condition.  Comes with original claw mount as issued for it's time period.

Also included are 25 magazines (20 round) of steel or aluminum construction.  Some are new never issued while others show some usage.  Some are marked HK while the balance are stamped with HK contractor marks.  Buyer will also receive aftermarket owner manual and original sling.  Included in the spare parts survival kit that comes with this package are replacement rollers, extractor, springs, ect... to keep this battle rifle running well into the future.

Completing this package deal will be 1000 rounds of 7.62x51 brass case mil-surplus ammo manufactured by Hirtenberger in Austria. This is boxer primed, non-corrosive, 147 grain ball ammo packaged in original 20 round paper boxes.  Hirtenberger is considered one of the best mil-surplus manufacturers around.  

I prefer to not break up this package.  I would pull out the ammo if somebody wants to make an offer on this package without the ammo included.  I will not sell the scope or mount seperate as they stay with the rifle.

I will gladly meet anywhere in NWA.  NWA is defined as Fayetteville to Bentonville and anywhere in between.  There are two ways to contact me: 1) reply to this posting or
2) call me at REDACTED.  Please do not send text message.  I can answer all your questions in 10 minutes of actual conversation vs. hours or texting back and forth.  Text messages will be ignored.

Shipping to out of State FFL is available.  Add $150 for packaging material and shipping costs.  This option requires USPS money order.  I do not accept PayPal or similar services.

The only possible trade that would interest me is a piston driven (ie: adjustable gas port) AR type rifle in .308 (7.62x51) caliber and cash difference.  Prefer new but will consider like new offer.

The LCP itself was purchased used a few years ago by me.  It's a limited edition OD frame version which is no longer available on the new market.  I've put maybe 300 rounds through it since I got it, and it has always worked fine for me.  It does have a small scuff on the bottom of the frame, near the magazine (I can't get it to show up on camera though - too much black on black).  Also has some holster wear on the blueing on the slide.  Mechanically, the thing is sound however.

Along with the LCP, you get:

-Original box, paperwork, and soft case
-Pachmayr rubber grip
-3x 6 round magazines; comes with two of the flush base plates, and two of the pinky extension base plates.
-Desantis pocket holster

380ACP Ammo:
130x Sellier and Belliot 92gr FMJ - my favorite range ammo
30x Federal Hydra-Sgok 90gr JHP
20x Buffalo Bore +P 100gr Hardcast lead - for those times you need to punch a hole through some walls
7x Unknown JHP on Starline brass - these came with the LCP when I bought them and have since forgotten what brand they are - I know they are factory loaded JHPs, and that's all I remember.

$350 for everything; must see some kind of proof that you can legally own a firearm (CHL, LEO/Military ID, recent gun purchase receipt, etc).  Not interested in trades.  Lowballs will be deleted without reply."

No, not in a organized events sense, but against the harshest critic of all time... me, and sometimes my husband. For me, participating in organized events is about proving yourself to others or measuring your performance in comparison to others. Refining skills, progressively getting better with improved shooting techniques, finessing firearms and handloads... that can be done without the noise, distraction, fanfare, politics and expense of organized events.

While my hat remains off to the folks who do participate in formal events, I will also say that it doesn't take a professional competitor to appreciate and utilize the features of a good target rifle, like this Ruger M77 Mark II Target.

The Ruger M77 Mark II Target is a different type of Ruger. It's big. This one is 48"" long in overall length with its 6.5 Creedmoor chambered, heavy contoured 28"" barrel. The barrel has an 8"" twist and is finished off with a recessed target crown. The matte gray stainless steel hardware is non-reflective and corrosion and bore erosion resistant. The barrel is full floating in the stock.

The laminated birch stock is wide in the forearm, flaring out from 1.75"" at the floor plate to 2.50"", making it ideal for shooting from a rest or other types of field support."
