I bought the rifle new out of the box a few months back so it's In great condition. I originally paid $650 so I'm basically taking $100 off for light use. 
 
  The build quality is great. The bolt and trunnions have been properly heat treated, The magazine well does not have excessive wobble, the tolerances are slightly tighter without excessive wearing which is why the rifle is very accurate, and the iron sights are perfect. I was able to hit an empty shotgun shell at 65yds first shot out of the box. I can show you the videos I took attesting for the accuracy when you stop by to check out the rifle. 
 
The reason I'm dropping the the price to $550 is I hit rough patch so the rifle needs to pay some bills the legal way haha. No trades, price is firm. It will come with one magazine and some ammunition."

Added to this lineup is our SIG551-A1, chambered for the widely used 5.56 x 45mm NATO caliber using Swiss Polymer magazines. The SIG551-A1 features a distinctive swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features six-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:7”. The SIG551-A1 measures 36.1” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 5.56 x 45mm NATO, the SIG551-A1 sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.      1500.00 o.b.o.   [gun is new unfired]   REDACTED very rare gun to find"

It has a great trigger and is a very accurate shooter.I am the original owner, having bought this pistol new at the end of March of this year. Exactly 150 rounds of brass jacketed ammunition have been fired through this pistol at the local gun range. It has been carefully and thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after every firing and has never been conceal carried. Has the normal friction marks on the barrel and chamber that all of the tilted barrel guns I have seen show after being fired, sometimes after just the test firing at the factory. I have never had a failure to feed or fire with this XD-S. These are great pistols...accurate, comfortable to shoot, durable, and easy to clean and carry. Included are the items that came with this package including the pistol, hard plastic case, stainless steel factory 7 round flush mount and 8 round Mid-Mag with X-Tension magazines, interchangeable back strap, paperwork, bore brush, and gun lock.I am also adding an additional stainless steel factory 8 round Mid-Mag with X-Tension magazine and a Pachmayr Tactical Grip Glove designed for the Springfield XD-S.Metal parts on the gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature.The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition.Local face-to-face cash sale only. Buyer must be at least 21, Oklahoma resident able to legally buy a firearm in Oklahoma, and must have a current valid Oklahoma issued picture ID. No exceptions."

They also told me that Chinese 54R is considered to be some of the best military-grade ammo in the 54R platform. The only way to tell if it was infantry or sniper ammo is to open the can or find someone who reads Chinese. I don't want to open the can and I am too old to learn Chinese.

A limited number of this commemorative fully-functional 92 that captures some of the lines and features of the Beretta Model 1915 of a century ago will be imported to the United States. This single-action-only steel 92 has a frame-mounted safety (no decocker) and has the years 1915 and 2015 engraved in Roman numerals on either side of the Brigadier-style slide. The same numerals are featured around the medallion logo in the center of the premium-wood grip panels. The whole is contained in an ammo-can-style Beretta box which also sports the anniversary dates. Only a month after Italy entered the First World War on the side of the allies Beretta patented the Model 1915 which was immediately adopted by the Italian military. Chambered in 9mm Glisenti a rather mild counterpart of the 9mm Parabellum on which it was actually based the Model 1915 single-action semiauto featured a cutaway on the slide and a minimally-protruding barrel two features that would become a hallmark of Beretta pistols in years to come. Curiously it also had two safety devices: one frame-mounted in the rear (similar to the one we have copied for the 92 Centennial) the other located above the trigger. The 92 Centennial tastefully imitates some of these features while also showcasing the very best of what Beretta has achieved in the intervening century.UPC: REDACTED48Vendor Part No: BER A5BJREDACTED
