Makes Rifle Run Cooler & Cleaner With Less Felt Recoil


Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on the gas block provides mounting space for a variety of front sights. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Replacement handguard provides extra internal clearance for piston rod and has internal shield to protect your hand from heat buildup during sustained fire. Separate models for three popular gas system lengths"

Private owner. I am not a dealer! Just got this in from ruger as a replacement to my damaged 1911. This is a new, never fired 1911. It was cleaned/greased already though. Also, the magazines have been used for about 20 shots each through another 1911. Comes with everything it would new: two magazines(used), soft case, gun lock, bushing wrench and all paper work/ads. 

i have another 1911, so i can afford to lose this. that's the only reason why i still haven't shot it yet.

Makes Rifle Run Cooler & Cleaner With Less Felt Recoil


Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on the gas block provides mounting space for a variety of front sights. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Replacement handguard provides extra internal clearance for piston rod and has internal shield to protect your hand from heat buildup during sustained fire. Separate models for three popular gas system lengths"

It is a backward firing BFONG (Blank Fire Only Gun). I have test fired it and used it at one event. Like all SS Room BFONG's it can be a bit touchy. So someone with a bit of technical know-how can likely get it chirping very reliably. It does NOT have the cut welds that Atlantic Wall used to do to these. It is recommended you do it for take down procedures to better clean and maintain the gun. So, it is in unmodified condition.

Yes! It is full auto. (But please be careful with how much you fire. Controlled bursts! Over doing it can damage the gun.)

I am not the first owner so I do not know how many rounds have been through it. I have put maybe 100 at most.

Comes with two drum mags and I will throw in a hiki make repro mag pouch. Also comes with original sling. Case pictured is included.

I have three holsters with it, two are form fit, one is a universal (and I believe completely unused, no idea where I ever came up with it.) I have ammo I'd include with it for the right price, I'll throw one box in the package from the start though. The case is a twin layer hard plastic case with foam inserts. I also have an aftermarket magazine that is a ridiculous 31rd mag for long days at the range and an uplula mag loader.
This gun is not new, and I'm not trying to represent it as such. It does have minor wear, less than you'd imagine for a gen 2. Its spent most of its life in a safe.

Original purchaser paid $4.77 (see pic) so that gives you an idea of what decade it was purchased. Selling as -is. $25 , 20 rounds. Or best offer cash or trade.  I could use 1,000 9mm brass cases in trade, maybe other calibers except 40s&w.
Pick up is in West Tacoma

 EOTech G33 3X Magnifier - $550.00
 Color: Black or Tan Available

 The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting. 

 This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights. G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

It’s a straight-forward carbine that should appeal to a wide user base looking for a hard-hitting tactical rifle.

The SRC-308 is a direct-impingement rifle with a 16.5-inch carbine-length barrel and a mid-length gas system. For the buttstock and handguard it uses common A2-style parts but for the magazine and grip they go up a step with a 20-round Magpul PMAG and Hogue over-molded pistol grip.

It is an “optics ready” rifle, meaning it does not come with any sights installed. Optics and iron sights are often a personal preference so this will help keep the overall price down. The SRC-308 has a receiver-height railed gas block and standard flattop upper receiver for mounting iron sights and other optics.

The railed gas block is another Windham design that features an accessory lug and a 12-o’clock quick-detach sling socket built in.

Windham appears to have developed the receivers in-house with lines and contours similar to their carbon fiber rifles. Appearances not withstanding, the SRC-308 is built on hard-anodized 7075-T6 receivers, upper and lower. The lower receiver is reinforced at the buffer tower and has quick-detach sling mounting sockets on both sides of the rifle. The design sports an integral trigger guard for simplicity.

Even with the beefed-up receivers the SRC-308 is fairly lightweight at 7.5 pounds unloaded. Other specifications include an overall length of 32 inches with the stock collapsed (38 with it completely extended), a one-in-10 right hand twist and of course, the barrel is chrome-lined 4150 chromoly-vanadium steel for a long life.

The controls are standard and familiar to anyone with experience with AR-type rifles. While they are right-handed, the lower receiver is marked on both sides for users who prefer to use left-handed or ambidextrous safety selectors.

I have here for sale the amazing and highly rated XDm 3.8 9mm. If you're reading this, I assume you know about the incredible reputation of this handgun by Springfield...

Its in Like New condition. 

I've done 2 small but important upgrades to it, otherwise its completely stock, and performs like new. I've cleaned and maintained it well using FrogLube,  and performs flawlessly.

I added a Pearce pinky extender to the smaller magazine, so now it feels much better when gripping it (and looks much better too!)

Also, I installed the TractionGrips to the grip of this XDm. It was great out of the box, and now its amazing. They're a very nice upgrade and won't slide off or wear out, but if you don't like them, they come off pretty easily and leave no residue or stickiness behind!

Comes with the original box/case, all the paperwork, lock, etc etc etc that came with it, PLUS….. I'm also included a nice nylon holster for it. 

Offering all of that, including the upgrades and holster, for just $570.

 Crucible: CPM S35VN:

 CPM S35VN is a martensitic stainless steel designed to offer improved toughness over CPM S30V. It is also easier to machine and polish than CPM S30V. Its chemistry has been rebalanced so that it forms some niobium carbides along with vanadium and chromium carbides. Substituting niobium carbides for some of the vanadium carbides makes CPM S35VN about 15-20% tougher than CPM S30V without any loss of wear resistance. CPM S35VN's improved toughness gives it better resistance to edge chipping.

 Because both vanadium and niobium carbides are harder and more effective than chromium carbides in providing wear resistance, the CPM stainless blade steels offer improved edge retention over conventional high chromium steels such as 440C and D2. The transverse toughness of the CPM grades is four or more times that of 440C and 154CM. The CPM process produces very homogeneous, high quality steel characterized by superior dimensional stability, grindability, and toughness compared to steels produced by conventional melting practices."

It was designed as a ""first rifle"" for kids. This was the only Winchester single shot bolt action that cocked automatically on opening the bolt. Opening the bolt engages the safety automatically; it must be released to fire the gun after the bolt is engaged. Earlier bolts were straight-handled, later ones used swept-back handles. This one has a swept-back handle; if it's like the similar 69As, I'd estimate date of manufacture as 1954. Bolt handle, rear of bolt are chromed (or in the white, I can't really tell), as is the trigger, which is grooved. Optionally available were peep rear sights coupled with ramped front sights, similar to those offered on the 69/69As and the 72/72As. Bolt is similar to the one used on the 69As, 72s, and 75s, but is unique to this model. It has a stud at the rear of the bolt which actuates the automatic safety (illustrated). The stock has a groove to clear this stud in back of the bolt. The barrel is obviously also used on the 69A, as it has a dovetail for the 69A stock stud. There is no trigger adjustment, and there is lots of over travel on the trigger.

Works great. Used for plinking and squirrel. Wood is clean with a nice patina, the bluing is faded.

The flash hider is pinned on so the barrel cannot be removed. That means it will require a rail/handguard that used a standard barrel nut (such as Samson Evo rail, or Fortis rev). There is a small amount of normal wear around the takedown holes and on the top rail, otherwise is in excellent, like new condition. It ran flawlessly, I just need to sell some excess parts.

From Glock
""The GLOCK 41 Gen4 is a practical/tactical .45 AUTO caliber pistol designed with the superior engineering of GLOCK to maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. The longer barrel and slide help to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil while the longer sight radius provides better accuracy for competition or duty use."""

I haven't had time to take my own pic and upload it but the pic is a stock image and the same as my Glock 30 Gen 3. 

I have a Glock 30 GEN 3 (45 Auto) like new. I bought the gun back in 2012 only put 120 rds through it at the time of purchase. Extremely little carry time with it, no wear and tear or marks/scratches on the gun. It has been well cared for and cleaned and maintained. Makes for an excellent carry gun (with 10+1 capacity).

Included would be: 
Glock 30 Gen 3 (45 Auto)
3 ten rd mags (all Glock, no imitation mags) which are impossible to find right now

Original box with paperwork, cleaning brush, test shells, etc

I'm asking $500. I think this is pretty fair deal so please don't low ball me. Paid $600 out the door for the gun, and $30 for the 3rd mag."

The KG-9 was an open bolt ""paramilitary"" blued steel pistol, sales of which the BATF stopped due to the open bolt being too easy to convert to full- auto.

 The Devtron Scopecoat™ is constructed using high-quality Neoprene (2mm thick) core, and laminated with Nylon. Its simple yet effective design safeguards your scope against dings, scuffs, scratches, dust, dirt, and moisture. The absorptive qualities of the Neoprene draw moisture and condensation away from your scope and helps protect it from the elements. 

 Scopecoat™ stretches approximately 10% and the ""perfect fit"" is a matter of personal preference -- ranging between a relaxed fit to a more form-fitted one. 

 Scopecoat™ fits a variety of scopes and our sizing guides help you select the right one for you."

I am selling a variety of parts for the Mossberg 500/590 and an AK stock. I will NOT mix any of the sets. I will ONLY sell the sets together. Details of the parts are below:

Note: These parts were taking from NEW and UNFIRED firearms.

Speed Feed stock. This stock has places on each side that fits 2 shells each, making it hold 4 total. Bolt and washer used to attach the stock is included.

Mako-Fab Tri Rail Forend. The side rails are removable. Make sure your forend is removable and that your slide tube is 7 5/8 inches long!! Will not fit the shorter tubes without an extended castle nut!

Together purchased online will cost you around $130+ total. I am asking $65 for this set.

Archangel AA500sc Stock, Forend, and Shell holder set. Here is the info taken from Promag's website:

A six-position, collapsible butt-stock allows shot-gunners of all sizes to find the optimum adjustment for fit and comfort.  The military-length forend can be configured with a smooth fore-cap, or with a mini tri-rail cap to allow the mounting of Picatinny rail-mount accessories without sacrificing comfort or convenience.  A 7-round shell holder mounts to the left side of the receiver and includes individual shell-retention adjustment for each round, without interfering with the stroke of the forend.

Everything is included in the set, and also for installation (bolts, allen wrench for stock bolt).

This set online goes for around $115-130+ total. I am asking $75 for this set.

Tapco Fixed AK Stock. This black fixed stock has a metallic butt plate and a sling swivel on the side. The 2 screws that attach to the front are included.

These go online for $30+ total. I am asking $15 for this stock.

I am willing to meet locally at a public place. I will only drive so far, depending on distance. I have met previous buyers at a gun store called The Gun Zone in Mesquite (for your consideration). If willing to pay for shipping, I could possibly ship these items to you (once we agree to a payment method).

If interested and/or have any questions. I'd prefer being contacted by email at
