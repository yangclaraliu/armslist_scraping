Some were with sear safties, some wheren't. Some had serial numbered barrels, some didn't. This one has the hole in the frame for a sear safety but none was ever installed. According to research the factory making sear safties was destroyed by an allied bombing raid in 1941. I suppose that they installed what they could come up with. The barrel on this one is not numbered. It is all matching from my inspection. I have not stripped it down because I don't want to chance adding scratches, etc. The collector that I got it from said he had taken it apart once and the internal #s matched. A local gunsmith rated it 98%-98%+. Whatever number you assign it; it is a beauty and with 2 matching mags, marked 1&2, with eagle L on bases and fxo and P.08 on mag bodies with eagle/37.

This is my SP-01 Tactical, Decocker, Night Sights. It's definitely not a safe queen with maybe 1000-1500 rounds through it. It could use a good cleaning but everything functions great. Attached are the ""imperfections"" Nothing here effects function but I prefer to be honest. The scars on the frame are from the hammer install and you have to move the decocker down as seen to even really notice it. There is also minor surface discoloration on the barrel. I probably easily have 1000 or so into it.

Our 9mm incendiary utilizes a compound similar to the Roufoss incendiary mixture { IM23 maximum amount possible } and is ballistically identical to the USGI M882 Ball ammunition. The full metal jacket, (FMJ), incendiary projectile detonates on impact with a hard surface and produces a brilliant white flash and a large cloud of smoke making it ideal for immediate feedback to the shooter. Use caution when using this ammunition as it is able to ignite flammable materials! this ammunition has a blue color code on the tip.

The catch.. I'm Basically throwing in the scope for free.  It works fine, but I wouldn't call it flawless.  The parallax adjustment seems to get funky?  I'm no scope expert but I do have decently bad astigmatism and I have trouble with having both the retical and target focus at the same time.  My friends don't have this problem but I do.  I don't have the problem on other scopes so I consider it an issue.  I never shot the gun enough to be bothered but I like to be as honest as possible about my listings."

Up for sale is a pristine LNIB Bill Wilson Carry CQB with a build date of 1/2011 that is absolutely flawless. Current list is $3300 for these bad boys and over 18 month wait. If you want the ultimate carry 1911...here you go. 

Price is $3000 shipped and will consider +/- cash trades for other high end 1911s(Wilson, Nighthawk, SACS, GI, etc...). This gun needs a new home where it will be carried and shot. Thanks!

This is an exact clone of what you will find on Bill Wilson’s hip on a daily basis. The Bill Wilson Carry Pistol is based on our CQB Compact with some custom upgrades. The front of the slide has our carry cuts to narrow the muzzle. The top of the slide is serrated at 30 LPI. The frame has the round butt modification to provide a more comfortable carry and minimize printing. The slide stop post has been recessed and the hole chamfered to allow the use of Crimson Trace laser grips if so desired.

Two flush fitting 5 round mags and one extended 6 round. It also comes with a very nice (and comfortable) Galco leather strap on ankle holster. This is the smallest 40 on the market and is great for deep concealment. I really like this pistol and don't want to get rid of it. The only trade I would make would be for a full size pistol as I do not carry concealed. I would prefer to stick with .40 or .45, however, I am not opposed to the 9mm either on some guns. This gun has about 150 rounds through it so it is not even out of kahr's ""required"" 200 round break-in phase.

Cash Price is as follow…(I got these on gunbroker.com for used condition even though it is still in the break in phase)

CM40- $450.00
2 mags - $50.00
Galco leather ankle ""glove"" is new for 90.00 on midway.com but I'll only price it at $50.00 even though it is practically new. 

So total package is $550.

It has a 28 inch barrel with a full choke.  This shotgun has been range tested and is 100% fully functional however there are a couple of cosmetic problems.  First, the magazine nut has  been scarred because some genius used a set of pliers on it at some point.  The other thing is the stock started to crack near the tang, which was a common problem which these older gun stocks, so there was a repair made using brass screws.  This repair actually does not look that bad because the heads of the screws were polished down and clear coated over and the stock is stronger now that it ever was before.  Other than that the bluing is a little thin in places but nothing major and the bore looks good.

The real beauty of this system is that 1 remote works all 3 lighting banks. And since there's 3 remotes, you can put them in various places.

I've got 3 of the light systems in the link above.  These are radio frequency controlled, so the on/off remote can be put anywhere, it doesn't have to point at the lighting fixture to control it. You can actually have it anywhere in the safe or even in the room it's in. I had the remote in the door hanger.

I shoot the Winchester partition gold slugs 2 3/4"". They really pack a punch and cost around $15 per box at Dunhams but they are very accurate and very powerful.  I have an extra butt pad on the gun to absorb the shoulder impact and that really helps a lot.  My third daughter killed a nice big doe at 135 yards this year with this gun and doesn't want me to sell it but I think I better.  If you prefer a very sensitive trigger do not buy this gun as it has a bit of a stiff trigger and it is something you'd have to get used to I think.  I'm going to leave the scope on it till I sell it but I am going to take it off and put my 4x Simmons on it since my wife got this Cabela's scope for me for Christmas I better save it :).

It appears to have been a safe queen as the fit and finish on all surfaces are near perfect. When tested at our range I found the rifle had not been sighted in, so I zeroed it at 100 yards. The rifle performed perfectly. The 7600 is built to deliver legendary Remington® first-shot accuracy, they’re also designed for ultra-fast follow-up shots – without ever having to unshoulder your rifle, and is one of the most proven deerslayers in the woods. Remington’s rotary bolt lock-up design for exceptional strength, safety and reliability. You can't find a big-game rifle with a better combination of practical shooting features: twin action bars provide slick, smooth operation for rapid repeat shots; a quick-release, drop-out four-round magazine that loads and unloads instantly; and a free-floated barrel that matches the accuracy of the best bolt guns. Comes with 4 magazines.
 An ideal cross-over rifle for pump-gun wingshooters. The Monte Carlo walnut stock with optional high-gloss finished stock is beautiful. 
 KEY FEATURES:
• Comes with a 3-9x50 scope mounted and zeroed at 100 yards.
• Robust slide-action design allows for fast follow-up shots in the harshest conditions.
• Action, slide release and safety based on the design of the Model 870™, America's most popular pump shotgun, for instantaneous user familiarity.
• Weight distribution and slim line design result in shotgun like balance and pointability.
• 22"" barrel with 3-9x50 scope
• Rotary-bolt lock-up provides rock-solid action strength.
• THIS RIFLE IS IN BEAUTIFUL CONDITION.
 MSRP without the scope is $772. YOUR PRICE with the scope is $500. Trades considered. Call Ted for details. REDACTED"

The T1 series is optmized for “the basics” and enhanced simplicity. Mission-critical elements such as the trigger, sights, and grip have been enhanced. The T1 is an excellent platform to build upon for future needs. 
ADVANTAGES 
• Improved trigger performance for reliability, speed and control. 
• Enhanced sighting for quicker target acquisition. 
• Overall greater speed, accuracy and control. The pistol frame is reshaped and textured for a more positive grip and improved index. High double undercut allows a higher grip with both hands improving mechanical leverage to counteract muzzle flip. 
A reduced backstrap hump makes the gun less grip sensitive and points more naturally. The CCW stipple texture is dehorned on the right and left panel so it does not print or scratch when concealed carried. 
Tactical Enhancements 
ZEV DUTY Drop In Trigger 
- Billet aluminum trigger system appropriate for defense, CCW, or duty usage. 
ZEV Combat Iron Sights 
Stainless Steel corrosion resistant contruction with durable black coating. 
ZEV Extended Magazine Release 
- Allows speed reloads without shifting your grip.

I have letters from Colt that indicate these were both shipped as blued revolvers. I will include the letters in the sale. I purchased these from an estate and the son of the previous owner told me his dad had purchased these new and sent them back to colt to have them nickeled and the trigger, cylinder release and hammer gold plated. I called Colt and spoke to the Custom Shop and they are not able to see if they did the work unless I had the work order number. I have no way of knowing who did the nickel and gold finishes for sure. These are spotless and I have not fired them since purchasing....Only Serious Buyers Please"

Further, and this is just my personal recommendation having worn these helmets for years, buy yourself a better suspension system.  There are many on the market and the one included is the Army issue one, which frankly is substandard at best.  Other than that, you are getting a great helmet that has a few scuffs, but is otherwise in superb condition.  Please do not confuse this with the much cheaper Kevlar Helmets of years before.
