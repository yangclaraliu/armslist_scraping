I am the original owner, have run < 100 rounds through it, and have kept it clean and appropriately lubricated. This pistol is a scaled-down version of the famous Colt 1911 model and, except for the reduced dimensions, is nearly identical in appearance and function. This is a great, easy-to-conceal Colt and has just the right combination of weight, balance, sight size, barrel length and grip length to be easy and comfortable to shoot. I have shot a variety of ball and hollow-point ammunition and never experienced a jam or misfire.

This Govt model Colt had a very short manufacturing window and is thus becoming more and more difficult to find. It has emerged as a genuine collectible. Other specks include a 3.25"" barrel, black original Colt grips, original box and all paperwork that was packaged by Colt.

I'll be happy to throw in two compatible holsters. One is a injected-molded, high density plastic Fobus BS-2 paddle holster and the other a nylon-constructed Hafner clip holster.

The market range for these pistols are $700 - $950 ... and, again, the gun is in exceptional condition, I am the original owner, it is a low-use weapon, I'm offering it with the original box and paperwork, and am throwing in the two holsters.

Century built, but does have the correct 5.45 barrel and does not keyhole, internet searches will tell you early versions have these issues, and I can send pics and serial no. confirming this does not. This is a well-cared for rifle, but it has some slight issues. I had gunsmithing done to fix a canted front sight base and stuck muzzle brake. It is made from non-matching parts kit, and has a non-chrome lined barrel. There is some corrosion on the muzzle end from where the brake was stuck on, but the crown and bore are in very good condition (less than 500 rds, non-corrosive new production stuff shot through it). It is an accurate rifle and has never had a FTF or FTE issue on the range.

Email me for additional pics or questions, and we can exchange numbers to discuss details. I'm willing to drive a moderate distance in eastern Iowa, but would like to handle at an FFL dealer (I will cover cost). For an extra $50 will throw in 210 rounds of Silver Bear non-corrosive, nickel plated 5.45.

This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

The scope and scope mount have been removed (cheap little Tasco scope blew out) but the mount is available if you want it. Shot very little, but it shot flawlessly when it did! She just sits in the safe so I would like to have her go to a good home where she will get played with more. Three mags come with it. Face to face transaction and sale price is cash only!

It has only been fired on two range trips for a total of 80 rounds and cleaned well after each trip.  I also added a nice compensator to it made right here inTucson from Black weapons armory X-Comp.  It works really well.  http://www.blackweaponsarmory.com/bwa-x-comps/bwa-x-comp-308-7-62-compensator-5-8-x-24-thread.html   Is the link to the 7.62 comp if you want to check it out.  I also have 920 rounds of 147 grain ammo to go with it.  All you need is any normal 5.56/223 lower, attach the upper and you are set.  It uses normal 5.56 mags...only difference is the barrell and of course, the extra power you get from .300 blackout (7.62 x 35).  You can use this to hunt hog, deer, etc... too.  This was part ofthe reason I bought it, but since I have yet to go hunting after owning this gun for a year, I doubt I will go anytime soon.  

If you are not familiar with .300 blackout, do some research and watch Travis Haley's youtube video on the year of the .300 blackout http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tgKjbySsAik  
This thing will last...after all, it is Daniel Defense.
Overall, selling the ammo for about .76 cents/round which is a pretty good rate plus $850 for the upper with the (cost me $120 plus tax)X-compensator on it.  Thanks for looking.
Note that sight does not come with upper.  It also does come with the never opened rail pieces you can place where ever gou want on the modular float rail.
Not particularly looking for a trade, but you can always offer me something I can't refuse."

This retails for 69.95 plus s/h from N82 Tactical.  I am asking 65.00 OBO.  I have decided that I am not an IWB kind of person, so I am simply looking to get some of my investment back.  Thanks, for looking.

Asking $375 firm. 

The shotgun was taken to a gunsmith years ago to have both barrels changed to modified rather then the full/ modified standard. 

The gun smith apparently wasn't the best because he did a horrible weld job on the two barrels that is completely hidden under the hand guard. 
Other then aesthetics, the gun shoots great and is awesome looking due to the hand guard hiding the crappy welds. 

The gun sells used for $500 consistently so I have lowered the price due to the welds.

This is the 1st civilian version of the military M16 to be issued to the public. It is in really good condition and will make someone a great trophy gun. It is in great firing condition and has not been fired since 1995. It has spent it's life in a gun safe ever since. Everyone that see's it in our store thinks that it is a fully automatic M16 and no one wants the newer AR15 after seeing it's past in this one. It is known for it's triangular hand guard and bayonet lug and some other features listed below. The features below were shared with the M16. 

Slickside The earliest version of the AR-15 upper receiver which can easily be identified by its lack of forward assist and brass deflector. This type of receiver was used on the original M16, USAF weapons, and the SP1 civilian rifle. 

The bayonet lug on AR-15 rifles is a small protrusion on the front underside of the gas block. This is present on the majority of Colt AR-15 military rifles, but is omitted in the case of some carbines as it is redundant due to the bayonet requiring a longer barrel to be mounted onto. It is also absent from a number of civilian rifles, most notably the Match Target rifles, in order to comply with various laws and regulations. 

The iconic M16 flash hider often referred to as the “Birdcage”, and was on a closed design to address problems encountered with the duckbill type flash hiders snagging on vegetation. Introduced on the M16A1, it has 6 ports equally distributed around the flash hider. 

Shipping is $30 and that includes Insurance on the gun. It is a great rifle that you can be proud of. If you are a Vietnam Vet then this will look very familiar to you and bring back some memories of the past."

Its in great shape and is exceptionally accurate while staying in a compact size.  Same size as a Glock 19 but with a shorter, easier to conceal grip.

This is also the hard to find compact model as mentioned with a shorter grip than the standard cougar, as well as a frame mounted rail. 
I'm moving on from 9mm caliber guns so it will come with all of my remaining 9mm ammo, 525 rounds of 115grn FMJ and close to another 100 rounds of HP's.

I'd really like to trade for a revolver.  I primarily like Rugers, would really like to have a .38 or .357 SP101 or a GP100 in any barrel length.  I'm not super picky though about brand, so let me know what you have, but I'm ONLY looking for .38 special/.357 magnum revolvers.
The ONLY semi auto's I would be interested in would be mid to full sized .40's, prefer da/sa but again, I'm not super picky.

Yugo(Serbian) OPAP M70,unfired in box,three 30 rd European mags.I've bleached and stained the stock with mahogony stain and gave it a cpl coats of semi gloss poly.Looks very good.Also had a bayo lug added,and comes with a Romanian bayo.

Norinco SKS.I've put a new Tapco collapsable stock on,Barska scope with see through dust cover mount.This was a file fit mount that is very tight and I've not sighted it in,but I'm certainit will hold zero.Has a Harris style bipod.Has AK 74 style brake.Comes with three Tapco 20 rd mags.I've also made a bayo lug for this one that uses an AK type bayo.Comes with a Romanian bayo.

1946 Mosin Nagant M44This is a very nice project that I've just gotten started on.Metal is pretty decent.Finish was gone,so I rattle canned all the metal flat black to do until I can get it coated.I just put it in a new $200+ Rhineland Arms Leopard walnut stock,which I finished in mahogony stain with a few coats of gloss poly.If you haven't saw these stocks,it has an adjustable cheekpiece,spring assist recoil pad,barrel is floated,etc.It is a thumbhole style.Bayo lug has been removed and no optics or mount included.If I don't trade it the next step is a bent bolt and scope mount.

Mossberg 500 12 gauge home defense style shotgun.Finish isn't great but perfectly functional gun.Has 20 inch barrel,I believe 8+1 capacity,polymer furniture,ventilated heat shield,sling studs etc.This gun is very similar to a 590,but has standard bead front sight and no bayo lug.

The only potential trade is for a project car of some kind.Something along the lines of a 62-65 or 68-72 Nova,78 or newer Malibu,77 or newer Impala or Caprice,maybe a 60-63 Falcon,an old coupe shell,such as a Model A,maybe a Datsun 510,VW Beetle,etc.Looking for a 2 dr project.Not limited to these specific cars.Will trade any,all or any combination,depending on what's offered.Good,solid straight body highly preferred over a drivetrain.

May also consider something along the lines of a nice early 2000s Beetle with no issues as a trade.

EDIT:
Due to several inquiries within the first few hours of this post,I should add that I'm not currently looking to sell any of the guns.If I don't get a trade that interests me,I might eventually price them,but as I'm really only looking for a trade and don't need to sell them,it would likely be a package deal and wouldn't be remotely cheap.
EDIT II:
Although I do appreciate all the good and fair trade offers for other guns,I'm not interested in any gun trades whatsoever.These are the guns I bought because these are the guns I wanted.If the right trade,mentioned above,doesn't come along,I'll likely just keep them.I'm a gun guy,I love guns.I'm just kinda wanting to get started back into another project car(I'm a car guy too),without initially putting out any cash."

This is the 1st civilian version of the military M16 to be issued to the public. It is in really good condition and will make someone a great trophy gun. It is in great firing condition and has not been fired since 1995. It has spent it's life in a gun safe ever since. Everyone that see's it in our store thinks that it is a fully automatic M16 and no one wants the newer AR15 after seeing it's past in this one. It is known for it's triangular hand guard and bayonet lug and some other features listed below. The features below were shared with the M16. 

Slickside The earliest version of the AR-15 upper receiver which can easily be identified by its lack of forward assist and brass deflector. This type of receiver was used on the original M16, USAF weapons, and the SP1 civilian rifle. 

The bayonet lug on AR-15 rifles is a small protrusion on the front underside of the gas block. This is present on the majority of Colt AR-15 military rifles, but is omitted in the case of some carbines as it is redundant due to the bayonet requiring a longer barrel to be mounted onto. It is also absent from a number of civilian rifles, most notably the Match Target rifles, in order to comply with various laws and regulations. 

The iconic M16 flash hider often referred to as the “Birdcage”, and was on a closed design to address problems encountered with the duckbill type flash hiders snagging on vegetation. Introduced on the M16A1, it has 6 ports equally distributed around the flash hider. 

Shipping is $30 and that includes Insurance on the gun. It is a great rifle that you can be proud of. If you are a Vietnam Vet then this will look very familiar to you and bring back some memories of the past."

This is the 1st civilian version of the military M16 to be issued to the public. It is in really good condition and will make someone a great trophy gun. It is in great firing condition and has not been fired since 1995. It has spent it's life in a gun safe ever since. Everyone that see's it in our store thinks that it is a fully automatic M16 and no one wants the newer AR15 after seeing it's past in this one. It is known for it's triangular hand guard and bayonet lug and some other features listed below. The features below were shared with the M16. 

Slickside The earliest version of the AR-15 upper receiver which can easily be identified by its lack of forward assist and brass deflector. This type of receiver was used on the original M16, USAF weapons, and the SP1 civilian rifle. 

The bayonet lug on AR-15 rifles is a small protrusion on the front underside of the gas block. This is present on the majority of Colt AR-15 military rifles, but is omitted in the case of some carbines as it is redundant due to the bayonet requiring a longer barrel to be mounted onto. It is also absent from a number of civilian rifles, most notably the Match Target rifles, in order to comply with various laws and regulations. 

The iconic M16 flash hider often referred to as the “Birdcage”, and was on a closed design to address problems encountered with the duckbill type flash hiders snagging on vegetation. Introduced on the M16A1, it has 6 ports equally distributed around the flash hider. 

Shipping is $30 and that includes Insurance on the gun. It is a great rifle that you can be proud of. If you are a Vietnam Vet then this will look very familiar to you and bring back some memories of the past."

The scope on the rifle is a Millet TRS-1, 6-14x50mm Mil-Dot with an illuminated reticule which is great for those low light, long range shots.  I am selling the rifle in order to build a new long range rifle.  I have about 200 rounds through it and the bi-pod is included.  If interested email me at bmnelson12@gmail.com."

The rifle will come as pictured but I will include a magazine with it.   

The only reason I am selling this is due to the other half thinking that I do not need the amount of AR's I have.  

Not really interested in any trades unless its reloading gear.  Powder, primers, die sets I do not currently have, Lock n Load Press.

The price is some-what negotiable, but I am in no hurry to get rid of this so do not low-ball me please.  As for meeting to sell this rifle, I am fine with that and will be done at a public place.  I am willing to drive a little bit for the deal to happen, but would like to keep my driving time under an hour due to work and kids."

The out of the box accuracy of this rifle is remarkable.  After purchasing the rifle and doing a standard break in, it was shooting sub MOA right away with 168gr, Federal, Sierra Match King Ammo.  The rifle comes standard with an Accu-Stock, Accu-trigger, 4 round detachable box magazine and oversized bolt knob.  All of which I have found to be a great asset to the rifle.  The barrel is a limited production 20"" heavy fluted barrel with 5R rifling and 11.25 twist.  The barrel is also threaded which allows for a muzzle brake, flash suppressor, or even a sound suppressor.  The scope on the rifle is a Millet TRS-1, 6-14x50mm Mil-Dot with an illuminated reticle which is great for those low light, long range shots.  I am selling the rifle in order to build a new long range rifle.  I have about 200 rounds through it and the bi-pod is included."
