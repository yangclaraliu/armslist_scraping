I am looking for a Gen 3 or 4 Glock 23 or Glock 27.  Any trade may or may not also need to include cash depending on what you have. I don't need Ammo! 

 There was a limited amount of OD Green Gen 4 guns made. Most of what I've seen we're other models and not the 26. Recently I had my local gun dealer contact Glock and they said they were not making any color other then Black. I've found a few that have sold on Gunbroker or Armslist but not many.
Would like to deal with other CCW holders

I am technically the second owner, although the first owner never actually fired the weapon.  This was my CCW gun and I have not had a chance to use it much at all.  A little over 200 rounds through it.  Most of which were at range where I assisted in a CCW class.

All work to gun has been done by a Glock Certified Armorer, as this is my CCW gun I don't trust it to anyone else.  Gun comes installed with:

- Ghost EVO Elite 3.5lb Trigger Connector - reduces trigger pull and eliminates ""Bump"" altogether. This is not a ""Drop In"" part it has been custom fit to this gun.

- Wolf 6lb Trigger Spring

- Polished Glock OEM Trigger Bar 

- Brass Stackers Trapezoid Slide Release  

- The gun will come with factory sights!!!.....UNLESS the gun your trading me already has night sights, if so then it will come with Trijicon Night Sights Front/Back.

ALSO INCLUDED are all the OEM Standard parts listed above.  If you don't want one of these upgraded parts I will have it swapped out back to factory parts but everything is included.

- Cabela's waterproof locking hard travel case with custom fit lining - See pics. Has storage under top insert as well.

- Standard Glock Factory case With Mag Assist Loader, Gun Lock and all Gen 4 Beavertail inserts, cleaning brush ect.

- 4 Glock 10 round mags

- 1 Glock 10 round mag With Glock +2 Extention

- 1 Glock 10 round mag with Pierce +2 Extention

- 1 ProMag 30 round mag

- Pierce Grip Plug

- Spare Mag Belt Pouch

- Trigger Lock with keys

Made in Italy (Recent production - I guess 2012 or 2013).  Three new Beretta 12-round magazines are included.  Comes with all manuals, box, etc. as from factory.

The Model 96A1 represents Beretta's latest evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol, the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history. Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two, these pistols feature a removable front sight that allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight. The frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The single-piece captive recoil spring assembly simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss. An internal recoil buffer increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition. The trigger guard is rounded to conform with current pistol gripping practices. 

Three 12-round magazines are included. 

Would like local deal, but may ship at actual cost through my FFL.

Price is $650 firm - which is what I have paid including shipping and FFL fees in February of 2013.  Not in rush to sell!  Will keep it, but may trade on very good condition Beretta 96 INOX.  No 96Ds please."

After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's Mauser Karabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. 

This particular rifle is all numbers matching M48A -- a lower production version of the M48 only made for four years.  Condition is between 95-99%.  Bore is extremely bright and rifling lands are deep and crisp.  This is a true factory bent-bolt with a smooth action that one would expect from a quality Mauser.

Lightly used, in box, with buttstock extensions, and scope mounts.

The Remington 700 SPS Compact model has seen little use as it was my back-up deer rifle. It has a 20"" barrel and black synthetic stock with grey rubberized accents on both the forend and pistol grip. It has butt-stock inserts so that the length of pull can be set for anyone from youth hunters to full-sized adults. The 20"" barrel is a great length for anyone hunting from box blinds and treestands. It's a shooter.

If you're unfamiliar with 7mm-08, you should look up the ballistics and trajectory as compared to the 308 and 270 on Remingron's website and the recoil tables from Chuck Hawks. Really a nice deer and larger predator round. Flat shooting, plenty of power, lighter recoil. My wife shoots the same gun in a right handed model and won't consider anything else.

$475

The lowest price I've been able to find on these, and there aren't many available, is $584 before tax. I'll leave the scope mounts on the rifle for $475. Not interested in lower offers. For any less than that, it makes a great back-up.

It's the Cadillac of AK-47s and it functions flawlessly and is as accurate as an AK-47 can be.  These are the most sought after guns in the AK world, and a quick search on gunbroker will show you how much they go for.  It comes with 8 steel 30-round mags, 1 75 round drum, and I can throw in up to 1k rounds of WPA ammo, as well.  I have more pictures upon request. NOTE: I've gotten a few emails about this not being pre-ban. Just wanted to include that info in the description. The muzzle break has been tacked on, but the welds can easily be removed with a dremel. The bayonet lug has been cut off, as well."

Savage 111 LRH in 6.5 x 284 Norma. 26"" 1-8"" twist barrel, Accustock, Accutrigger, Karsten adjustable cheekpiece. The rifle has just over 400 rounds through it and shoots exceptionally well. Best loads were 139 grain Lapua Scenar and H4831SC, 140 grain Nosler Accubond and H4831SC.

There are a couple of issues with it. The stock has a rubber type coating on it and it has started to peel near the floorplate. Also, I never used the muzzle brake and it is now stuck closed. I have soaked it in brake cleaner and also soaked it it Kroil and followed it up with brake cleaner and it wont budge. I did not try heating it. In the process of trying to get it freed up, I have damaged a couple of spots on the knurled part of the brake. See photos. 

I will sell the Rifle with scope base for $500 firm. No low ball offers please. 

**The scope is a Nikon Monarch UCC 3.3-10x44 with mildot reticle, mounted in Burris Signature Zee Rings. 
I have a set of RCBS dies with an additional custom VLD seater plug made for 139 grain Lapua Scenar. I also have a Forster Ultra micrometer seater. 

**Will let the whole rig go for $650 cash, firm. This includes the rifle, the scope, rings and bases and dies. 

**I would consider trades/partial trades for Smith M&P Shield, M&P 9c or 40c, Kahr PM9. Might be interested in a Glock or Springfield Subcompact.

Bought this trigger for a rifle I built and test fired with a few rounds, but then bought a new POF that already came with a SSA so no longer need this one.

The Geissele Super Dynamic - 3 Gun (SD-3G) trigger is a semi-automatic-only derivative of the two-stage Super Select-Fire (SSF) combat trigger that Geissele Automatics produces for customers in the U.S. Special Operations Community. The SD-3G was developed to combine the SSF combat trigger’s match-grade semi-automatic performance with its smooth single-stage full-automatic feel to make a fast, smooth, and robust trigger ideal for 3 Gun competition shooting. The new Geissele Super Dynamic - 3 Gun trigger has a super short trigger pull and a short reset so that rounds can be sent
downrange as quickly as possible while still maintaining superb accuracy. 

Features
•The Super Dynamic Triggers are rugged, non-adjustable combat triggers with a sear design that provides a wide margin of safety against unintentional discharges yet still gives the operator a sharp, repeatable trigger release. The exclusive, flat trigger bow, patterned after the trigger of an M1911 pistol, reduces the perceived pull weight of the triggers and gives outstanding tactile feedback and trigger control."

MPN: 01-107-09079

I purchased a new Daniel Defense M4V7, and I'd simply like to use a different handguard rail than the Modular Float Rail 12.0.

The MFR has never been used. It was removed from the AR-15 prior to ever shooting the gun.The rail is perfect for a shooter that wants a mostly slick handguard with the option to place accessories in multiple positions and places throughout the rail. The rail includes everything in the pictures. You will need a spanner wrench to install the barrel nut. This is available at most hardware stores.

The Daniel Defense MFR 12.0 is a 12"" CNC Machined Modular Free Float Handguard. It is specifically designed to adequately cover a low profile gas block on a carbine or mid-length gas system barrel. The MFR 12.0 has been engineered to provide each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an unitterupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don’t.

The slim profile feature of the MFR 12.0 keeps the shooter’s support hand close to the bore which aids in firearm manipulation, and the design and construction allow for the attachment of Picatinny Rail Sections at standard 90 degree or offset angles.

It has lived most of its life inside my safe, which is why I've decided to sell it to someone who will take it out and run it like it deserves.  That, and I'd like to put the money towards something else.  This rifle has straight sights, and has been zeroed for 50 yards, and it's held it well.  It features a chrome lined barrel.  It has never once malfunctioned, and I doubt it ever will.  It is, after all, an AK.  It gobbles up steel cased ammo like a champ, which is great if you're on a budget.  Lastly, I'd like to note that I installed a Tapco 74 style muzzle brake on it, which really does help with recoil and muzzle climb when firing quickly.  Please email me with any questions."
