Woodleigh Protected Point bullets are Australian made hunting bullets with a reputation for quality and performance on all types of game.

Protected Point bullets feature a soft lead core with six internal grooves that allow for reliable expansion. The nose of the bullet is more of a spire point than a round nose and a minimal amount of lead is shown which protects the nose of the bullet from deformation under recoil in the magazine of bolt action rifles. The Protected Point bullet has been tested on a variety of game of all sizes and each time it produces consistent and devastating results.

Note: For ultimate bullet expansion and results, it is recommended that this bullet be fired in a load with an impact velocity no greater than 2400 fps and no less than 1900 fps.

Capacity	15 rounds .22LR, 17 rounds .22L, 21 rounds .22S
Length	36 ½""
Barrel Length	18 ¼""
Weight	5.25 lbs.
Stock	Straight-grip American walnut
Sights	Adjustable rear, hooded front sight

Finish	Blued barrel and leverThe Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

The barrel length is 18¼"", overall length is 36¼"" and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long and as many as 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi-automatic .22. And, a lot more fun to shoot.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.


Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever

Both are 115gr. FMJ 50/box.

Depending on where you shop this ammo retails between $14 and $17 a box. I value my ammo at a very conservative .30/shot or $15 dollars a box. Yes, you could buy it a little bit cheaper if you catch some on the shelf at Walmart, but you'll have to make 30-40 trips to the store to try and get a quantity like this together. That's a lot of time and fuel to save a few pennies per shot. Please note that no matter how ""like new"" your used rifle is I will not give you suggested retail plus a $10 fee in value, nor will I trade the whole lot for your pistol that cost $250 brand new. I'm not here trying to rip anyone off, but I'm not an idiot either, please be realistic.

I am most interested in a .22LR target style pistol, but will consider hand guns in .380 ACP, .40 S&W, 9mm Luger, or .357 magnum.

Willing to trade up, down, or straight across. Can add cash or maybe some bulk .22lr ammo for the right trade

The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

Lever Carbine with Large Loop Lever
The Henry Lever Carbine .22 rifle features a large loop lever that is perfect for individuals with larger hands or when wearing gloves in cold weather. It has a compact overall length of 34"" and a 16 1/8"" barrel.

The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

Grooved receiver for easy scope mounting
The barrel length is 18¼"", overall length is 36¼"" and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long and as many as 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi-automatic .22. And, a lot more fun to shoot.

471,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2286471,For Sale:  ODI custom Viking Combat 1911,"East side, Anchorage, Alaska","$ 1,200","Listed On: Friday, November 1, 2013",Handguns,L.W.

I have been looking for one of these for two years, you don't see them often in Alaska.
 Omega Defense Industries in New Jersey made only 1400 of these 1911's in 1981 and 1982. They are factory versions of the Seecamp custom Double Action/Single Action commander sized 1911, based on the Colt commander 1911. They were one of the early all stainless steel 1911's, and also one of the first double actions, and actually worked better than most of the other double actions that came out in the 80's. 
This gun was obviously worked on as the slide has no markings, and only the serial number is on the frame, and I beleive an Essex Arms kit was used, which would make it even more valuable as the quality is increased as less cast parts are used. It could also have been upgraded with Caspian or Seecamp parts, and only 300 of the Seecampt kits were made after ODI went under. The butt grip safety is disabled...most people disabled all safeties on these guns as there were issues with them. Tru Dot trijicon sights have been added, as well as buffalo bone grips. If you want to keep it classic, then order some teak wood grips so it will look original. This is a collectors piece that would compliment a collection, but can also be used as a daily carry. I will be firing it this weekend and will give an update.

I am looking for cash, but would consider a nice 1911 or stainless 10 mm plus cash. 
Must be 21 with a state ID and willing to sign a bill of sale."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. The P226 Black Stainless has both a stainless frame and slide that has been Nitron coated. Available in 9mm, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

PRICE DROP: $600 for the package... $450 for the gun only(no laser) with two mags.
I bought it used(without lasergrips) out of a shipment of agency trade-ins from a local FFL.
I replaced the old recoil spring and striker spring with Kahr factory power replacements.
It has minor wear only, a lot less than expected from a daily duty carry piece. It was carried a lot and shot little. Magwell has signs of mags being inserted over and over(the edges are smoothed down a bit).
I purchased the Lasergrips new for $200+

It will come with 2 magazines, the original rubber grips, replaced springs and the remainder of the ‘maintenance kit’ spring package from Kahr. 

Theres nothing wrong with it at all, these K9s are tanks! Im only selling it because I need the cash.

9mm and .40 S&W available. 2 10rd mags eac. 4 inch barrel.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

829,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2286829,Want To Buy:  Want to buy/refurb/repair used gun safes and antique safes.,"central, Corvallis / Albany, Oregon",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, November 1, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am a certified Safe and Vault technician and I am interested in any tired, old, scratched, dented, locked out, fed up safes. I will look at any safe made of metal, even the older ones like mosler, diebold (heavy, decorative and often have huge wheels on the bottom) and other antiques. Here is a few gun safes I know I would be interested in: Liberty, canon/Remington, browning, Winchester, American security(amsec). Just send me a photo or a good description with some dimensions and I will let you know if I am interested.

Not interested in sentry safe or any of the cheaper big box store units (unless you are locked out, I could open it for you for trade). I opened and repaired a Canon gun safe recently in exchange for a S&W 442 w/some great accessories, probably worth 500-600 total. Something like a liberty gun safe puts up a bigger fight so we would haggle it up a bit but you get the idea. I would encourage comparative estimates so we all know we are getting a good deal. I try my best to not drill, I have an auto dialer to try if you think you know some of the numbers or if you aren't in a huge hurry (it can take a day or two), I have a lot of fancy tricks for the electronic locks to avoid drilling, I have many factory contacts for support and an outstanding drill rig if it comes to that. I repair my holes with carbide bit tips and ball bearings so if we do drill it would be the last time that spot gets drilled (holes & repairs are always concealed under the dial/keypad/lock face).

I would provide identification, resume, references and you provide a fair trade and something for me to do. This is something I am doing on the side as a hobby to keep my trade skills sharp. I am willing to drive out further than any of the locksmiths will too, its the best way to get me out seeing new parts of OR. 

I have included a couple photos of myself on miscellaneous jobs.
1. opening a bank vault (sometimes its cheaper to just go through the wall)
2. opening a National Guard armory vault, installing security cameras, opening an Air Force classified documents file cabinet safe (startled by boss for photo), and auditing a roll cage install
3. my auto-dialer looking shiney on a safe

I take security very seriously and if you seem even the slightest bit shady I will wish you well on your way. I will ask appropriate questions before I spend any time driving. I will need to see and verify proof of ownership before I work on any safe. As far as purchasing your used safe I am open to many 'conditions' of safe but I wont be interested in crusty rustys that have been left out in the elements.

With the P938, Sig Sauer offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm
cartridge in a platform similar in size to the P238 pistol. A
single-action-only trigger coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights
makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry
concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP
counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal
frame and the most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line. The
cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy
in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine
release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety
makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Item 90021 comes
with the standard 6 round magazine.

You can use the existing hardware / parts from your standard carrier and transfer them to this one for a cheap upgrade.

Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the most durable finish on the market. It's so good that it's being adopted by the Military and many Government agencies. It will never chip, peal, or flake off. It's much smoother than Hard Chrome, it's easier to clean and you can run it almost lube free for thousands of rounds due to it's self lubricating properties. These BCG's are a huge improvement over a Phosphated BCGs. They are
even an improvement over Hard Chrome.
