These are made by Armscor and are exceptionally tight with no looseness or frame rattle.

I've run it with cheap mags and cheap ammo and have yet to have a malfunction of any kind.

I'm interested in trading for something full or mid sized in .40. Since its a 1911 it carries IWB very well, but I'd like to have something with a higher capacity if I'm going to have something full sized.
I'd really like a Beretta 96 or a CZ75 pattern handgun, particularly a Jericho in .40, or  a Springfield XD40.  Really would prefer to have something in .40 but might consider these same models in 9mm

The trigger has been worked by a USMC armorer in North Carolina, it takes up smooth and breaks clean. This rifle was built to be a rifleman's rifle, it does what it needs to do with no excessive frills.

I was active duty USMC for 5 years and I originally gravitated to this rifle due to it being so similar to the M16A2, but also having the capacity to attach an acog later due to its flat top upper. The rifle is also a 20"" 1/7 twist chrome lined barrel making it ideal for heavier ammo, and again making it true to the M16A2 design.

I personally shoot the rifle out to 400 meters with great results. Again this is a rifleman's rifle.

Operates without electricity and produces up to 45,000 BTU of heat for your hunting cabin, military tent with flue opening or any other structure that you can vent.  Each stove comes complete with the exception of the 4"" flue pipe, a fuel (Jerry) can and a tripod to support the container from. This unit can safely burn kerosene, diesel, or gasoline.  These stoves sell online for over $150 before shipping and handling.  Buy local and get a stove that will last a lifetime. 

Here is a general description of the heater:

This unit provides for safe, reliable heating using a fuel vaporizing technology that has been tested in the laboratory and in field tests. The H45 heater has been in service for many years and thousands of units have been put to use. The H45 space heater is a 45K BTU heater that is designed to provide heat for the General Purpose and Temper tents. The H45 operates without the use of electrical power and can burn many types of liquid fuel. (DF-2, DF-1, DF-A, JP-5, JP-8) The H45 utilizes vaporizing R-tube burner technology, which overcomes the major combustion and safety problems that have existed over the past 50 years in the non-powered military heater industry. These problems include poor, smoky combustion of diesel fuel and the unsafe exposure of a pool of raw fuel during operation. The new vaporizing R-tube burner technology eliminates these deficiencies while still maintaining simplicity, ruggedness, and low cost.

It has never been racked, never been carried. Factory New. Everything from the factory is included.  Shortly after purchasing this gun I realized it is not what I really need, as I tend to open carry I would prefer a full size H&K.  I have plenty of other firearms so I chose not to shoot this one after coming to that realization. It is evident of its new condition when seen in person, and through pictures.
This P2000SK is a V2 - having a sweet sweet trigger, it is the law enforcement modification trigger.  It is the only trigger I would buy on my H&K's. I could gabble on otherwise about its features but I would rather you take them straight from the manufacture, (copy and paste the line below). 
http://www.hk-usa.com/civilian_products/p2000sk_general.asp

Otherwise as I stated everything from the factory is included, including two ten round mags that allow a great grip on the firearm.  This gun has been handled less than one in the case at bass pro, and $50 off the retail price +tax($70) has been eaten by me. Cash price is firm at $940.  Notably there is another one of these listed for sale priced at $950 firm and his is USED!! This a great deal on a brand new HK P2000SK, but really I am looking for a good condition full size HK model plus some cash!

Otherwise I will let the pictures talk, if you have any questions about the firearm and its features let me know.  On that note it is fully ambidextrous with extended slide releases and mag releases on both sides.

BORE IS NICE . GREAT OVERALL CONDITION . PLEASE SEE LISTED DETAILS. The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.The USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Heckler & Koch USPc 45 Compact DA/SA Safety / Decocker w/ 2 8 round magazines Made in Germany USP Compact 45 Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories - Ambidextrous magazine release lever - Extended slide release - Patented Lock-Out Safety device


$1100.  Cash sale only.

Serious inquiries only - I am not interested in any trades.

2 additional 8 round factory magazines $70. each - available only to purchaser of pistol

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.

From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.

The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

The circumference of the SF receiver is reduced at the rear, or ""backstrap"", which will appeal to shooters with smaller hands and offer increased comfort and control to all. The GLOCK 30 in the legendary .45 caliber offers excellent out-of-the- box precision paired with the ballistic quality of a genuine big-bore caliber. The smooth design and the simple operation of the GLOCK pistol allow quick drawing of the pistol. Because of these advantages and especially because of its compact dimensions, the GLOCK 30 is the first choice of plainclothes officers and protection personnel.

Magnum Research, purchased by Kahr Arms in 2010, is well respected for their well made and extremely reliable firearms that outperform their competitors time and time again. In fact, their DE1911G and DE1911C are among the most sought after imported 1911's on the market. Experts agree the DE1911G and DE1911C have some of the most shooter friendly stock triggers available. Next time you are in the market for a high quality firearm that is not plain old vanilla, Magnum Research Inc is going to be your next best friend. 

The ""Baby"" of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market.

Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA). All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

Since 1919, O.F. Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.

Remington 870 barrel, Stock & Forend with Stock hardware

Need a 12ga  26"" to 28"" Vented Ribbed Barrel with a screw in choke, and a wood or synthetic factory stock and forend 

I am tuning my Home defense Remington 870 Marine Magnum into a hunting shotgun for my son. one of the reasons I am converting it to a hunting shotgun is that I retrieved the shotgun from a safe that was in the High Park Fire. There is nothing wrong with the shotgun except the nickle was ruined from the fire so the gun had to be painted. but it shoots just fine so i figured i can convert it for my sons first year of goose hunting. 

I would also do a straight across trade for a remington 870 12ga with a 26"" to 28"" Vented Ribbed Barrel with a screw in choke, and a wood or synthetic factory stock and forend. or a Mossburg 835. but I'm sure no one want a gun that was in a fire but me lol."

10 ROUND PMAG FREE OF CHARGE.

The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC556. Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail. Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger.

 Item #: P3AT

 Sights: Fiber Optics, Dovetailed Aluminum Front Sight
 Barrel Length: 2.76""

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220R features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear resistant Nitron finish, lightweight alloy frame with M1913 Picatinny rail, and the Sig Sauer four point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector."

Sig Sauer P250 Compact 9mm Pistol w/ SIGLITE Night Sights - 15rd: S250C-9-BSS
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Taurus 905 9mm 2"" Revolver - 5rd Blue: TI905021
For years, law enforcement professionals have asked Taurus to produce a small, lightweight revolver chambered for the popular 9 mm and .45 ACP. This allows the capability to cross-carry a pistol and a revolver and only one caliber of ammunition.
Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

""SLIM"" is the name of this suave new entry into the Taurus line. Elegant in Blue and Stainless this small, single-action-only could be found under a cummerbund or a pair of bibs. It's what you have been asking for! No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come. New Unique SA/DA Trigger System The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

I have treated it with FrogLube CLP already (proper way with heat treatment) and it has been sitting ever since I purchased it last month.

I paid roughly $785 out-the-door with sales tax so my loss is your gain.

This Black Diamond Gun Safe by Dakota Safe Company has it all, priced to sell. Black Diamond Safes have most of the upper end features of more expensive safes. If getting the most value for your money is important to you, then you are in the right place. *Free Curb Side delivery to the following states. Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, Missouri and Louisiana. Available anywhere in the U.S. Call for a quote to other states.

The BD5928 is the best priced of our mid range Black Diamond safes featuring:

59x28x20

450 lbs.

12/24 - long gun capacity

45 minute/1200° Fire Rating

4 way Locking bolts on the door.

The doors feature a three way bolt system with fixed, stationary back side dead bolts on the hinge side.

The Black Diamond bolts are 1.5"" on all but the BD5924 which are 1.25"".

Beige Carpet Interior with versatile adjustable reinforced shelves and gun rack.

5 spoke chrome handles standard with a Manual Dial lock.
Electronic lock available by request. (additional $119)

Black Diamond safes are built with heavy 12 gauge steel and come in one color, Textured Black.
And of course, all safes come with the Black Diamond logo emblazoned on the front in silver.

All Black Diamond Gun Safes have Anti-Pry tabs. Very few safes have this feature included in the design of their safes and it is usually upper end safes.

All safes have hardened steel plates to protect the vital parts of the safe. Making it so no one can just come in and drill the locks. All safes have a re-locker, a spring loaded pin. This pin is tripped, if tampered with, and locks up the whole mechanism. This feature is ONLY found in upper end safes.

All safes have a handle design that utilizes a slip clutch to disengage the handle and keeps it from engaging the bolts. This feature is one that is usually found in upper end safes.

All safes have under shelf support bars on all big shelves. You can load your shelves with ammo and a year later they will still hold their rigid form. Again, this feature is one that is usually found in upper end safes.

All safes have four bolt down holes so you can anchor them in place. Each safe comes with a bolt down kit.

All safes have fire rated gypsum interior linings with a 75 minute, 1200° fire rating. This makes the Black Diamond Safe the most secure fire resistant safe in its class.

Fully continuous welds throughout. You will never see a spot weld on one of our safes. This is one more way that we will provide the best value for your dollar. And yet again, this feature is ONLY found in upper end safes.

All safes come with expanding door seals made to expand at higher temperatures to better seal your valuables from smoke and water damage.

All safes come with beige fabric interiors, including the gun and storage shelving. You can add light kits or pocket door systems to your safe for a nominal fee, call for details.

We inspect our safes to guarantee that they are the highest quality safe in its price range.

[3.31 kg.] (M468) Length: 35.375 inches. Barrel length: 16 inches. Cartridge: 6.8 SPC Caliber: 6.8x43mm SPC Barrel: Chromed bore. 6 groove, Right Hand twist, 1-in-10”. Action: Direct Gas Impingement Rate of fire: 45 rpm (Semi-Auto) 750 rpm (Cyclic) Muzzle velocity: 2,650 ft/s. Effective range: 600 meters [656.1 yards] (Individual Target) 800 meters [874.8 yards] (Area Targets) Feed system: 28-round magazine. 5-, 10-,20-, 25- or 30-round aftermarket magazines. Sights: Folding front & rear. Barrett’s M468 carbine chambered for the new 6.8 SPC is all business. The Barrett M468 is a variant of the M4 Carbine, re-chambered for a heavier and larger 6.8mm bullet for increased power and damage. The designation of ""M468"" stands for an M4 carbine chambered for the 6.8mm SPC cartridge. From its forged receiver to its tough military parkerized finish to the rail handguards it wears, every feature of the M468 is well thought out and includes the proven attributes that all experienced operators ask for. Case in point is the weapon’s A.R.M.S. Selective Integrated Rail System that offers an unsurpassed ability for the user to attach any number of accessories. The system ""free floats"" the barrel and promotes drastically enhanced cooling. It also allows the user to put a rail where he wants it and not have a rail where he doesn’t. The system is solid and wiggle free and also completely noiseless. The rear sight folds down flat when not in use and is held closed with a spring-loaded lock lever to prevent inadvertent opening. Pushing down on the sight and moving the lever allows it to open. There’s a small knob on the port side of the sight for windage adjustment. Elevation adjustments must be made on the front sight. Barrett uses a front sight/gas block combo part. The front sight folds down flat against the gas block for use with optics and uses a spring-loaded ball detent to hold it in the “up” position when deployed. The company uses a 16-inch chrome-lined barrel on the M468 and rifles them with a 1:10-inch twist to stabilize the bullets. This Barrett for sale has had only 200 rounds through its barrel, and is in extremely good condition. The rifle includes its sling, the Eotech Sight, and the bright Surefire torch,The firearm also comes with one (1) 20 round magazine in matching camo pattern. This weapon fires flawlessly, and is ""dead-on"" accurate. It is a true pleasure to shoot, and has little more recoil than an offering chambered in 5.56(.233), yet the power and punch of the 6.8 mm round is really awesome!"

This is one of the finest gas piston (not gas impingement) uppers on the market. It is manufactured by the Adams Arms exclusively for HULDRA Arms. Adams Arms is a premier AR manufacturer based out of Florida. This upper is approximately 6 months old and has less than 200 rounds down the pipe. I upgraded the standard M4 hand guards to the Magpul MOE hand guards. Both sets of hand guards are included along with a Black Dog Bolt Saver and (2) 20 round mags. The original Huldra box is also included.

Factory Specifications taken from the Huldra Arms webpage:

Charging handle and bolt carrier group included.


The Huldra 5.56 mid-length upper is a standard mil-spec upper that will work on any mil-spec AR lower. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber.

Please take a minute to review the photos and email me with any questions.

I'm looking for a face-to-face sell in the Twin Cities Metro. I'm in the Burnsville and White Bear areas daily. I will ship for an additional $25 insured shipping.

A upper is not considered a firearm therefore no PTP or PTC is necessary. I will provide a Bill Of Sale if buyer requests one.

To do this yourself, you would spend over $1400 with the ammo. I'm wanting $1100 simply to fund another project. I know guys like to haggle a little on here but this is a steal at this price. This is an awesome set up that still leaves some room for tinkering if you'd like. The current set up would get you out to 600 yards with practice. THIS IS NOT YOUR NORMAL OUT OF THE BOX 700. Everything has been done right without cutting corners and with the right intentions. Realistic offers please.

(262) four four two 44 two three. I will ship to your FFL in the  lower 48 for flat $15 shipping (this is more or less splitting the shipping with the ammo included). Please give me a call to work out payment and FFL info. I have more pictures upon request (also have some pictures of targets if you want to see those as well)."
