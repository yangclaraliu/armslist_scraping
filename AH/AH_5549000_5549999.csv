There are a few cracks in the stock that a new owner may be interested in having repair professionally.The appraised value AS IS was $1900.  If you had stock repaired, fixed trigger catch, and fixed the rear sight, estimated value would be $2500.I'm offering this for sale at $900.  As this is an antique, no FFL is required.  I AM WILLING TO SHIP THIS RIFLE.  Cash talks.  Make an offer. Motivated seller.  I can only post the one picture, but reply to the ad and I will get you multiple pictures and answer any questions."

I'm calling it a package deal because I'm offering them both with all their mags and the case.I'll also throw in all the spare parts I've got for them and about 300 rounds of .223 ammo. I just don't really have much timeanymore to go shooting as consistly as I would like. The guns have basically become safe queens. I've put about 100 rounds throughthe full size one, and maybe two boxes of federal bulk through the M&P 15-22. This was all before the price of .22 skyrocketed a while back.I'll start by describing the full size one.The .223/5.56 Nato AR is an assembled gun that consists of a professionally assembled and tuned Noveske Upper, and a Palmetto State Armory Lower with their parts kit.I'll list the parts that make up each half here below. Upper Reciever (Professionally assembled an tuned by PK firearms in Indiana):Vltor MUR1-a16"" Noveske Stainless Lightweigh BarrelBattlecomp 2.0Noveske 11"" NSR rail (Keymod)Noveske Rail covers4"" Noveske NSR Rail pieceMagPul vertical gripLower Reciever:Palmetto State Armory Lower RecieverPalmetto State Armroy Mil-Spec Lower Parts kitMagpul BAD LeverBravo Company Gunfighter gripB5 Sopmod Bravo Stock The Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 is just a run of the mill M&P 15-22. I added the rail covers and a magpul moe stock & grip.They are way more comfortable than the stock furniture. I added a fake can on the end to finish the look, because when you have atacticool gun you might as well go all the way. The fake can twists right off if you wanted to replace it with a flash hider/ muzzle brake whatever you wanted. This gun is a ton of fun.The red dots come with the guns, the 15-22 has a run of the mill truglo red dot scope/sight that came with it when I purchased it. The Noveske has a Primary Arms Micro Red Dot, its supposed to be the best knockoff aimpoint T1. I'm not law enforcement nor am I in the militaryso I didn't see a need in buying the real deal aimpoint. I've never had an issue with it and it's built like a tank.Case is a Voodoo Tactical 2 gun case, both guns fit perfectly and are protected. There are 4 M&P mags they're all Smith & Wesson and 25rds.The Noveske has 6 30rd Lancer L5 Mags all transulcent smoke so you can see the ammo left in the mag. There is a 10rd mag that I boughtto make sighting optics in easier when shooting from a bipod or a bench. I also have two 40rd pmags.If you have any questions or would like more photos please just ask."
