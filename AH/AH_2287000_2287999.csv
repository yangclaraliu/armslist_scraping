During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-Frame line of .357 Magnums: the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681 and Model 686.The Models 581 and 681 have fixed sights, whereas the 586 and 686 use adjustable sights.
Offered here is a Smith & Wesson Model 686 manufactured in 1985 (per date on grips and confirmed from Smith & Wesson customer service). This revolver is Product Code 104215 and Special Order 6052. It has a 6” barrel, adjustable rear sights and adjustable front sight. This is a fairly rare variant of one of the finest combat/target revolvers out there. As it was an early model, it had the hammer’s firing pin and the frame’s firing pin bushing replaced – “M” is stamped on frame by the model number. The truly amazing thing about this classic revolver is the condition – it appears as new and unfired. No trace of powder, scoring or flashing inside the frame or cylinder. Barely able to be seen turn line on cylinder. Comes with the original box with label, all paperwork, sealed cleaning rod and screwdriver and unopened hex wrench for setting the front sight. Grips are the older style Goncalo Alves wood, target style and absolutely gorgeous. This will make a great pistol for the advanced collector, investor or shooter who appreciate the pre-lock target style Smith & Wesson revolvers."

Hey i am selling my brand new (never fired) Mossberg 4X4 with extras.  The reason i am selling it is because I mainly hunt with my shotgun. This brand new rifle has the detailed walnut stock, fluted free floating barrel, muzzle break, Weaver tall scope rings, brand new RedHead Epic scope 4.5-12X40, comes boresighted to be on paper @ 100yds, has all original parts and manuals included, comes with a brand new mossy oak Allen scoped rifle bag, and 2 boxes of Winchester ammo.  I am willing to drive to neighboring cities to make this transaction at a different FFL but it will be faster and easier to do one in the 831.  Remember this rifle is 650 bucks because its brand new, ready to shoot, and you dont have to pay the tax! let me know.  I can take tons of pics for you.  I am also selling a Mossberg 817 too so let me know,  id be willing to let them both go for $800.00 for both.

This one comes with the black rubber grip installed as well as the original military bakelite grips.  The second picture is with the bakelite grips.  Comes with one magazine, and I'll throw in 16 rounds or two mags worth of 9x18mm ammo.  It is a circle 10 military approved model but I'm unsure of the year of manufacture. This one is in great shape mechanically but with the typical holster wear of these guns.  They are fun and cheap to shoot, exceptionally reliable (100 rounds of steel cased ammo through it, 0 malfunctions), and very accurate, as well as being a good CC choice.

I'd like to trade it for something subcompact or pocket size.  Not really particular but I would prefer something in .40 or 9mm.  Would also consider .38 special/.357 snub nosed revolvers.  Absolutely not interested in .22's, and the only .380 I would consider would be a Ruger LCP or S&W Bodyguard.

I will look at any safe made of metal, even the older ones like mosler, diebold (heavy, decorative and often have huge wheels on the bottom) and other antiques. Here is a few gun safes I know I would be interested in: Liberty, canon/Remington, browning, Winchester, American security(amsec). Just send me a photo or a good description with some dimensions and I will let you know if I am interested.

Not interested in sentry safe or any of the cheaper big box store units (unless you are locked out, I could open it for you for trade). I opened and repaired a Canon gun safe recently in exchange for a S&W 442 w/some great accessories, probably worth 500-600 total. Something like a liberty gun safe puts up a bigger fight so we would haggle it up a bit but you get the idea. I would encourage comparative estimates so we all know we are getting a good deal. I try my best to not drill, I have an auto dialer to try if you think you know some of the numbers or if you aren't in a huge hurry (it can take a day or two), I have a lot of fancy tricks for the electronic locks to avoid drilling, I have many factory contacts for support and an outstanding drill rig if it comes to that. I repair my holes with carbide bit tips and ball bearings so if we do drill it would be the last time that spot gets drilled (holes & repairs are always concealed under the dial/keypad/lock face).

I would provide identification, resume, references and you provide a fair trade and something for me to do. This is something I am doing on the side as a hobby to keep my trade skills sharp. I am willing to drive out further than any of the locksmiths will too, its the best way to get me out seeing new parts of OR. 

I have included a couple photos of myself on miscellaneous jobs.
1. opening a bank vault (sometimes its cheaper to just go through the wall)
2. opening a National Guard armory vault, installing security cameras, opening an Air Force classified documents file cabinet safe (startled by boss for photo), and auditing a roll cage install
3. my auto-dialer looking shiney on a safe

I take security very seriously and if you seem even the slightest bit shady I will wish you well on your way. I will ask appropriate questions before I spend any time driving. I will need to see and verify proof of ownership before I work on any safe. As far as purchasing your used safe I am open to many 'conditions' of safe but I wont be interested in crusty rustys that have been left out in the elements.

Model: Python Hunter 

Serial Number: VA4074 

Date of Manufacture: 1980s 

Caliber: .38 Special and .357 Magnum 

Action Type: Single and Double Action Revolver With Swing-Out Cylinder 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “Python Hunter / * .357 Magnum Ctg. *”. The right side of the barrel is marked “Colt’s PT. F.A. Mfg. Co. Hartford, Conn. U.S.A.” The flat under the crane and the crane are marked “VA4074”. The left side of the frame is marked with a “Rampant Colt” logo. The left side of the grip frame at the top of the trigger guard is marked at the front with “VP” in a triangle and at the back with a “C”. 

Barrel Length: The vent rib barrel with full underlug is 8” in length. 

Sights / Optics: This revolver is mounted with a white outline square notched rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation that is pinned to the top strap of the frame. The front sight is an orange insert ramp pinned to the top of the rib. There is a scope mounted to the top of the barrel rib marked “”M8-2X EXTENDED E.R” at the objective and with patent dates and “Made In U.S.A.” at the eyepiece. The scope has a bronze medallion on the left side marked “Colt / Leupold” and with the Rampant Colt logo. The outside of the scope shows one or two very light marks.

Finish Originality: All Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 98% of its finish. The only mentionable sign of wear is a slight cylinder drag line. Otherwise, the imperfections on this pistol are limited to storage. The right side of the gun has a handful of tiny freckles scattered about; these are generally on the front bottom edge of the frame, on the right side and on the right side of the unfinished hammer. Much of this should clean further and the specks appear to have a brown finish in a small percentage of the spots. These can also be seen on the scope mount screws. This is a result of storage in the Halliburton case, with deteriorating foam. The foam has since been removed. The knurling on the ejector rod and the checkering on the hammer are sharp. The screw heads are mainly sharp but show marks of a screwdriver. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Fine to Excellent condition, even better after a careful cleaning."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer. Only shot 1 box of ammo. All paperwork and shipping box included. Also, included with 2 high capacity magazines @ $39.99 each."

It's deadly accurate and very quiet with the bull barell. Mr.Rhineland made 500 of these guns to present a contract with Ruger since this gun is like a Ruger 10-22 on steroids. It's a fully machined gun so it cost over $500 to make and Ruger would have to sell it for over $1,000 and they did not know if there would be a high demand for a high quality but pricey 22 Long rifle. It will only go up in value and it's one of my favorite guns I have ever owned. It weights close to 15 lbs so it has some weight to it. This gun will take and Ruger 10/22 mags and I currently use Pro mags that work just fine. It also has a vertical grip."
