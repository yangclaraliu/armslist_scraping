The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

It's very nearly new and in perfect shape-it has the PEARCE grip extension on it, but if you prefer the factory stuff-that comes with it too. Also it has the DeSantis pocket holster-which works pretty good. Also I did a pretty descent job of painting on some glow on sights- if you like them keep them- if you don't you can take them off.

Milled receiver and chromed bore. Threaded barrel. This gun is absolutely in amazing condition. Wood furniture is like new. The previous owner had the gun professionally refinished. It’s got the tough Moly Resin finish on it right now. Nothing was wrong with the factory finish. Previous owner just wanted a better finish than the factory. Which I totally agree. Moly resin is really hard, durable, long lasting, self-lubricating, and has that always like-new-look finish to it. The gun has enough U.S. made parts for the 922(r) compliance. The pictures does not do the gun justice. This gun looks way better and nicer in person than the pictures. My fault, not really a very good photographer. You must be at least 18 years old or older to buy this gun. Kentucky resident with proper ID. Thanks for looking.

 A little background on the Bulgarian SLR-95:
 The SLR-95(s) is/are 100% made in Bulgaria, has Steyr cold hammer forged barrels, and factory hot dipped hammer forge receivers. No longer being imported. The Bulgarian SLR-95s were imported back in the mid-90′s for just a few years. There are not too many of them in the U.S. The Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 is one of the best AK-47s in the world. 

* No lowballers and tirekickers please. Got enough of them already *

*** Note: For the whiners out there (yes, you know who you are),  don't email and tell me that you can buy the same gun (SLR-95) cheaper on Gunbroker or somewhere else.  If you can,  buy it somewhere else then. You don't have to buy/trade my gun. JUST DONT BUG ME AND DON'T WASTE MY TIME. JUST STFU ***"

There is minimal cosmetic wear on it with absolutely no major scratches or dings. It has never been dropped and it is in perfect working condition. I have shot appx. 250 rounds through it since I purchased it new a couple of years ago. This hamerless, .357 Magnum is a perfect concealed-carry piece. Being able to go practice with cheap-to-shoot, .38 Special ammo and then loading .357 Mag for personal defense ammo later is definitely a nice benefit to owning this revolver.

I have a pre ban cetme c91 sporter .308 battle rifle that I'm looking to sell. 

A lot of people like to talk trash about cetme's and anything made by century arms. However this is an older one built before the 1994 assault weapons ban. Before century started employing drunkin monkeys to assemble their firearms. 

Many people also believe that this is a copy of the h&k g3 or h&k 91 but actually those rifles are copies of the cetme and from my research the only real differences are the trigger group and the sights and the cetme actually has lighter recoil. 

This rifle is built very well and functions perfectly with any and all ammo you feed it .308 and 7.62x51 alike and is also in very good shape for it's age with less than 500 rounds through it.

 The rifle will come with 3 20 round mags, an Alllen shell holder, 18 rounds of hornady American whitetail interlock match grade hunting ammo, 23 rounds of military surplus 7.62x51 fmj ammo and 2 green tracer rounds. The rifle also has a claw scope mount on it and also has a custom rubberized pistol grip and also has an h&k muzzle break and new h&k rollers If your looking for a cheap but reliable and accurate .308 battle rifle this is the gun for you! I am in Spokane right now but I live in Seattle and will be returning soon."

I love this gun.  I have only taken it to the range a few times and primarily use it as a self-defense firearm for if the need may ever arise.  Fun to shoot, reliable, well cared for  (I have disassembled and cleaned twice with oil), and a perfect package for home defense or fun shooting at targets.  Plenty of power, but manageable and accurate, unlike its recoil-heavy big brother, the Glock .45 caliber.  The LED light is perfect if the power is ever cut to your home or you need to investigate a situation at night, but don't want to waste your free hand holding a flashlight.

The only reason I am selling it is because I want to get a motorcycle but don't have the money, and I am going to use my shotgun for home defense.  Hence, you will see that I am selling this either for cash or for a motorcycle.

Sightmark® Pistol Laser Boresights provide the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in pistols specific to the bore sight’s caliber. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the pistol is aiming; it’s easy to sight in your firearm or scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the firearm being sighted to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any pistol. The bore sights are easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is available in the most common calibers for use with the most popular pistols.

We asked ourselves why a semi-auto barrel rib starts at the front of the receiver, a full 4 ½” further forward than an over-and-under shotgun. 

Doesn't that unnecessarily shorten the sighting plane? The answer is yes, but we can do better. The new Velocity LR has an innovative ramp style fixed rib that starts at the back of the receiver giving the shooter the maximum length sighting plane for better target acquisition and tracking. The bottom line is that a better sight picture equals more broken targets.

The Velocity LR combines all of the other ground breaking innovations that have made the XLR5 Velocity so popular last year. FABARM Velocity LR – Moving Forward Faster."

The ELOS B’s and ELOS B AL offer a high level of reliability backed by one of the most extensive warranties in the industry. The best news is that a gun of this quality comes at a price that will make your hunting buddies envious – now wouldn’t that be terrible."

The Axis Sporting is the whole package – balance, durability, good trigger, barrel performance, perfect stock dimensions, and low recoil. 

The Axis barrels feature the advanced TRIBORE HP™ tapered bores that lower recoil and reduce the need for excessively long forcing cones. Each gun comes with five EXIS HP™ choke tubes with a proprietary hyperbolic design that is a ballistic match to the tapered barrel bores. The result is devastating performance down range with all types of shot sizes and velocities.

The Axis action was purpose built as a target gun. The heavy duty 43mm wide action combined with a monolithic locking lug makes the Axis an extremely durable platform. The fore-end iron utilizes an adjustable mechanism to allow the action tension to be tightened at will for ease of service. 

An adjustable trigger features a light, crisp trigger pull. Stocks are made from Turkish walnut and finished with a matte oil finish. All Axis stocks come with the Fabarm KINETIK™ recoil reducer that is easily removable to be able to tune the guns balance. The Fabarm Micro Metric™ adjustable comb and left hand stocks are available as an option.

Using a FABARM Axis Sporting in competition is not cheating, but it is close."

These are also impregnated with Permathin, which is an insect repellant.  There are MANY cheap copies of Multi-Cam uniforms and Combat Shirts.  These are the real deal.  

You are getting a total of 40 (forty) genuine Multi-Cam pieces.  Here is the breakdown:

Tops:

Medium - Short X2
Small - Regular X3
Medium - Xtra Long X1
Medium - Regular X8
Large - Regular X1
Medium - Short X2

Trousers:

Small - XX Long X1
Small - Regular X4
Medium - Short X5
Medium - Regular X2

Massiff Combat Shirts:

Small X2
Medium X2

As far as the wear of the uniforms.  At least 30-40% of them appear to have never been worn in country as there is no wear or sun bleaching.  The remainder clearly were worn, but are serviceable.  At least two of the pants have tears in the crotch area, which is common with these and easily repaired and at least two of the tops have small or medium tears that can also be repaired.

As I stated before, these are not cheap knockoffs, they are genuine U.S. Army issued FRACU Multi-Cam Tops, Trousers and Combat Shirts.  

If you own an Army Navy type store, or something similar, this would be a great opportunity to get a large amount of genuine FRACU Multi-Cams for your store or to sell online.  Brand new, these genuine FRACU Multi-Cams are about $200 for a top and bottom and about another $200 for a combat shirt.  So the rough value of this set, taking into account for the couple of damaged and worn tops and bottoms, is around $3,500 retail.

I am not looking to piece meal this lot out.  I want to sell it as a single large lot.  I will ship it USPS Parcel Post with insurance and tracking.  I am a full time Police Officer and a decorated veteran of OEF and I will assure you as to the fact that these are all genuine.  

Only serious inquiries please.  Make me an offer that both allows me to profit and you to sell them and make a reasonable profit with a markup.  I also have some Multi-Cam issue patch kits that if I can find them (I should be able to) will include some in the order.

Count on at least $50 for Shipping and Handling to the 48 States.  

ABSOLUTELY NO International Sales!

I can email or text more. 

I have had a few people asking to buy my contender that was in the picture of my add for the barrels. After much consideration I have decided to offer it with the 3 barrels, shoulder stock ammo and more. Here is a list with prices so you get an idea what it all adds up to and give full understanding of the price. 

Contender G2 frame mfg 86 - $250

444 Marlin Super 14 bull barrel custom made by JD Jones. It is ported and threaded. One of VERY few ever made. He no longer makes the 444 barrel. However on the price list for his contender barrels a custom barrel is $430 plus $125 per 4 porting holes. This barrel has 18 holes. That is over $560 in porting. Sounds crazy but that is right on his price list on his website. I am putting this barrel at $850. You will probably never come across another one of these barrels for sale. 

30 Herrett Super 14 Bull barrel with Burris 1.5-4 power scope. - $350 ($275 for barrel and $75 for scope and rings.)

32-20 10"" Bull Barrel with Tasco 1-4x28 scope and rings. - $325 ($275 for barrel and $50 for scope and rings)

Shoulder stock - $75, not sure what it is worth but ones similar were $110-$120.

RCBS Reloading and case forming dies - $300. Midway has the reloading set for $145 and the case forming dies for $238. 

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/443751/rcbs-case-forming-die-set-30-herrett-from-30-30-winchester

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/775094/rcbs-2-die-set-30-herrett

Now the ammo. 

There is around 90 rounds of 444 with a few empty cases. 444 ammo is going for 44+ a box of 20. Thats about $180 in 444 marlin.

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/382054/remington-express-ammunition-444-marlin-240-grain-jacketed-soft-point-box-of-20

There is 40 loaded rounds of 32-20 with 10 empty brass. all very nice hollow point ammo. Lead bullet Remington ammo is going for $48 per 50. I am going to say $50 seeing as the stuff is jacketed hollow points. 

The 30 Herrett ammo is a little hard to price. This ammo is not commercially available and that is why dies are included. The brass sells for $59 per 50. I have between 90 and 100 rounds of ammo with some empty brass. At $2 a loaded round thats about $200 in ammo. I dont think that is a bad price given the price of the brass. 

On top of all of that I have an extra wood forearm and extra rubber grips. I will put $50 on them together. 

The bluing on everything is beautiful. Everything overall is 95% + on the grading scale. Everything together adds up to $2530. 

I am looking to sell or trade, trade plus cash doesnt matter. I am open to offers, worst I can say is no.

Price in cash is $2000 obo for everything 

I like/collect lots of different kinds of guns so make an offer. Prefer gun trades only but would be open to other offers too. You never know...

These are also impregnated with Permathin, which is an insect repellant.  There are MANY cheap copies of Multi-Cam uniforms and Combat Shirts.  These are the real deal.  

You are getting a total of 40 (forty) genuine Multi-Cam pieces.  Here is the breakdown:

Tops:

Medium - Short X2
Small - Regular X3
Medium - Xtra Long X1
Medium - Regular X8
Large - Regular X1
Medium - Short X2

Trousers:

XX Large - Long X1
Large - Regular X6
Small - XX Long X1
Small - Regular X4
Medium - Short X5
Medium - Regular X2

Massiff Combat Shirts:

Small X2
Medium X2

As far as the wear of the uniforms.  At least 30-40% of them appear to have never been worn in country as there is no wear or sun bleaching.  The remainder clearly were worn, but are serviceable.  At least two of the pants have tears in the crotch area, which is common with these and easily repaired.

As I stated before, these are not cheap knockoffs, they are genuine U.S. Army issued FRACU Multi-Cam Tops, Trousers and Combat Shirts.  

If you own an Army Navy type store, or something similar, this would be a great opportunity to get a large amount of genuine FRACU Multi-Cams for your store or to sell online.  Brand new, these genuine FRACU Multi-Cams are about $200 for a top and bottom and about another $200 for a combat shirt.  So the rough value of this set, taking into account for the couple of damaged and worn tops and bottoms, is around $3,500 retail.

 I am not looking to piece meal this lot out. I want to sell it as a single large lot. I will ship it USPS Parcel Post with insurance and tracking. I am a full time Police Officer and a decorated veteran of OEF and I will assure you as to the fact that these are all genuine. 

 Only serious inquiries please. Make me an offer that both allows me to profit and you to sell them and make a reasonable profit with a markup. I also have some Multi-Cam issue patch kits that if I can find them (I should be able to) will include some in the order.

 Count on at least $50 for Shipping and Handling to the 48 States. 

 ABSOLUTELY NO International Sales!

 Let the offers begin! Cheers! -Rob"

I went a little overboard this year at PSA and have an extra upper I'd like to trade for something I need.

This is a PTAC Upper which I received NIB. For the price on these uppers during Black Friday I simply couldn't pass it up, and of course neither could anyone else as they sold out very quickly. 

Just a quick FYI this came with a couple of scratches on the barrel, and the ejection port has a couple of scratches BUT this is how the gun came to me and frankly it looks great. All I've done is taken it apart for examination, put some goo on it, and threw a Rainier Arms Xtreme Tactical Compensator on the end. I will also include the regular F/H in the Rainier box. 

On top of the XTC I will also be including 4 NIW Pmags to even out the deal.

I'm looking to trade this package for a 3rd gen glock 19 although I would aslo consider other glocks in 9mm.

I have $, ammo, and mags to even out any deal if you have a 34 or a 17L. I also have a good guy card and a WA state ID. 

I'm open to other trades but first choice goes to a 9mm glock
