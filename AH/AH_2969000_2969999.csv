From Tac-con's website:
"" The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.""

This is one of the best triggers I have used.

The bolt carrier group had the firing pin blown out the back of it and I just don't have the time to fix it/invest in a new bolt. The safety button has also cracked in two, however the safety mechanism itself is functioning correctly. I have checked with a gunsmith that the rest of the shotgun is in full functioning order. It just needs a new bolt and plastic safety switch (installed with a hex key).

Mostly new stuff, pump shotguns and semi auto shotguns. Prefer the Mossberg or Remington brand but let us know what you have. We aren't looking for bolt action shotguns or break barrels. Now for rifles, we are looking for AR style, AK style, or bolt actions.  Not really Ito the .22's in those but offer and and we will see. NO single shots or muzzleloaders/blackpowder.  You can always add ammo to make up some room. Definitely not looking for tube fed rifles or lever actions.  For handguns, please just offer up what you have. Not really looking for revolvers but still try, prefer 9mm but others may be ok.  

The value I would like to see is in the $1500 range but if your trade is lower by a lot then maybe add a bunch of ammo or maybe some cash.  I'm not stuck on $1500.

Iver Johnson TP22

Bond is back!  If Skyfall is not the best Bond film ever it certainly is one the best in a long, long time and today's review focuses on the Iver Johnson TP22 which is a clone of Bond's iconic pistol; the Walther PPK.  I am at the stage of life now where handguns I did not have the opportunity to pick up when they were new can sometimes be found in the ""Used"" gun case at my local shop and such is the fortune that prevailed a couple of months ago when I stumbled into Bill's Gun Shop in Robbinsdale, MN and found the TP22 which is chambered in 22 Long Rifle.

The TP22 is a dead ringer for the Walther PPK whose heritage goes back to 1928 when Walther introduced the slightly larger model PP.  Not long afterward they shortened the grip frame, barrel, and slide and produced the PPK which was certainly more comfortable.  Both models were originally produced in .32 ACP caliber but the .380 ACP or 9mm Kurz (as it was known in Germany) soon followed.  I have owned four PPKs in my time including a 1966 West German made PPK which predated the Gun Control Act of 1968.  After the GCA they could no longer be imported because of their size until Walther mated the shorten barrel/slide of the PPK to the larger grip frame of the PP and called it the PPK/S.  I have owned three of those; one imported by Interarms and two built by Smith & Wesson under contract with Walther.  All four of my pistols were in caliber .380 ACP and all were extraordinarily accurate. 



Walther did produce both the PP and the PPK in .22 Long Rifle and if you are lucky enough to find one expect the price tag to be well over a grand.  A quick internet search finds the PP model in 22LR going for $1295, $1299, $1500, and $2395 for an engraved boxed limited edition. .22LR PPK pistols are found with prices of $1695 and $1995.  So finding a used Iver Johnson TP22 for over 85% less than the going price for a .22 caliber Walther seemed like a bargain!

One of the interesting things I found was that Iver Johnson's advertising completely omitted any mention of the fact that the TP22 was clearly patterned after Walther.


If there is any difference between the Iver Johnson and the Walther it is the sights.  The sights on the TP22 are smaller than the Walther and while not great, they were usable with the understanding that this is not a target pistol.



Below is a copy of a review of the TP 22 at the time it was first manufactured.  Although the name of the magazine was cut off by whoever posted the copy of the review I tend to think it my be from the ""American Rifleman"" published by the National Rifle Association.  By the way, if you're reading this and you are not a member of the NRA it is time to pony up.  The second amendment would be completely ignored by many in today's government if the NRA was not there to constantly remind them of the rights afforded by our founding fathers and the Constitution of the United States.




Strangely enough this magazine review also makes no mention of the obvious similarities in appearance and design to the Walther PPK.  The article does come to the same conclusion I found with the TP22:

Fun pistol to shoot!
As accurate as you would expect a small pistol of this type to be.
Is ammo sensitive.  If you find one of these pistols buy many different 50 round boxes of ammo and select the one that gives 100% reliability and the best accuracy.



The Iver Johnson TP22 breaks down exactly like a Walther PP, PPK, PPK/S.  First remove the magazine and double check the chamber to make sure the pistol is unloaded.  Then pull down on the front of the trigger guard.  This unlocks the slide which can then be pulled back and up before sliding it forward and off the barrel.  Once the slide is removed the recoil spring can then be taken off the barrel.  Reassemble in reverse order remembering that the tightly coiled portion of the recoil spring goes on the barrel first."

448,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2969448,"For Sale/Trade:  Stihl 088 Chainsaw / 33"" Bar / Stihl's Biggest Saw!","Harrisonburg, Virginia, United States","$ 1,200","Listed On: Sunday, April 20, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I buy, sell, and trade Stihl chainsaws as a hobby, and here I have an excellent example of Stihl's largest chainsaw. Before we go any further, I'll answer the question I always get on this model....this saw was designed to accept the largest bars available. You can run anything from 21"" to 60""+ bars on this saw.

The history of Stihl's largest chainsaws can be confusing, so here's the story:

Stihl's original 'modern' large chainsaw was the 084. By modern, I mean with electronic ignition, chain brake, anti-vibe features, high-rpm engine, and relatively light weight for the horsepower involved. Prior to the 084, Stihl's largest saw was the now-outdated 090 which had a few more cc's in engine size but was a heavy-as-lead, low-rpm saw by comparison. Stihl has obsoleted many key 084 parts, including the ignition coil which is a problem area for the 084.

In the 1990's, Stihl redesigned the 084 to create the 088. The new 088 had an improved ignition coil design which eliminated the 084's biggest weakness. Another 084 weakness which was eventually fixed in the 088 line was to install a steel crankshaft bearing insert in the bar side of the crankcase. Only the late-model 088's have this feature -- the saw I'm selling does have the insert and is more desirable because of it.

Finally, a few years ago Stihl renamed the 088 to the MS880. However, all major parts remained the same. The MS880 does have a different carburetor to comply with newer emissions requirements.

The only carryover from the ancient 090 to these modern saws is the bar. These saws all use the ""large-mount"" Stihl bar, which was once common on Stihl saws, but is now only used on the 084 / 088 / MS880. This is important to keep in mind when / if you go bar shopping for this saw.

Most arborists and loggers will have one of these on their truck for large stumps and logs. Saws of this size are also often used in portable sawmills.

This particular 088 is the best example of this series I've had. It's a late-model with the steel insert for the bar-side crankshaft bearing. It shows relatively minor wear, which is unusual for a saw of this size. It had great compression when I got it, but a visual inspection showed a chip in the cylinder wall where the nickel-silicon plating had come off, so I decided to replace the piston and cylinder. These cost $450 from Stihl, by the way. I tuned the carburetor and installed a new 33"" Carlton bar and .404 chain on it from my stock. This saw starts and runs like the horse it is. It should be somewhere between 8 and 9 horsepower.

It currently has 25:1 mix in the crankcase because of the new piston and cylinder, and should have 25:1 in it for another tank or two, then be switched to 50:1.

A new MS880 will run you a cool $2,000 or more (plus tax) at your local dealer, if they have one in stock. I've priced this 088 at $1,200 -- an excellent deal for the right person. If you've always wanted to own Stihl's largest chainsaw, here's your chance.

EVERYTHING BELOW IS STANDARD INFO I PUT IN ALL OF MY ADS.

You can reply to this ad by Armslist's email system. I'm located in Briery Branch if you're familiar with the area, but I often meet people at the Park and Ride off I-81 Exit 240 to make finding me easier for out-of-towners.

GENERAL INFO:

This is a hobby for me, but I try to turn out the best quality used Stihls available in our area. I have factory service manuals, factory tools, and a background in mechanical and tree work. When I sell a saw, I go completely through it to be sure it's ready to go. I replace any worn parts that I find, and do any preventive maintenance that it needs including sharpening or replacing the chain. My checkover also includes verifying condition of the engine through a compression test, followed by a vacuum/pressure test, visual inspection, and parts replacement if necessary.

Although I don't warranty pistons and cylinders because I have no control over the age, quality, or mix ratio of the fuel mix you use, I won't sell you something that I know isn't right. My saws aren't the least expensive, but I have done everything possible to each one to be sure it won't let you down. I do this work as I get some spare time, so it may take me several weeks or even months to complete a saw.

All of my saws are priced at the lowest amount I am willing to accept for them, as I have a lot of my time and money invested in each one. I realize that having a bottom-line price takes a little of the fun out of it for some people, so if you enjoy haggling, we can set the price $100 or $200 higher and I'll let you gradually chip away at me until we've gotten back to the original price! Seriously though, having a set price is the only way I know to be sure that everyone who buys from me is treated fairly."

794,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2969794,For Trade:  RARE 1850 Dated Swiss Schuetzen Rifle,"Jeffersonville, Indiana, Louisville, Kentucky",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, June 2, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have, for trade only, a very rare and early Swiss Schuetzen rifle.  This rifle was made in 1850 by a gunsmith in Altdoorf Switzerland.  There is also another town's name engraved on the barrel that I suspect is where the barrel was forged.  

This rifle is in good condition with the typical dings and handling marks you would expect to see on a rifle of this age.  There is a crack where the side plate is inlaid.  If the barrel is removed, this piece will come loose.  This could be easily repaired, but I will leave that to the next owner.  The bore is excellent with shiny rifling.  I believe the caliber is 10.5mm.  The lock functions great, and the hair trigger is EXTREMELY sensitive, just as it should be.  The original sights were replaced sometime around the 1860s.  This thing is a tack driver!  There are some intricate engravings on most of the metal parts.  

I can only upload three pictures here, so please feel free to email me for more pictures."

The gun comes with original box and paperwork and 1 magazine. The gun has its original more desirable matte finish and was not sent back to seecamp to be refinished and have modifications to the frame (as many owners did). If you have questions, just ask."

I'm in the Burnsville and White Bear areas daily so I prefer the deal be made close to those areas.

I will consider trading up for a Trijicon TA11 or TA33 ACOG with the .308 BDC reticle. Otherwise a cash sell is preferred. I will consider shipping for an additional $15 to cover insured USPS priority mail shipping.
