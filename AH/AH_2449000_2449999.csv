It is matching numbers and was manufactured in Romania by CUGIR, not a kit-built rifle. It comes with 5 (10 round) magazines that work just fine. I have put maybe 100 rounds through her and that was mostly PPU 150gr non-corrosive brass-cased ammo. 

The upgraded optic is an 8x42D POSP with an illuminated reticle. The ""D"" model has larger knobs and an independent focus adjustment. Its a VERY nice scope and is a top of the line fixed-power POSP. It currently utilizes a red diode, but that can be switched out if desired. I purchased it directly from Kalinka Optics and have only fired about 20 rounds with the scope on. 

The synthetic furniture is from Black Horse Arsenal and changes the whole look of this thing. The forearm and gas tube cover were made in the US, and the adjustable buttstock was originally made in the Izmash Arsenal in Russia for an SVD Dragunov. They were imported by BHA and converted to fit the PSL rifles. Therefore it counts as being made in the US as well. I went with this setup not only for the looks, but for the utility. The cheek pad is very functional for using the scope, and it rotates out of the way so you can use iron sights as well.

Included are several extra batteries for the optic, an amber lens cover, the rubber eyepiece, a cleaning cloth, scope bag, instructions manual (in Russian), and importation paperwork for the buttstock. It will be shipped in a lockable hard plastic case.

Looking for cash on this one. Many people have offered very nice rifles and carbines for trade, but not what I'm looking for (which is quite specific) so I'm no longer accepting trades.

These aren't being imported anymore and getting harder and harder to find. Who knows how expensive they'll be in a few years? More and more people are beginning to list these on GunBroker for well over $2000... know that right now, you can't put this setup together for what I'm asking for it. I know what the value is, and I'm not in a rush to sell, so don't try to low-ball me please.

Please know your state's laws as I will not ship to where this rifle is illegal. I plan to ship this directly to your FFL of choice. Buyer pays shipping unless otherwise negotiated."

Comes with TWO MAGAZINES ONE (13) round Magazine and ONE (25) round magazine. This is a great weapon. From the Factory: Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the KRISS System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time.it can be quickly and effectively deployed from behind a patrol vehicle steering wheel, covert-carried or by mounted units storing easily in a saddlebox. With its hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge, the KRISS provides in-close knock-down power at 1200 rounds-per-minute and 6” groups at stand-off distances of 100m....all with no worries about over-penetration risks and the confidence of single-fire,The KRISS Vector is built to rugged MILSPEC standards and features simple and robust moving parts.

There's no more fitting way to honor 50 years of bolt-action supremacy than with a Model 700 BDL crafted in the spirit of the very first one Remington released in 1962, in its first chambering: the 7mm Remington Magnum. This rifle's timeless looks and laser-engraved commemorative floorplate make a coveted piece for collectors, but a few shots from the bench will assure you it's built to hunt. Like all Model 700 rifles, this edition is graced with the world-leading out-of-the-box accuracy and reliability that have earned it a place in history as the greatest bolt guns of all time. The handsome ""B"" grade walnut stock is adorned with Fleur-Di-Lis checkering and white line spacers at the recoil pad, grip cap and fore-end. Rich satin bluing on the receiver and 24"" barrel adds the finishing touch. Modern advancements like the X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger further support our belief that this is one commemorative rifle you won't be able to keep on a shelf.

According to the US Government, non-lethal Optical Distractors (ocular interrupters or “laser dazzlers”) are visible (green) laser devices that have temporary optical effects on human targets.  These types of non-blinding laser devices use highly directional optical energy to support several non-lethal missions, including: 

	Temporarily overwhelming an adversary's visual sense by emitting a compelling glare source.
	Providing an unequivocal non-verbal warning.
	Providing the target an opportunity to clarify intent.

Although these mission capabilities are generic to any high-intensity light source, laser light sources, versus LEDs, are ideal for non-lethal applications, as the optical energy is collimated and very directional.  This allows the Operator to precisely deliver the laser energy at long ranges, while minimizing the total power output and minimizing collateral effects to other bystanders.

A Dazzler Laser allows the Operator to temporarily impair the vision of the target(s) by temporarily eliminating their ability to see, engage and/or effectively target the Operator by overwhelming their visual sense.  Due to the Operator’s ability to adjust the range of engagement from 1-2400 meters (model dependent), the Operator can visually impair, warn, assess, deter, suppress, illuminate, target, hail and warn, and/or communicate with the target(s) potentially avoiding an unnecessary escalation to more lethal engagements.

NOHD is an acronym that stands for Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance.  The NOHD represents what a laser system’s eye safety zone is. For example, if a laser system has an NOHD of 20 meters, the system cannot be used eye safe from the exit point of the system out to 20 meters in range.  Beyond 20 meters, no eye damage will occur.

Specs:
The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand."

BLOCS is a universal system that can be figured out to suit any special operations mission. From direct action to vehicle patrols, even rural/long range operations. BLOCS can be modified to suit the individual soldier’s preference or specific situation by simply adding or removing pouches. Our tactical pouch line utilizes 500 Denier® Cordura. All of our pouches are constructed from this material because we have found it to be approximately 40% lighter than the 1000 Denier®, yet suffering only a 10% reduction in durability. All items in our BLOCS line utilize S.O.TECH's Flex-Tab(patent pending). Flex-Tab™ is a simple, safe, and strong system that integrates 100% with all current issue PALS packs, pouches and vests. In addition, it allows for a faster and stronger pouch attachment than other designs. And with our products, they come with a lifetime warranty."

He said it was on his rifle throughout his tour and has seen a lot of combat.  He said that he had been through some really rough missions and always kept this carry handle for luck, even switching it onto a new gun when he had to swap them out.  When he came home he kept it as a memento of his time overseas but later decided to include it in a package sale of some items I bought from him.  He wanted me to know the story behind it when he gave it to me and I want to make sure whoever buys this knows it's something that had special meaning to him.  

It is a bit rough as you can imagine but fully usable.  Would make a great addition to your AR and comes with an interesting story.  Personally I was touched by the story and had planned to keep and display in my home but if someone wanted to use it on their AR it would work just fine and, who knows, maybe with it being so lucky it might improve your accuracy scores!

This cit consists of three parts: low profile deckocker levers (left and right) and a low profile slide catch lever. 

This kit makes your PX4 much narrower and it doesn't hurt as much to rack the slide. It also converts your Type F to a Type G...read below.

Most PX4’s that are sold in outdoor stores are the Type F. 

How can you tell if you have a Type F or a Type G?
The difference is in what happens when you activate the decocker lever.

Type F: activate the leverl and it stays down – the gun is on “Safe”
Type G: activate the lever and it pops back up – there is no manual Saftey.
	Type F: Single and double-action. Decocker. Manual safety.
	Double/single action. 
	Ambidextrous manual safety on the slide with hammer decocking function, automatic firing pin block safety.
	When you activate the decocker lever, it stays down – the gun is on “Safe” until you remove the safety by pushinh the safety lever/decocker lever (one and the same lever) back up to the fire position.
	Type G: Single and double-action. Decocker. No manual safety.
	Double/single action. 
	Ambidextrous manual lever on the slide with hammer decocking function with the return of the lever to the firing position, automatic firing pin block safety.
	When you activate the decocker lever, drops the hammer (decocking) but then it springs back up. The lever ONLY functions as a decocker, not a safety. When you activate the decoker lever, it automatically returns to the ""fire"" position and cannot be locked in the ""safe"" position.
	Many prefer the Type G function because the gun is always ready to use. You don’t have to think about the safety lever position. Just pull the trigger and bang. With the Type F – if you left the safety on (lever down) and you need your gun for an emergency, it will not work until you push the safety lever back to fire. For this reason many prefer the Type G function. Because the decocker lever always snaps back to the “fire” position – you are always ready to shoot.

It is a spikes tactical "" punisher"" with the color fill. On the side is the punisher emblem engraved and filled in in white. For the safety markings the safe is a loaded round etched then filled in in red. The fire mark is is a spent case etched and filled in in red. ( see photo). The next component that was added was a lower parts kit by DPMS. The butt stock of the gun is a Magpul PRS fully adjustable stock. It has an adjustable cheek piece as well as adjustable length. It's not collapseable. The pistol grip I believe is a magpul hard rubberized grip with the hard rubber base plate. The fore foregrip is also hard rubberized with storage compartment in it. Might be big enough to house a field cleaning kit. This brings us to the upper. It is a complete upper from ARD has a flash suppressor that easily will screw off for the addition of a can. It is the 16 inch 1:8 version. It has the quad rail on it from the factory. One magpul mag used a sling adapter that mounts to the picatiny rail. There has been less than 150 rounds through this gun. I would prefer a local pick up but I will ship if you are willing to pay for shipping. If shipped it will have to go to ffl from ffl. Text me at 412 nine seven four 6970. Or email me but I will get the txt faster. Trades are ok let me know what you have worst I can say is no. I really want to stay away from pistols. I would also take cash.

According to the US Government, non-lethal Optical Distractors (ocular interrupters or “laser dazzlers”) are visible (green) laser devices that have temporary optical effects on human targets. These types of non-blinding laser devices use highly directional optical energy to support several non-lethal missions, including:

 Temporarily overwhelming an adversary's visual sense by emitting a compelling glare source.
 Providing an unequivocal non-verbal warning.
 Providing the target an opportunity to clarify intent.

Although these mission capabilities are generic to any high-intensity light source, laser light sources, versus LEDs, are ideal for non-lethal applications, as the optical energy is collimated and very directional. This allows the Operator to precisely deliver the laser energy at long ranges, while minimizing the total power output and minimizing collateral effects to other bystanders.

A Dazzler Laser allows the Operator to temporarily impair the vision of the target(s) by temporarily eliminating their ability to see, engage and/or effectively target the Operator by overwhelming their visual sense. Due to the Operator’s ability to adjust the range of engagement from 1-2400 meters (model dependent), the Operator can visually impair, warn, assess, deter, suppress, illuminate, target, hail and warn, and/or communicate with the target(s) potentially avoiding an unnecessary escalation to more lethal engagements.

NOHD is an acronym that stands for Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance. The NOHD represents what a laser system’s eye safety zone is. For example, if a laser system has an NOHD of 20 meters, the system cannot be used eye safe from the exit point of the system out to 20 meters in range. Beyond 20 meters, no eye damage will occur.

According to the US Government, non-lethal Optical Distractors (ocular interrupters or “laser dazzlers”) are visible (green) laser devices that have temporary optical effects on human targets. These types of non-blinding laser devices use highly directional optical energy to support several non-lethal missions, including:

 Temporarily overwhelming an adversary's visual sense by emitting a compelling glare source.
 Providing an unequivocal non-verbal warning.
 Providing the target an opportunity to clarify intent.

Although these mission capabilities are generic to any high-intensity light source, laser light sources, versus LEDs, are ideal for non-lethal applications, as the optical energy is collimated and very directional. This allows the Operator to precisely deliver the laser energy at long ranges, while minimizing the total power output and minimizing collateral effects to other bystanders.

A Dazzler Laser allows the Operator to temporarily impair the vision of the target(s) by temporarily eliminating their ability to see, engage and/or effectively target the Operator by overwhelming their visual sense. Due to the Operator’s ability to adjust the range of engagement from 1-2400 meters (model dependent), the Operator can visually impair, warn, assess, deter, suppress, illuminate, target, hail and warn, and/or communicate with the target(s) potentially avoiding an unnecessary escalation to more lethal engagements.

NOHD is an acronym that stands for Nominal Ocular Hazard Distance. The NOHD represents what a laser system’s eye safety zone is. For example, if a laser system has an NOHD of 20 meters, the system cannot be used eye safe from the exit point of the system out to 20 meters in range. Beyond 20 meters, no eye damage will occur.

My dilemma was whether to keep this gun or my Kahr 9mm of the same type. This gun shoots great, not a single FTF, FTE or misfire, and I ran both FMJ and hollow point catridges through it. It is slimmer than the Kahr but slightly longer from front to back. It was a tough decision, basically a tossup, but at some point I finally had to make a choice.

Here's the deal: MY FFL charges $30 for the background check (it's hard to find an FFL to do a BC, let alone at a reasonable fee.) You come to Longmont, we go to his place and you pay him for the BC, and if you pass I pay you back the $30 and you get the package for $265 net. If you fail the check you're out the thirty bucks. Price is firm at $265; I'd be surprised if you can find it on Armslist cheaper with fees and sales tax if you buy from a dealer. Thanks for looking and have a Merry Christmas."

Hey guys, thought i would put this up for rent since i've seen some people wanting to get some shells drilled but don't want to pay $90 + shipping for a drilling fixture.

Price is $20 shipped but you will have to put a deposit of $100 while you borrow it, which i will hold till you ship it back with a tracking number, then i will refund you the $80 when i get a tracking #. That way any liability issues are covered.


Rent period would be 1 week. Additional weeks can be added for $10 per week. For example, if you want 2 weeks, you can rent it for $20 + 10 = $30.

This jig is used to drill the holes on the Polish shells, but should also work on other blanks.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 magazines holding 12 rounds each for the handgun. Each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

I will include 100 rounds of Federal HST JHP self-defense ammunition with this purchase. 

I live in Puyallup, but I will be in Spokane this weekend for the holidays and can meet in the area if you are on the east side."

For sale/trade is 800 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. I am asking far less than retail for cash offers. 

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

Gun was manufactured by JP Sauer and Sohns (yup, now the later part of Sig-Sauer), in the 1960-70s.  Apparently, these were used in many of the older Western shows and movies for prop guns.

Revolver is nickel plated with 4-5/8"" barrel, fixed sights, and those ugly pearlite grips.  Gun is in good shape, with some dull spots on the finish, likely taken out by polishing.  There are also two screw heads that are buggered beyond removeable.  Parts are still available through Numrich online and many parts are interchangeable with Colt SAA revolvers and the clones.

Maximize your distance and accuracy.
At H&R, we offer a broad range of tack-driving rifled slug guns that can cost less than an accessory slug barrel for many repeaters. They’re unfailingly dependable, easy to carry and exceptionally accurate out to the farthest reaches of shotgun range. Our single-shot action’s strong lockup and stout build creates an inherently precise platform. But another major contributor to their ultra-tight grouping capability is the Ultragon™ Rifling. It uses six oval lands and grooves without sharp corners like traditional rifling. This system imparts stabilizing spin on your slug without distorting the sabot jacket or exterior of your slug, leading to a better gas seal, higher velocities and more consistent flight characteristics. No nonsense. Just pure deer-dropping performance.

A lightweight fully rifled slug gun featuring adjustable rifle sights. Its walnut-finished
hardwood stock has sling swivel studs and a recoil pad. 20 gauge.

Bash, shine and stun. Guard Dog Security introduces the world’s first combination of metal baton, tactical flashlight and concealed stun gun all within the Titan.

Often attempted, yet never perfected, the metal baton stun gun has finally been engineered in a type III aluminum, aircraft grade body. With a firm rubberized grip handle, the Titan transforms into an 18.5” heavy duty clubber and emergency glass breaker.

With a quick slide, the Guard Dog Titan shines a blinding 260 lumen tactical flashlight with three light functions: blinding high, battery conservation low and emergency strobe. The far-reaching, and concentrated, light allows for everyday use or as a defense device in the event of an emergency.

The Titan’s front end boasts Guard Dog’s exclusive Concealed Inner Stun Technology™, firing off a thunderous 7,500,000 stun gun. With no visible probes, the stuns emit a loud electrifying shock with the push of a button.

The shockproof body allows for durability and longevity while the car and wall chargers permit flexibility in recharging capabilities. Whether you’re on guard or just using the Titan as a personal safety device, you’re in good hands with the industry exclusive Guard Dog baton, tactical flashlight and concealed stun gun."
