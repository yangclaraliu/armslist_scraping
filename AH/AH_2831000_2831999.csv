Looking for firearms, basically anything that I do not already own. Just let me know what you have, pics are great and a ballpark figure of how many rounds you are looking for.
As you know we are still experiencing a large and lengthy .22 ammo shortage that will last for a long time to come. Even when found bricks are now in the $30 neighborhood. The good ole days of walking in anywhere and picking up 1000rds for $35 are unfortunately way over.  Please keep in mind that this ammo is very easy to sell for elevated prices. I am not looking to do that but if you are looking to feed your .22 caliber guns and maybe have another gun that doesn't get much attention lying around then maybe we can make a trade. 
I am not a flipper, nor do I stand in line anywhere in am hours to get a box. Most my ammo was purchased pre shortage."

It features a thicker Cold Hammer Forged thicker Barrel and a thicker front RPK style trunnion. This allows this rifle to have better durability and accuracy than other AK variants. It eliminates the terrible barrel wobble seen in other thin barreled AK's. This rifle was purchased back in mid December of 2013 and has never been shot before. This rifle comes with 6 20 round magazines. I will FFL transfer the day you purchase it. NO delays.

The idea behind the ""Accelerator"" was to provide the hunter a practical means of taking small game with a large caliber rifle, without destroying all the eatable meat. In effect, the hunter was using high-speed .22 caliber bullets, fired from a standard .30 caliber rifle. This worked particularly well when the hunter wanted to carry just one rifle. By carrying both .30 caliber ammunition and sabot-loaded ammunition, the hunter had the equivalent of two guns-in-one.

I believe that this pistol is a Model VII (7). No disappointment here. Made in Israel. The gun is 2 tone, black on barrel and slide, silver lower. Includes 1 extra mag, (new). Pistol has not seen a holster; never been hunted with. Bore has polygonal rifling, looks like a mirror. This gun has not been shot much. It has less than 40 rounds through it. This gun really speaks with authority. Recoil is much lower than expected due to the semi-auto action (softer than that of a 44 revolver); but definitely not a gun for the limp wristed. It’s time for this pistol to be somebody else’s toy

This single action, 9mm Luger, FEG made Hi-Power is reputed to be the most faithful copy of the FN Browning Hi-Power. (The DA version uses a S&W action and is generally not considered as strong.) Uses same magazine. I have owned both the FEG as well as the FN and other than the interior finish, the guns are very similar in appearance as well as function. This particular gun is in excellent mechanical condition, strong, tight, with bright bore and strong rifling.  Very clean.

Popularly-named the Perfect Repeater at its introduction, it largely set the standard for pump action shotguns over its 51 year high-rate production life. From August 1912 until first discontinued by Winchester in May 1964,
Unlike most modern pump-action shotguns, the Winchester Model 12 had no trigger disconnector. Like the earlier Model 1897, it too fired each time the action closed with the trigger depressed. That and its 6-shot capacity made it effective for close-combat. As fast as one could pump the action, another shot would be fired.
The United States armed forces used various versions of the Model 12 in World War I, World War II, Korea, and in the early part of the Vietnam War, until inventory was exhausted after the Model 12's initial production ceased in 1964
