it takes 2 3/4"" shells and its manufacture date is august of 2008, so relatively this is a very young gun when it comes to the life of a shotgun. this shotgun is in immaculate condition, mostly been in a dafe for its whole life. the 1100 is a top tier incredibly reliable shotgun and will go head to head with the most expensive of semi-auto shotguns. i have 4 boxes of shells (100 rounds) through the barrel from a day of shooting clays and it permormed amazingly. only letting it go to fund another project.

This firearm is in excellent conditon.  The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!    In addition to the features on the main handguns page, the Classic Custom features the following:  5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. 25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing. Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI. Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only. Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight. Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly. Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button."

The SUB-2000 is a pistol-caliber carbine manufactured by Kel-Tec CNC Industries of Cocoa, Florida, United States. The rifle is a blowback operated, semi-automatic firearm with its operating spring located in the tubular stock. The distinguishing characteristic of this rifle is that it folds in half for storage and transportation, and its extreme slim shape compared to other rifles. The main advantages of a carbine in a pistol caliber over a handgun include the increased sight radius which aids with accurate shooting; the long barrel more efficiently captures burning powder which increases projectile velocity; and more points of contact between the shooter and weapon which increases stability."

Center 3rd Generation gun, with a strong preference for a Shorty Forty.I also have a Kimber 25th Anniversary Custom for sale as well, and may sell my full size Kimber SIS if the price was right (that is my favorite 1911, so it would have to be a REALLY good offer)."

They use Saiga magazines. 30 round mags are available for $15 from Sportsmans guide.These are likely to rise in value in their original configurations. I haven't seen any others for sale lately, and they will only get harder to find since they are no longer imported.Not in a rush to sell, nor am I desperate to cash.
