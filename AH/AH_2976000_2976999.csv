No NYC. Production 10 Pack M-1 3006 .30-06 or 308 .308 / This listing is for One Lot of 10 clips; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extra lots at the same per-lot price and no additional shipping charges. Here are authentic U.S. Made, steel bodied clips for the venerable M1 Garand, that General Patton labeled The Greatest Battle Instrument Ever Devised. Manufacturer is Aggressive Engineering Company of Anaheim, California, a company that served during World War II and afterward as a primary U.S. Government Contractor for the WWII and Korean War issue Garands. AEC is still in business; these are marked AEC 3 as the photos show, and they have never been issued. Construction is all steel, phosphate finish. Caliber, of course, is .30-06 Springfield, and each magazine will hold 8 cartridges. These will fit any M-1 Garand, chambered in .30-06 or even .308, like the 1980s Springfield tankers. We’re offering these unissued AEC clips for less than $5 apiece, sold in lots of 10 only and not sold separately. Own a 10 pack for only $ 49.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Glock 23 Gen 4
The Glock was purchased just last year NEW. Purchased to carry on the daily. Didn't have a conceal so it ended up being a nice collection item for a year. It's been to the range a few times and I wouldn't say more than 100 rounds went through it. So it is in great condition. Looking to get $525.00 for it. I have the carrying case 3 magazines of 12, and 1 22 round magazine.

Mossberg 500 Tactical
The Mossberg was purchased 3 years back. It was purchased for home self defense when I moved into my first house. I don't hunt so it wasn't really used. The only time it was fired was just a few times out in the woods, just to check it out. I wouldn't even put a guess on it of 25 rounds fired through it. I still have the same box of amo from when I originally purchased it, and still have alot of the rounds remainding. I purchased it for $800 hoping I can get at least $350 for it. But make an offer and all will be considered.

BUY BOTH GUNS AND ILL TAKE $50 OFF JUST AS APPRECIATION. IM LOCAL IN PITTSBURGH. GREAT STEAL AND YOU WILL LOVE THEM. I SURE DID LOVE THEM JUST TO HAVE. BOTH ARE GREAT GUNS BY GREAT COMPANIES. THEY ARE BOTH 1 OWNER (ME) AND NEITHER HAS SEEN 100 ROUNDS FIRED.

Glock 23 Gen 4
The Glock was purchased just last year NEW. Purchased to carry on the daily. Didn't have a conceal so it ended up being a nice collection item for a year. It's been to the range a few times and I wouldn't say more than 100 rounds went through it. So it is in great condition. Looking to get $525.00 for it. I have the carrying case 3 magazines of 12, and 1 22 round magazine.

Mossberg 500 Tactical
The Mossberg was purchased 3 years back. It was purchased for home self defense when I moved into my first house. I don't hunt so it wasn't really used. The only time it was fired was just a few times out in the woods, just to check it out. I wouldn't even put a guess on it of 25 rounds fired through it. I still have the same box of amo from when I originally purchased it, and still have alot of the rounds remainding. I purchased it for $800 hoping I can get at least $350 for it. But make an offer and all will be considered.

BUY BOTH GUNS AND ILL TAKE $50 OFF JUST AS APPRECIATION. IM LOCAL IN PITTSBURGH. GREAT STEAL AND YOU WILL LOVE THEM. I SURE DID LOVE THEM JUST TO HAVE. BOTH ARE GREAT GUNS BY GREAT COMPANIES. THEY ARE BOTH 1 OWNER (ME) AND NEITHER HAS SEEN 100 ROUNDS FIRED.

-New battery
-New spark plugs
-New radiator
-New catalytic converter
-New shocks
-Brand new in the box led rear tail lights
This jeep had a heavy duty curri 4x4 track bar installed

The good: The tires are still good, bf mud terrains, it is locked up with Detroit lockers front and rear, interior is good, all engine components are running great, has an air compressor under the hood, it has four wheeling rims, rock sliders, differential armor, I think
It has a cold air intake, also have the original bikini top but it's a little beat up. The new hard top is in great shape, also have bulldog fiberglass upper doors with glass sliders, it's geared but Not sure of the exact ratio but handles 35s on the trails great.

The bad: the front stabilizer shock is shot and it is getting the wobbles BUT I have an appointment with Four to go in wheat ridge to get the wobbles fixed. It will get a new stabilizer shock, everything tightened up as well as an alignment, tire rotation and tow adjusted.
After 04/25/2014 there will be nothing wrong with this jeep at all.

PKM Beltfed Semi-Automatic 7.62X54R with COLLECTOR KIT. 

Probably Collectible?  There is no doubt that this will become a very collectable weapon for a variety of reasons.  For one thing the ammunition is so inexpensive for this weapon that it offsets the cost greatly.  Why do PKM's cost so much you may ask, it's because there are very few in the USA that were ever imported.  The PKM is often touted as the best machine gun in the world for it's class.  It is lightweight, accurate and unbelievably dependable.  Most the countries in the world have adopted it with exception of the US military, who unofficially uses the weapon in battle also.

More Information

The PKM is a Kalashnikov-designed and manufactured GPMG (General Purpose Machine Gun) that is in use all over the world, most visibly recently in the middle East. Copies of the PKM are produced in other countries (mostly Eastern-bloc). Its reliability, simplicity, and relative light weight (20 lbs with bipod) has made it very especially popular in 2nd and 3rd-world nations, and has seen use by PSCs (Private Security Contractors) in Iraq. Vltor (Wiselite Arms)  manufactures PKM receivers for building up complete weapons from parts kits to qualified organizations, and also complete weapons. Vltor (Wiselite Arms)  made improvements to the original PKM receiver design including strengthening in problem areas and machined receiver rails instead of stamped.

The PKM fires the 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge, one of the oldest military cartridges in the world. The famous Russian sniper rifle, the Dragunov SVD, uses this same round. Contrary to most belt fed weapons, the PKM feeds a metal belt from the right side of the receiver. If the barrel and gas piston tube of the PK look like an upside-down AK, that's because it's basically an AK-action turned upside down. The feel of the PKM is familiar to those who've handled Soviet-designed weapons. The pistol grip and stock are characteristic to that genre, as is the stamped metal construction. 

The PKMs we fired are in the light machine gun role, with a simple gas-tube mounted sheet metal bipod. The bipod is held under the barrel by a clip and when released, springs open. Loading the PKM is done by pressing the catch at the rear of the top cover, which should be familiar to AK shooters when they remove the top cover. The top cover is lifted open and a belt is laid in the feedway against the stop. The cover is snapped shut and the cocking handle on the right is pulled back, which makes the weapon ready to fire. 

One cool feature of the PKM is that the ejection port dust cover on the left side of the receiver is spring loaded and stays closed and only opens as an empty cases is ejected. The link ejection port above it also has a spring loaded dust cover that is opened when the bolt is pulled to the rear.

Shooting impression - it's light for that size caliber, accurate, and just very pleasant to shoot.

Improvements


Compared to conventional PKM receivers, Vltor's (Wiselite Arms)  receiver is more robust, rigid and wear resistant. Vltor (Wiselite Arms)  has researched the PKMs history and found the weaknesses of the existing chassis and moved forward to improve upon its design. For example, the PKM receiver was notorious for cracking around the rear trunnion rivet holes. This was cured through increased strengthening around the said holes. Another downside to the original PKM receiver was the excessive wear on the receiver's rails. 

Vltor (Wiselite Arms) has remedied the problem by the eliminating the conventional ""stamped"" rails by replacing them with fully machined, heat-treated tool steel rails. Finally, with the installation of the tool steel rails, the Vltor (Wiselite Arms) PKM receiver is less likely to flex or twist during operation, when compared to the original."

I will meet you at the Blacksburg shooting range if you would like to test fire any of my listed firearms. May consider meetings at local ""gun friendly"" businesses, like a gun shop. I will not meet you at my home or yours, unfortunately there are some folks out there wanting to do harm and we do not have the time to ""get to know"" one another. Hate to do this but you will need to provide your own ammo for test fires. Seems that folks like to make me drag all my guns out, haul them to the range, shoot up my ammo and then not buy anything. Ammo and gas ain't cheap so do not waste my time.

The only wear to the gun is the slight finish fade on the barrel every Cheetah gets after its fire a few hundred rounds.   Operation is flawless with all the ammo I have used.  The feed ramp is polished and the slide glides like butter.   If you are looking for a CCW gun, this one should be considered.  It's a favorite back up or off duty gun with police officers since the design is near identical to their full size Beretta 92FS.  It's also why you rarely seen them come up for sale.  The single stack design gives you a very comfortable hold and will make it comfortable to carry in a belt bag or inside the pants holster.  Both magazines are near new Beretta magazines with Pearce Grip Extension for additional comfort.  If you would like the original flat bottoms for the magazines, I have those to.   I have an extra set of 3rd partly metallic green grips that come with the gun as well!

The rifle is an excellent shooter, barrel is shiny and new looking. Firearm has no trouble or failures of any sort. I had it appraised recently at Cabellas for 700.

The rifle is a fine example of a Yugo capture, all part numbers are matching (including stock, bolt, magazine plate, barrel), shoots extremely well, stamped Mod98/48 (means it was one of the few redone after 1950). These rifles were made with newer production Yugo barrel and are excellent shooters. Stamped RAD 145, meaning it came from workshop 145, which is an unusual specimen seeing as no one knows the location or anything about this workshop. Most Yugos came from PREDUZECE 44, while this one did not. Also quite unusual (and quite exciting) is the presence of an iron eagle and swastika hidden behind the bolt handle as well as a couple Waffenamps. When these rifles were refinished by the arsenals all German markings were scrubbed off, but in this rare case they missed one (as well as a couple other Waffenamps stamps on the barrel bands). It is visible only when the bolt is removed, which could be explained how the scrubbers missed this one.

Not interested in Trades, but feel free to make a suggestion if you like.

Also I have nearly 500 rounds of various ammo, mostly Romanian steel core on stripper clips. I also have reloading supplies including die set, powder, bullets and primers. Feel free to inquire as I'd rather move all this in one batch but it's certainly not required.

Restrictions apply on higher capacity magazines in some parts of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional magazines at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping. Here are never issued factory Beretta Magazines with all steel body construction, blue finish, high impact black polymer follower and floorplate, 15 round capacity for any Beretta 92, 92SB, 92S, 92F, M-9 pistols. These are all PB stamped Italian Made Beretta Factory magazines. This particular batch of magazines came to us from a Law Enforcement trade, and they were never issued. They are just like they shipped in 2005 – 2006 from Beretta in bulk. Their only surface detractions are occasional contact evidence, no ejection or insertion whitening at all. Buyers will receive magazines from the same batch as the photo specimens. Factory magazines like these free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, never fail during a firefight. Replacement pricing on these in our area is upwards of $50 apiece, when a person can even find them. Wholesale is upwards of $50 apiece on these. Our Single Mag price is $33.00. We’re offering these fine, genuine Italian Factory Beretta Magazines, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 per; buy 3 for only $78.00.

This rifle, chambered in 5.45x39.5mm, utilizes the famous short gas system (Krinkov or AKS-74U) and features a full-length 16"" barrel.

A perfect candidate for SBR (Short Barrel Rifle) *, the SLR-104UR rifle is a brand new Bulgarian stamped receiver rifle that is built from all original brand new factory parts and premium quality US made components, from its hammer forged chrome lined barrel to the original Bulgarian Arsenal mil-spec. stamped receiver.

The SLR-104UR comes with Arsenal, Inc.'s already famous left-side folding solid polymer buttstock and ribbed handguards. The folding buttstock makes the SLR-104UR compact rifle for carrying easily and locks in its extended position rock-solid and provides all the comfort you need during shooting. The lower handguard comes with Arsenal, Inc.'s stainless steel heat shield, which helps keep your hand cooler when shooting.

Throw an optical scope on this baby and the SLR-104UR, equipped with a double-stage trigger group, becomes an accurate sharpshooting rifle. Or, cut down the barrel and get a mean looking Krink for yourself *.

The SLR-104UR accepts any mil-spec double stack 5.45x39.5mm caliber magazine (available through K-Var.com: M-74B, and M-74B45).

This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price, and with no additional shipping charges. For the past few years, American Tactical Imports has led us to appreciate Turkish Gunmaking Finesse. Here is ATI’s factory 10 shot magazine for its well made, slick-finished FS9, CS9, and HP9 series of pistols, modeled and named after John Moses Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Italian influence, rather than Belgian, is more in evidence on the pistol itself as well as on its magazine. The tell-tale marking on the magazine is its patent number 5386657, a Mec-Gar patent. Manufacturer is Tisas, shorthand abbreviation for Trabzon, Turkey, Gun Industry Corporation; and these are manufactured on Italian equipment. These magazines also fit the ATI FS-9 and CS-9 pistols. Interestingly, it will not fit a 92F series Beretta, but it works just fine in the Beretta 8000 Cougar, and the Stoeger Cougar Clone pistols, with only a quarter inch or so of protrusion past the butt of the Cougar’s grip frame, as the photos show. It will NOT fit a PX4 Beretta, either. Construction is smooth bright blue finished steel, with steel spring and heavy duty black polymer extended floorplate and cartridge follower. This magazine flush fits the grip frame of the HP-9 pistol, as opposed to its standard issue extended twenty rounder. Pricing on this magazine often approaches $60 apiece for the ten rounders, even more for the issue magazines that usually come with the pistols. Our Single Mag price is $24.00. We’re offering the ten rounders in the photos, however, or their identical mates, in lots of 3 or more at only $16 per. Own 3 for only $ 48.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

We cannot ship this to some jurisdictions; please read the entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for ONE upper and ONE magazine. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, however, may take any number of extra packages at the same price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a complete upper that enables owners of AR-15 type rifles to convert their gun into something as good as an FN P-90 rifle, for about 1/3 of the usual cost. This is PW Arms’s AR57 Upper. The receiver and its component rails begin with a single block of Aircraft Grade 7075 T6 aluminum, rated at 83000 PSI strength. The entire upper is precision milled to within .002 tolerance. This upper is well ported for heat dissipation, and comes with an integral picatinny quad-rail system. The assembly process’s final steps include Infused Hard Coat Anodized finish on the alloy, and parkerization on steel surfaces, installation of front and rear sight area picatinny rails. GBQ Parkerizing process ensures finish durability on the steel. Barrel is 16.04 inch 4 channel fluted, free floating with open ended flash suppressor. Rate of twist is 1: 8.5 inches. Bolt is heat treated 4140 chrome alloy parkerized, like the barrel. Receiver and rail block measures just over 17 inches overall length; from the receiver back to the muzzle end, total length is 24 9/16 inches. This upper receiver comes furnished with a 3 5/8 inch Carbine buffer; owners of A2 rifles will need an AR type buffer. The most important feature of this upper, writes the factory, is its reliability. Unlike many other receivers, they continue, there is no gas system to become clogged with carbon or fouling. The chamber stays clean well beyond extended shooting sessions. Simplicity is key, they summarize, with the free sliding bolt being the only moving element. Its easy removal makes maintenance literally a snap. The AR-57 system ejects spent rounds through the lower’s magazine well, another plus. Factory cautions against using non-factory or non-FN magazines; against using reloaded or non-SAAMI approved ammunition. While we have never heard of any of these requiring the receiver to be fitted, that is always a possibility that a buyer needs to be prepared for. While these assemblies do not come furnished with any magazine from the factory, we are including the buyer’s choice of an FN Factory 10 rounder or 50 rounder.

NO CA DC CHI CT MA NJ NY PR This item is not a rifle; it is a parts kit with the potential of becoming a rifle. Restrictions apply, however, we cannot ship to civilian non-dealers in jurisdictions where AK47 Rifles are restricted to Law Enforcement only, that includes California, Connecticut, Aurora IL, Chicago Cook County IL, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, or any others with similar statutes. 

Please read this entire ad carefully, then, before bidding or offering to buy. Photos show one of only a few almost-complete parts kits we just got for the venerable Kalashnikov Rifle, known as the AK-47. This parts kit is the descendant AK-74, but fully interchangeable. Bolt face and extractor are mated for 7.62x39 caliber. All this kit needs is a receiver, barrel, both barrel trunnions, and magazine. We have partially finished receiver billets available but not included in this low price. Manufacturer is Arsenal AD of Kazanlak Bulgaria, that nation’s principal small arms manufacturer; and all these parts were made on Russian milling equipment. Their quality, then, is second to none. Condition is Excellent; the diligent workers of Croatia selected and retrieved these parts, and each kit includes a factory Inventory Sheet. These kits contain full component inventory for a Kalashnikov Rifle. All that is needed for a complete rifle is a receiver, a barrel and the trunnions for the barrel. Parts included are, to the best of our ability to identify them: stamped steel receiver cover ; milled steel bolt and operating assembly; stamped steel & brown polymer Gas Tube/Forend assembly; milled steel rear sight assembly with block; underfolder type stamped and cast steel side stock assembly with folding buttplate; brown polymer pistol grip; brown polymer forend; cast steel front sight assembly; cast steel gas block; steel cleaning rod; Stamped Steel Trigger Guard Assembly with Magazine release; cast steel handguard support with sling loop and lock lever; milled steel trigger hook assembly; milled steel sear; steel sear spring; coiled braided steel hammer spring; milled steel hammer; milled steel trigger pin; milled steel hammer pin; stamped steel safety selector / dust cover assembly; cast steel threaded muzzle brake; stamped steel selector lever stop; milled steel disconnector; stamped steel bolt carrier rail assembly; single hook milled steel trigger; milled steel barrel pin; milled steel barrel bushing lock; milled steel gas retaining pin; barrel bushing lock spring. We do not guarantee our labels to be correct, we are neither competent nor gunsmiths. Surface detractions are minimal, only edge whitening, as the photos show, and buyers will receive a kit from the same exact shipment lot as the photo specimen. These parts are greased, but that very grease is the reason they are in such fine condition. Everybody knows what AKs are selling for these days. We estimate that a barrel, both trunnions, and a receiver will cost something like $300.00. We’re offering the Bulgarian Arsenal AD Kalashnikov Rifle Parts Kit in the photos, or one of its identical mates, per kit only $ 199.00. Add a rear trunion for just $25.00 more. Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, or any jurisdiction where Kalashnikov Rifles are restricted to law enforcement only. Buyers should be aware that finishing a rifle requires an 07 manufacturing license. Circumvention of Federal Law can incur a $250,000 Fine and 10 Year Sentence in Federal Prison.

The unit will come bagged like the second picture and when put together by you (2 easy steps) will look like the picture of the complete launcher.

Please note: Without following the proper NFA steps including the full Class III checks and tax stamps, this is only a flare launcher. Be very sure you know the rules before you even think about putting anything else in this like is done by law enforcement in Europe.

I am willing to meet on the East side of Cincinnati for a FTF deal. No trades please.

Customer Review:
""I don't know how quite to put it. Other than we need more of the SWATSCOPES and NIGHT VISION ADAPTORS. The reason being is that we have all the capabilities of shooting at night, with accuracy as well. The problem? It's only out to a short distance, due to the fact that the night vision scope is on the rifle and not on the spotting scope. With the night vision adaptor, I can also put the PVS-14 on the spotting scope and lock it in place with the adaptor. I have been able to spot enemies for up to and beyond 700 meters, enabling my gunner to engage effectively; which in turn gives me the advantage of spotting for him and other friendly units. Both, the SWATSCOPE and the NIGHT VISION ADAPTOR have been outstanding. The periscope itself is great. The problem? Every time we set up in a house we have to knock holes in the walls in order to effectively engage a target, in turn letting the enemy know where our position is. With the periscope, we can simply take over a house, and use them in order to look over the wall, and scan for enemy movement at the same time without compromising our position. The bottom line, every time we go out, we face a situation in which we need to look at the terrain and wish that we had a periscope or a NVA 4440 Adapter (monolock as we call it).""

Imagine having every tool you need to get your AR back into service, right from your pistol grip. The Samson Field Survivor is a multi-tool system that has a patent-pending mechanism which secures inside the pistol grip. The Samson Field Survivor contains: a broken shell extractor, wire brush for bore cleaning, an ampule of oil for one field lube, a cable to pull the brush through the bore, a carbon scraping tool, a feed lip gage, a front sight adjustment tool, a flat blade screwdriver, a feed lip adjustment tool, a gas key cleaning tool, a cotter pin hook, and a strike plate. The Survivor also comes with a spare extractor pin and two firing pin retaining clips. The Field Survivor tool is the one tool necessary for every AR to keep you safe in combat, or in play on the range. Just insert the Survivor into place and twist the base to lock it in place. The Field Survivor fits all A2 pistol grips and Hogue AR15 Rev 2 grips.
