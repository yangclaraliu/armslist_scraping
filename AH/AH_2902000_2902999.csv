Pay regular Walmart prices.

This is a website that checks walmart ammuniton inventory. 

You need to check it out. Once you learn how it works you'll know what store is getting which type of ammo.

Learn your local store stocking times and get your ammo. It's out there.
When the truck arrives the manifest is accepted at the store. Once scanned in it will update in GREEN. Now you figure out when it hits the shelves.
My store updates at 9pm - 3am. Stocks at 7am.

According to the second picture.It shows Light Green. This came in either today or yesterday. May still be a box or two.  
The one in grey(MiniMags) was stocked the other day and probably gone...but just maybe.

Local stores are dry at the moment. But that can change on the next inventory check.

i AM GETTING FLAGGED BY THE MARKETERS THAT WANT TO KEEP DOUBLING THE PRICE.
PLEASE POST A LISTING ELSEWHERE WITH THIS INFORMATION. GET IT IN THE RIGHT HANDS FOR THE RIGHT PRICE.

Two employees.  We're not reselling Walmart ammo--ours is straight from a distributor. 

Right now we have a larger quantity of 22LR available than any Walmart near you.  As a dealer we may never see this much 22 again.  This is in fact our first shipment of ammo ever, and as an independent dealer with no big-box store buying power, we were lucky to receive it.  So we're selling it.  Despite wanting to keep it and spend the next several years shooting it all ourselves.  No limits on purchases, with pricing half that of many online retailers.

I can also include about 300 brass cases of .45 if need be.

This is a brand new setup, never used, just cleaned as per instructions.  I am selling all of this because I do not have the time to reload.

This was a ready to shoot package with whisker bisquit, three pin sight, stabilizer, quiver, and neopreme sling. It will arrive with all the same parts I bought it with, except the sling, as I have put a para-cord one on it. This is the most current package offered from PSE. This means it has the newer quiver and stabilizer on it. Below is a link to this bow on the PSE website. The only difference is the stabilizer. I am asking $400 Or best offer.

Special features include a 9 shot extended magazine tube, bevelled loading gate and shorter foreend for quick reloading, and an oversized bolt handle and release for easier operation. The receiver is laser engraved with ""JM Pro-Series, Tactical Class.""

Mossberg 930 shotguns feature a self-regulating gas system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate stress on critical components. All 930 autoloaders chamber both 2.75 inch and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease from target loads, to magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. The ambidextrous safety and included stock spacers ensure that this shotgun will fit any operator's requirements. The receiver features a drilled and tapped receiver for mounting optics, if desired. A high visibility fiber optic front sight is fitted."

We are an independent no-franchise small local Minnesota firearms dealer and can't compete with Walmart. Two employees. We're not reselling Walmart ammo--ours is straight from a distributor. 

 Right now we have a larger quantity of 22LR available than any Walmart near you. As a dealer we may never see this much 22 again. This is in fact our first shipment of ammo ever, and as an independent dealer with no big-box store buying power, we were lucky to receive it. So we're selling it. Despite wanting to keep it and spend the next several years shooting it all ourselves. No limits on purchases, with pricing half that of many online retailers.

The barrel is in very good shape but does not spin.   This percussion revolver is more of a wall piece as it looks exactly like the old colts.    This is an old gun with serial 2642 stamped in single place on bottom and ""FTF Italy"" stamped on bottom of handgrip butt.

It has been in the basement for about 60 years and hasn't really been handled since it was brought back.  I recently found it and did a little cleaning with some Rem Oil wipes to get some surface grime off and checked to make sure it actually dry fired, which it does.  It is from the Toyo Kogyo Arsenal made between 1939-1945 and is a 34th series rifle, 7.7 cal.  The mum is still in great shape because it was a brought back personally by my grand father.  The rear trigger guard screw is missing but I plan to order a set from Numrich next week and install.  He believes he lost the screw shortly after bringing it back and stripping the rifle once.  The rifle has some slight rusting on the surface but nothing too serious it seems.  Shows to be a true war relic.  I can try to help provide any information possible.  I would entertain trading for a SKS or possibly 9mm/.40 hand guns.  No shotguns or other caliber pistols or revolvers.

I travelled to this gun store with $2,000 cash in hand, excited to purchase a 1939 German Luger.  Jon Devaux, the owner, stated the pistol was numbers matching.  I asked him to disassemble the pistol so I could inspect the bore and confirm the serial numbers matched (to verify the $1,695 valuation of the pistol). Jon refused stating the only numbers I needed to see where on the barrel and outer receiver. I informed him that there were addition numbers on the components inside the pistol including under the trigger plate, the hold open bar, the bolt, extractor, firing pin, front toggle, and back toggle. The disassembly only takes about 30 seconds and does not require any tools. After I told Jon about the addition numbers he became defensive and said I could check AFTER I purchased the $1,695 pistol. This should be a red flag to any collector.  If he had nothing to hide he would have disassembled the pistol.  I have no doubt he is trying to sell a pistol that is NOT numbers matching for a numbers matching price. I WOULD NOT TRUST THIS DEALER.  MAKE THE DRIVE INTO COLORADO SPRINGS OR DENVER."

Very few military units are permitted to paint their rifles. Seal's used to spray paint their own firearms themselves but for the most part have them professionally done now. The HK 416 is available for SEAL and SOCOM use and has been standard equipment for some time. These units are available for civilian sale and are designated as the MR556A1 by HK but these upgraded versions are NON CATALOG items typically not offered for civilian purchase (but again you may buy this deployment package). The 416/MR556A1 per contract spec has had all internal parts NP3 PLUS coated and had their exteriors coated in Desert Tan Poly-T2. NP3 PLUS has a 1000 hour salt spry protection level per ASTM-B-117 and Poly T2 exceeds 1000 hours. No BS FACTS.. we know from personal experience this HK platform is the finest piston driven platform in the world; further there are only two piston systems we would EVER use in Indian country.. This system expels all gases out front and literally gets wiped out with a cloth after use. By adding the aerospace contract coatings we do not oil the upper or lowers as the lubricity factors in NP3 Plus are stunning. We do routinely clean the barrels however. HK units have 16.1"" match barrels and are guaranteed sub moa, tactical upgraded charging handles, upgraded bolt systems (NP3 Plus), weep ports for water use, German G4 adjustable stocks with soft rubber recoil buttplate (swing out with storage), genuine HK German mfg rail covers. HK delivers these units with ""battle triggers"" which means they kinda suck (sorry). Special Forces and SEALS replace the battle trigger units with Geissele custom units upon receipt ( no BS real deal). These custom run non catalog HK rifles also have Geissele trigger packages installed.Topped with the same scope used by your Special Forces the Leupold Mark 6 1-6. At 1x works as a red dot scope (illuminated) for CQB close quarter battle yet you can dial up to 6x for your 800 meter sniper shots. Military version waterproof, dustproof. Package includes the Sig Sauer MK25D. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs the fleets special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs. This Desert version features flat dark earth coated alloy frame and stainless steel slide. It also features a UID identification label, anti-corrosion coatings on controls and internal components. Letter of authenticity from Sig Sauer confirms this is the REAL Mark 25 which comes with FIVE (5) magazines. Package includes the as issued Hardigg military issue case which holds all including two padded grenade pockets (grenades shown on top of grenade padding/case for display purposes)."
