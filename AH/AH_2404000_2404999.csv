***Israel Weapon Industry Tavor Rifle**

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

-Optimized ergonomic design.
-30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
-Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
-Detachable barrel.
-Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
-Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.

-Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
-Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
-Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
-Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
-100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.

Must have FOID Card and person to person only.

The Spectre SMG was developed by Italian company SITES in the mid-1980s. Spectre was designed primarily for close combat, anti-terror or police operations thatrequire compact size, instant firepower at the short ranges and safety of operations.

Spectre is a recoil operated, automatic firearm. It fires from the closed bolt, an is a hammer-fired. The trigger group is more similar to handguns, than to SMG - it is Double Action without manual safety but with decocker. So, Spectre could be carried with loaded chamber and hammer down and then fired immediately simply by pressing the trigger. The receiver of the Spectre is made from stamped steel. The bolt is so designed that it acts as an air pump to push air through barrel shroud and provide additional cooling for the barrel and action (very useful when firing long bursts). Spectre has top-folding stock and polymer forward handle. It uses high-capacity, four column magazines for increased firepower."

Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) Tactical 300 Blackout rifle. Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC Blackout, this rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price. A long-time favorite of both military and police units, the Model 700 offers the legendary accuracy and unfailing performance you ve come to expect. At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16.5"" inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle breaks and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed. The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue OverMolded Ghillie Green pillar bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington s X-Mark Pro externally adjustable trigger, designed to break-like-glass and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy."

Tactical Solutions has transferred the innovation from the X-Ring™ series SBX barrel over to the AR-22 conversion. The AR-22 SBX barrel is a 6061-T6 lightweight aluminum threaded end* barrel with a 4140 button rifled steel liner and Hogue® free float forend. The SBX barrel has bore length of 12.25” with a permanently attached shroud for an overall length of 16.5” allowing the user to attach a suppressor without adding length. This gives the user all the advantages of a short barreled rifle without the time consuming and costly SBR paperwork. As with all of our AR-22 conversions, it includes our CNC machined bolt assembly with 416 stainless steel bolt and precision ground tool steel guide rails for strength and smooth, reliable, functionality. In addition, the AR-22 SBX includes a forged charging handle with our tactical latch. Each conversion is shipped with a 10 or 25** round Black Dog Machine magazine.

The PX4 Storm Special Duty was developed to meet the very demanding requirements of the original .45 caliber JCP (Joint Combat Pistol) specifications issued by SOCOM: superior weather resistance, three magazines (one 9-round flush and two 10-round extended), dark earth frame, extended barrel, tactical case and additional accessories.
Developed For JCP Program According To SOCOM Specs.

Rotating Barrel:
The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle raise.

Ambidextrous Safety:
The ambidextrous safety lever is easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. 

Accessory Rail:
The frame of the PX4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

Automatic Firing Pin Block:
The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time.

External Hammer Design:
A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/ uncocked status of the pistol. Hammer unit can be easily removed.

Individual Side Grips:
Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large back-straps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The back-straps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.

Reversible Magazine Release:
Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use."

I agree, some of the pistols listed here are absolutely overpriced, but remember, we are not all in Nashville where there is stiff competition. Some of us in outlying areas have to shop locally where there may only be 1 or 2 dealers. In my case, I have a gen 3 Glock 23 listed that I believe is priced fairly. If you buy a gen 3 for 400, add new night sights, a new magazine and a new kydex holster, you will easily have over 500 in the gun. If you know where I can buy one like mine for 399, please tell me.

Desert Eagles don’t have a typical pistol design instead it uses a gas-operated rotating bolt, which is a trait more common for rifles. It has a fixed barrel and front end, so the bolt blows back instead of a slide. Features include an ambidextrous safety and when engaged it disables the trigger and blocks the firing pin, so even if it drops it won’t discharge. Magnum Research's founders, Jim Skildum and John Risdall had been involved with the company since 1979. Both men oversaw the ascent of the Desert Eagle® Pistol from a concept on paper to a pop culture icon including a Playboy magazine front cover featuring Pamela Anderson showing off a Pink Desert Eagle pistol. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been produced in the USA at MRI's Pillager, MN facility. The Desert Eagle pistols are made in a number of distinctive and appealing finishes including classic brushed chrome and the latest the distinctive and collectable “Tiger Stripe” pattern - a Gold Titanium Nitride - Authentic Bengal Tiger Striped coated finish, which is a very hard surface. The DE is very easy to disassemble for cleaning. Warranty papers are in each box, including safety cable and Bolt tool. This gun includes an extra MR magazine [7 rounds] and 20 boxes [20 rds ea.] - 400 total rounds of factory 300 -325 Gr. ammo. Gun(s) and the ammo are very hard to find on the open market, NIB [New in the box], as these are. This gun has the fancy hand inlaid engraved grips [Silver, Brass and Gold], as seen in the pictures.

Anything acquired is for personal and educational purposes only.  Nothing acquired will be resold or used for commercial or monetary gain.  My grandfather served in Europe, landing initially in North Africa (Torch), to Sicily, onto D-Day at Anzio, eventually up through Italy, into France and on to Germany.  After his recent passing, I am following his personal account and experience of the war to re-create a living collection of what he may have used, encountered, seen or come by.  

Anyone with whom I meet that is interested, whether or not we exchange anything, I will be happy to provide you with a copy of my grandfather's account of the war.

Unfortunately, the Greatest Generation is aging and regrettably we will see those who preserved the world's freedom pass on into history.  Text books can provide a 'bigger picture' view of the events that took place; however it is often through the personal accounts of those who witnessed these events first hand that can truly provide the best insight into the daily conditions and emotions the men and women who served experienced.  My goal is to collect and organize as much information on this critically important period of history as I can so that I may share it with others and preserve the experiences of those who were there."

These were made from 1934 to 1945. pricing bb goes as exc 350 , vgood 300 , good 250.
This one is in very nice shape actually. Cleaned and frog lubbed. Took the grips off and cleaned around those as well. Scrubbed in and out very nice.
email your cell number to get with. The blue book pricing is accurate as I can tell and as much research as I could find. I did not find much on the Model 1 pistol.
It is a nine shot .32 acp or 7.62 browning . Has one magazine with it.
These were made for the French Army i was reading. I did not find any of these for sale on gunsameraic or gunbroker.
Would like just what I have into it which is 290.00 .
I am going to drive over to the range with the 2 boxes of ammo I got today and give her a try. Cabellas has plenty of .32 acp actually. 
local cash only. Only trade would be a ruger 1022 or a ruger markiii 22 pistol. Maybe another gun but not any shotguns.
Thanks
I just bought this monday to do a review and youtube and range time video. So it is ready for a new home. If you get to me before i goto the range, you can buy the ammo as well would save you the drive.  

ok, thats about it I guess. Cell number to call and we can get together. Oh one last item. have a ne buyers permit or iowa if you live there. i might take some less then 290 depends on how we talk on the phone and excited you are. This would be a nice piece for your colection as it is in great shape."

The Trijicon ACOG ECOS-G is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter Battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required.  Trijicon is the first to market with its unique dark earth brown color, a definite factor to concealment- directly contributing to the safety of the operator, who is often in harms way. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight.  With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand, truly the best of both worlds.

Not much to say, its not pretty, but if you know these actions, you know they work! Then, now, and after.

The action is extremely slick, trigger has some loose play, but tightens up crisp light and consistant. 

The bad: obviously it has a sporter stock, no lug, sport mag, and a folding rear sight replacing the peep. Also there is significant blueing loss but little to no pitting or rust. 
(where it looks like pitting on the barrel it isn't! Its some of the remaining blueing against the metallic wear.
The stock has a couple nicks but nothing to make it non functional.

The good: Slick action, good trigger for a mil-surp, strong rifling, strong, solid action. 
And there is a nice pad on the the stock so recoil is mild at best.

Will sell, or trade!  Having trouble uploading pics, but I have them and will gladly send."

Every once in a while you hear of someone ""inadvertently"" trying to get a weapon through airport security. If they were carrying the 340pd I'd believe it was at least possible. So light you forget you're carrying, which is what it's all about. In my opinion the best carry weapon ever made. If you have ever fired a .357 don't believe the stories about unmanageable recoil. I fired this weapon one-handed accurately and I'm average sized. I've also been shooting .357's for 20 plus years. Not interested in trades. Cash only. Will not ship."

Ruger has discontinued the Redhawk, for whatever that is worth. Who knows if there will be some massive Redhawk shortage now that they have released next year's product catalog without it. No box or papers and I am not the original owner, so I don't know a round count. Excellent condition with some minor, surface marks from carry and use. You have to get the light just right to see them and they would very easily buff out with a Scotch-Brite pad, as they don't go into the metal. They are just on the surface finishing. However, unless you really move the gun around in the light and look for them, they really aren't that noticeable. I took a couple pics with the light just right so you could see the worst of them. Excellent mechanical condition with tight lock-up and excellent carry-up. Best trigger I have ever felt on a Redhawk, too. Great hunting handgun, but extraneous to my needs. $650 for a face to face deal in Hickory, NC.  Thanks for looking!"
