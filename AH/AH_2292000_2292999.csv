Thanks for making such a family-friendly collection of great rifles. You have a much better understanding of what people enjoy about shooting than do other firearm companies. Our Henry lever action is high quality, easy to use, accurate, and an absolute pleasure to handle. You have no competitors in value for the price.

Here is a photo of my wife at the range with the Henry I gave her for Christmas. As an immigrant from China, where individuals aren't allowed to own firearms, she has a special appreciation of our second amendment rights.





The Henry Pump Action  .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom's apple pie, a restored '57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles. This Varmint Target model is a predators worst nightmare, and a target shooters dream. So weather your taking that long range shot at a coyote in that distant canyon, or the little 10 ring on your match target this rifle will perform with the accuracy you expect from a Ruger."

It comes with the original box, papers and the factory mag spring and cap should you want to convert it back to original 4 round capacity.
NOTE...This is a real Police Magnum, not an express magnum or that so-called ""tactical 870"" that is really no more than an express 870. Police Magnums are different and were built to a much higher standard than their civilian counterparts and DID NOT use MIM parts that can fail like the Express Magnum. Don't expect a hunting model to measure up to a Police Magnum's quality. These guns are built to a high standard because lives will depend on it not failing when an officer needs it. This firearm was built way before Remington was bought out be Freedom Group.

FACTORY V6 engine, manual 3 speed, 4H and 4L. 
Bought as a project and got it running this summer/fall but now the starter is not working and it's blowing a fuse due to that. I just don't have time so might consider selling/trading just so I don't have to see the soldier sitting in my driveway making me sad!
There is a brake issue that was unresolved when I got it as well. The master and the brake pedal are one unit and it is NOT hooked up (the pedal just sits on the floor). That didn't stop me from driving it around the neighborhood earlier this year with no brakes! I put it in 4L and downshifted to slow.. It's very fun to drive, no power anything, a true off road beast.
I filled transfer case and tranny with fluid and it ran great, really suprised me.
Body is pretty rough, floorboards and tub rusty (looks like the previous owners just put a light layer of bondo over the whole thing and sprayed it blue. I put OD green over it and added new 15 inch rims and 34 swampers. 
It has BESTOP top and seat covers (kinda old but still good shape) also has doors.
Has a big skyjacker lift (probably 6"") on it.
This was someone's mud toy and my intent was to make it street able for driving around, again I'm just too busy with other projects. 
I will sell for 800 with worn 31"" tires and used rims OR 
1800 with the new 34"" TSL's and black rims as shown in pics.
Will trade for value of firearms/ammo valued at 1000 and 2000 respectfully.
Please be reasonable on your estimation of firearm value because I'm knowledgable about ALL weapons and won't even respond if you try low-balling me.
I DON'T NEEED TO SELL, I just feel bad it's not getting the attention it deserves.
Please reply in email form and if you are serious or the offer is reasonable, I will send you my number so we can talk.
Already has tow-bar on it so ready to roll.
AGAIN, price/trade value is 1800/2000 as shown in pics, will come with other rims and well worn 31"" tires for the 800/1000 price/trade value.

Starting in the 1920's, the Japanese government required all junior and senior high school boys to have two hours a week of military training. Several companies started producing the necessary training rifles for this purpose. Unfortunately most training rifles did not bear markings that identified their origin.
These training rifles had no standard design and were often made from older models of military rifles or parts from these rifles. Therefore you will find many variations of the same model. There are known models that used 1888 Mauser, type 99, type 30, and type 38 rifle parts. These training rifles continued to be produced until the late 1930's. Some of these rifles could not be fired while others would fire wooden bullet blank ammunition. Many of the blank firing rifles were made with smooth bore barrels. Rarely would any of these rifles fire the standard service round. Nearly all of these training rifles could carry bayonets."

If I agree to sell to one person on this website, and another man comes along and says I'll give you such and such, I reserve the right to sell to the next man. It's my gun and I'll do what I want with it. However, I won't hold out on you. If you offer and we talk on the phone, we'll set up a meeting within the week at an FFL. Once you got me in the door at the FFL (and remember I want to sell this thing fast, which is why the price is so low), the gun is yours assuming you brought cash.

I've had the same experience. I've responded within the first hour of the posting and never received a response. Sellers need to be courteous, and at least inform buyers if the they have another potential buyer. 

Another problem is posting with no intention of selling. Such behavior negatively impact and devalue this site

My final concern is the need for responsible transactions. Must posting indicate buyer / seller must produce valid ID, CCW permit and agree to sign a fire-arm-bill of sale. This is an excellent and responsible practice. I'm a advent buyer from this site and a few times I've travel over 100 miles to complete the financial transaction, only to find out that the seller will not sign a fire-arm bill of sale. For me this is a deal breaker and a waste of time. Let's keep the government out of our business, but we must remain diligent and responsible by agreeing to all terms of sell as posted. Signing a fire-arm bill of sale, protects everyone. If don't, we are only inviting government intervention.

This is a great site, let's keep it that way."

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle.
