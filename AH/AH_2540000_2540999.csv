For those who aren't familiar with these, they were made in the same valley as Beretta in Italy by Tanfoglio, but these pistols were made for the Israeli military under contract and thus have ""MOSSAD"" with two 6 point ""Star of David"" on the slide. This classic pistol is based upon the classic loved CZ-75 design. Frame says ""Made by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.P.A. for ""Weapons House LTD"" - Israel"".  Bore/barrel look good, no pitting and good distinct grooves, 9mm 16 round mag double stack. One Italian made Mec-Gar mag included. Additional mags are plentiful as they take the same mags as current CZ75, Baby Eagle, Jericho, Springfield p9 and Tanfoglio Witness pistols - this pistol is the same basic design as all of these (CZ75 clones that are still being made today). 

 This is neat opportunity to own a very uniquely marked and rich historic pistol used to defend the nation of Israel. Many believe that Israeli Mossad officers originally may used this weapon as their ""home"" carry protection. For those that may not know, the Israeli Mossad is roughly the equivalent of our FBI/CIA. A very rare and potentially valuable addition to many collections.

All serial #'s match on the Bolt, Butt Plate, Trigger Guard, & Receiver. Only the bayonet has a different Serial #. This rifle is in very good shape and is a dead on shooter at 50 ft and I'm sure it could nail something much farther but the range I took it to had limited range for testing its full potential. I don't know exactly what condition grade it would merit but it's been cleaned of all cosmoline so I'll just let the pictures speak for its condition. Come with some extra accessories as shown in the pictures. Not interested in trading so please serious buyers only. Will accept cash only and buyer must pick up at my house.

This Tula made Russian M91/30  Mosin Nagant has a great bore. It was made after WWII so it was probably stored without much, if any, firing of corrosive ammunition. These are tough, fun guns, and it should make a nice shooter with its nice bore. It also looks very impressive with the bayonet extended. The M91/30  rifle was developed after the Germans overran and killed thousands of Soviet soldiers equipped with the M38 carbine which had no provisions for a bayonet. The M91/30  was intended to be issued to all soldiers, replacing not only carbines but rifles as well. The M91/30  was used by many countries following the war, and was a favorite of the Israeli Haganah."

The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

609,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2540609,For Sale:   NEW BLACK OPS .45,"High Point, North Carolina, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, March 1, 2014",Handguns,Para Ordnance                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Pistol Features
The frame and slide of the single-action .45 ACP Black Ops pistol are both constructed of solid, reliable stainless steel. The frame's dust cover features a milled-in tactical rail for light and laser accessories. The slide is milled with front and rear cocking serrations and a flared ejection port. 
Inside the slide you will find a full-length guide rod, match-grade barrel bushing and Para's Power Extractor. The slide assembly is topped off with front and rear combat style fixed metallic Trijicon night sights. The match-grade trigger is skeletonized and fitted with a factory-set over travel stop, and the flat mainspring housing features 25 lines-per-inch checkering. The hammer is skeletonized for a fast lock time. The grip panels are manufactured of tough, heavily textured black G10 and held in place with black hex-head screws. 
External safeties include an ambidextrous thumb safety and a beavertail grip safety with a raised speed bump. Internal passive safeties include a disconnector to prevent the pistol from firing out of battery and a hammer half-cock to prevent an accidental discharge if the primary sear notch fails. To prevent the pistol from firing if dropped, the captured firing pin will not engage a cartridge primer unless it is struck by the hammer, and a firing pin block prevents the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is fully depressed. Two of PARA's Expert eight-round magazines are included in the hard case this pistol ships in. 
The entire Black Ops pistol is treated with an Ionbond satin black finish. It is approximately three times harder than chrome with a lower fiction coefficient. This includes the 5-inch match-grade barrel. If you really want to find out how tough a finish is, applying it to the barrel would be the way to find out since most barrels treated with bluing or other chemical treatments tend to show wear right away. The PK2 treated barrel on this pistol shows no visible wear after hundreds of rounds. As it turns out, former U.S. Army Sergeant and World Champion action shooter Travis Tomasie has put thousands of rounds down range through a barrel with this finish, and it still shows almost no indications of its rugged use.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

Prefer FTF deal with an Ohio resident but will ship for a flat fee of $35 to your FFL. Your FFL must accept it from an individual. 

FTF deal will go through my local gun shop so you will need an Ohio driver's license and be able to pass the instant background check. I am selling a lot of guns so they must go through a legal transfer so I don't run afoul of the ATF/firearms laws. Sorry if that is a deal-breaker but that's the only way I can do it! The sale price (and shipping) is what you pay. I do not charge sales tax nor is there a transfer fee."
