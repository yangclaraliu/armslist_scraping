Overall they are in great condition and were in a climate controlled building the entire time I had them. After researching to find models and such, I found they are listed as the following in order from left to right:1. Pistol Shape Series Springer - Staghorn body2. Oversize Kriss Blade Springer - Special Export Only Item - Says it is some kind of ivory, but it is too yellow for that, so not sure.3. The Guardian, Staghorn body4. Springer w/Drop Point Blade - Again, says ivory but too yellowLooking for offers. Would like to sell all knives as a set, but if the price is right, I would be willing to part them out. I would also be willing to trade for handguns in good condition. All Calibers.If you are interested in these knives, then you should be aware of what these are valued at. Especially the older ones that are directly from Germany. So again, I am looking for offers. If you email and ask me how much I am asking, I will most likely not respond back.

Handgaurd is Magpul MOE. Complete specs for this upper are available on Palmetto State Armory website.   The lower is Spikes Tactical lower Punisher rollmark. Has PSA lower kit and Magpul MOE grip and buttstock. Also comes with 3 D&H Teflon coated aluminum GI style mags and 2 Magpul Pmags. Also comes with 90 rounds of Federal AR556 55 grain ammo and 80 rounds of PMC X-Tac 62 grain M855 ammo and 436 rounds of factory reman  .223 55 grain ammo. I really like this rifle but it never gets shot and I am trying to get a motorcyle so I am selling this. This rifle has never been fired and all parts are new except for one of the Pmags which I got used. More pics available. Thank you  Must have permit and valid ID to buy   May trade for motorcycle"

Handgaurd is Magpul MOE. Complete specs for this upper are available on Palmetto State Armory website.   The lower is Spikes Tactical lower Punisher rollmark. Has PSA lower kit and Magpul MOE grip and buttstock. Also comes with 3 D&H Teflon coated aluminum GI style mags and 2 Magpul Pmags.

It has the Danish VAR barrel, which has a reputation for excellent accuracy. MW and TE are both 2. The receiver dates to 1944, according to my research. The stock has the usual dings, but no cracks or chips, and it is numbered to the gun. No import marks, of course. The only modification I ever made was to glue two pieces of plastic tie wrap to the bottom of the stock, because the trigger assembly had some play in it when the gun arrived. I've also replaced a few parts over the years, as is usual with these guns. Included with the gun are the manual, some spare parts, some enbloc clips, a SLED single shot clip, a set of plastic sight protectors and muzzle protector, a leather cheek rest, and any other odds and ends I can dig up. Not a museum piece, just a great shooter and a piece of history. Asking $900 shipped to your FFL anywhere in the Continental US. No trades.
