The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels – it is the State of the Art. The rifle also features a forged upper receiver, RDIAS/RLL compatible forged lower, Mil-Spec lower parts kit (.250 takedown and .154 FCG pins), mid-length gas system, 30-round Magpul PMAG, and it will accept standard AR15 mags with either 300AAC Blackout or 300 Whisper ammo.

My name is Jeff, and I have 1300 rounds of  federal .22 AutoMatch for sale or trade.  Honestly I would like to keep these together when I sell or trade them.

Items such as boots, socks, a 12'x12' or larger piece of padded carpet (he is moving in my unfinished basement), a split queen size box spring (my stairs cannot fit a complete box spring, and we have a queen mattress for him), nice pillows, or even a tv. I live in North Webster, but I attend IPFW so I am in Fort Wayne often and would be willing to meet there to exchange.

I have for sale a brand new Vepr 12. This is considered to be the best semi-auto shotgun on the market today. I would also consider this to be the most destructive gun a civilian can own without a class 3 license, or a BATF tax stamp. Molot is truly the gold standard of the ""AK"" platform. This is the new one that just started coming through customs a few months ago. The collapsible stock model shows impeccable quality. 

Although the folding stock is tac welded shut in one spot ,(due to federal regulations) you only need to throw on 5 US parts. After that, grind off the pencil point sized tac weld and you have a shotgun no different than the one used in the Turkish Military. 

Here is a great video illustrating the steps to take to make it 922r compliant:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SfYmyxhTUw

They offer a hinged dust cover, self regulating gas system (will cycle low brass no problem unlike saiga 12's), a pistol grip, Picatinny rail, threaded barrel, nice adjustable rubber cheek weld.

Also, the receiver on the Saiga 12 is 1.0 mm thick. Vepr 12's offer a 1.5mm thick receiver!

If you do not know about the Vepr 12 AK shotguns that have hit the US, I will attach a video. Keep in mind this video below is a video of the first ones that came through with wood stocks.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMfzN5LZc3o

This amazing shotgun comes with a factory 5rd magazine, box, and manual.

The weapon has a Tapco pistol grip/ telescoping stock. It also comes with 3 x SGM Tactical 30 round capacity polymer magazines. 
The weapon was to be my pet project. The bolt is polished. The trigger group has not been moved forward, but the rifle does have a pistol grip and a telescoping stock. 
I have not kept a shell count log on the weapon, but it has sent less than 700 rounds down range. I have kept the weapon with good maintenance. It has been cleaned after each trip to the range, and oiled before each trip to the safe. 
I am selling this weapon to raise capital for this coming spring. The weapon is not 1 dollar, it is being sold on best offer basis. The ammo has already been sold. Send me a message if you have any questions or want to make an offer.

They have reduced the weight of the rifle by wrapping parts of the rifle in carbon fiber. I was amazed at how much lighter this CA-15 with bipod and scope was compared to other AR's that have no accessories added. If you wanted to shoot this rifle with a glove on, they have allotted plenty of space by the trigger to do so. The flash suppressor not only looks great, but is made of titanium, which is durable and light. My favorite part of this rifle is the fore end that has been contoured perfectly to fit your hand.

It is made incredibly well, I bought from an older gentlemen that got it when his father passed away. He said his father loved the rifle but couldn't ever go shoot it because he had problems with his shoulders. It looks in close to new condition no signs of wear,no rust or corrosion, the scope and bi pod look unused, bore looks flawless. I got it bore sighted and brought it to the range, I started at the 100 yards it was dead on, went out to 200 yards and I was hitting 4-6"" groups. I have only shot non corrosive wolf 148 grain through it. I use a laser bore site to make sure it's still on when I take scope off to clean.
Comes with 4 mags, POSP illuminated 8x42B scope, adjustable bi pod, medal lockable Remington case with handle and wheels, laser cartridge bore sight.
Feel free to ask me any questions or request more specific pictures.

Selling the gun I built for my 14 year old daughter. A little too heavy for her.

Rem 700 action from early 70's that has been fully trued and blueprinted. This is an extremely nice older action that is super smooth.
Over size stainless pinned recoil lug.

Lilja stainless steel fluted #5 contour 1-12 twist barrel
Chambered in 243 Ackley Improved with no turn neck.

Stock is Remington 5R Special Edition with dual palm swells/three studs/ wide forearm, nice recoil pad with remington stamped on the pad. Color is green and black webbing.

Trigger is ""old style"" Remington trigger fully adjustable for overtravel, sear engagement and trigger pull weight. I had gunsmith set to 3lbs for daughter.

Bottom metal is Remington BDL blued. Slight wear on the bluing on the bottom plate-I tried to show in picture.

This gun shoots 87 grain v-max under 1/2 MOA and would probably shoot bergers much better, but I did not do a lot of load development since she did not like the gun. Gun also shoots regular 243 Winchester ammo very well. I killed several varmints at 300+ yards with the fireforming loads using 70 grain nosler balistic tips. Would shoot factory 243 Winchester ammo plenty good enough to deer hunt with. Less than 200 rounds shot through gun.

Gunsmithing done by Kevin Cram at Montour County Rifle in PA.

One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement in the SIG516 rifle. With its 16"" chrome-lined, phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator, the SIG516 incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail forend and barrel, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle available. The SIG516 Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol grip. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the Sig Sauer innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the Sig Sauer proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO's Over the Beach test. It has a free-floating M1913 quad rail, and the the top rail is optic-ready with Sig Sauer flip-up iron sights.

MORE POWER PER SQUARE INCH

The new, remarkably ergonomic SIG P227™. It’s a .45ACP that holds 10+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip. Take hold of this high-power, high-capacity pistol and you’ll see first-hand how we’ve stacked the odds in your favor.
 The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P227® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P227 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail.
