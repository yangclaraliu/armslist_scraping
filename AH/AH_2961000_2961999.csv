This is my wife's gun. She has since moved over to the new Glock 42 and does not need the 26 too. We have put no more than 250 rounds through the gun with no issues at a all! I bought it new and (as an advanced Glock armorer) I have maintained this gun to perfect condition. I also have changed out the trigger bar and trigger spring (Value $30) to make the trigger more of a consistent press at around 4.5 lbs. I replaced the trigger spring to the NY1 spring to eliminate any potential malfunction of the original spring. I have also set up this gun for a lefty - if you're a righty let me know and I will switch it back to the original side. All work on this gun is warrantied by me for 3 yrs after purchase. 

YOU WONT FIND A BETTER VALUE OR GUN OUT THERE!!

The following description is from Glock USA:
The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators."

Hk 91clone.
it has a lot of work and parts into it.

everything is as it was when I received the rifle. 
I have no list price, OBO.... I only list them here to give an idea of what was put into it.
But do search and have an idea of its worth before you ask me about $400.
I'll just ignore lowball.
I also have the stock green set of furniture and a brown buttstock.

the scope tilted, and wasn't that great to begin with.

a magpul PRS2 precision adjustable stock, g3 model
($255.00 right off the magpul website)

hk g3 tactical tri rail hand guards.
($119.00 out've hkparts.net)

the scope rail mount is attached properly, then sealed on with bondo to keep from moving when fired. however still removable. anyone that has used these mounts knows that they just aren't fullproof by themselves. hence the bondo.
but the iron sights are still fully functional as is.

I have 10 or so 20 round magazines.
and a few boxes of 308 rounds to go with.

I just replaced the firing pin spring a week ago (with an hk spring), and only test fired 1 mag through it since.
the digital camoflauge paintjob is sub par, (done by previous owner), I was going to have it duracoated. but never got around to it. and the rifle only sits in the closet, so I don't wish to put any more money into it.
but it still looks good from afar lol.
Please look closely at the paint work before you show up and act surprised that it's not at all perfect.
I have plenty more pictures I can send on request.

~~The Ronin is the new standard by which all other Kydex concealment holsters are measured and the foundation of the GunfightersINC holster lineup. The Ronin embodies the core objectives of simplicity, ergonomics, and reliability in every way possible. What makes the Ronin unique is the placement of the pistol which is located perfectly along the beltline and rotated forward to find the center of balance, lessen lateral profile to prevent printing and can easily conceal some of the largest handguns. An optional “battle cut” may be built into the holster at no additional charge. Which greatly aids in the draw as well as re-holstering, especially under stress. The belt loops are hard riveted and hand contoured to provide the best ride possible and backed with marine grade friction tape to even further enhance stability. When we’re done what you end up with is a single, indestructible piece of equipment you can be your life on.

An optional “battle cut” may be built into the holster at no additional charge. Which greatly aids in the draw as well as re-holstering, especially under stress. The belt loops are hard riveted and hand contoured to provide the best ride possible and backed with marine grade friction tape to even further enhance stability. When we’re done what you end up with is a single, indestructible piece of equipment you can be your life on.

Simplicity. Ergonomics. Reliability. Guaranteed. Forever."

Prior to getting this handgun i've always had full sized Rugers, Sigs or Springfield's but got talked into buying it due to a promotion they were running at the store at the time.  Bought it primarily as a CCW gun, but truth be told i'm not a fan of the trigger in the least bit.  Gun was purchased on 2/8/14 and I still have the receipt for proof.  I fired exactly 147 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 165 grain rounds through it.  I'll also include 2 boxes of that same ammo with it.  I'm just not accurate with the trigger at all so i'm looking to get something different.  Considered putting an Apex trigger kit in it but didn't want to change the integrity of the firearm.  Also includes an IWB DeSantis holster.  Will take $350 in cash...sale has to be done at an FFL authorized dealer."

LANTAC DGN556B MUZZLE BRAKE

 The new LANTAC Dragon muzzle brake is manufactered to the highest quality standards and features a patent pending design that offers improved recoil management and muzzle rise over the competition. The unique Short Energy Pulse (SEP) system reduces the length of recoil so that repeating shot energy cannot overlap and knock the shooter back. Even with fully automatic fire it offers massively reduced recoil and muzzle climb, so all shots can fall on target.

Ultra Fast Attenuation (UFA) of muzzle blast gasses helps to reduce side blast and muzzle flash, preventing this Dragon from being a fire breather!

CNC Machined from US Mil-Spec AISI 4140 Steel and surface hardened using Tufride QPQ Liquid Nitride for extreme hardness and corrosion resistance.

I will trade for my Springfield Armory XDs .45 Auto (post recall) plus extras.

This SA XDs .45 is in like new condition.  I've cleaned and lubed it thoroughly after every range trip (4 total).  I bought it from Targetmaster in Chadds Ford about a year ago for $620 brand new.  It has a total of 300-400 rounds through it including about 6 different types of hollow points and has never had a hiccup either before or after the recall.  I sent it back to Springfield for about 2 months for the recall/upgrade and it was returned with everything performed which you can verify by the roll pin through the grip safety.  I also have all the paperwork for this (purchasing and recall).  I put Talon grips on it (and both of the extenders for the 2 extended 7 round mags that will be included with it) which greatly increased the control of this weapon as well as dampen the recoil.  I personally don't feel the recoil is bad at all on this gun however if you're recoil sensitive, a .45 this small probably isn't the gun for you.  If you aren't, then this is the PERFECT CCW!  This gun is +P rated however I've never fired any through it so I can't comment what the recoil is like with +P's but I'm sure you can find someone that has reviewed it with them online.  I really don't want to get rid of it but I want even more to acquire a Glock 20 and this is the only way I can afford it (not to mention I can't even find a 20 at any local gun shops).

This package includes:

-SA XDs .45 ACP, 3.3"" barrel, fiber optic sights (includes extra red and yellow/greenish fiber, very easy to swap out/replace)
-2 Factory 5 round magazines
-2 Factory 7 round magazines (both have grip extensions with talon grips installed on them to mate up perfectly with the grip)
-Sheppard Leather/Kydex IWB Holster (pictured)
-Pocket Holster
-Everything that was originally included with the gun (SA Large Black Hard Plastic case (very nice), manual, lock, spent casing, PADDLE OWB HOLSTER, EXTRA MAGAZINE HOLDER, etc.)
-2 50 Round Boxes of Federal Premium Tactical 230gr HST's (Best defense rounds out there IMO, do some research, hard to find and not cheap)

I REALLY would like to do a straight trade for a Glock 20 and some cash can go either way depending on what you have and the shape it's in.  If I must sell it to get the money to go find and buy the Glock 20 I will but the price is firm as this XDs is a beautiful, perfectly kept firearm and includes the extras and ammo."

Take a look at the pictures and you will see that there are NO scratches, dents or dings on this pistol. It was cleaned, lubed, and stored after every range visit. As is typical of Glocks, it has fired with every squeeze of the trigger with no FTF or FTE. Absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, just getting away from striker-fired pistols.

I would like to trade my G23 for something that shoots .45 ACP, 5.56mm, or 30.06 (no striker-fired pistols please). I have 150 rounds of UMC .40 cal FMJ and 27 rounds of Federal 180 grain HST JHP to even up the trade if your trade has more value.

I would rather trade the pistol than sell it.  $575 takes the pistol and ammo.

I am located in Lacey and would be willing to travel approximately 30 minutes in any cardinal direction, maybe a little further for the right trade. FTF will be conducted in a public place of my choosing. I am an honest guy that treats people fairly and I expect the same from those that I conduct business with. If you don’t fit in this category then go bother someone else. 

CPL and DL from the state of Washington is a must. If you are military contact me and we will work it out. I will require a peek at both (no pics) documents and will do a transfer of ownership for both parties that will go no further than my safe.

Send me an email through Armslist and I will respond ASAP.  More pics available upon request."

Build details are as follows:

Remington 700 SPS Tactical 20"" bull barrel 1 in 12"" twist.
Bell and Carlson Medalist 3 Stock in Tan Spiderweb
Vortex Viper PST 6 x 24 x 50  First Focal Plane Scope with Illuminated (red) EBR-1 Reticle MOA

EGW 0 MOA Picatinny Rail
Timney 510 Trigger
Harris S-BRM Hinged Bipod
Harris Bipod adapter for flat forend stocks
Ultimate Arms padded cheek rest
Butler Creek flip up scope covers

This rifle is in mint condition.  There isn't a single scratch, scuff, nick or wear mark on the entire rig.  It's been fired approximately 80 times using 168 grain match ammo at distances ranging from 100 - 860 yards.  This rifle is capable of 3/4"" groups at 100 yards (by me anyway) and remains sub MOA out to 800 yards.  This is an incredibly accurate rifle so long as you do your part behind the trigger.  Total build price was 2300.00, the scope alone is 1000.00 and you'd be hard pressed to find a finer optic.  This is a first focal plane scope, if you're not familiar with that, I recommend you visit Vortex's site and have a read.  The scope has a transferable unlimited warranty (Vortex will replace or fix the scope even if you drop it and smash it).  The scope box and all literature and parts come with it.  The scope is mounted on burris xtr rings and an egw mount, all properly torqued with an inch pound driver.  The trigger is a Timney 510 and is set at approximately a 2.5 pound pull (it's adjustable from 1.5 - 4 lbs) with ZERO creep or over travel.  Over travel, trigger pull, and backlash are all adjustable.  This is a huge upgrade from the stock remington trigger.  Lastly, the harris bipod is the top of the line 6 - 9"" harris offers it is the model that allows you to cant the rifle.  I installed the optional lug for easy adjustment too.

Sale price is 1600.00

I might consider 1911 trades - but not just anything and the condition would have to be mint.

Also looking for a Sig 229 Stainless Elite

This is a cash only deal and Connecticut residents only that hold a valid Pistol permit or rifle permit.  I can meet you at a licensed FFL to finalize the deal.

No low ballers.

I will not part out the rifle and that includes the scope - it goes as is or not at all.

Any questions, please ask."

Deluxe safes use uncompromising construction with a one-piece, continuously welded steel body adds increased protection and a high level of finish quality that rivals safes costing much more. Pry-Stop MAX Locking Bolts and a reinforced door frame provide superior pry resistance. Pry-Stop End Bolts at the top and bottom of the door side secure the critical door corners from pry attack. Exquisitely painted, pinstriped and accented with chrome hardware, a Deluxe is the ideal safe to protect your valuables. Feature-packed Deluxe safes offer class-leading security and fire protection at an excellent value.Stepping up to the Pro Series Deluxe Series gives you a full selection of finishes, colors, and options to select from. Inside the safe, the new Electrical Outlet, premium Axis Adjustable Shelving, and LED Interior Lights are all standard. A higher fire rating (75 min. vs. 60 min.) and locking bolts on all four sides of the door improve protection from disaster.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTIONThe heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access.

Classic safes offer essential fire and security features, plus new Cantilever Modular Shelving that will give you almost unlimited organization potential for your guns and valuables. Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The versatile DPX Storage System includes a Quick Access Barrel Rack for extra storage. The beautiful exterior finish, subtle graphics and chrome trim pieces add class to any room in your home.

MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTS

MAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. 

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM

The Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

DUO-FORMED DOOR

The best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.

HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTION

The heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.

NEW CANTILEVERED SHELVING

Quickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine models. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM

Includes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.

Classic safes offer essential fire and security features, plus new Cantilever Modular Shelving that will give you almost unlimited organization potential for your guns and valuables. Oversized MAX Locking Bolts and End Bolts resist pry attack better than round bolts. The versatile DPX Storage System includes a Quick Access Barrel Rack for extra storage. The beautiful exterior finish, subtle graphics and chrome trim pieces add class to any room in your home.

MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTS
MAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. 

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM
The Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

DUO-FORMED DOOR
The best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance, and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 5/16"" thick.

HARDENED PIN LOCK PROTECTION
The heart of a safe's securty is its lock, and that's why all Pro Series safes feature Hardened Pin Lock Protection. The lock is protected by two 1/4"" hardened steel plates and features four 1/4"" hardened steel pins designed to deflect or break drill bits during a drilling attack.

NEW CANTILEVERED SHELVING
Quickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine models. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM
Includes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.

Black Label Mark IV safes feature the unmatched storage potential of Axis Adjustable Shelving to accommodate a wide range of long guns and carbines, plus the secrity measures you want for peace of mind.A fortress for tactical firearms: Elegant is an understatement, the Black Label Mark IV is designed to accommodate modern sporting rifles as well as traditional long guns. These full-featured, no-nonsense safes provide maximum protection from fire and theft while adding a sleek tactical appearance to your room.WHY STEP UP TO THE TACTICAL MARK IV?Stepping up to the Mark IV gives the added versatility of Axis Adjustable Shelving for more interior organization potential and standard LED Interior Lighting. The Exterior Gear Loft provides provides a place to keep gear in a convenient location. The heavy-duty Duo-Formed Door adds additional security while the new Electrical Outlet makes it easy to add accessories such as dehumidifiers and charge electronics.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEMThe Force Deflector Locking System (U.S. patent #7,665,405) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.PRY-STOP END BOLTSMore than 2 1/2 times longer than door bolts, they attach to angle iron which prevents the locking bolt support bar from bending in a pry attack. The top and bottom locking bolts on the door side secure the critical door corners.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fill in the safe and use the minimum amount of space, individual shelves can be adjusted to accomodate modern sporting rifles, carbines, and shotguns.EXTERIOR GEAR LOFTTactical and hunting gear can be stored within easy reach on the top of the safe in the semi-enclosed Gear Loft.CARBINE BARREL LOOPSLower mounted barrel loops secure shorter rifles and shotguns to the DPX door panel.DPX STORAGE SYSTEMIncludes a rack on the back of the door to store long guns and make them easier to access. Pouches and pockets organize other valuables.LED INTERIOR LIGHT PACKAGEIntegrated LED Lighting Package makes locating objects on shelves or identifying the right firearm convenient and easy.

The Cantilevered Modular interior and DPX door storage provide the most versatile interior found in a safe at this price - and above.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVERED MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine modules.

This is a choice piece for concealed carry, and great under the pillow for home defense. The Ruger .357 magnum is small framed and easy to conceal, with enough punch to stop a threat to you and your loved ones if the time ever comes. Personally, I hope that time never comes where I have to draw on a human. Knowing I have the right tool when the time arises, gives piece of mind. One just never knows when they'll need it. Do yourself a favor, carry REAL protection if you're going to carry a firearm for self defense. No matter what you carry, and most importantly, shoot that firearm. Get to know it well. You control the the action when the trigger is squeezed. So make those rounds count.

It has a bit of rust underneath but the only ruff spots on the car are in the rear quarters. That being said the rears will either need a bit of sheet metal work or replacement fenders. The car has No dents and is very well taken care of. The motor runs strong but the carb is shot and needs replacement. The power steering doesn't kick in on left turns and the vacuum powered headlight covers don't lift, I think there's a leak in one of the lines. Other than that everything else works. Headliner needs replaced and the dash has a sun crack.

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. Great Mothers day or Fathers day gift. Take care of the ranch,or farm, order a nice scope and get them varmits . We have scopes too.

The steel body is formed and continously welded - not spot welded - for outstanding strength and flawless appearance. Wide MAX Locking Bolts offer additional security and the smooth rolling Gear Drive Locking System provides bank vault-like feel. The versatile Axis Adjustable Interior with DPX Storage System and Scope Saver makes it faster and more convenient to access your most prized possessions. Honor your firearms and valuables with a Prestige safe.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.MAX PRY-STOP CORNER BOLTSInnovative long bolts extend diagonally from the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.UNI-FORCE LOCKING SYSTEMRobust cam locks and a multiple diversion bar system divert pressure from reaching the lock.OMNIBARRIER LOCK PROTECTIONA carefully engineered structure of steel hard plate and steell components designed to protect the safe lock from drill, punch, and push attacks.DPX SCOPE SAVERSFound exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, the Scope Saver keeps your rifle scopes protected and ready for use.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance and attack protection.

The Pinnacle offers reliable security with a heavy-duty 3/16"" steel body.  Browning ProSteels' patented innovation of MAX Locking Bolts provides 12-times more surface area than traditional bolts, and when combined with Pry-Stop Corner Bolts, creates a gun safe that is twice as pry-resistant as a safe with regular round bolts.  The Gear Drive Locking System is three times easier to operate. The versatile storage inside the Pinnacle includes the AXIS Adjustable Shelving, DPX Storage System with Scope Saver and cedar panels on the ceiling and walls for a luxurious gun safe that protects your guns and other valuables.The Pinnacle Series offers unequalled security and fire protection features, the most versatile interior in the industry and refinement not found anywhere else, the Pinnacle is the finest gun safe available. These uncompromising safes are formed from a single sheet of thick 3/16"" steel for exceptional strength and rigidity. Axis Adjustable Shelving maximizes storage potential and the fragrant cedar and simulated leather interior provides a luxurious appearance.You can spend hours researching websites and catalogs, but you won't find another gun safe that compares to a Pinnacle. The Pinnacle is a symbol of strength offering unmatched security, fire protection, interior versatility and pure elegance. The safe body is formed from a sheet of thick 3/16"" steel for exceptional strength and rigidity. Inside, you will appreciate the elegance of fragrant cedar and simulated leather. The Pinnacle is also available in seven colors to perfectly complement your home. For the ultimate in security and beauty, look no further than the Pinnacle.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with Browning ProSteel's external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.MAX PRY-STOP LOCKING BOLTSMAX Locking Bolts offer up to twelve times more bolt surface area than regular round bolts and four times the strength. Pry-Stop Corner Bolts or End Bolts add additional pry resistance in the vulnerable corners. Browning ProSteel designed most of their Locking Systems utilize a cam and linkage system that diverts pounding and prying forces away from the lock.MAX PRY-STOP CORNER BOLTSInnovative long bolts extend diagonally from the corners of the door to protect against pry attack at the vulnerable corner areas.UNI-FORCE LOCKING SYSTEMRobust cam locks and a multiple diversion bar system divert pressure from reaching the lock.OMNIBARRIER LOCK PROTECTIONA carefully engineered structure of steel hard plate and steell components designed to protect the safe lock from drill, punch, and push attacks.DPX SCOPE SAVERSFound exclusively on Browning ProSteel safes, the Scope Saver keeps your rifle scopes protected and ready for use.AXIS ADJUSTABLE SHELVINGMultiple shelf styles are available and can be moved to allow small and large items to fit in the safe and take up minimum space.DUO-FORMED DOORThe best safe door Browning ProSteel offers is made from multiple layers of steel formed together to provide superior strength, pry resistance and attack protection. Full second panel for outstanding strength. The door face is 1 (5/16)"" thick.ELECTRICAL OUTLETA 110V outlet allows electrical accessories to be added without taking apart power cords.GRADE VI INTERIOR/LED LIGHTINGA fragrant cedar interior adds a rich quality to the safe. Interior LED lighting along the door frame makes locating items inside a safe much easier.AXIS DRAWER AND MULTIPURPOSE INSERTThe Axis Drawer mounts beneath an Axis Steel Shelf and includes a Multipurpose Insert that keeps small items organized, easy to locate, and protected.AXIS FILE BOXImportant documents may be irreplaceable and need to be easy to find.
