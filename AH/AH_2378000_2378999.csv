The serial number is in the PF328XXX range which makes this one of the fabled Irish contract rifles.  For those not familiar, after WWII when these rifles were at their best fit and finish, Ireland contracted England to build them rifles, for whatever reason the rifles were never delivered and sat in a warehouse for decades until being sold off as surplus in the 90's. That makes this rifle unissued and until I received it, unfired.  These are regarded as the best shooting Enfield rifles available.  I purchased it from a collector that was the original purchaser, he never shot it and I've only put 20 shots through it. There are some minor safe bumps but other than that, the rifle is simply immaculate, it's like a snapshot in time.  The rifle has a 1954 production date.  I'm including a matching bayonet and a box of ammunition.  I see these getting bid up to the $700 range on Gunbroker on the rare times they come up for sale, I'm just asking $500 to make the sale easier, buyer pays transfer fees and I'm located in Newark.

Have only had it for a few months and have only fired about 50 rounds through it. 

Description: The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, this pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

Action : SEMI AUTO
Magazine Capacity : 13
Barrel Length : 4.02""
Overall Length : 6.85""

The 4th Generation Glock ""Safe Action"" brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed, real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. 

In addition to the gun, I am including the following accessories as well:

2 boxes of 20 Hornady Critical Defense rounds ($60.00 Retail)

1 Black Flamingo Tactical TRIFECTA holster ($70.00 Retail)

This Ruger Model .44 Magnum Carbine is in near perfect condition.  I can only find three very light scratches in the wooden stock.  The finish has not been penetrated so the marks on the stock should steam out just fine.  All blued metal is free of blemishes and/or scratches.  The factory rear site folds down to accommodate a scope and also has adjustments for elevation and windage should you choose not to scope it.  This weapon is missing the magazine but those are not difficult to find.  With this weapon, I am providing approx. 50 rounds of target ammo and 2 boxes qty 20 each hollow point rounds.  

This carbine is perfect for bore hunting. Additionally, it is more than adequate for whitetails. For home defense, I almost feel sorry for the intruder.

I know this rifle will only appeal to a certain type of rugged individual and I am therefore willing to wait for the right buyer.

This weapon will not be a disappointment to any potential buyer."

This is one of the original Seattle, Washington guns -- mfg in 1976 or 77, one of the first 1000 Detonics pistols built. I purchased this from the original owner in Seattle.

The gun has a later style blued slide, barrel, and hammer, as well as the later factory checkered wood grips. The original owner explained that the gun originally shot low and left, so after fiddling with it for several years he eventually took it back to Detonics (Smith Tower location) in the 1980s and had them fix it. The result was the gun's current configuration. It still has the original rubber-backed mainspring housing.

Gun is in excellent condition with just the slightest bit of finish wear on the corners. Overall 90+% condition, this gun has been a safe queen with both the previous owner and me. Gun functions perfectly and shoots accurately.

Comes with one original 6-round Detonics magazine, a Bianchi #7L (right-handed) holster, and original Detonics soft case/rug.

$800. Prefer FTF in Enid area, but willing to drive 45 mins (halfway to Tulsa/OKC/Wichita) to meet for FTF.

The triumphant advance of the smallest Glock pistol, specially developed for concealed carry and previously a domain of 5-round snub nose revolvers, started with the presentation of the Glock 26 in August 1994. The Glock 26 offers more than an alternative in this field. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

Black finish, plastic grips, comes with box, manual and an extra magazine. The firing pin has had the cocking indicator cut off, because it had a tendency to get caught up on the pin spring and jam up. I've also taken some 800 sandpaper to the feed ramp in order to smooth out factory defects and improve feed reliability.

This CA380 has effectively been broken in. The sharp edges have been worn down, and it performs more reliably than it did before putting about 100 rounds through it.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)

6 Original Unopened Baseball Bat Bottles 3 Coors Light & 3 Original Coors Limited Edition
Kept in the basement where temperature is fairly consistent
Not saying they should be drank but it is possible they still could be.
I am selling as a Collectable, Not as an Adult beverage
18-ounce Bat Bottles, Coors Light and Original Coors 
The first ""Limited Edition"" Bat Bottles were available for three months, in 1996, coming out on Opening Day of Baseball Season. The next year they had bottles with some players names but these are from First Limited Edition with no players names
The amber bottles are 11 1/2 inches tall and nearly 3 inches wide. They feature a simulated wood-grain texture that is molded directly into the glass. The Coors Light and Original Coors labels are located where a trademark would be on a real bat, on the bat's barrel section.
The bottle's neck, shaped like a bat's handle, is decorated with stripes mimicking the tape used to enhance a batter's grip. No paper labels are used on the bottles. They instead are decorated in a process known as applied ceramic labeling. Minute ceramic particles, called ceramic frit, are applied by silk-screen then oven-baked into the surface of the bottle creating a finish that looks as if it were painted.

Up for sale is a very nice Swiss K31.  Date stamp on the rifle is 1940, magazine, receiver, bolt, and stock all match serial numbers. Bluing on this rife is 95%, I reblued the buttplate and retouched a couple tiny spots on the barrel.  Stock is in good condition, only a few dings on the buttstock.  No nametag under the buttplate.  Bore is in excellent condition and shoots very well with GP11 ammo, or Handloads using .30 Caliber 168Gr Sierra MatchKings and IMR4320.  Two-stage trigger is outstanding with a very light crisp final stage.  Selling due to lack of time to get out and shoot it. Ballistics wise the 7.5 Swiss sits right between the .308 Winchester and the .30-06 and uses standard .308 Caliber bullets to reload.  GP11 Surplus military ammo is readily available as well.  

Included with the rifle:
* 40 Rounds of Hand loaded ammo (168 SMKs, IMR4320, Prvi Partisan Brass)
* 40 Rounds of 1x Fired Brass (Prvi Partisan Brass)
* Redding Full Length Sizing Die
* Lee Bullet Seater Die
* Lee Shellholder

* Steel 1"" Rings (SCOPE NOT INCLUDED!!)

Specifics on the Sale:
