The TP22 was manufactured between 1982 and 1986, it is based on an Erma Werkes design and some of the earliest production used Erma parts. It is a sound design that has an internal firing pin block. When the manual external safety is applied the firing is blocked at both the front and rear. I use Remington .22 LR Thunderbolt ammo and have had no issues whatsoever during target practice. This is a small carry pocket pistol that when carried goes unnoticed. The handgun does show wear from holster carry but is in very-very good shape.  Price is FIRM."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. 

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

I would be willing to consider a trade for a good smaller objective scope of similar value.

It would be nice to find a 6x fixed scope with smaller objective, as i plan on mounting a mini red dot on the rings for my sight mount for 1x shooting. I can't imagine seeing the need for switching my scope to anywhere between 1 and 6x or needing greater magnification. For my carbine doing fixed 6x for my scope and 1x for my red dot should fit all my use cases while cutting down on bulk.

Just under 14,000 of these revolvers were made, compared to over 2 million of the Russian variety.

I originally interpreted the serial numbers as this pistol being made in 1899, however the serial list I was viewing didn't consider the couple hundred serialed revolvers that we not delivered to the army and instead were sold to civilians. This means this revolver is from 1898 and is considered an ""antique."" As an antique I can ship it right to your front door- no FFL, no paperwork.

This is a Swedish made M1887 double-action Revolver designed by Leon Nagant and manufactured by Husqvarna for their army. 

It shoots the 7.5mm Swedish Nagant cartridge and 7.5mm Swiss Ordinance cartridge interchangeably, so ammo is available for it online and through catalogs. It can also shoot the .32 S+W short and .32 S+W long wadcutters and lead ball ammo with a few bulged cases. NO FMJ's!!! These are very weak cartridges and won't harm the gun- accuracy also wont be as good as quality 7.5 ammo but for plinking out to 50 feet they are fine. These guns are also popular with reloaders as .32-20 cases can be reloaded with black powder and a .30 lead ball for a good plinking load.

Condition is overall at 75%+. Blueing is excellent on most parts. No rust or pitting. Bore is shiny with no pitting and strong cut rifling. Straw finished parts have gone to a patina-esqe finish but are still  glossy. 6 shot cylinder is excellent. Grips are original, have no cracks, and strong checkering- has never been refinished. Action is smooth and function is 100%. DA trigger pull is hefty, but smooth. SA trigger pull is very light and crisp without being unsafe. This is very high quality hand made craftsmanship here.

All #'s are matching on every part except the cylinder which is from a pistol one month older. The frame is also marked with a serial number that was added to the gun when it was re-issued in the 1940's for Landstormen (home guard) use.

There are conversions to turn these into .22 revolvers.

Own this fine Swedish revolver for $650 trade $500 cash in person $600 shipped (Paypal, postal money order, or personal/certified check only- check must clear before it is shipped)  Must be over 18 to purchase.

Prices are not negotiable.

Would trade for other guns. and certain calibers of ammo. I like old guns with historical meaning. I could use a beater browning auto 5 plus cash. A Luger, P38, or Browning Hi Power would be nice. What do you have?"

The idea is simple. I have an item. My goal is to get the best trade or most amount possible. You want an item. Your goal is to acquire the item at the cheapest possible price or least amount of trade. So you offer low, the seller then counter offers until you reach a happy medium, and the item exchanges hands. This is how negotiations work in the REAL world. 
Sadly, here on Armslist, negotiations are terribly misunderstood. Offers that come in lower than the seller wants are met with hostile trash talk. Conversely, if a seller is asking too much most people refuse to negotiate or make the counter offer. I can't tell you how many of you ignorant people I've dealt with on here that have no fucking idea how to communicate. You people suck. Your Glock isn't worth $600 because you had someone put night sights on it. Your Century AK isn't worth $1000 because you added a Tapco stock... And when I offer you less (actual value) your reply or COUNTER OFFER should be worded with respect, since we're both men. 
Last thing: just because some asshole on your television show advises you to think that your item is worth MORE in trade than it is in cash, doesn't make it so. Your used ass equipment is only worth what someone is willing to give for it. It's not worth more in trade because that's what the gays do on tv. Wake the fuck up and get with reality. Quit being so stupid and start communicating. Make offers, when you receive offers think about them and feel free to make a counter offer. This breakdown of communication is as disgusting as the spineless humans behind their keyboards spouting their trash talk and acting like children. Good day."

The resulting gun was chambered in .32 ACP and designed by two brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl. It combined elements from both the Walther PP and PPK. The pistol is fed from an 8-round single-stack magazine, located within the bakelite paneled grip. Small fixed sights are located on top of the slide. The pistol functions via the blowback principal - recoil causes the slide to move backwards, thereby compressing a spring around the fixed barrel. After it reaches the end of its rearward travel, the recoil spring returns the slide to its forward position, stripping and chambering a new round from the magazine as it does so, rendering the gun ready to fire again. Hammer and trigger operation is double-action - that is, the hammer can be cocked and released by a squeeze of the trigger.

This one is in very good condition ,no pitting in the barrel and the rifling is in good condition also, safety and decocker are functional. Comes with case, two mags, inside/outside holster. 25rds of ball

752,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2372752,For Sale/Trade:  ***SOLD PENDING FUNDS**** REDUCED PRICE - Ultimate Fishing kayak - 12.5' Native Mariner with Pedal drive,"S.W. OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 1,275","Listed On: Thursday, April 10, 2014",Fishing,no type,no type,no type,no type,"FOR SALE:
2011 model (I think) Native ""Mariner"" 12.5 foot, with Pedal Drive Unit, olive green color. It is in very good condition, I'd say - not been out but maybe 4 or 5 times ever, although of course it only takes once to get scratches on it.

This is a sit-on-top kayak, which features a rudder with left-hand control, and the pedal drive system, which is very fast. This boat has a double hull, and at about 90 lbs, is *extremely* stable, so between that and being an unsinkable sit-on-top, it's a great choice for beginners, windy days, big water, and/or solo adventures, provided you can handle the weight when loading & unloading (90 lbs).

It's a very good fishing kayak, as you can pedal both forward and backward with the pedal drive (and/or paddle as well).  Pedaling backwards helps you work banks of lakes more easily and pull fish away from structure when you hook one.  See link to vid below - you can go very fast in this boat.

The large, flat, and low rear platform / storage area is perfect for your dog to sit on and climb out of the water onto, if you're a duck hunter. 

This has a September permit for OKC lakes, so you have 8 more months to go boating around here with no more cost! I believe this one originally was around $2,100 or $2,150 new.   Please note that  state licensing/tags are not required any more on kayaks, so you'll never have to pay a dime again (except local lake fees such as the OKC area permit)!

It is muddy in the pic, obviously, from my last outing, but I will clean it up for you before delivering!

Yours for: $1,275.  However, counteroffers will be considered.

PM me, post, call, text, or email if you want some pics: REDACTED or REDACTED

It is just like this one except mine is without the camo accents, and without the anchor trolley system and extra rod holders (though you can buy and add those things to this boat):

This truck is Very Dependable. It Runs and Drives great. Engine and transmission are very strong. Great gas mileage! This is a great everyday driver.

I got the truck from a customer and it needed a new rear axle. I put an entire new used rear differential in the truck. I also put new rear brake lines, Brake drums, brake hardware, brake shoes, wheel cylinders on the rear. So everything on the rear axle is brand new!

This truck runs and drives perfect and will make someone a very dependable daily driver.

I have done a lot of work in the last 2 weeks to this truck and are listed below.

New rear differential
Brake lines
drums
brake shoes
wheel cylinders
brake hardware

Coolant flush and service
transmission flush and service
fresh oil change
Resurfaced front rotors and pads
complete chassis lube
Alignment
Brake system flush

The truck was used as a work truck by the previous owner. It has scratches and dents. It has 1 spot of rust above the drivers bedside. The inside could use a cleaning as he used it for a work truck.

The ABS light is on. This is only because the new differential didn't have a spot for the sensor. So it is unplugged. I will show you where the connection is so we can verify it.
The check engine light is on due to an ECT (electronic coolant temperature sensor) code. It isnt sending a signal to the instrument cluster. The truck does not overheat or run hot. This doesn't affect the drivability at all!

The only other thing is the outside drivers door handle is broken and the passengers mirror has fallen out since its gotten cold. I still have the mirror in the truck. Just needs apoxy'd back in.

In the condition the truck is in KBB values the truck as $3100.

Price is $1800 Cash.

The barrel has strong rifling and grooves and is shiny!  The stock on this rifle is an original USGI Walnut stock with ordnance crossed cannons on the bottom of the pistol grip of the stock. This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas.

This was built from an authentic Winchester Model 1897, but it is not an authentic USGI. It is a copy built on the same platform the M97 was built. Slamfire abilities with the model 97s.

I truely don't know what it might be worth, because it is a copy, but I have a little more than $700 into the build. If I trade, it would be in that value range. It isn't a Norinco, it's built from an actual vintage Winchester. The gun is Winchester, the heatshield/bayo lug is a good reproduction, as is the sling. The bayo does not go with it. It is the correct bayo, but also used on the M1917. I borrowed the bayo from my Eddystone to show it with bayo fixed. again, BAYO does not go with the M97."

The M1917 was made by three different companies: Remington, Eddystone, and Winchester.  

The rifle maintains the British cock-on-closing feature, in which the bolt's mainspring is loaded and the rifle cocked as part of the return stroke of the bolt, which aided rapid fire, especially as the action heated up. Most bolt action designs after the Mauser 98 cocked as part of the opening stroke. The rifle has a characteristic ""belly"" due to a deeper magazine, allowing the rifle to hold six rounds of the US .30-06 cartridge in the magazine, and one in the chamber. In a manufacturing change from the Mauser 98 and the derivative Springfield, the bolt is not equipped with a third 'safety' lug. Instead, as on the earlier Model 1895 (Chilean) Mauser, the bolt handle recesses into a notch in the receiver, which serves as an emergency locking lug in the event of failure of the frontal locking lugs. This change saved machine time needed on the rifle bolt, cutting costs and improving production rates, and this alteration has since been adopted by many commercial bolt action rifle designs for the same reasons. The location of the safety on the right rear of the receiver has also been copied by most sporting bolt action rifles since, as it falls easily under the firer's thumb. 

The M1917 is well-suited to the powerful, rimless .30-06 round. The M1917's barrel is a  5-groove left hand twist, in contrast to the 4-groove right hand twist rifling of the M1903 Springfield and other US designed arms.The M1917 had a long 26-inch heavyweight barrel compared to the lighter 24-inch barrel of the M1903 Springfield. With the longer sighting plane, the M1917 proved generally more accurate at long distances than the M1903.

This particular Remington M1917 has been enhanced with the addition of a more sporting stock, and has more accurate peep sights installed.  She is a great shooter, and capable of tight groups with modern ammo.  Bore and rifling in Ex condition, and she has had a trigger job in the past, give her a pretty good feel. The finish is 100%

The rifle is over 50 years and eligible for a face to face sale.  Cash only."

OK guys, I purchased this DOUBLE SET TRIGGER MANNLICHER from a collector's estate, and I had to REMOVE THE COSMOLINE from the barrel, action, and trigger!!! I believe to have been unfired due to all the cosmoline. I hand-buffed the stock and added a few layers of Minwax to perfect the finish. Only shot with virgin brass and a starting load of 62gr H1000 powder with 130 grain Nosler Accubonds. I properly broke in the barrel after EACH shot for the first 10 shots using coated Dewey rod, breech bore guide, WipeOut solvent and accelerator. Next cleaned after 5 shots...was shooting 1/2 inch groups at 100 on the second string of 5 and held off on final cleaning till after Elk Hunt. For the hunt, I wrapped the stock in black Coflex medical wrap to keep perfect (works great and inexpensive way to save your stock) almost any horse supply store (e.g. D&B) will carry for around $2 a roll. I implore you to find a finer example of Interarms Double Set Trigger rifle. I am only selling to fund an Interarms 458 Win Mag Safari rifle build I am doing. [SCOPE AND MOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED.  Mounts are Leupold (one-piece base -much stiffer/stronger - Leupold medium rings) and the scope is a Vortex 4-12x 42mm scope with BDC reticle...and mounts alone cost over $250 - AS NEW and will sell separately for $225.]  All sales final, and as always - checkout by a licensed gunsmith for all used firearms is the industry standard.

Described by Fjestad's Blue Book as ""the most accurate AR15 ever produced,"" this is one of 1000 limited edition rifles produced by the Colt Custom Shop (White Label) from 1996-1997 with a unique serial number range (this rifle is SR0004XX). Colt’s Custom Shop features include:

•	20"" bull barrel with a 1/8 twist (this is not Colt’s standard production “heavy barrel,” but a true custom bull barrel).
•	Hogue aluminum free float tube with rubber ""Overmolding""
•	Flat top upper receiver with picatinny rail
•	Hogue ""Overmolded"" hand grip
•	Choate E2 hooked buttstock
•	JP Enterprises adjustable single stage ""AR Precision"" trigger
•	Titanium firing pin
•	This rifle also has a Badger Ordnance Tac Latch and an Accuwedge installed after market.

Included in the sale is the original Colt 10 round magazine, original (unused) cleaning kit, original White Label Custom Shop box and original manual and paperwork.

This rifle is in excellent condition, with only a few light handling marks on the receiver and barrel (too light to pick up in pictures, but typical for this finish).  I don’t have an exact round count, but I would conservatively estimate under 1,000. This rifle has been a safe queen, and deserves to be in the collection of someone who will appreciate her.

Asking $2,000, payable in cash, money order or discrete PayPal (I will not charge a fee for using PayPal).  I can complete a private exchange with Massachusetts residents in the greater Boston area using an E-FA/10, buyer must have valid LTC.  Otherwise I will ship for free to a valid FFL anywhere in the continental US.  I have excellent exchange feedback on a local forum, which I’m happy to share with anyone seeking to purchase the rifle."
