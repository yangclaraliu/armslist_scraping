I prefer NIB, or LNIB, with all manuals and packaging.
I will consider others, but understandably will offer a little less.
I prefer 40's and 45's, but will consider others.
In case you haven't noticed, it's no longer a seller's market.
Guns are a dime a dozen now.  It's not like it was 6 months ago.
Private sellers that want more than they paid for their guns, still own their guns.
I pay FAIR used prices (about 20% less than NEW retail) for used handguns.
A used handgun is one that is not purchased new from a dealer.
And a NIB handgun from a private party is a used handgun.

 This is a Taurus' 1911 design in all black . It is a very sharp gun, shoots incredibly well and is known for being a much nicer gun than it's fairly low price would indicate. The trigger alone is on par with much higher dollar handguns. I love this gun personally and it is in like-new, perfect condition and has been cared for after every use. I can send additional photos at any time if you need more.

Note:
    Last night I had 7 auctions flagged as a scam.  I don't appreciate that at all as this is no scam and is 100% legitimate.  A listing takes a long time to list in total and I hate having to relist auctions for no reason.  I am an honorable member of this forum and have many people that I can reference who I have personally done business with here before.  Please contact me before flagging any post of mine as it is not fair to me or potential buyers and I do not fraudulently post anything, ever.  Thank you and have a nice day."

For those that do not know, this is the civilian version of the police taser.  Aside from ergonomic differences, the police model does a 10 second burst to allow them to put handcuffs on the assailant while the civilian model does a 30 second burst to allow you to leave your taser on the ground and escape without further conflict. Taser International has a policy to replace your taser for free if you submit to them a valid police report stating that you had to use your taser in such a manner. These are legal to conceal carry in Kent county without a permit.  I'm selling because I recently moved to New Castle county where I cannot legally carry it.  Taser lists the battery as having enough power for about 50 uses, I've used it about 15 times just testing it so there's plenty of life left in the battery.  I'm including a holster, 2 live cartridges and 1 blue trainer cartridge.  This is the newer model that is equipped with a flashlight and laser sight.  You can remove the cartridge and use it as a basic stun-gun that shocks on contact instead of using the projectile cartridges. There is no transfer fee or FFL required to buy this, I just need your information to submit to Taser so they can update the registration on the device.  I paid about $375 for it and used one cartridge to test.  I'm asking $250 and I'm located in Newark. I work in Dover most days so I'd easily be able to meet up with a Kent County resident to sell it.  Cash is preferable but I'm open to trades as well."

This press is identical to the MEC 600jr.

I purchased this used back in September as I was getting back into shooting 12ga again.  I completely disassembled it, ultrasonically cleaned all the parts, and reassembled.  I also replaced the powder measure with the current, beefier model, replaced the crimp starter with the Spindex crimp starter (6pt and 8pt starters included), and put a new wad guide in.  Spent primer tray, reprime spring, and 1oz charge bar were all brand new as well.  Works great with Gun Clubs, Top Guns, Rios, and a couple other types of hulls I fed it.

Only reason I'm selling is because I got a smoking deal on a 9000G, and don't need two 12ga presses.

Includes wooden base/riser block.  I used this on my reloading bench, and drilled the holes to line up with the holes I already had drilled for the 9000 (so I didn't have to drill anymore holes).  Should line up with holes for Sizemaster, 8567 Grabber, or 9000, but may need minor tweaking depending on your bench setup.  Or you can take it off and toss it in the trash, your choice.

HK P30 V2 9mm Pistol.The P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HKâs enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation-Âone that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HKâs enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. â¢Caliber: 9mm â¢Weight: 1.63 lbs. â¢Safety: Ambidextrous safety lever â¢Sights: Fixed 3 point â¢Magazines Included: 2 â¢Magazine Capacity: 15+1 â¢Grips: Black polymer, interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates â¢Slide Finish: nitro-carburized steel â¢Frame Finish: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer

Note: Be careful with kits which come with uninstalled new barrels. Unless you know what youâre doing and know how to use a mill you will end up ruining your barrel, trunion or both. There is only a 0.003 difference between a good build and a pile of junk. Alternatively, sending a new barrel out to a smith will cost you $100 or more. If the bans some of our government representatives want to get passed happen these spare parts kits will become âpricelessâ.

Note:
Last night I had 7 auctions flagged as a scam. I don't appreciate that at all as this is no scam and is 100% legitimate. A listing takes a long time to list in total and I hate having to relist auctions for no reason. I am an honorable member of this forum and have many people that I can reference who I have personally done business with here before. Please contact me before flagging any post of mine as it is not fair to me or potential buyers and I do not fraudulently post anything, ever. Thank you and have a nice day."

I am the original owner and have cared for it like a baby.  It is a luger action, meaning it ejects the shells from the top and feeds to the center of the gun, and has no slide at all.  It was originally designed in WW2 by the German Army.  This is Stoeger's version brought up to date and flawlessly executed in the modern age.  It is in like-new, perfect condition and has probably only had 150 or so rounds fired through it.  It is a fun gun and a blast to shoot.  I am interested in any trades and will entertain all offers.

Note:
Last night I had 7 auctions flagged as a scam. I don't appreciate that at all as this is no scam and is 100% legitimate. A listing takes a long time to list in total and I hate having to relist auctions for no reason. I am an honorable member of this forum and have many people that I can reference who I have personally done business with here before. Please contact me before flagging any post of mine as it is not fair to me or potential buyers and I do not fraudulently post anything, ever. Thank you and have a nice day."

Comes with FOUR - 35rd mag. 
The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. 

This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. 
All parts and components are new and Polish made."

First is a round receiver Russian M91/30 in great condition...made in 1942.....bore is nice and it HAS been test fired.....$155.

Next, I have 2 type 53 Chinese nagants.....these ARE good guns despite what your thoughts may be on the desirability factor of Chinese weaponry......they were built in China in 1955 on Russian tooling and to Russian standards. These are the shorter carbine style rifles with the side folding bayonette. The stocks are not that great, but the bores, rifling, bluing, action, etc are all quite nice. These have also been tested....that means actually taken to the range and fired. The numbers on these do match....(unlike what you find at Fleet Farm for $129 where they are all made from a basket of parts and slapped together......also, Fleet does not have the bores cleaned out, so, often times you cant even see down the bore with all the solid grease packed in there). Price on these units is $140. 

I also have some ammo for these laying around should you need some. 

please CALL or TEXT Greg REDACTED with any questions.....i do NOT get a chance to check e mail very often, so via my phone is the best way to contact me.....Thanks"

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and donât work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and youâre ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

I bought this gun brand new about 15 months ago for my carry weapon. I have since changed to a smaller handgun. This Sig has been taken to the range a few times and has fired less than 300 rounds. It has been well taken care of and cleaned thoroughly after each use. The gun has a Streamlight TLR-3 (180 lumen) LED tactical light. It fits really nicely on the gun and has an ambidextrous rocker switch. I will include it for an extra $50.

This gun is quite unique and can convert to multiple calibers (.40 S&W, .357 Sig, .45 Auto and 9mm).
I don't have any conversion barrels, but they cost around $150-$200. The magazine that comes with the pistol holds both .40 S&W and .357 Sig.

Other info: I purchased the rifle 3 months ago. I'm selling to purchase the Ruger 22LR Tactical Autoloading. I've shot one box of Federal Match Grade ammo through the rifle (325 rounds). The rifle comes with original box, carry case, manual, one ten round mag, Leupold rail installed (I can remove if you want), and one box of Federal Match Grade (325 rounds). Please be advised, while I was installing the scope rail, the screw hole nearest to the barrel, I accidently over tightened, lol. I took the rifle to the gunsmith and he rethreaded, so that screw hole uses one size larger than the other screws, but you can't tell the difference. I just wanted to make the buyer aware. The rifle is like new in box.

The price doesn't include the scope. If you want the scope attached (all installed and sighted in by gunsmith), the Nikon P22 2-7x32 will be $150.00 additional dollars."

526,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2386526,For Trade:  800 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup (in Spokane for the weekend), Washington, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, November 28, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

For sale/trade is 800 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping. I will also be in Spokane for the holiday weekend and can meet there.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

I obtained it in 1985 from a neighbor. This gentleman was retired and his full time hobby and passion was restoring old military guns  - mostly rifles and pistols from the turn of the century up to WWII. 

He did the work in his garage and he had pallets full of old guns  and gun parts. He always said his goal was to make the old guns beautiful again. 

This particular rifle is a Bethier Model 1907/15 made by Chatellerault in 1927. It's chambered in 8mm LEBEL and ammo is still available at a reasonable cost from PPU, Graf, Hornady and a few others. 

My old neighbor told me this rifle was mechanically able to be fired, but I must insist that you have the rifle examined by a gunsmith before you do. At 86 years old it's simply the prudent thing to do.  

The condition of the rifle is fantastic as it has been completely restored. It's really a thing of beauty and the attention to detail that went into it is terrific. 

I'm really not sure how my neighbor refinished the metal, but it appears to be some sort of black phosphate to me. It's definitely not blued, and this would have been done well before the days of DuraCoat and similar.  

The wood appears to have a hand rubbed oil finish. Bore is very good and everything fits together quite well. Action is tight and everything seems 100% functional. 

The rifle comes with an original French ""knitting needle"" style brass grip bayonet, and a beautiful sling that I assume is a reproduction, but one that was obviously made 30+ years ago since it was on the rifle when I bought it in 1985. 

Additionally there are 4 original charger clips and 20 rounds of original ammo that also came with the gun. 

I'm asking $600 and think this rifle is worth every penny. Rifle is to be picked up in Brandon by a Florida resident who is at least 18 years old. 

Thanks for looking."

Note:
Last night I had 7 auctions flagged as a scam. I don't appreciate that at all as this is no scam and is 100% legitimate. A listing takes a long time to list in total and I hate having to relist auctions for no reason. I am an honorable member of this forum and have many people that I can reference who I have personally done business with here before. Please contact me before flagging any post of mine as it is not fair to me or potential buyers and I do not fraudulently post anything, ever. Thank you and have a nice day."

He fired a few rounds through it then tossed it under the seat of his truck and that is where it stayed until I rescued it. Ruger no longer makes this revolver and I am having a little love affair with it but if I can ge my asking price I will sell it.

It has some pitting but in my opinion not bad except for the sights they were a little rusty. I cleaned off the rust and blackened them so I guess overall they look pretty good. The bore and cylinders are perfect the timeing is perfect and the overall mechanics is like new. 

You have to be at least 21 years old to buy this gun and be willing to meet me in Auburn. My price on this gun is firm as I want to keep it but got it so I coud resell it."

These bullets are APPROXIMATELY 10% perfect - 80% with some cosmetic problem (such as excess lube) that should not affect performance - and 10% that likely won't shoot very well. Because of the imperfections these are classified as SECONDS and marked down accordingly. The price on these is essentially the cost of the Hardball metal used to cast the bullets so if you receive them and don't like them, you can melt them down and re-cast them at the same price as buying just the raw metal. These bullets were cast with certified hardball which is currently selling at Rotometals for more than $3.00/lb.

As for shipping, if purchasing one or two packages the cost of shipping is $6.50. If purchasing three to nine packages, the price is $13.50. If purchasing all 10 packages, the weight exceeds the maximum amount allowed for a single package by the USPS so it will cost $20.00 ($13.50 + $6.50).

Payment is via USPS Money Order or personal check. If paying with personal check, the item will not be shipped until the check clears. Price is per package of 250."

I've got a really nice .44 magnum Ruger Super Red Hawk I'm ready to sell.

I bought the gun new from Vance's Shooter supply in Columbus.  I've got the original reciept, the plastic storage box, and other stuff that came w/the gun.

I also put a very nice Leupold Scope on the gun and scope rings too.  The scope itself was about $270 new.  

I'll separate the scope, rings, and gun if you're only interested in one part of the package. Gun has hardly been used.  I'm still on the original box of 50 shells.  I think I've only shot about 3 loads out of it (18 or 24 shells?).  Anyhow, it's all in same as new condition.  

$850 for all of it or $600 for just the gun.  Thanks, Gary - REDACTED"

I've got a .32 Cartridge handgun I'd like to sell.  The barrel says, ""Harrington & Richardson Arms Company"" Made in Worcester Massachusetts. And patent of October 8th, 1895. 

The gun has been in our family for at least 80 years.  My father-in-law gave me and his daughter the gun probably 20 years ago. He was the second owner of the gun.  He bought the gun from his older brother who purchased the gun new in New York a verry l-o-n-g time ago.

The gun does have an issue.   It needs a spring or something for the firing pin. It worked when we first got it.  I only shot 5 or 6 rounds through it in the first few years we owned it. Then, the next time I pulled it out it wouldn't fire.  A gunsmith in our local town told me it needed the spring or a plate? I can't remember exactly what he said, except that he said it could be fixed pretty easy. I just never got around to it....

I've been told the gun is worth $450 - $1300.  Probably lower side b/c of the firing issue.  But i think problem is minor according to gun shop.  Gun would be perfect for concealed carry, or just to add to a unique collection.  Or for somebody who knows what it's worth to buy and fix and resell. 

I may take trades for ATV's (Ozark, Recon, Rancher, Grizzly) or other things like pop-up camper, lawn tractor, dirtbike, utility trailer (5x8 or bigger), could use a nice rifle scope for a 30-06 Remington 700 CDL right now, who knows....  tell me what you've got and we can talk.

A great tactical/security shotgun. It has a rear ghost ring sight, front fiber optic sight, a pistol grip butt stock, and an ammo holder on the buttstock. It's a lightweight shotgun with a smooth pump action and I've only put one box of ammo through it. I upgraded to a semi-auto so I don't need this anymore. This model runs about $285 in stores, plus taxes and fees, without the shell holder. $175 cash or $200 trade equivalent.  I can also include some slugs, buckshot, or a case for extra.
