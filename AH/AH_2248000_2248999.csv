Bought as single stack sporter rifle,  but had mag well bored (professionally, not dremmeled in a basement somewhere) to fit double stacks, with the correct wider bolt to accommodate.
A quad picatany rail hand guard. With Magpul angled foregrip.
The rifle came standard with bolt cover rail mount. However I had the side mount removable sight rail installed over it.
The scope is mediocre. Bought of amazon for like $150 or something. It is 0-10x zoom. Red/green lit crosshairs, or black. But not special, great, or expensive. Just mediocre.
The stock, thumb hole butt stock is still on the rifle. Tactical, not wood style.
ALL INCLUDED

312 steel 7.62 ROUNDS
118 brass 7.62
20 soft tip 7.62
450 total 7.62 ROUNDS

And of course the EAA zastava pap ak 47 7.62 semi automatic rifle.


This rifle retailed for around $300-$400 new, total I have more than $1009 into it. But let's be honest, ak's like this are not rare, or golden, I'd value it at about $7-800or so.

All that being said, I'd like to trade for a 4x4 truck for winter, then off road/rough truck come summer.
I don't care about cosmetics or rust, but must run.
I can do most any minor repairs, no ""needs rebuilt"" ""no engine"", ""no transmission"" etc.
And I might add cash on top if interested.
I know plenty of people have a buster 4x4 sitting in the yard that pick n pull will only pay $400-$500 for, that's my interest.

But I'll listen to ANY trade offer. Guns, toys etc...
Please don't ask ""what do I want for it"". If you don't have an offer I don't have a response.
IM IN NO HURRY TO SELL. But it only takes up closet space right now.

Outstandingly accurate AR-type semi automatic. In a caliber that will reliably drop big game. 16"" interchangeable barrel.

Comes with everything that the rifle comes with new (Knights Armament 20rnd mag, box, manual, nylon sling, torque wrench, Tangodown rail covers, removable front and rear sights,etc). A Knights Armament trigger guard has been installed - it's a beautiful part and gives enough room for a gloved finger (I'll provide original as well). Also comes with three 20 round Magpul Pmags (one is still in package).

Has had 240 rounds of PMC ""Bronze"" 147gr. FMJ through it. Never fired fast strings. Excellent condition all around. Has 3 marks on the left side of the gun (two on upper receiver), one of which is hardly visible. The other is at the bottom of the magazine well. More pictures available upon request.

I'd consider some partial trades (I'd like to end up with about $1000 cash, so a trade of around $1300-1600 in value would be considered).  Good optics for a Ruger scout .308 might be a possibility (lower magnification desired).  Ammunition is possible - .223, .308, 9x19, and especially FN 5.7x28.  Cash and any gun or combination of guns (handguns or rifles) that add up to the balance would be considered.

Feel free to ask any questions. I hate to see it go, but it's time to pass this high-performance machine to someone who will take it out more often!

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

It runs off a 20oz co2 tank to pressurize the larger 20lb tank that holds about 3.5 gallons of gas or whatever flammable liquid you want. Gives you a run time of about minute, minute and a half or so if you just hold the trigger down but trust me it gets hot so short bursts is best. You can buy a scuba tank back pack harness if you want a mobile unit but then you would need a shorter hose from the tank to the trigger/gun part which I can help you with. The 20lb tank for back pack use is very heavy but doable, thats why this build is meant for stationary use with a 8ft hose from the tank to the trigger assembly. Not pictured but a propane tank is attached to the barrel of the trigger/gun for flame. as long as your propane torch is good, this one comes with obviously. Its a little under 20$ to have the co2 tank filled and the gas necessary to run it. Every fitting was done with aircraft grade thread sealant meant for gas/diesel lines. This is defiantly one hell of a unique toy to have. If you have anymore questions just ask.

It is a solid scope but too be honest I am not into the ""rang/hold over"" reticles. I guess I just prefer the simple type reticle. It was originally my Grandfathers and I have had it about 5 years. It has just been sitting in safe so I guess I'm not going to use it. These have the 1 Shot Zero. NEW ones are $799 but obviously this one is used. It has ring marks and some general handling marks. The Glass is in excellent shape with no issues. I'm just looking to trade for another scope at the moment but may change my mind if nothing comes up that tempts me. Can add cash if needed for the right trade.

Leupold mounts are every bit as rugged and dependable as the Leupold optics they're intended to secure. With a huge variety of mounting systems, for nearly every type of firearm under the sun, you're sure to find the perfect match for you firearm, and your style of shooting. The Leupold Integral Mounting Systems (IMS) family quickly and easily eliminates the two most common issues faced when mounting standard rifle scopes to AR-style rifles; scope height and eye relief. Each aluminum IMS cantilever design mounts directly to the firearm's Mil-Spec 1913/Picatinny to raise the scope and push it forward, eliminating the need for risers or specialized optics with shortened eye relief. All Leupold IMS products are tested to endure the rigors of the field and are covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee."

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power. Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools. The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time. The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. The ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. This careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds. The Model 95 provides the discerning shooter with bolt-action accuracy and magazine fed rate of fire."

To adhere to shooter’s demands for durability, the Sightmark Ultra Shot QD Digital Switch is equipped with a protective, aluminum shield hood for added protection, making it even more durable than the basic Ultra Shot.

I recently got a little 380 acp in on trade and I want to take her to the range. I dont have any range 380 so i am looking to pick up a few boxes of FMJ for her. I can either pay a fair cash price, or I can trade either 9mm fmj rd-rd, or work out an amount to trade 22LR for them. I dont want thousands of these, just a few hundred at most to plink and test a few guns and to have some left over just in case I get another. If you have any available please shoot me a message on here, or shoot me a text only to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Unless it is a fantastic deal for me we would need to meet close to or in Norman. 
Thanks for your time and have a great day!

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements  even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights.

Our 357 mag. ammo adds more power than ever before to the 357 mag. This ammo is safe to shoot in ANY all steel 357 revolver - this includes J frames. This ammo is no harder on your gun than any other normal 357 ammo. Please don't phone us and ask if this ammo is safe in your gun. It is, providing your gun is in safe condition for use with any normal 357 ammo.

We don't recommend this ammo to be fired in super light alloy revolvers as bullets may jump crimp under recoil, but the ammo itself wont hurt these super light weight revolvers. These revolvers are simply so light that the recoil is severe enough to cause crimp jump."

Product description, below:

Uberti's new 5 1/2"" barrel hand-tuned Cattleman model is truly “the boss,” or El Patrón, as the Vaqueros of the old west would say. The gunsmiths at Uberti have fitted each El Patrón with high-grade, US-manufactured Wolff springs and each revolver has been carefully tested and certified for flawless fit and function. The result is a single-action that is reliable, lighter and faster with a smooth-tuned action, steel backstraps and trigger guards, new checkered walnut grips and wide, easy-view front and rear sights.

The Top Choice For Speed & Authenticity


Tailored to improve your speed of draw, reload time, overall shooting form and comfort. Each piece is handcrafted from top grain, vegetable-tanned leather, border stitched where needed, and sealed along the edges, then dyed to a rich, hue that grows increasingly more beautiful with wear. The Long Hunter Series of products combines the shooting experience of two-time, modern world champion Jim Finch, aka Long Hunter, with the expert craftsmanship of Kirkpatrick Leather. Right- and left-hand holsters built for speed. Each holster is hand molded for a perfect fit to your Ruger or Colt single action revolver. The extra wide, molded skirt contours to your hip for all day comfort, while the exposed triggerguard and low cut front help reduce drag. A slight drop with eight-degree muzzle forward cant prevents breaking your wrist at an awkward angle during quick draw. Rolled-out edges make holstering a breeze. Includes hammer ties and a hand-tooled scallop pattern to match the Long Hunter Holster Belt."

What in the heck is a compact L you ask? Looks like a P-01 doesnt it. Not at all. They do start with the compact frame like a cz p-01. But thats where that ends. Think of it as a baby shadow 9. They start with all new frames and slides in the black and custom fit like a perfect match gun. It's very, very tight. Unlike the P-01 it's got a manual safety instead of a decocker also like a shadow. Next they smooth the trigger cam, sear area, the frame, the rail surfaces, the ramp and bullet throat. The Barrel overall interior and exterior & chamber are all polished as well. Then they respring the entire gun, resight it and install the combat CZ custom hammer. CZ night sights are included. Also I had them smooth the inside of the rails as well and swap the firing pin for titanium. It's by far the smoothest double action gun ive ever fired including many smooth old smith revolvers. Breaks like glass. And obviously the single action trigger is also nice. Not dangerously light. Says 3.5 lbs on the factory sheets. The CZ custom's test target compared to the CZ factory Czech target speaks for itself. This gun is VERY, very accurate. I also included VZ Frag Dirty Olive grips and original rubber CZ factory grips which are also super grippy. The VZs were $80. It originally came with two 14 round CZ (MecGar) factory mags. It come with that PLUS an EXTRA CZ factory Shadow SP-01 19 round mag with extended baseplate. This is a $50 mag by itself that im throwing in for nothing smile
