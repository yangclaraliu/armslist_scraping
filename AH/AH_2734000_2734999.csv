Ammo is 1938 Nazi production and every box plus every individual round has the Nazi War Eagle stamped on it. Ammo is loaded on two 5 round stripper clips per box. It's very clean and condition of both the ammo and the boxes are excellent. I've fired a quite a bit of this ammo over the years and it all goes boom.  $90 for the five boxes. 

(2) 16 round boxes of Nazi 9mm Luger ammo. Boxes are still sealed and are in unbelievably good condtion. It was made in 1944 and manufacturer code is AK 25. Also boxes are marked ME indicating that the bullets have iron cores. This is a wonderful collectible that's very hard to find today - especially in this condition.This would compliment any Nazi artifact collection very nicely.  $80 for both boxes. 

(4) 20 round boxes East German M39 7.62x54 ammo. M39 ammo was originally designed as practice/training ammo primarily for machine guns. It's loaded with a special black colored 124 grain steel core bullet. Velocity is not reduced however the thought process was that the lighter projectile would travel less far than standard weight bullets. Another benefit to those who shoot it in their rifles is that recoil is substantially reduced. I've shot this ammo in Mosins, plus a SVT40 and recoil is light. However it's certainly not your traditional practice ammo as it penetrates a heavy steel gong target at 50 yards when SS109 5.56 Nato will not. 
$65 for the 4 boxes.

20 rounds 8mm Lebel ammo. It's clean brass case, berdan primed with cupronickel jacketed bullets that is very magnetic. Both the bullet and primer are sealed with a red military lacquer. Asking $30. SOLD

20 rounds 6.5mm Jap ammo for your Arisaka rifle. This ammo is extremely clean and it's loaded on the correct Arisaka 5 round brass stripper clips. It's brass case, berdan primed with copper FMJ bullets. Both bullets and primers are sealed with a green military lacquer. I believe this ammo was made by the Chinese shortly after the war for use with all the captured Arisaka rifles they had.  SOLD 

(2) 30 round brass strips of 7.7mm Jap machine gun ammo. This ammo is brass case, berdan primed with copper FMJ bullets. This ammo is somewhat different than the Arisaka rifle round so I'm told it is not interchangeable. It would however make for a super cool display item. This ammo is live and is packed in it's original WWII rice paper boxes complete with all of the Japanese markings. A really neat historic item.  $60 for both strips.  

(2) 25 round boxes S&B 6.35 Browning ammo commonly called .25 ACP. This ammo was purchased long ago and is brass case, berdan primed. It also has a  full copper jacketed bullet with a steel core. This is likely the only steel core (penetrating) .25 ACP ammo you'll ever run into since importation of this style of ammunition stopped a long time ago. Asking $50 for both boxes.

Due to health reasons unable to go. Built on a brand new barreled action from Weatherby. AI stocked it with a Super Fancy piece of Claro Walnut and added a custom contrasting grip cap and fore end. They also installed there all steel custom free float chassis system and then gave it 8 coats of there hand rubbed oil finish. The Flue De Lure wrap around checkering was done by a MasterEngraver at Colt Firearms. She also hand engraved the floor plate as well. The checkering is amazing and flawless. The stock has amazing figure and fiddle running the full length of the blank. The blank was 800 before any work and the checkering was 700. This is a beautiful rifle and will shoot rings around the 338 Lapua. Also comes with a one of only 200 made NRA Limited Edition Slings that were only avaible at the 2013 Dallas Safari Club Show and a Weatherby 3by9 Supreme Scope. 4300 invested.

He also has a bunch of ads on here that he posts the price as FREE, then when you click on his ad, the price is shown for what he is selling. He is a scam artist and is one of the guys who will get armslist shut down. he lists a bunch of guns for salle and does not have an FFL. The law states that without an FFL, an individual is allowed to sell a ""reasonable"" number of guns per year. As a former FFL holder, I am quite aware that beyond 5 guns/ year, the ATF takes notice, this guy lists dozens if not hundreds of guns per year here. he is also the one running the ad, ""Need Money, I buy guns"". He is about to cause a world of hurt to armslist and it affects all of us. I urge you to flag his free and ammo ads, and take the time to look at his other ads by clicking the option in blue ""listings by this user"". It's time we stand together, protect our rights, protect armslist, and shut down the abusers, thieves, and scammers. Let your voice be heard by flagging the abusers. I'm an old Marine, and have learned to not go looking for trouble, but there are times when it's necessary to get up on the hood of the old jeep and sound off.The market and system will take care of abusers. If people stop buying from or selling to an abuser, they move on. With our gun rights in such a precarious balance, it's best to handle things on our own, within the law, create as few waves as possible, and let the market take care of itself.

Olde English is the only place locally I can find this gun for sale and they want 969 plus tax for it. I would like $850 with everything listed above.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Description:The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance-grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer-forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users' body, allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full-length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous, allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles, and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines, but you can also use your own AR-15 style magazines. Flat dark earth finish. Bayonet lug included.

Mainly for a ruger super Blackhawk 7.5 inch barrel . I plan on testing different grain bullets to find the best accuracy for the gun but I will use copper jacketed bullets , probably mainly 240 grain. Now my questions are:

What is the best powder to use that isn't too expensive? Also , what primers would you recommend for mainly federal brass?

I plan on making somewhat accurate rounds at a good price. Maybe you could share your data? I don't need any hunting rounds. Just decently accurate plinking/ target rounds"

As the seller didn't want to break up the lower, I agreed to buy it as a complete lower.

So I'm parting it out. The trigger group is chromed, unlike the offerings by AA now. The AA price for the trigger group is $203. I'm offering it for $175. The seller who listed it originally claimed it had about 100 rounds through it, and I'll attest that it is in excellent condition.

I don't have a price on the A2 stock yet. Make me an offer.

Alexander Arms says:
This tactical trigger unit has been designed specifically for field use and does not share a common heritage with a target trigger. For this reason, it is not recommended for target-type shooting, although it may be used with some success in this discipline. The trigger is basically a single stage unit with a bushing mounted disconnector, which is adjustable for engagement and over travel while the pull weight and disconnector engagement are fixed to ensure durability during hard use and inclement environments.

The trigger bow is intentionally narrower than those commonly found on target type triggers. This assists with accurate reference of the trigger finger if the unit is used with gloves or in cold/wet conditions. The pull weight allows manipulation of the trigger with gloves while minimizing the possibility of discharging a round unexpectedly in the manner of a target trigger. In extreme cold conditions the trigger can still be used with mitts with the trigger guard pivoted down, although this is not recommended.

The unit is manufactured from an S7 type tool steel and is through-hardened to provide a durable base. The surface is chrome-plated using a technique that creates a dense finish and a surface hardness in excess of 72 HRC. This surface provides the durability for the trigger in adverse conditions and, hence, the surfaces on both the trigger and the hammer should not be further polished or honed."

It is a very tight gun with no play between the receivers. Great buffer spring and tube, you can barely hear/feel the action during the shot. It's a very good setup for playing around at the range or hunting. I am no sniper by any means, but I can consistently hit a 12"" steel plate at 300yds every time and with low wind I can hit a target at 600yds with proper compensation for bullet drop and distance. It's an awesome rifle, but I don't use it much and looking to add a lighter rifle to the collection.

Comes with one 20rd Pmag, it fits better when you're shooting from a bench.

Description:The Tavor is a perfect fusion of an ordnance-grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer-forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users' body, allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full-length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous, allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles, and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines, but you can also use your own AR-15 style magazines.

The M1919 Browning is a .30 caliber medium machine gun that was widely used during the 20th century. It was used as a light infantry, coaxial, mounted, aircraft, and anti-aircraft machine gun by the U.S. and many other countries, especially during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Although it began to be superseded by newer designs in the later half of the century (such as by the M60 machine gun), it remained in use in many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and elsewhere for much longer. It is very similar in design to the larger .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2 Machine Gun, which is also a Browning-designed weapon and is still in NATO service. Many M1919s were rechambered for the new 7.62Ã—51mm NATO round and served into the 1990s, as well as up to the present day in some countries. The United States Navy also converted many to 7.62mm NATO, and designated them Mk 21 Mod 0; they were commonly used on river craft in the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam. The M1919 was an air-cooled development of the standard US machine gun of World War I, the Browning M1917, as designed by John M. Browning"

Description: A direct descendant of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by HK as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm. Using the HK- proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 is produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1's upper receiver will be fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. The MR556A1 uses a barrel produced by HK's famous cold hammer forging process using the highest quality steel to produce a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use.

Specifications:
•Semi-auto, Proprietary Gas-Piston Operating System employs a piston & solid operating “pusher” rod (in place of the gas tube commonly found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms) to virtually eliminate hot carbon fouling & waste gases from entering the receiver area causing malfunction   
•Match rifle capability   
•Features Picatinny top rail machined into the upper receiver & HK free-floating four quadrant rail system (FFRS) handguard w/(4) MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails   
•Upper receiver/barrel assembly are fully interchangeable w/other high quality AR-style firearms   
•Cold hammer-forged, heavy contour barrel is moderately “swagged” & constructed of the highest quality steel for superior accuracy & long life  
•Unlined bore for optimum accuracy w/internal profile of 6 lands & grooves   
•1:7"" Twist   
•Enhanced 2-stage trigger   
•7.64 lb. trigger pull   
•Extended latch charging handle   
•Retractable buttstock can be locked in place by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock   
•C.I.P dimensioned chamber allows for a wide variety of 5.56x45mm ammo & also functions reliably w/most quality .223 Rem. ammo   
•OAL: 37.68"" (extended), 33.9"" (retracted)

Everything is in great condition, and of course you are more than welcome to inspect it in person if you'd like to buy it, as well as e-mail me with requests for specific pictures. All .40 magazines are loaded with mixed hallow-point rounds or target ammo, and I believe I have about 20 extra FMJ rounds sitting in a box here.
I'm willing to sign a bill of sale if you'd like me to, but it is your responsibility to bring -- no funny business here, the gun isn't stolen, and I am a CCW holder.

$ not set
I have five boxes of hand loads for sale’.., some in once fired brass about 90% is new brass, if you've been out looking for .348 Win ammo you know how short it is, with that said; you also know what a meat hammer the cartridge is. These hand loads were loaded to take advantage of all the best qualities in a .348 Win cartridge. 
In my Win 71 rifle (1952) they were extremely accurate. I chronograph the load on my Oehler P35 

The load is:
Barns 250gr Original SP (The bullet is legendary in the .348 W.F.C)
50.0grs of H-380
Winchester case 
Primer Federal 210 or WLR
Velocity 2308 fps with about 3000 fpe

This is a very safe load in my M-71 rifles. Ammo will run between $70.00 & $95.00 plus per box; to your door or from the store. I’d like to sell all the boxes at one time, I’m not setting a price make an offer if it’s fair I’ll take it. I also have the fallowing; 

100 rounds New Win .348 Win brass
52 rounds Primer Sized and Trimmed .348 brass
19 rounds fired .348 brass
17 round of older loaded Win 200gr Silver Tip factory

65 Hornady 200gr FB SP RN
Lee .348 Win Reloading Dies and shell holder

It’s all about the barter so think about want you think you’d pay and make the offer.
Selling for ($ barter) buyer pays shipping, you may use PayPal add 3% on sale. USPS money orders only, cash OK with face to face. 

NOTE: I’m not going to piecemeal this out, if your interested you’ll have to take it all…. this type of ammo and components are getting harder and harder to come by and it’s not letting up anytime soon. If you shoot this caliber and plan on waiting until hunting season for ammo your must likely going with a different rifle in the future.
