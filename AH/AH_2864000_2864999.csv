Item Description:
This is a brand new in box Springfield Armory XDm-40 semi-automatic pistol chambered for .40 S&W. This pistol features a 3.8"" match grade barrel, delivering the accuracy serious shooters demand. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDm's match grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a level unrivaled in the firearms industry. The forged steel slide has an attractive satin silver finish for a classic two-tone look. Aggressive front and rear chevron-shaped cocking serrations allow confident operation in any environment. The ideal grip angle offers intuitive point-ability, and the comfortable contours and high tech texturing are designed for maximum control. Interchangeable backstraps are included to customize comfort for the shooter's hand. The frame has an integral Picatinny rail, readily accepting tactical lights, laser sights, and other accessories. Three white dot sights are fitted.

Springfield's USA, or Ultra Safe Trigger, system guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. This trigger also has one of the shortest travels of any currently available polymer framed pistol, along with a similarly short reset, keeping you on target with greater ease, for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. A visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow the shooter to be completely certain whether the pistol is loaded, and whether the striker is cocked. A standard grip safety, unique amongst polymer frame pistols, ensures that the pistol can only be fired when gripped at the ready.

Two ""Mega Capacity"" 16 round magazines are included. The XDm series has the highest factory capacity magazines of any production polymer framed pistol. A holster, speed loader, safety lock, and magazine holder are also included. This pistol ships in a padded hard case.

Caliber: .40 S&W

Capacity: Two 16 round magazines included

Barrel: 3.8"" Melonite steel

 Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
 all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
 At only 1"" wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
 strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
 the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
 reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
 front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
 your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
 Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
 pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
 top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
 usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
 the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
 Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
 inserted into the pistol."

It is fitted with an ATI no-gunsmith scope mount. The sling is a surplus Enfield sling. I do also have some low rise scope rings for a 1"" scope. (THE SCOPE IS NOT INCLUDED)

Included with the rifle is 207 rounds of new manufacture brass-cased PPU 174gr FMJ, as well as 60 rounds of corrosive Pakastani surplus 174gr FMJ. The ammo can and rifle case are also included. 

The rifle is in good condition and shoots great, unfortunately some dumbass (me) decided to mount a picatinny rail and attach a bipod just forward of the front sling swivel. The holes in the stock pictured are from that endeavor. The holes are the only real blemish on the stock and I have priced the rifle accordingly. The front and rear sights have been removed for the sake of the scope mounting, and again some dumbass (me) lost the parts. The good news is that should you wish to return the gun to its original form, you can order just a few parts from Numrich and assemble them on the gun. 

I'm afraid I'll need to sell the package as it is, but here's a breakdown for my asking price.

   Rifle: $250
   Rings: $20
   Mount: $50
   Ammo: $0.78 x 267 = $208.26 (plus shipping and ammo can)

The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic carbine chambered for the 7.62×39mm round, designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin sistemy Simonova, 1945 (Russian:, 1945; Self-loading Carbine of (the) Simonov system, 1945), or SKS 45.

 In the early 1950s, the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front-line service and replaced it with the AK-47; however, the SKS remained in second-line service for decades. It is still used as a ceremonial arm today. The SKS was widely exported, and was also produced by some former Eastern Bloc nations as well as China, where it was designated the ""Type 56"", East Germany as the Karabiner S and in North Korea as the ""Type 63"". 

The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand. It was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62×39mm M43 round, which was also used later in the AK-47.

This is a highly sought after brake in the AR market. This version features a slightly extended shoulder a pre-drilled hole so that it can be pinned to a 14.5"" barrel to bring it up to 16"" length to meet NFA requirements.  I bought this version because I think it looks nicer than the standard version.

This brake is used, but is in perfect shape.  I attached it to my rifle for ten test shots before going back to my three prong flash hider for flash suppression.  It is concussive to others around you, but it almost completely eliminates muzzle rise and recoil impulse.  It includes all the items it came with, including the shim set, instructions, and thread locker.  

My price is firm, as I paid $135 for it new.  If you are familiar with this brake, then you will recognize this as a good price, and you will also know how hard these are to find in stock.

Enough about the particulars, allow me to defer your attention to the item description below:

I am the original owner of this Glock 17, which was my introduction into a full-frame 9mm. Never used for concealed carry (too large and bulky for me!) and never abused or dropped. Put approx 150-200 fmj target rounds prior to Ghost Trigger install and about 50 rounds on the Lone Wolf match grade stainless steel barrel with the Ghost Trigger installed. Put a Hogue grip sleeve over the stock grip to improve the feel and control of the gun. 

There are no real signs of wear on this pistol either exterior-wise or otherwise. Just an exceptionally accurate and reliable gun to own for home defense and target practice. Never had a failure to feed or fire. 100% free of any mechanical defects. Comes with 3 mags including 1 17 rnd Glock brand mag, a 19 rnd Glock brand mag & the Mega 33 rnd Glock brand mag for when you don't want to mess around! 

The original barrel and Lone Wolf match grade barrel can be swapped out in seconds. The Ghost Trigger is a 3.5 pound trigger upgrade which was professionally installed and tested to perfection. All original parts and springs are included. You also get a clip attachment if you want to conceal carry without a holster (not recommended with a 3.5 lb trigger pull!) and a super heavy-duty slide lock with key. Includes the original case and everything shown in the pictures.

PS. I have a Blackhawk CQC black leather IWB Italian made holster (new/unused condition) designed exclusively for the Glock 17 model that fits like a glove! (Retails for $45 new)  I'll throw it in for $15. Here are the details on it:

""The Blackhawk!® Inside the Pants Leather Concealment Holster is compatible with Glock 17 handguns and allows for middle-of-the-back, strong-side, appendix or cross-draw carrying. The holster is made of durable leather and features a shirt shield to protect your clothing and keep the holster opening unobstructed and an adjustable tension screw to attain your desired retention level."""

Sig only intended the Equinox to be made in .40.  A limited number of 9mm slides were accidentally made, they decided to produce and release the gun in a limited, uncatalogued batch and this is one of them.  I spent quite a bit of time lusting after and looking for this specific firearm and consequently could never bring myself to shoot it.  

From the factory it's equipped with a TRUGLO front tritium fiber optic site, SigLite rear night sights (gun manufactured in August 28, 2012 so night sights still have plenty of life) Sig short reach trigger, and wood grips.  Coding on the box lists it as model number E26R-9-EQ.

Double and single action pulls both feel excellent and it's sure to be as reliable as any Sig.  

Everything pictured is included.

Price is $1150 FIRM and a bill of sale will be completed upon sale.

No trades will be considered.

From Osage County Guns Sig web site:

Sig Sauer P226 Equinox - 9mm (LIMITED EDITION) P226 Equinox in 9mm is a non-catalogued gun that was never meant to be built. Sig Sauer accidentally produced a small quantity of Equinox slides in 9mm instead of .40 Cal and completed the guns instead of scrapping the slides. Once the limited stock of these are gone we will likely never see more!"

I need some help valuing and identifying a gun. It is a .45 caliber blackpowder rifle. It is almost the exact same design and components as a thompson center hawken. Here is what it says on the barrel ""made in italy"" ""american eagle arms Corp"" ""45 CAL"" and has a good amount of proof marks and the serial number as well. After a good long while looking online I cant find anything on it. Closest i can come is that it was probably imported in the 70's from Italy by American Eagle, but I cant find any value or pricing point for her. Its a great old gun and has perfect patina appearance in my eyes. Th barrel looks to have been ""browned"" instead of blued, or the light surface rust has just been so symmetrical that it appears that way. I am mainly looking for any info you all may have and for a good asking price/value for her. i would keep it but I already have a Lymon 50 cal and a hawken 54 and really would prefer to not get more molds and work up another load for a third caliber of BP haha. I can get better pictures if yall need as well. 
Thanks in advance!

Here is the info from Galati Gear. I won this in a competition a year or so ago and I have no rifles that need it. It has been taken to the range once and sat in the back of the car.
