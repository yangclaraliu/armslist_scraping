On top of everything that comes with the 6940 (flip up back up iron sites, monolithic rail, etc) this rifle comes with an Aimpoint Pro red dot optic ($415 midwayusa.com), Insight M3x flashlight with pressure pad ($160 opticsplanet.com), magpul foregrip ($25 cheaperthandirt.com), an upgraded buttstock ($40 not sure of the brand though) and 3 magpul pmag magazines ($15 each). I came to the listed price by adding everything up and subtracting 20% which is very reasonable considering this gun is in perfect condition, those prices are from the most competitive stores, and tax, shipping, and a dealer transfer fee are not included. This means I'm not going to be coming off the price so no need to send me an email with ""700 bucks cash today"" in it. If you just want the rifle, I'll sell it for 1250. Any other questions, feel free to shoot me an email. Thanks!!"

I have a like new Sig Sauer 1911 Spartan edition chambered in .45 ACP with a 5"" barrel. This pistol has exactly 50 rounds through it, and has been cleaned and maintained meticulously. There are no scratches whatsoever. I have never had a single malfunction, and this gun is very accurate. In case you are unfamiliar, the Spartan edition has what is called an ""oil rubbed bronze"" nitron finish that is absolutely beautiful and unique, and tough as hell, but somewhat difficult to photograph, so it looks way better in person. It also has a real 24k gold inlay along the slide that says ""molon labe"" in ancient Greek, which translates to ""come and take them"", which is what the Greek king Leonides told the invading Persian king when told to lay down their swords. It comes in the original box with two Sig magazines, and is equipped with bright novak style night sights. The msrp on these pistols is $1,300 before tax.

i know we never get out of these guns what we have in them, unless people get taken!!! im not trying to make a profit, just sell this package for a reasonable price. that price is $675 and im pretty firm. i can deal with loosing out on $125 becasue of the enjoyment i have got out of shooting and owning this rifle. i can keep some ammo and get the price a little lower if you do need it all, as we shoot 9mm in other guns. if you are not real familiar with this gun, i am including some links that will help familiarize you with it below.

This is an actual youth sized crossbow with a shortened stock and forend so that children and smaller women can comfortably shoot it. Even with the reduced 125 lb draw weight it still produces arrow speeds of 250 fps due to a 12"" power stroke. The bow comes with a 25mm red dot sight, a Hunter Elite Lite 3-arrow quiver, 3 arrows with field tips, a Horton rope cocking device, and an Allen soft crossbow case. My youngest daughter is now 15 and has simply outgrown this bow. I need to replace it with an adult sized bow for her. I live in Liberty Township and you can actually shoot the bow in my backyard before purchasing to ensure it is exactly as I have described. Not that it matters, but this is the exact same bow used by Darrell in ""The Walking Dead."" You'd think the producers would have been smart enough to give him an adult sized bow!

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever

I am selling my Remington 700 SPS Stainless in .300 Win Mag. This is an older 700, so it does not have the x-mark trigger, but it has had an excellent trigger job set at 2.5# which breaks like glass. It will come with the factory composite stock and a Boyd's charcoal (""Pepper"") colored laminate stock that it is currently in. The barrel is fully free floated and this model comes with a factory jeweled bolt. This also has the bottom floor plate. 

Overall, this rifle is in excellent condition. You will be hard pressed to find a mark anywhere. It has only had about 100 rounds through it, and the barrel was properly broken in. This has been sitting in my safe and I just don't see being able to use it anytime soon.

Caliber: 7.5x54 French
Capacity: 5
Method of Operation: Bolt Action
Overall Length: 40 inches
Barrel Length: 22 inches 
Weight: 9 pounds
Condition: Believed to be New Unissued with light handling marks. The barrel and receiver needs to be thoroughly checked and cleaned of any remaining cosmoline and should be checked by a professional gunsmith before firing.

Product Details:
Manufactured by The Manufacture d'armes de Saint-Etienne (MAS), based on the serial number, between July 1951 and July 1952 (most likely the beginning of 1952). One of the last of the FG series and the late production MAS 36's.

Description:
The MAS-36 is a short, carbine-style rifle with a two-piece stock and slab-sided receiver. It is chambered for the modern, rimless 7.5x54 French cartridge.

The MAS-36 carries a spike bayonet, reversed, in a tube below the barrel. It has a relatively short barrel and is fitted with large aperture (rear) and post (front) sights designed for typical combat ranges. It is known to be an extremely accurate rifle. It has a five-round, Mauserstyle double-column magazine with a removable floor-plate and a charging hump that can take stripper clips. The rifle is somewhat unusual in that the locking lugs are found at the rear of the bolt rather than the front, (rear locking lugs are more resistant to dirt), resulting in a distinctive-looking forward cant of the bolt handle.

All MAS 36 Fc3 models were counter-bored, the barrels were factory built that way and these were originally intended for the rifles to be used for grenade launching (MAS 36 LG48). This practice was soon extended to the whole production line so that a standard rifle could be transformed into a dedicated grenade launcher by only swapping parts.

Includes:
Original leather sling
Spike Bayonet
2 –20 Round Box of PRVI PARTIZAN 7.5x54 French

This SKS is in extremely good condition, would have to see it to understand.

This SKS was, like many, packed away in cosmoline for decades. I personally unpacked it, and cleaned out all the cosmoline. I have not fired this gun yet, and to be honest, cannot tell if it was ever fired before it was packed away.

I have installed the fantastic SGWorks Bullpup kit. Making this SKS a perfect example of what a modern battle rifle should be. Accurate, reliable, and powerful.

What you see in the pictures is what you get, may throw in some ammo (200rds) if the offer is right. Does not come with optics or sights. Comes with the 3 mags, tri-rail, and foregrip.

Asking price is 650 OBO.
Price is more than fair considering the price of an SKS, the condition of this one, and the fact that it has a freshly installed SGworks kit around it."

Also included are two (2) additional net seats, which retail for $17.99 each. This is a very stable and very comfortable stand, which I purchased due to the ability to quickly remove and reinstall the net seat. I had poacher issues and did not want them to be able to sit in my stand.  This Roost model has a chain attachment whereas the new models have a nylon ratchet strap. I personally prefer the chain. A chain never gets old and needs to be replaced and critters can't succesfully chew on it. I did not even put it out/up during the 2013/14 deer season. Call Steve at REDACTED.  $85 for the stand alone or $100 with the two extra net seats.  I am not interested in any trades please."

The Cooey Model 82 was a single shot bolt-action .22 caliber target rifle intended for use in training Canadian Army and RCAF cadets during WWII. A number of variations exist but, generally, the rifle is 44 inches long with a 27"" ordinance steel barrel. Weight is generally 6.5 lbs however this can be adjusted by changing a steel rod located in the forearm under the barrel. In 1942, the Canadian government placed an order for 34,810 rifles at a cost of CAD$13.80 per unit; the Canadian Army Service Bulletin dated April 20, 1943 identified them as ""Rifles, Cooey Pattern. .22 in. Instruction No. 1.""
Large quantities later became available to the civilian market after the war as military surplus. In the late 1940s, Hallum's Sporting Goods of Toronto and International Firearms in Montreal were offering the ""musket type"" at CAD$9.95 each (about $110 in 2011 dollars). A contemporary advertisement to the retail market states, ""A Military Model .22 caliber especially designed for Class 2 [shooting] clubs. Adaptable for drilling purposes, target shooting, Home Guard and Cadet training.""
Well regarded for its durability and reliability, particularly in the harsh environment of the Canadian winter, a Model 82 in good-to-excellent condition can fetch as high as $300-$400.
Unlike other Cooey rifles of the period, all Model 82's are marked with a National Stock Number found on the base of the grip. Front sights were usually a hooded post or hooded blade type while the rear sight could be either a blade and ramp style similar to that found on other Cooey rifles or the receiver was drilled to accept a peep sight or scope mount. The action is the same design as other Cooey single shot .22's and this rifles can shoot all .22 cal ammunition"

7 Good Reasons Why You Should Make A Remington 870 Tactical Bullpup Part Of Your Arsenal.

Reason #1: 22% Shorter Configuration, Smaller and More Compact

In many tactical situations (urban apartments and businesses, suburban hallways, vehicles, etc) you need a self-defense weapon that packs a lot of firepower in a small, compact package. With a 22% overall reduction in weapon length, the bullpup design gives you with the shortest most tactical shotgun configuration available to civilians without a special permit or license.

This is the core reason why we developed the Remington 870 Tactical Bullpup conversion kit – to give you the shortest legal civilian shotgun configuration possible without skimping on brute strength firepower.

Reason #2: Standardized Grip & Safety Placement

Many people are very familiar with the AR-15 platform. Because of this weapon familiarity, we chose to use the same grip, safety and trigger mechanism to make the Remington 870 Tactical Bullpup very familiar to use – all the important stuff is right there where your muscle memory thinks it should be. This makes it very easy to switch from an AR-15 rifle to the 870 Tactical Bullpup, and back again under stress, low light or complete darkness.

Reason #3: Better Balance And Improved Handling

One of the primary concerns with a weapon system is balance. The better a weapon is balanced in the hands of a user, the more effective it will generally be in a tactical application. Improved balance means faster target acquisition, easier movement, quieter movement, improved handling and less inadvertent and dangerous gun handling mistakes.

Because of the improved balance and shorter overall length, shooters who have back problems, lower upper body strength or are simply not accustomed to every day use of the weapon system will find this Remington 870 Tactical Bullpup easier to use effectively than most other shotguns.

Reason #4: Built in Rail Systems

The incorporated rail systems in the bullpup design get you needed space to attach a custom configuration of Remington 870 Tactical Accessories to your shotgun quickly and easily. Want to add a flashlight – no problem. Laser or holographic sights – no problem. Magazine extensions, side saddle shell carriers, and more accessories are as easy as Tac On and go get your tac on.

We specifically placed the tactical rails in strategic locations to ensure you have nearly endless accessory options and provide you with as nearly a custom and personalized shotgun set up to meet your needs, whatever they may be.

Reason #5: New Life

These new bullpup conversion kits can breathe new life in an old bird gun that is beat up, ugly or just needs a little tactical facelift. Within an hour, you can transform that “bird gun” into a tactical beast that will get everyone’s attention.

The best part is that you get to continue to rely upon the dependable reputation of the Remington 870 12 gauge shotgun, use any ammunition you choose from non-lethal to specialty and exotic ammo, and get a far superior tactical shooting experience with the bullpup design.

Reason #6: Pistol Grips Don’t Cut It

If you have ever shot a 12 gauge with a pistol grip only, you know what we are talking about here. There are very few things in the world that really feel as though you grabbed a tiger by the tail than pulling the trigger on a pistol grip only 12 gauge.  Without the ability to shoulder mount the weapon, the gun kicks like a mule – often bucking the barrel up into your face. Nothing says “Yeah, I’m a serious tactical operator” like a broken nose or black eye.

By shortening the overall length of the shotgun to just 28.5″ long, we created a platform that alleviates the length issues while still maintaining a shoulder mounted weapon system, giving you maximum amount of control, maneuverability and safety.

Reason #7: Rugged Construction

Let’s face it… we have all had friends that had a special gun that they seemed to just sit around and polish with a soft cloth. You need something tough, a 12 gauge workhorse that can take the day to day pounding and still look good and perform even better.

The Remington 870 Tactical bullpup’s rugged polymer body is designed to take whatever your tactical situation throws at it – and keep on churning out spent shells and sending lead down range like a boss.

We offer the latest technology in Titanium Nitride coatings and refinishing as well as other customizing services.

For those not familiar with Titanium Nitride it is unique in terms of firearm finishes as it not only gives a custom look to your firearm it also adds durability and reduces the friction on the coated part. This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, vastly increases the durability, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is the average coating only adds 3 micrometers of material, so it will not change the function of your firearm only enhance the look of it. It is applied in a cathodic arc chamber which ensures a uniform coating. This is the same coating that is used by high speed cutting tools to give you an idea of its strength.

MG Precision Arms LTD separates our business by offering not only one finish option, but 4. We also pride ourselves on a quick turn around. We understand that most will be using these coatings on firearms they rely on, and we do everything we can to return your part as fast as possible. While other companies offer 4-6 week returns, we have a 2-3 week turn around, and often return parts even quicker. If you are looking for the most durable coating with plenty of finish options, a good price and fast turnaround MG Precision Arms LTD is the company to use.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. I'll ship to FFL"
