Nicest AK I've ever handled, far superior to a WASR, and not a parts kit.  Finish has some scuffs, as can be expected with a parkerized AK, but the function is perfect.  Nice and clean throughout.  Only about 100 rounds through it.

Comes with three 30 round steel mags, one 5 round steel mag, Bulldog soft-side case, and sling.  I can throw in up to 500 rounds of steel cased 7.62x39 to even the trade if necessary.

If I don't get any good offers, I'll keep it.  I'm just more interested in other things at this time.  I do not have any cash to add for a trade, only to cover a pistol transfer if necessary."

The Coming of the Single-Six
Designed in 1953, the Single-Six was Ruger's first revolver, following the initial success in 1949 of Bill Ruger's Mark I semi-auto .22LR pistol. In the decade of the '50s, Westerns were all the rage both in the theater and on the new fangled television. This medium allowed a whole new generation of kids to enjoy the old B westerns of earlier decades.

With that and the subsequent demand for sixguns, Bill Ruger realized that if he could produce a pistol people could afford, he had a sure market. But of course, starting off with a great big .44 special would probably have been a disaster. So he started small and thus we have the Single-Six, now more than 50 years old and still being produced. 

However, while a traditional styled sixgun was the order of the day, Ruger did not simply copy Colt's design of 1873. Instead, he replaced the workings with something a bit more modern and much stronger. In fact, the action is so strong that practically any gunsmith will tell you that they don't have much experience repairing these revolvers (modifying and customizing, yes. Repairing, no.) They simply don't break with any frequency unless they're severely abused. 

The original run of Single-Six production ran from 1953 to 1962 with the early revolvers being offered with two barrel lengths. One interesting aspect of the early production guns is a flat loading gate instead of the contoured shape we normally think of. This was corrected in 1957 as well as the addition of other barrel lengths. Revolvers made during this period are generally refered to as ""Flat Top"" revolvers due to the appearance of the top strap. 

The next production run would last from 1963-1973 with changes in the grip frame, the addition of adjustable sights on some revolvers, and other improvements. Revolvers produced during this period are refered to as the ""Old Model"" while all revolvers made prior to 1973 are frequently known as ""Three Screw"" revolvers for the three screws visible on the frame. 

In 1973, the Single-Six had been in production for 20 years, a decent run by any standard. It is estimated that about 500,000 of these revolvers had been sold at this point. Ruger had produced perhaps one of the most populare sixguns outside of military and law enforcement. But Ruger had also made several advances over those 20 years as well as devloping a means to make their revolvers safer to carry holstered with a full complement of six rounds in the cylinder, at last making six shooters able to safely shoot six. The time was now right for the Single-Six to get an upgrade. In fact, every revolver in the Ruger line up got an upgrade that year, mainly as a result of this innovation.

The FN FNS-9 & 40 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal.

The FNS pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism together with an optional manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.

Fast and Accurate Shooting
The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.

The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.

Maximized Safety Systems
In addition to the manual safety, the FNS features Four Major Safeties:

Trigger Safety
Firing Pin Safety
Drop Safety
Out-of-Battery Safety

1. Trigger Safety

The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.
The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.

2. Firing Pin Safety

The firing pin safety prevents the striker from passing.
The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.

3. Drop Safety

Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled.

4. Out-of-Battery Safety

When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the striker even if the trigger is pulled.

Enhanced Ergonomics
The FNS pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:
- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension
- Front serrations for easy press check
- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size."

The barrel is dove tailed for a blade type rear sight.  Both the front and rear sights can be purchased at Numrich if you wanted to take the rifle back to iron sights.

Here is a little info about the 99-M1:
The Marlin Model 99M1 is a short carbine with the same tubular magazine and action as the Marlin 99 and 99U. The main difference is the 99M1 has a walnut stock and hand guard and an 18-inch barrel to make it look more like a US military M1 Carbine. Marlin introduced the 99M1 in 1964, in hopes that the resemblance to the US M1 carbine would appeal to the thousands of WW II veterans who had trained with and carried into combat the larger caliber US M1. The 99M1 was a success and over 160,000 were sold before production was discontinued in 1978

These were known to become jam-o-matics due to the feed-throat wearing out. Originally it was made from chromed aluminum. It took a while, but I finally was able to find a feed-throat conversion kit, and this rifle has been upgraded to a steel feed-throat.  I still have the original parts as well.
This will be a great addition to your collection or a quick handling squirrel getter!
It is beautiful and fun to shoot.

EDIT:  Here are the answers to a few questions I have been getting.
-  The date of manufacture on the little Marlin is 1971.
-  I have been asked about the ""Marlin Bulls-eye"", and it is still intact right there next to the rear sling stud.
-  The Walnut is in excellent shape and there is normal wear on the high spots and edges of the metal. There is no rust on the metal. Overall it is in excellent shape for a rifle that is 42 years old.

You are not going to find one of these at Wal-Mart.

Shoot me an email with a good trade offer and this little piece of history can be yours!"

Product Details:
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

The worst part of the kit is that the rear four inches of the receiver has been burned off due to importation by the ATF.  Everything else is included.  Barrel is in great shape with good lands and grooves.  All parts needed to assemble are readily available on robertrtg.com.  Any questions I can be reached at REDACTED.  Parts kit is located in Youngstown, Ohio.  No low ball offers or tire kickers.  Complete kits are extremely hard to find now!  Trades will be considered or will sell for $625."

I also chose the option to set it up so I could shoot standard .45 ACP for practice. I chose their Model 1 (snappy name, huh?). Here is a link to their website: www.guncrafterindustries.com . Following is a list of what I have in it (including .50 GI ammo, which can also be obtained easily from the manufacturer).

Note there are a total of ten magazines, five mags per caliber. Normal .45 ACP mags won’t quit fit right because the frame is somewhat beefed up to handle the .50 GI loading. This gun is like new....not a scratch anywhere on it - One trip to the range and it's been a safe queen ever since. Shipping: I'm growing a little weary of people asking me to ship guns illegally; ""just don't tell what's in the box"" may save a buyer $20....but it could send me to jail, so I will take the argument out of it by paying all shipping costs - for the gun and ammo. Gun must ship to an FFL.

OVERVIEW:

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in."

Gun has factory wood grips, but I installed a brand new set of VZ G10 Operator II grips ( on it right now – pictured). I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60). I like the gun, but it is just too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

This is a neat rifle in that it has a squirel on the stock. Was made in the late 60s or early 70s and the blueing is about 90% on it. It is also the more desirable JM stamped marlin which means it was made when they made top notch quality guns vs the newer stuff which is hit and miss. Also has a great trigger that breaks very nicely. Has a tasco scope with see through mounts where you can still utilize the iron sights. Also has a sling installed which makes for a perfect hunting outfit for a child to learn on . Gun is magazine fed(7 round) which is good for safety since it can be unloaded by removing the magazine. I want $265 firm for this rifle and its worth that in the shape it is in.

And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

Prefer $250 and under, for the right gun with ammo and enough accessories $300 (Not going to pay $300 for your used 995TS with no ammo however, I can get them new for that).  A new one is $270 and less, depending upon the sales going on shipped to my FFL, so don't expect me to pay new price for yours if all you got is a rifle.  Located in Benson, willing to meet in Dunn or Smithfield in a public location, or for the right deal in Garner at Dicks Sporting Goods.  Have cash in hand, and NCDL.  Only willing to purchase with a bill of sale provided, no shady business etc.  If you have one you're wanting to get rid of, shoot me an email with information, and your asking price and we can go from there."

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Available with a tactical designed mil. spec. lower handguard with flash light.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

At its heart is a one-piece Alcoa 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength structural fasteners. The match-toleranced barrel is hydraulically pressed and locked into the extrusion resulting in a rock-solid, unitized structure on which to mount a rifle telescope. Safety is unparalleled because the cartridge is surrounded by both high-grade gun barrel steel and the aluminum extrusion.
The bolt is machined from a single piece of proprietary grade steel. Its 15 lugs safely lock it into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts are its extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly. It is reliable and easy to maintain."

Giving you the ballistic quality of the big bore .45 ACP in a concealed carry gun, the G30 .45 ACP Subcompact Pistol is a popular choice of plainclothes policemen and protection personnel. The G30 combines GLOCK's highly accurate firing characteristics and the big bore power of the .45 ACP in a size previously occupied only by snub nose revolvers. Like larger GLOCKs, the G30 pairs a corrosion-resistant, ergonomic, stronger-than-steel polymer frame with a durable cold-hammered steel slide and barrel coated with GLOCK's high tech Tenifer 64 HRC surface treatment.  The Safe Action trigger system teams a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages.  GLOCK barrels feature rounded interior profiles for easier cleaning and longer lasting precision. Loaded chamber indicator. Double action. Black finish. Fixed sights. Weight: 23.99 oz.

The M11-A1 is a compact version of the Sig P-226, just 7.1 inches long and only 1.5 inches wide. The Navy SEALs and Special Boat Teams consider it a favorite, and use it as their standard carry pistol as it is small, light, durable, accurate and easy to conceal. The M11 is a recoil-operated, semi-automatic pistol that fires a 9mm NATO round in both single- and double-action modes.

Produced to the exact same specifications as those which have been the official sidearm of the Navy SEALs since 1986.
