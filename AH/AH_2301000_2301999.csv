It was built using a DelTon stripped lower, a Palmetto State Armory lower parts kit, a Palmetto State Armory stock kit, and a DPMS slick sided upper. The upper is a flat top, optic ready upper with a railed gas block and an A2 flash hider. The barrel has a 1/9 twist rate and is rated for 5.56 NATO. It also has a Mil-spec collapsible CTR stock which eliminates the wobble.

I've fired less than 75 rounds through it (a few to sight it in, then two stages in a 3 gun competition before swapping to my other AR), so the round count is probably closer to 50 than 75. I've never had any problems out of this gun, and I'm sure with some practice I'd shoot this AR better than my other, but I'd rather just pass this one along and use the money to upgrade my optics.

I'm offering this rifle in one of two set ups, to accommodate various budgets:

$775 - Rifle with FDE Magpul CTR stock, FDE Magpul MOE grip, FDE Magpul MOE hand guard, and 1 FDE Magpul Pmag.

While it is super fun to shoot and generally works okay, it has too many FTFs for my taste. The mechanics of the gun look to work perfectly, so I am guessing it is more of a magazine issue than anything else. If you're the type to tinker and can tweak magazines or perhaps polish the feed ramp, then I bet you'd get this sweet piece working great. Because of this, I am asking $150 cash for all of it. Could be an amazing deal for the right buyer. Will only sell to buyers with a current drivers license and Indiana carry permit."

This is a great gun thats really fun to shoot, but I missed out on the cheap .308 ammo years ago and looking to consolidate calibers. Really looking to trade but would consider selling. Please only quality gun trades, some of these L1A1's had miss shaped feed ramps and wouldn't feed, this one does not have this problem only feed problem I have had was because the DSArms will not work with 20rds in them.

XPS2

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

-Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
-Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space

This is a 6mm bullet on a 223 case. It's a pretty cool little round but I've lost interest. Built this thinking I would get into this for deer hunting and coyote hunting and I just haven't. There isn't but 60 rounds down the Black Hole Weaponry 1-10 twist barrel 18 inch mid length barrel. It has a YHM free float handguard on it, comes with the Burris PEPR mount and Nikon Monarch 2-7x40 scope. Also has Magpul ctr stock and miad grip. YHM bipod mount and Shooter's Ridge swivel 6-9 bipod. Will also include the 20 round pmag with round limiter in it and the attached sling. Charging handle is a BCM mod 3 handle and a Young Manufacturing Bolt Carrier Group. I also have about 30 bullets and maybe 50 cases sized, primed and ready to load that I will include as well.

Would really like to trade (with cash on my end) for a 308 AR...no DPMS rifle please. The only other things I'd be interested in would be an M1A...no Cetme's or FALs.

Not exactly sure what market value on this is but I think $1050 might be reasonable. Let me know. Roseburg area."

I bought this new and carried it three times. This Taser uses the same technology of the X26, X2, and X3. It doesn't look like a gun and instead looks like a cell phone. Gives the same shock as the police model but runs for 30 seconds. The police Taser only runs for 5 seconds. This is also good for contact stunning. This is the model with the laser site and flash light. When you flip the cover they automatically turn on. Don't buy the model without the laser. The laser might be all you need to stop an attacker. Many people are afraid of the Taser. Must be transferred legally through a Taser transfer form. Will need the routine battery replacement soon. Otherwise is like new condition. Has never been fired. Make sure this is legal in your area.

It has, (for the most part) been mounted on a ""Safe Queen."" It comes with the ARMS quick throw lever mount ($135.00) value. This scope is in perfect condition. I bought it, mounted it, and have only used it a few times; mainly for sighting in and a little range time for familiarization. It DOES NOT have the original mount (which was crap anyway). I purchased the ARMS mount at the same time I bought the scope and is also like new. This is a great scope and I really hate to part with it, but at this point in life it goes unused for various reasons and just sits in the safe. That said the starting bid is not negotiable, since I have no ""need"" to sell. I'm asking way below the original price for this perfect condition and working, top end optic. It DOES NOT have the original box or manual. Yes the flip covers go with it. I use ""Square"" for CC purchases and of course bank certified checks or MO. Contact me to arrange your preference

The holster is literally brand new-never been used. Not to mention, it is ridiculously hard to find these holsters, which you probably already know if you're looking at this ad. The holster is made of the extremely durable STX material and is suede lined to protect the finish of your weapon. It is a LEVEL 3 retention holster-which means it has a locking hood, a locking mechanism for the ejection port, the usual tension screws, and a metal guard to keep the hood from being abused in combat. This holster is BADASS. I ordered it and ended up selling my Glock before the holster even came in. The usual wait time for this model holster is 4-6 weeks!

Rifle functions well. Stock was cracked but repaired to functional quality. I have looked on ebay and other places and it is possible to obtain a new (non-sportarized)stock for $150.00. Looks to be an early production rifle 1941 or 42 by my guess at the serial numbers (I am no expert). The on/off switch is not a safety, it is way to lock off the 5 rd magazine so that troops could use it as a single shot. If the enemy got close you could switch to on and have a ""rapid fire"" 5 shot."

Approximately 200 rounds have been fired through this gun, all of which were factory FMJ.  The pistol was meticulously cleaned and lubed after each use.  Overall, it looks new and was carried at the end of summer in a Crossbreed Super Tuck IWB holster.  There is also a rubberized Talon grip on the gun, which took it from feeling good to feeling great.

Besides the pistol, it will come with four (4) five round magazines, three of which have Pearce finger extensions on them, and a seven (7) round magazine with the two sleeves.  Also included is the original box with all factory accessories and the manual.  Lastly, the right hand Crossbreed Super Tuck holster will go as part of the deal.  

This gun has been sent back to Springfield Armory and received the recent upgrade, and I will supply you with documentation proving such.

Price is $650 FIRM, AND CASH ONLY.  No trades, please, as I only want to sell this gun.  I will need to see a valid Washington state driver's license AND a valid Washington CPL, and we'll scratch out a quick bill of sale which will go straight into the safe and never see daylight again.  I live in Pierce County and will drive a reasonable distance to meet you.

I am at work and will post pictures when I get home tonight.  If you are interested in purchasing this pistol, please email me directly at riceboy72 @ hotmail . com, or use the link on this page to send me a message."

Round count through 40cal  bbl is very low (100 or less?)
Mostly shot it as a 9mm (250 ?)
Pistol was carried (vehicle gun) more than it was shot.
Does show handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks in the black finish, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. They are ""swirlys"" from carry in a Kydex holster (already sold in a seperate listing). Note the finger index mark on the trigger guard on side opposite ejector port. This is a 100% reliable, great shooter grade/carry gun, not a show piece!

For the whole setup, $450 should be a fair price. With the accessories, that's roughly $375 for the pistol itself, $50 for the 9mm barrel, and $25 for the mags and a little ammo..

Yugoslavian Model M-98 Mauser Rifle
Not to be confused with any of the other Yugoslavian Mauser Rifles, the M-98 is the only one of the Yugo Mauser rifles that originates in Germany. These rifles were used by the Nazis during the occupation of Yugoslavia during WWII, and were captured when Yugoslavia liberated itself in 1944 (the only European country to accomplish this without aid from foreign armies). Another source of WWII German K-98s to Yugoslavia at the time came in the form of war reparations from Germany after the cessation of hostilities. 

Following liberation, Yugoslavia's military was understandably critically short of weapons. One means of resolving the shortage was through overhauling and remarking captured German rifles, which were after all, quite similar to those the Yugoslavians usually employed at the time.

Some advertisers list the Yugo M-98 as 'German M98k Mausers' however we deem this as potentially misleading because original markings have been tampered with and as a result do not include the words 'WWII German' in the model name. The reasons for this involve the arsenal refinishing and remarking of these rifles: original maker's markings and production year have been ground off the receiver and replaced with the Yugoslavian crest. In some cases serial numbers have added and/or removed, and some Yugo M-98s will bear the 'Preduzece 44' markings of the Zastava arsenal where the rifles were overhauled.

This rifle has the crest and the Preduzece 44 stamping.  It is in extremely good condition with no cracks in the wood and good clean blueing.  It has a sling that was made to simulate the original.  

I will include 175 rounds of ammunition"

Shows some handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. No rust, well maintained.

I bought this so long ago, I no longer have the box/manual. So I will deliver it to buyer in a Mil-tec Holster w/ 4 ammo loops. You can get a manual free from Taurus, I can even download one for you and deliver it with the handgun if desired. 

You don't see pre-lock guns of this type surface for sale very often, $350 should be a fair price. They go for $430 new on gunbroker, plus shipping, plus a transfer fee, maybe plus tax depending on where you are.

I ALSO PUT A HEAT SHIELD ON IT AND THE SIGHTS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO NEON NIGHT SIGHTS. ALSO, IT HAS AN ALLEN BUTTSTOCK SHELL HOLDER AND A GELPAD ON THE END OF THE STOCK SO THAT IT WILL HELP WITH RECOIL AND NOT HAVE YOUR ARM BRUISED UP IF YOU SHOOT ALOT.

I REALIZE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF SOMETHING WHAT YOU HAVE IN IT BUT I'M WILLING TO SELL THIS SHOTGUN FOR $325, I WILL ALSO THROW IN A $25 HARD SHELL CASE FOR FREE. THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE TACTICAL FORENDS FOR THE MODEL 320 SO YOU WOULD HAVE ONE THAT IS ONE OF A KIND AND THE ACTION ON THIS GUN IS EASY AND SUPER SMOOTH. YOU COULD BARELY GET BY WITH $325 JUST BUYING IT AND PAYING TAXES AND BACKGROUND. SO I THINK THIS IS MORE THAN A FAIR PRICE. PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS. I HAVE OVER 15 SHOTGUNS AND AM JUST KINDA TRYING TO WHITTLE DOWN ON MY SHOTGUNS. THE ONLY TRADES I WOULD CONSIDER ARE COMPACT 9MM ( NO JUNK, HI POINT, DAVIS, HIGH STANDARD, JENNINGS, ETC. ) IF SERIOUSLY INTERESTED YOU MAY TEXT OR CALL REDACTED.

Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components."

  I'm looking for a quick sale on this, it has the original 36 cal  bp cylinder as well as a conversion cylinder, which allows this steel framed pistol to shoot 38 special ammo.
 Since the price of steel and wood has not been on the increase, I will not gouge anyone on the price. With that being stated, look at new Pietta prices, and look at conversion cylinder prices. I think you'll see I'm priced well below Illinois average used prices.
If you're interested, $350 is my price.  I say the following with the utmost respect and do not wish to sound sarcastic... I will not go lower, as I do not need to sell. I will not ship and because this is IL, the state of corruption, I will follow FOID gun rules.

There is no shimmy or wiggle to the stock, which has just been purged of cosmoline (the original owner chopped the stock but didn't clean it, weird).
