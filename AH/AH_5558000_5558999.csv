IE- buying a hardcase for shipping, getting boxes to wrap the hard case in, taping it together so it won't fall apart in shipping, finding a ffl that's willing to ship, paying an aditional 40% on top of next day air shipping fee. if you want to complain about me not shipping, just keep in mind, i'm not a retail store and i don't have to please you at all. my life is hectic and if i don't want to take on additional time/cost to sell somehting, i simply wont. no amount of complaining is going to change that."

Precision CNC machined from solid billet 7075-T6 aluminum, the SP223 Billet Lower is the first step to building the best AR15 possible. Mil-Spec is just a starting point for Seekins Precision. Specifically designed for serious tactical shooters, the SP223 has features not found on standard AR lower receivers that significantly improve handling and performance. The Seekins Precision Enhanced Bolt Catch comes standard on the SP223. Shooters can easily drop the bolt from either side with our ambi-bolt release feature. Custom screw in dowel pins are used to secure these components, eliminating the use of roll pins, hammers, and pin punches for installation.
An oversized winter trigger guard allows the use of gloves while maintaining precise trigger control, and the trigger reset adjustment screw allows fire control tuning for optimum performance.The quick access mag release and beveled mag well assist with rapid, positive magazine changes and works with most all magazines including Magpul P-Mags and Surefire high capacity magazines.
To assist with exact, no hassle assembly, the rear take down detent has also been relocated under the grip. All of the features and superior design combine to make the SP 223 lower receiver a significant upgrade over common mil-spec lowers.Purchased  May 19th for $264.Looking for $250 cash or possible trade for 22lr,9mm/357sig/magnum handguns.Must sign BOS,proper ids.Text REDACTED for more info/offers/pics"

Not sure why they aren't all made like this. You don't have to alter your grip at all to release the slide. This is not a crappy striker fired pistol. Is a smooth Sig DA/SA trigger, just like the P226.  Of all 9mm pistols out there, this would probably be the easiest one for a woman to handle."
