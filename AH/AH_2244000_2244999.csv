M48: 1950-1952- The initial version of the M48, with full crest, M48 mark on receiver and all machined steel parts. These rifles have not been available for a long time. They are a must for the military rifle collector. Very few of these true M48 rifles are available.

GRADE:This rifle is in very good condition. The bore looks great with deep rifling.

The M48 Mauser is a post World War II Yugoslavian version of the Belgian Fabrique Nationale designed Mauser model 1924 short rifle. After World War II, the Yugoslavs took this design and incorporated modifications based upon Germany's MauserKarabiner 98k. Although similar in general appearance to that of the German rifle, many of the parts of these two rifles are not interchangeable, especially the bolt and related action parts. The main difference between the M48 and the K98k is that the M48 uses an intermediate-length receiver. They are usually easily identified by the top handguard, which extends behind the rear sight and ends just in front of the receiver ring, although this feature exists on other models as well.

I am most interested in trading for other C&R firearms rifle/pistol/revolver.

I am very open to all offers. Face to Face in San Antonio only.

I may be willing to throw in a little ammo if the offer is right. I would love a keltec PMR 30 so if you have one and will trade let me know what you want and we can try to work a deal. Otherwise I am open to almost anything. 

Other items high on my interest are: Bulgarian Makarov, British Enfield, French Mas, AR Lowers and parts, CZ 83, Chinese SKS, Tokarev Pistols, sporterized mosins hit me up with whatever.

I recently traded for it, and before I made the trade I contacted Taurus to learn as much as I could about this firearm.

As the title says it was sold new in 2011 and is a bright stainless 1911.  The barrel bushing, guide rod plug, slide stop, trigger, thumb safety, grip screws, beaver tail safety, and hammer are all GOLD plated.  The firearm also sports a picatinny rail.   I have several more pictures but they are too big to upload.  So I can email or text them upon request.

When I spoke with Taurus last week they said the MSRP in 2011 was $892.  We all know no one pays full MSRP.  I have talked to 2 people who bought these new and both said they paid $799 in 2011.  Guns have gone up quite a bit since then, but I am asking $800.  I would consider fair offers, but am not strapped for cash or an idiot.  Fair offers will be considered.

Just found one that sold on a gun auction on the Internet over a year ago for $782.  Guns have definitely gone up since then.

I would consider trades but no hi points or Jimenez or ak's/sk's."

""Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight."""

432,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2244432,For Sale:  Finnish M39 Nagant Sniper Rifle - Superb Condition,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida","$ 1,150","Listed On: Monday, October 21, 2013",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I purchased this rifle in 1990, admired it for a while, then greased it up and put it in my safe where it has been ever since. 

I believe it is one of a relatively small group of rifles that were assembled by the Finnish government in the 1970's for export using mothballed M39's and original PU scopes that were either captured or purchased and stockpiled by the Finn's after WWII. 

The pristine condition of the rifle along with the high quality work evident in the scope mounting seem to confirm this. I've seen many examples of the work that the big importers have done here in the states and it varies from ok/fair to downright shoddy. So again this does seem to indicate that this is one of be rifles put together in Finland then exported to the US in the 1970's.

I've done some research on this rifle and there really isn't much info available. However I did find record of some old print ads from the 70's that advertised what appears to be a very similar rifle. It went for $200 in the mid-70's which was a considerable amount at the time. 

The rifle is immaculate with metal finish near 100% with wood the same way. Bore is pristine, and the PU scope's optics are bright and clear. 

Rifle comes with an original Finn M39 green leather sling and blackened brass muzzle cap. The scope is an original PU that includes leather lens caps, heavy canvas scope/action cover, and the original lens cleaning cloth.  

Additionally there is (5) 20 round boxes of Russian 7.62 x 54 Match ammo that was made in 1971. Ammo is brass case and uses match grade powder & primers along with a 182 grain boat tail match bullet. There is also a high quality reproduction bayonet and green leather scabbard that was purchased later. Most of the original M39 bayonets were destroyed and a surviving original can cost upwards to $500 by itself. 

Finally there is some paperwork that came with the rifle. It's written in either Finnish or Russian and since I can't read either - I'm not sure. The only thing I can read is the date which is stamped in blue ink and it reads 1976. This is obviously some sort of
inspector's sign off sheet. It could be for the rifle, it could be the scope or could be both. 

I'm asking $1150 for the rifle, ammo & accessories. Pick up in the Brandon area. Must be a Florida resident and of legal age to purchase. 

Thanks for looking."

All 9mm and .357mag ammo for $750

All ammo is new (not reloaded) shelf ammo in new mtm cases
This my my final ad for this ammo. I sold all my 9mm and .357mag firearms and have no use for this ammo or the mtm cases. These are the cheapest prices on this defensive ammo anywhere so I will not lower any prices. Minimum of $100 purchase. CASH ONLY NO TRADES.

Saves from overworking brass by only resizing the neck of the brass.  Ideal to resize brass that has already been fired from YOUR gun.  

When a rifle round is fired from a gun the brass expands (perfectly) to the chamber of that gun.  That's where Lee's Collet Neck Sizing Die comes in.  It only resizes the neck/mouth of the brass, keeping the shoulder perfected mated to your rifle's chamber, thus increasing accuracy!"
