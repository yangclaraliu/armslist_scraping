Unfired (by me); I just cleaned the barrel and slide where the residue from test firing was left on it.  I've got other .22s I enjoy shooting, and just never got around to putting anything through this one, so its just the way I got it.

I've got no need for the little pistol, and could use the $$$ for a new project, so its offered for sale in time for Christmas!  (and yes, it IS light enough and small enough to fit in his or her stocking!)"

     I have a M&P9 compact for sale. I love the gun but i got a shield and it is much easier to conceal carry. So I really dont have a use for this gun anymore. This gun has been taken care of. I use frog lube on it religiously. It also came with factory night sights. So they are on very well. Let me know what you guys think!

This ammo is safe to shoot in ANY all steel 357 revolver - this includes J frames. This ammo is no harder on your gun than any other normal 357 ammo. Please don't phone us and ask if this ammo is safe in your gun. It is, providing your gun is in safe condition for use with any normal 357 ammo.

We don't recommend this ammo to be fired in super light alloy revolvers as bullets may jump crimp under recoil, but the ammo itself wont hurt these super light weight revolvers. These revolvers are simply so light that the recoil is severe enough to cause crimp jump.

The below velocities are offered so that you can see what guns/barrel lengths give what velocities with this new 357 mag. ammo. You'll notice that new S&W revolvers with short barrels are often shooting faster than older S&W revolvers with longer barrels. The new S&W revolvers are very good and are made with equipment that makes them more consistent and faster than the S&W revolvers of yesteryear.

It shoots like a dream and has been kept in excellent condition. I have replaced the O-Ring with a Remington brand rubber one and the follower – the O-ring on the first year models were steal, and I thought a bright orange follower was a nice safety upgrade. I still have the original follower and the original steal O-ring which will be included with the sale if you would like to return this firearm to 100% original configuration.

This particular model has a 28"" barrel, will hold 4 2.75"" shells (5 with one in chamber).This is a Remington 1100 and will accept all modern Remington 1100 parts if you wish to upgrade. Newer ribbed barrels, stock options, the whole nine yards. I don't know why anyone would want to change such a nice looking gun, but there have been no major design changes for the life of this model.

I am new to armslist but familiar with craigslist and ebay scams. I am real and the gun as advertised can be viewed at my non gun related business. I have multiple employees, closed circuit surveillance, and wish to transact with real gun owners and buyers. Do not contact me about meeting half way. Do not contact me if you are an out of state resident. If you want to buy a nice gun show me that you are real. The term real means that you can provide valid NH ID as well as CCW Permit. The responses in the last 12 hrs have been ridiculous. The process is simple, leave me your number in an email. I will call you back if you are interested in my gun. I reserve the right to go to a local gun shop to do a transfer at my expense if I am not comfortable with who you are to complete the deal.

To clarify:
I do not meet half way
I do not sell to people that cant verify residence or permit
Its like selling an item on ebay or craigslist, come to me I have the item. If you cant figure that out find a gun that is more local to your area"

The pistol comes with all of the original parts and can be returned to stock if desired. Pistol has:

Night Sights
Ghost Rocket 3.5# trigger connector tuned for a short trigger reset and lighter pull
Competition Spring kit (stock springs currently installed for reliability)
3 10 round magazines with pearce grip extensions for a full grip
1 glock factory extension that increases mag capacity to 12 rounds
Wolff magazine springs (stronger than stock)
Hogue Handall trimmed to fit the short grip and not impede magazine release/ loading
DPMS 3 spring recoil system
Extended magazine release
Extended slide release

With these upgrades this pistol is very easy to shoot quickly and accurately yet maintains 100% reliability.  With the competition striker spring you may get light primer strikes.

Prefer to meet face to face. Transfer is at my discretion. 

I am new to armslist but familiar with craigslist and ebay scams. I am real and the gun as advertised can be viewed at my non gun related business. I have multiple employees, closed circuit surveillance, and wish to transact with real gun owners and buyers. Do not contact me about meeting half way. Do not contact me if you are an out of state resident. If you want to buy a nice gun show me that you are real. The term real means that you can provide valid NH ID as well as CCW Permit. The responses in the last 12 hrs have been ridiculous. The process is simple, leave me your number in an email. I will call you back if you are interested in my gun. I reserve the right to go to a local gun shop to do a transfer at my expense if I am not comfortable with who you are to complete the deal.

To clarify:
I do not meet half way
I do not sell to people that cant verify residence or permit
Its like selling an item on ebay or craigslist, come to me I have the item. If you cant figure that out find a gun that is more local to your area"

I have had 5 Mosins, this is the best looking of the 5. I will include the bayonet(still wrapped in paper) and the leather pouches. It is a 1939 with the hammer and sickle stamp, definitely Russian, it was made before the war.   The ""tooling"" is better all over, the lines are smooth without the ugly tool marks that the guns made in the mid 1940's (wartime) seem to have. They produced these rifles faster and in bulk in the early and mid 1940's and they didn't turn out as nice. The exterior of this barrel is smooth, no ugly ridges (tool marks)...like many of them have. Receiver(and all the metal) is prettier than the average Mosin.  Wood is good, not perfect but good and certainly not a disappointment in any way...very deep reddish in color.  The numbers do not seem to match on the metal. Some of the numbers look weird and it is hard to tell,  but they don't look like they match.
The rifle works perfectly in every way, zero problems.  Dead-on accurate. Bolt action is smooth, smoother than normal in my opinion...it must have been polished or something...it moves better than any I've had in the past...no hangups, no stickiness at all.  I need a little extra Christmas money, that's why I am selling it.  I considered doing a partial trade, but really just need the money. I WILL CONSIDER ANY TRADE OFFER, if I like your trade better than my Mosin, it's a done deal...but I sure won't turn down the cash."

I am new to armslist but familiar with craigslist and ebay scams. I am real and the gun as advertised can be viewed at my non gun related business. I have multiple employees, closed circuit surveillance, and wish to transact with real gun owners and buyers. Do not contact me about meeting half way. Do not contact me if you are an out of state resident. If you want to buy a nice gun show me that you are real. The term real means that you can provide valid NH ID as well as CCW Permit. The responses in the last 12 hrs have been ridiculous. The process is simple, leave me your number in an email. I will call you back if you are interested in my gun. I reserve the right to go to a local gun shop to do a transfer at my expense if I am not comfortable with who you are to complete the deal.

To clarify:
I do not meet half way
I do not sell to people that cant verify residence or permit

It is a Springfield receiver and by no means matching. It does have an old import mark on the muzzle end of the barrel. It does fire fine....cycles and ejects fine. If I had to guess I would say it was an old ""rack grade"". The stock is a newer Boyds American Walnut. The barrel is starting to get tired...but still shoots fairly well. I can honestly say I would have no problems keeping it...but pistols interest me more. That being said, I would be interested in a trade for a good semi auto handgun for target shooting.... Either way no compacts or sub-compacts..I just prefer large frame pistols. Ideally I would really like the get a Witness Match in 9mm again....but open to others....even if your pistol is worth less than mine I would consider a couple of firearms...one pistol one rifle etc or a pistol plus cash.

It is a Springfield receiver and by no means matching. It does have an old import mark on the muzzle end of the barrel. It does fire fine....cycles and ejects fine. If I had to guess I would say it was an old ""rack grade"". The stock is a newer Boyds American Walnut. The barrel is starting to get tired...but still shoots fairly well. I can honestly say I would have no problems keeping it...but pistols interest me more. That being said, I would be interested in a trade for a good semi auto handgun for target shooting.... Either way no compacts or sub-compacts..I just prefer large frame pistols. Ideally I would really like the get a Witness Match in 9mm again....but open to others....even if your pistol is worth less than mine I would consider a couple of firearms...one pistol one rifle etc or a pistol plus cash.  I do have a soft spot for old Stevens .22 rifles lol.  Run it by me you never know. 

I do have a few clips to include with the M1 as well....."

It is marked as a factory test fire (from the Kahr website: Q. What does the ""U"" on the trigger guard of my pistol mean? A. If there is a ""U"" engraved on the trigger guard of your pistol, it is a factory refurbished and test fired model (often sold as a ""test fired"" gun). From what I understand, Kahr pulls some assembled pistols off the assembly line, fires them and marks them as a factory test fire. The advantage is the break in process is already started and you get a new condition pistol at a discounted price. 

It is in the factory box just like you would get a new one. There are no scratches or any marks on the pistol other than the barrel hood which indicates it has been fired at the factory.

Has a free float quad rail covering nearly the whole barrel, a MagPul AFG2, and currently has some Cobra Tactical angled BUIS (If you don't want, we can take them off - just hadn't figure out an optic yet). There is a single point hookup set up for lefty, but will easily mount to the other side.

Everything on this gun as been KG GunKoted. The bolt carrier is, the dust cover, everything. The body and most of the weapon are flat OD Green, with FDE on all of the small bits. Makes them easier to find in the dark and looks very nice (I think). I didn't put a flash hider on it yet, but I will GunKote one for it before you pick it up. 

I'm looking for $1,200 - and I'll consider reasonable offers. This is not a NFA firearm, but those rules do apply if you remove the upper. I can include a few GunKoted and matching Brownell's Aluminum mags, or I have brand new PMAGs... including a few of the 40 rounders. So - make an offer."

If you want a long range shooter without the recoil then this is it. It is extremely accurate. It is heavy but holds steady. The barrel is one inch in diameter at the muzzle and about twenty six inches long. The action is a Mauser 98. I am not sure of the round count. All I know is from the one time I took it out and shot it at a four inch disc at two hundred yards. It was so easy it wasn't fun. The scope is not a leupold. I don't know what it is. The optics are good but I wouldn't value it over a hundred dollars just because it is of unknown origin. The scope mounts are very nice quick release mounts. It comes with reloading dies and braoss. Call or text me any time day or night at REDACTED. If you can't legally purchase or own a firearm or you are not an Oregon resident then you know I can't sell it to you. Thanks

To be clear, I am not sure I am going to sell this one. I am trying to build up some cash to finance a project but this is a nice shooting gun that I really like. Anyway, I am posting to see what kind of interest is out here and if the deal is right, I may let her go.

Details:
Ruger SR1911 Full Size, .45 ACP
Bought new in 2013
Estimated 400 rounds fired with zero malfunctions (target ammo & hollow point)
I still have the box and all original packaging
2 Mags, one is a flush fit (7 rounds I think) and the other is an 8 round mag

I noticed that I have lost a grip screw but I am trying to find one to install back into it.  Simple fix. Worst case scenario is ordering a set of 4 from Ruger for $3.00.

So that is about it -- if I sell, the buyer would have to either:
1. Have concealed carry permit & be willing to sign a bill of sale
or
2. Have a handgun purchase permit (that I will keep), matching ID, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

Thank you for the consideration."

These pieces are lightweight and easily packed to a minimum volume, so they can be carried among the variety of other mission essential gear, and they provide the warmth you need to lie in wait for extended periods of time.
Designed to provide maximum comfort in extreme cold weather, the High Loft Jacket - USMC 1.0 (Happy Jacket) is a superior outer layer. The jacket is cut large to fit over several layers of clothing and body armor. The shell material is a carefully selected, tested microfiber that is impregnated with a thin layer of silicone. This material is lightweight, windproof, highly water resistant, and breathable. The added silicone also enhances abrasion resistance.
The jacket is designed to enhance comfort and performance in extreme cold conditions, eliminating all unnecessary features. Insulated with PrimaLoft® Sport synthetic insulation, the jacket is lightweight, compressible and keeps the wearer warm even when wet. We put 6 oz PrimaLoft® in the body and 2 oz in the hood to insure comfort even in the coldest conditions. The sleeves feature 330 denier Cordura nylon reinforcement panels just where you need them. The hood and waist openings are elasticized with barrel lock closures, making gloved adjustment a snap. We put two internal mesh pockets into the jacket for storage, and they are large enough for users to dry out socks or gloves while wearing the jacket. Wrist openings are elasticized with hook and loop adjustable closures"

A solid, safe, accurate and reliable pistol by anyone's standards. Included with the sale I have a very good right-handed G-CODE kydex paddle holster, and 6 mags. 2 of the mags are the standard 15 round Beretta, and 4 are the all metal ""GUO"" 15 round mags made by Checkmate.
I don't play the ""I've only shot 100 rounds through this and it was always kept in the safe"" game. I'll carry this gun when I go hiking with the dogs (reliable and quick to operate, but too heavy for my style of daily carry). I've shot this gun a lot but most certainly <1000 rounds, and I have practiced a lot of draws from the kydex and a leather holster. This is where the only ""flaw"" would come from, it has normal (but not a lot) holster wear at the barrel end of the slide and frame. There is normal wear on the barrel as well. 
I put a new recoil spring in before a TDY to the Blackwater Academy a few years ago and has roughly 300+ rounds on it. Other than that there has been absolutely no need for anything else to be done to this piece... Other than meticulously maintained.
Thanks for looking and I hope to find someone interested. I am mainly looking for cash to go towards a Sig, so if you have a Sig in the P-series I may be interested in trading. Cheers!"

I tried counting the ammo last night but got a little distracted while counting the loose stuff. It's close to 400 rounds, maybe a little more or less by 20 or so. The gun is in very good shape for what it is. I don't think I've ever shot this particular one but I might have. I'm sure it was shot before I bought it though.

It introduces new improvements to form, fit and function, while maintaining the integrity and reputation of its predecessor, the world famous 92FS. Although the 90-Two offers more individualized performance, the operating controls are identical to those of the 92FS/M9/M9A1, making it completely familiar to those already trained in the use of the older pistols. Many of the internal components, as well as the magazines, are completely interchangeable with those of the previous generation 92 series. Here are the new features: 


	A. Slide Serrations: Increased surface area
for better grip during slide retraction.
B. Updated Styling: Beretta once again partnered with the world-famous Giugiaro Design industrial design firm to enhance the appeal and ergonomics of the 90-Two.
C. Weight Reduction: The skeletonized
frame of the 90-Two grip design has resulted
in a lighter pistol.
D. Removable Front Sight: Allows user to
replace existing sights with accessory sight
systems or replace damaged sight.
E. Internal Recoil Buffer: Increases service
life by reducing stress on the receiver created
by the more powerful .40 S&W ammunition.
F. Individual Size Grips: Single-piece, wraparound,
technopolymer grip is user replaceable
with an optional smaller grip. Allows
user to select most comfortable size, while
reducing the part count by thirteen.
G. Magazine Capacity: Increased to hold
up to 17 rounds in 9mm and 12 rounds in
.40 S&W. Magazines from standard 92 series
models are completely interchangeable with
those of the 90-Two
H. Caliber Availability: The 90-Two is available
in both the 9mm and the .40 S&W.
I. Accessory Rail: The frame of the 90-Two
has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid
attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming
devices. Includes removable rail cover.
