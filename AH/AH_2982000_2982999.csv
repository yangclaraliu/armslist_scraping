I will replace or take off the scope with a different optic  for $1100. The barrel was re-threaded to accept a standard Flash hider and a Knights Armament (KAC) flash hider has been installed. The light is an Insight Technology light and has the wired remote pad for on and off. The RAT WORX trigger changed the trigger pull from what feels like a longer double action heavy pull to a crisp 4.5 lb pull much like a standard AR. The Short Dot is exceptional in clarity for CQB or long distance and has a light up reticle. Because of the Bull Pup stock this guns overall length is about an inch shorter than most AR Pistols. It is very accurate and a good shooting gun. Call or text REDACTED for quickest reply.

It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is about twice as wide, and substantially heavier than the typical .25 automatic pistol, though its relatively compact size and powerful cartridge made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun. The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That’s why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

It has around 19,xxx original miles. It runs and drives good and is very reliable. I have never had any issues with it not starting or breaking down on me. It is a salvage title the previous owner said it was in a shop fire but he had a list of parts he replaced I can send. The tires are at about 60% tread left. It does include a backrest for the rear passenger also. It has been straight piped and the old mufflers cut off. The spark plugs have all been replaced. It comes with a clear windshield also. There is a wiring issue, the turn signals act as running lights in the front and only one side stays on and when you turn on the signals they flash fast. I have looked and cannot figure out what is wrong but I am not a wiring person. Have tried replacing bulbs to and that didn't work. Along with the turn signal wire problem the front and rear turn signals on the left side are being held on by tape the rear just needs a screw replaced the front the housing is broke so it will need replaced if you don't want tape holding it. Also at the end of riding season last year the speedometer cable broke so It does have probably about 100-200 more miles on it then the odometer says. Other than those couple minor things wrong with it, it is a great bike especially for its age. I have had the bike repainted from the old paint that was cracked from the fire to black, the motor and all that has been painted black as well, and I have put green LED underlights on the bottom of the tank and hooked up a switch to turn them off and and on manually. Serious buyers only and no joy rides unless you have a motorcycle liscense. I am a little negotiable on the price but I know what I have in the bike and I dont have to sell it. If you are interested you can email me on here or text me at 7six5seven2nine0eight8six. Calls are welcome to but I may not be able to answer right away so just leave a message and I will get back with you as soon as I can. I can send more pics also."

This thing is sweet. In general 10.5"" barrels are tricky to find, and this is a very nice barrel to boot. Overall build is great, I picked up the stripped upper receiver from a gentleman who took it to someone to get the barrel removed, and they bent it slightly near the front end of the magazine well. Pistol functions fine, as the tracks the BCG sits on are unaffected.

I'm looking to get $900, comparing it to other ar pistol prices i've seen, also considering what this has in the build this is a reasonable price.

Very little kick, awesome to shoot. Wish I could keep and not in a hurry to sell, but would prefer to have cash to work on other projects.

This thing is sweet. In general 10.5"" barrels are tricky to find, and this is a very nice barrel to boot. Overall build is great, I picked up the stripped upper receiver from a gentleman who took it to someone to get the barrel removed, and they bent it slightly near the front end of the magazine well. Pistol functions fine, as the tracks the BCG sits on are unaffected.

I'm looking to get $1250, comparing it to other ar pistol prices i've seen, also considering what this has in the build.

Very little kick, awesome to shoot. Wish I could keep and not in a hurry to sell, but would prefer to have cash to work on other projects.

Featured in many popular movies such as the Terminator, Bad Boys, Jurassic Park, The Matrix, and many more!  This is a real Spas 12, one of only 1800 that made its way into the United States.

I want to first say that my price is ABSOLUTELY FIRM!!  I will not take a dollar less.  If you ask me if I'll take a lower cash offer.....your email will be ignored and deleted.  Also, this gun is for local pick-up only.  Which means I will not meet you half way, or drive the gun to you.  Must be picked up at, or near my location.  No shipping.

Okay, now that I have discussed my terms, lets talk about the shotgun.  The story behind this particular gun is it belonged to an ex-swat team unit, and was mounted in a trunk of a squad car.  Not sure how true the story is, but the gun shows signs of improper storage.  Very well could have been stored in a trunk.

The gun has some light rust forming and some pitting on the surface of the barrel and stock on one side.  The other side of the gun is in great shape.  Also, the receiver has some wear marks from where it was mounted in the trunk.  Overall, the shotgun is in good mechanical shape.  The only thing wrong with this gun is the cosmetic appearance.  This is why my price is so low.  It needs to be restored/refinished to look 100% again.  If you don't mind the way it looks, you can enjoy it as is.

Mechanically the gun is solid.  The receiver shock absorber/recoil buffer is in great shape!  Looks new.  The receiver itself looks like it has had very little use.  Gun does switch from pump action to semi-auto as it should.  I bought this gun with intentions of restoring and keeping.  But plans have changed.  Other things of importance.  Gun shoots 2 3/4inch shells only.  Includes a hard plastic case.  This Spas 12 comes with the rare and sought after ""hook"" and folding metal stock.  It also has the extended tube (8+1), and rear ghost ring sight.  I got quoted $300-$400 for a professional gunsmith to restore this gun to perfect looking condition.  I'm asking 900 FIRM!  You WILL NOT find a cheaper SPAS 12 on the market.   Gun is considered a regular long gun.  No special permits are needed to own or buy this shotgun.  Please email me for any questions and for actual pictures.  Serious buyers only reply.  NO SPAM, NO TRADES, CASH ONLY.   $900 CASH   FIRM FIRM FIRM Thanks"

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

I have examined quite a few of these models posing as a buyer, and let me tell you that many of these weapons--if not most--are WORN OUT! Many have defects, non-original parts, and even jerry-rigged parts intended to make the rifle fire for a short while more. They fire ""keyholes"" into the targets (a potentially, EXTREMELY dangerous condition that means that the barrel rifling is worn, pitted or just plain unusable). Many of these models jam, do not feed properly, have extremely worn or loose parts, or are just plain junk. I lowered the price on this rifle for one reason only; I need the money. But let me assure you that I am still quite concerned that this model goes to a ""good family.""

REDACTED

As far as its' condition goes, I have not seen many models in the same, near perfect condition, listed at anything even close to this price. I have seen complete rebuilds go for $700 - $1200, and these were NOT weapons that were comprised of all original parts. They were rebuilds.

This unit was purchased by my great-grandfather, brand new. It passed down to my grandfather, and upon his death in 2000, it was inherited by my father. This is a four-generation masterpiece. In fact, the only part on this weapon that is not from the original unit is the butt plate. While birding in Washington state (where this unit was originally purchased), my grandfather dropped the rifle into the bed of his pickup, slightly cracking the butt plate. As my great-grandfather before him, my grandfather (my dad and me, too, while being honest) was a perfectionist. He immediately ordered a stock butt plate, which amazingly enough was still available, and installed it on the day it arrived. That was decades ago. So, while this model is all original, the butt plate is the only part that has been repaired, replaced or altered in any way.

Any collector will want to pick up this item to add to his or her collection. This Remington Model 12-A pump-action, breakdown rifle (a single thumbscrew separates the rifle into two, easily cleanable parts) is priced unbelievably low for a model that is in such excellent condition AND IS COMPLETELY ORIGINAL. This rifle has been extremely well maintained over the years. Mechanically, it is in perfect condition and works much better than you would expect, given its age. If there is ANY flaw with this weapon, it is that it would look brand new with a little more bluing however, any true collector knows that re-bluing such a fine rifle would lower the value tremendously. It is the excellent, original condition that truly matters.

It shoots straight and true--with an aperture (peep) sight--leaves no keyholes in the targets (meaning that the barrel is in good shape--and this proves to be true when using a bore scope--there is no wear, pitting or rust to be seen in this original barrel; it is in perfect condition). and the pump action works smoothly, perfectly, and feeds rounds as fast as you are able to operate the mechanism. In short, if this weapon was not almost 100 years old, you would mistake it for a brand new weapon, and one that has been well cared for even in that short time. If anyone who is interested in this rifle lives reasonably close to me, then you really should have a look at it. You will see that everything that I have said about this weapon not only is true, but it actually might even be in better condition than you are expecting, again given its' age. Trust me, a bargain such as this only comes along once in a great while, and this one will not last long at this price.

I have had a tremendous number of enquiries about this weapon, but I want to sell this weapon to a true collector--not someone who will destroy it with neglect. Many potential buyers with whom I have spoken did not even have a cleaning kit! Even though I am relinquishing this weapon to a new owner, I would prefer that it goes to a home where it will be well-cared for. If this is you, please contact me soon."

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr’s CW series (3.6″ barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3″ barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0″ barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0″. The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr’s PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

DESIGNED FOR SHOOTING
A400 Xplor is the result of the hard work of designers passionate about hunting, always in search of the optimal balance between innovation and tradition. But that’s not all: with the A400 the design and research also meet functionality, with simple and original solutions thought for the hunter. Perfect mix of walnut and polymer to maximize performance From the fore-end insert to the trigger guard and over to the kick-off interface, each polymer component of the A400 Xplor has been conceived to optimize form, weight and functionality. Green receiver: a true cosmetic alternative respectful of even the most classic tastes. The finishing of the A400 Xplor Unico’s receiver is an absolute innovation in the world of hunting shotguns and represents the union between the protective characteristics of anodizing and the exclusive green color that renders the a4 and the exclusive green color that renders the A400 Xplor truly “Unico”, a green technological beast.

SIG SAUER P239 40SW SLITE

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

The gun is in excellent condition, 98+%, less than 300 rounds fired, without carry wear, original box and contents included. Standard sights. The pistol came with 2 magazines, 1 flush/flat based which I have converted to the extended grip type, so both 12 rounders are extended grip magazines. No issues with the limited range time, never jammed on me. It's a fine pistol without issues, it is simply not what I prefer as a carry item. It is a pistol in mint condition, without issues, that hasn't even been broken in yet, along with a good starting supply of ammunition. In this day and age, one MUST CYA, and so a transfer through an FFL dealer I will require."
