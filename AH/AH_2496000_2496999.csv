I'm sure I'm missing stuff on the list.  This isn't your average ar pistol setup.  It's not eBay parts thrown together.  This pistol is custom built, and just feeling it in your hands makes all the difference. PICTURES DO NOT DO IT JUSTICE.  It's ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.  EVERYTHING on this pistol is brand new, and the gun is unfired.  Absolutely flawless condition.  This is a keeper, and I've spent countless hours building this pistol and it has been fun every step of the way.  The first person to see this gun in person will buy or trade for it, I guarantee that.

DISCLAIMER**  this pistol was built as a pistol, sold as a pistol and intended to be used as a pistol.

Notice the image of the missing piece on the side below the scope's eye piece on the back left.  Used to have a small, square bracket for something.  Don't know what it was for as I always used the scope, so it was removed long ago.  It may have been for an iron sight along side the scope, instead of underneath it.

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.

Pistol has a very nice feel. Well balanced, and has a very thin profile. Excellent alternative to a 1911 and another fine example of the great John Browning's quest for excellence.
Comes with 3 mags. 2- 10 round mags and one 15 round mag. At the time these were produced 10 cap was in place. I searched high and low and found the FACTORY Browning 15 round to go with this pistol. $600 firm is the $ I'm looking to get out of this gun and worth every penny. It is in EXCELLENT condition with very little use. Will come with aprox 200 +or- rounds of lead nose that I loaded.

A Highly Customized Knights Armament SR-25 ER suppressed rifle package. The heart of this package is a KAC SR-25 ER (Enhanced Rifle) chambered in 7.62x51mm NATO (will accept .308 Win). The ER model is based on the AR-10 style operating system and is the basis to the Army's M110 sniper rifle. The SR-25 features a 20 inch long, match-grade barrel finished with a target crown for optimal accuracy. Integrated into this rifle's gas block is the suppressor adapter for Knight's barrel overlap suppressor. The URX free floating rail system with integral front sight helps ensure this rifle delivers consistent groups, while the tuned bolt ang gas system allow for reliable operation with remarkably low recoil. 

While this rifle is a force to be reckoned with in it's factory configuration, we decided to transform it into the ultimate long range semi auto rifle. To increase the portability and versatility of this package as well as make it easily operated by shooters of all sizes, we upgraded to a carbine buffer tube with .308 tuned recoil spring and heavy weight buffer. To enhance the shooters control on the rifle in all weather conditions we installed a Magpul MIAD pistol grip, VLTOR EMOD rifle stock and Magpul ladder rail covers. While the factory 2-stage trigger worked well, it did not satisfy our demand for the best, and was replaced with a Geissele Hi-Speed National Match trigger mated with a Battle Arms Development BAD-ASS ambidextrous selector. To add stability for long range shooting a Harris LM-S 9-13"" Bipod with Integral Larue Tactical LT-706 base was added. Because we wanted to give this rifle the best ""Tactical"" scope available we added a Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x50mm with NP-R2 reticle mated to the rifle with a Larue Tactical LT-158 Quick-Disconnect Scope Base. In addition to this amazing parts list this rifle package also includes a KAC barrel-overlap suppressor. Knights designed this suppressor to handle the toughest combat conditions, and it's enlarged internal volume make it the quietest 7.62mm suppressor that you will ever hear."

First is a 12 bore double and I believe it has chromed bores.  Condition is very good to excellent, (I don't believe I have 20 rounds through it).  I will throw in the boxes of over powder cards, lubed fiber wads and overshot cards.  I would entertain $500.00

Second is a 50 cal. Kodiak double rifle.  Condition is same as above.  My only ""problem"" with this rifle, if such it can be called, is that I have been shooting real double rifles for about 20 years and Pedersoli, in an effort to circumvent the high cost of regulating the barrels to one rear sight, saw fit to install two rear sights.  One is sighted for the right barrel and the other for the left barrel.  A system that works admirably.....but I can't get my head wrapped around it.  It is exceedingly accurate with a patched round ball and if you sight according to Pedersoli the composite groups are impressive.  $500.00 for it also.

The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. The exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that's barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it's time for action, the revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load.

SMA prospered with this relationship and continued to expand, eventually entering limited sales to civilians.



In the mid 1990's Department of Defense contracts began to shrink dramatically due to funding decreases and private, civilian sales began to dominate the majority of our business. We have been fortunate to evaluate many types of foreign and domestic high performance ammunition from .22lr incendiary through .50cal Mk211 Mod 0 HEAPI, (High Explosive Armor Piercing Incendiary) as well as foreign military ammunition.



SMA has had the opportunity to establish invaluable relationships with people on the leading edge of advanced ammunition technology and development. We will gladly share information and experiences with our customers to ensure that all expectations are met and common pitfalls are avoided.



We currently offer new loaded apecialty ammunition, recovered reloading components and brass processing for 5.56 and 7.62 NATO as well as loaded ammunition - both civilian and military.

The smallest dot Trijicon offers in this model is 7 MOA, that means it covers 7 inches at 100 yards, 14 inches at 200yds, 21 inches at 300, etc...  You put the triangle at the top of center mass and you have a ""kill shot"" from 0-300yds.

Description:

The FNX™ service pistol was introduced in 2009 and incorporates many of the ergonomic improvements initially developed under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program for the FNP™-45 USG. The FNX™ is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol optimized for the 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel, and the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

It is the softest shooting 12 GA shotgun I have ever had the pleasure of shooting.  I shot it a couple times, and now it just sits in the closet.  Perfect condition, and includes original case, chokes, documentation, etc.  See link below for more information.  Asking $1,750.  Please call Dustin at REDACTED if interested.  Thanks for looking.

 Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

 Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.
Includes:
 SSAR-15 OGR Stock
 Interface Block, Nut Retainer.
 Hex Key.
 Mounting Hardware.
 Instructions (found on the product packaging).

Fitment:
 Only compatible with AR-15's with a collapsible stock (add the conversion kit if you have a fixed stock AR-15).

 Compatible with Mil-Spec and Commercial Buffer Tubes.

 Not compatible with .22LR AR-15's without a .22LR upgrade kit.

 Some Sling Plates may not be compatible.

 Some of the aftermarket ""billet"" receivers have non-standard dimensions and therefore may not be compatible."

Please don't waste my time offering a glock even up trade for my gun.  If you can get one of these for $500, please dont waste my time.



Please don't offer me your gun or guns at retail and try to get mine at wholesale.  Silly that I have to say this but there are some real kooks shopping on here.



Asking $1050 .........cash offers get best pricing.......if you want to trade at gun broker prices, then your trade will have to be at gun broker prices too



The trades I am looking for are one pistol (preferably Glock Gen 4 but open) and cash or two guns (non hunting, non antique, quality gun)

If one is a Glock, I'm open with the second gun.

Definitely prefer two glocks though or two semi autos I might add cash or ammo for right deal if necessary if it gets me two nice semi autos
