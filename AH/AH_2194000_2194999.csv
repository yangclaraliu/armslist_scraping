 The Factory Specifications are as follows: 

 Item #: P3AT

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

hi i have a set of colt single action 22's, consecutive serial numbered anniversay set.
one is 22 LR, the other 22 WMR (magnum)

all original and used a little bit.  guns are tight, could use some polishing. i think the set is worth $1500 in ""as-is""condition, and closer to $1800 polished up.  realistically im looking for $1300 or best offer.  partial trades are considered, only for glock 19, chinese AK variants, other AK variants ok but nothing destroyed by century arms.  i can use a ""punisher"" AR lower, and thats about it. im selling to fund for some guns that i will shoot. these have been in the family since new, but i just dont shoot them. im not really a collector either

FS: Glock 36 LNIB Stock Sights 4 magazines

I have a Glock 36 LNIB Stock Sights 4 magazines. I am looking to sell it only (need cash for another purchase). 

The pistol comes with the box, lock, cleaning tools, manual (manual hasn't even been opened), etc. The only thing it doesn't have is the crappy Glock magazine loader. Please review the pictures carefully. 

The pistol has had only 12 rounds shot through it. I have been told by one person the pistol appear to be green in color. The pistol is in fact, black in color. 

My price is $450 FIRM for the pistol as pictured with two magazines. 

If you want all four magazines with the pistol, I would take $500 FIRM. 

Regardless of which magazine option you choose, I will include 50 rounds of FMJ ammo. If you buy all of the gear I will also include 25 rounds of HP/FMJ ammo that is currently loaded in the magazines.

This item is located in Winston-Salem. I am willing to drive halfway to help facilitate the transaction but not more than a hour. 

All laws will be followed. I will require you to sign a bill of sale and identify yourself with NCDL. CHP or PPP required as well.

Other info: This rifle is C&R. The Cooey Mod. 60 is a bolt action repeater that appeared in 1939–1940, capable of firing .22 short, long and long rifle. The Mod. 60 has a tubular magazine, capable of holding 11 to 15 rounds depending on the type of cartridges. It was manufactured in H.W. Cooey Machine & Arms Company in Coburg, Ontario, Canada; and was also known as the Ranger.

This was/is a project gun I purchased, that was not operable at the time. I cleaned it thoroughly, replaced the sear/trigger mechanism, put in a trigger return spring (missing before), and extractor. The rifle fires fine, just does not load/extract rounds 100% correctly, it's all in the technique. UPDATE: I was messing with it some more yesterday and learned if the bolt is deliberately pulled back like you mean it (nothing crazy hard), then the rounds reliably (for the most part) slide nicely up into the extractor and nicely eject the previous round. At this time it is missing the rear rifle step sight, I will seek a replacement from an old Daisy soon. Traded As-Is.

 I'm very open to offers but Im primarily interested in a Kahr CM9 or CW9, Ruger LC9 or a Beretta Nano and Id also consider a Kel Tec PF9, a Taurus Millennium, or a Ruger SR9c or SR40c.  I'd consider just about any small small semi auto in 9mm, .380, or .40, but I'd also consider snub nosed revolvers in .38 special or .357.

These are Cammenga's new Easy loading magazines for AR 15 rifles. Manufactured in the US using steel instead of aluminum. Installed with anti tilt followers. The leading edge slides completely out of the way so you can load all 30 rounds from the front. When full simply slide the leading edge back to the top of the magazine and your are ready to go. I will install photos for this ad, but I highly suggest you check out the manufacturers video at the link below. They bury it in sand several times, pound it with a sledge hammer along with an aluminum magazine (the aluminum mag gets destroyed). They shoot both kinds with a shotgun (Aluminum destoyed after one shot) Easymag takes several and still functions, they even drag it behind an ATV. All tests and the Easymag still functions perfectly.
