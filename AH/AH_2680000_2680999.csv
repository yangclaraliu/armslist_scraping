Since the rifle has been fired I cannot call this new, but it has literally only had 20 rounds (1 box of ammo) through it. It is in excellent condition. I have considered the market we are in as well as the tough times with finances everywhere so that is the reason I have opened with the price. If you shop this rifle; you will see prices from $850 to $1200. The rifle came with a 20 round magazine, but there are 5 more mags included in this offer. Please no trades (I will not reply to trade offers sorry) as the funds will go toward the AR build. I have enclosed a link below with a few extra shots. FOID needed to be considered. I will only ship to an FFL (that is if you need the rifle shipped). Thanks so much for looking.

I am also selling with it my minoutaur IWB holster. It is specifically made for the Shield and was $90 new.  I am wanting $450 for the handgun and the holster combined. Not really to keen on separating the two as the holster will not do me much good if the hand gun is sold. Would be willing to trade for a Kahr PM series or Springfield  XDs. The gun comes with two magazines, one for a flush handgrip and one that makes the grip full sized. Still have the original box, and all.

Here is a description of the P1 from SolarForce-
The body of P1 consists of precisely CNC-ed aluminum alloy in HAIII finish, which is covered by a layer of GFRP (an extremely strong, lightweight, chemical-resistant and durable substance), providing users with a comfortable and heat-isolating grip. The ventilating design of the GFRP ensure good heat dissipation and effectively prevents overheating of the LED module. Flame retardant is added to the GFRP of P1 to make the product more safe. The versatile, light-weight and compact design makes P1 a very good outdoor companion to professional users."

SALES ON 300 BLACKOUT BRASS mixed headstamp lots $135/1000 
7mm mag and 300wsm brass $70/100 limited supply


I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

Rack a round and she barks until she's empty. The fit and finish are great. The fit is better than many of the much higher priced 1911s that I own. The finish is getting a bit thin on the edges but nothing bad. My only complaint about this pistol is that it does hit low.

If you have more mags I'll buy them at 15$ a pop and ammo for 20 cents a round.

These NEW run 559$ from Slickdeals,Aim surplus and PSA.
I refuse to pay these ""LNIB"" BS prices people are putting up.

Has to be chrome lined.
Trunnions HAVE to be straight.
Has to have non canted sights,Tight mag lock up a little wobble is fine.
The bolt wear on the hammer needs to be straight,Not diagonal.
Gas tube can have slight cant.


Looking for overall straightness of the rifle if you couldn't tell already.
AK's are BUILT not ASSEMBLED like AR soccer mom assembly lines it takes a craftsmen to BUILD an AK correctly and I know what to look for.

Prefer WASR's with laser etching on the receiver,Means it was made by I.O/century post 2010 if it looks like a toddler scribbled it on your AK you most likely have a rifle put together by a moron.

Sick of morons on here selling what they think is a quality rifle for RIDICULOUS prices.

HOORAY - 53-46 vote - The US Senate just barely succeeded in gaining a majority of the votes against the UN resolution which as aimed at the 2nd Amendment to the US Constitution!

Now, which 46 Senators voted to help destroy us? Well, let their names become well known!! 

See below. If you vote in one of the states listed with these 46 “traitors,” then vote against them!

By a 53-46 vote, the Senate narrowly passed a measure that will stop the United States from entering into the UN Arms Trade Treaty.  The Statement of Purpose from the Senate Bill reads: ""To uphold Second Amendment rights and prevent the United States from entering into the UN Arms Trade Treaty.""  

The UN Small Arms Treaty, which has been championed by the Obama Administration, would have effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms.  The ban would have affected all private gun owners in the US and had language that would have implemented an international gun registry, now get this, on all private guns and ammo.

Astonishingly, 46 out of our 100 United States Senators were willing to give away our Constitutional rights to a foreign power.

Here are the 46 senators (all Democrats) who voted to give your rights to the UN:

Baldwin (D-WI)

Bennett (D-CO)

Sell or trade for FN Five-Seven or quality AR-10. Other interesting weapon trades considered, plus or minus cash depending upon value.  Here is I for from Superwinch web site:

""What is your secret?"" - that's what everyone will be asking out on the trail. How can you pull at max power and get back on the ride so fast? The answer is your Superwinch Talon Rock 9.8. With 9,800lbs of pulling power on 50' of rope, you'll be pulling in the ""Power Zone"" - the first two layers on the drum. Higher layers rob your winch of power - with the Rock 9.8 you won't need to spool out extra rope to get at it.
9,800 lbs of pulling power in a small, lightweight package! Weighs 28 lbs less with Dyneema™ synthetic rope, 4"" narrower for smaller modified competition vehicles, Free-spool knob rotates in 45° increments for custom applications, Industrial grade, over-sized, safety yellow latched hook and 3 solenoid box installation options; Offset (solenoid over motor, as shipped), Centerline (solenoid over drum, kit included) and Competition (solenoid remotely mounted, kit included). Note, mounting bolt pattern is 4 inches narrower as compared to the standard Talon (6"" x 4.5"").
Superwinch synthetic ropes are genuine AmSteel-Blue™ with Samthane™, a special coating to help resist abrasion. The raw material in AmSteel-Blue™ is made from genuine Dyneema® SK-75 HMPE fiber, ""which is the worlds strongest recovery fiber™"" made by Samson Rope Technologies.
AmSteel®-Blue is a torque-free 12-strand single braid that yields the maximum in strength-to-weight ratio and, size for size, is the same strength as steel--yet it floats. AmSteel®-Blue outlasts wire 3:1, making it an excellent wire rope replacement. It has extremely low stretch and superior flex fatigue and wear resistance. Average strength is 19,600 lbs. and minimum strength is 17,600 lbs. Elastic elongation is only 0.96% at 30% of the break strength."

   I got this Browning a few months ago to duck hunt, but that isn't going to happen. I've taken over the shooting team at my high school, so if someone has a more SKEET friendly Browning/Beretta or other high end shotgun I would work a trade. I can let my top shooter use it and maybe even win the state tournament !!! If you have 1 to trade let me know.
I'd also consider other weapons, rifles, handguns, even high end scopes, Nightforce, etc."

In my experience with people on this site I have encountered some of the rudest people.  

Now I know that we all lead busy lives.  I know that sometimes you contact people on the sight and sometimes people contact you.  And it is because you have either listed an item for sale or trade or are interested in a item for sale or trade.  But why be rude about it?  

In dealing with people here I have been told to go to hell because we were off by $10 on what each of us thought was the fair price.  I have been asked to give someone a call after I have inquired about their item.  During the call I have either been hung up on or been told that I do not know what the f I am talking about.  Now I admit I do not know everything but I do have a better then good understanding of this topic.  But when people get upset because you are trying to get info about what they have or they just flat hang up is unbelievable to me.  Then you have my favorite.   The email.  Either some one asks about your item or you about theirs and ultimately someone asks for more pics.  Or they would like a few more questions answered to determine the value of the item.  I take the time to take a few more pics and answer their questions and then that's it.  Never to be heard from again and this is after 4  - 8 email exchanges.

I personally do not understand why it is so hard to be nice.  You have posted something on the site or you are inquiring about something on the site.  Be nice, be polite, be friendly.  It isn't that hard to not waste others time."
