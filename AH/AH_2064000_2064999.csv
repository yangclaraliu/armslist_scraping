Gas tank is built into it, but it has a fuel port to allow you the option of hooking up an external can (I never needed xtra). So it frees up floorspace in the boat not having the can or fuel line to trip over. I was told Sears sold these in the 80's.

All mags are loaded with SD ammo, so 44 rounds total. Also, I have a Desantis IWB holster (Crossbreed style), a Galco IWB Kydex holster, and a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster. Lasly, I have 150 rounds of range ammo. Pictures will be uploaded next week and can be available upon request.

$490 for gun and factory accessories
$40 per extra mag 
$50 for SD ammo
$75 for range ammo 
$35 per holster 

I would consider a partial trade on either a S&W .357 snubbie, .22 pistol/revolver, OR a general purpose pump shotgun (i.e. no tactical, specialized turkey or duck set-ups, etc.).  I really prefer to sell outright.

HERE'S THE DETAILS:

I have a Top Quality Red Dot Scope mounted to a nice, strong upgraded Cantilever mount which raises the red dot sight up just enough to perfectly CO-WITNESS WITH YOUR REGULAR/FLIP UP STYLE IRON SIGHTS. If you're not familiar with Co-Witnessing- it's a sighting system that allows you to line u****I CAN USE THE RED DOT SIGHT AT NIGHT AS LONG AS MY RIFLE MOUNTED SUREFIRE° TACTICAL LIGHT IS ON AND THE LIMIT OF MY SHOOTING RANGE IS DETERMINED BY.HOW.FAR THE LIGHT SHINES, IT'S PRETTY FAR-AT LEAST 100 YARDS SO IT IS LIKE NIGHT VISION IN A WAY******p the red dot sight perfectly with your factory installed or aftermarket brand iron sights or folding style back up iron sights of any kind. However, lots of people use a red dot sight.and have no back up/secondary iron sights. That's all about personal preference and
totally up to each individual shooter.

I also have the matching 3X Magnifier that is mounted on a quick release lever-style mount and can be installed/removed in seconds on your gun with ease and allows you to reach out and hit targets at much greater distance, you can engagets up to 3 times the distance you could normally engage with just the red dot sight. The red dot sight has no magnification and is good for 100 yards or so by itself but this is to address that issue and basically turns the red dot sight into a much longer range device and makes your weapon more versatile and you'll be more than capableo of having lots of fun and  handling any kind of recreationalshooting/hunting/home defense situations and more allowing you to shoot targets with regular red dot sight up to about 100 yards or so and if you have to shoot hundreds of yards away you'll be able to so THIS PACKAGE WITH BOTH THE RED DOT SCOPE AND MAGNIFIER WILL ALLOW YOU TO SHOOT TARGETS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF RANGES AND DISTANCES UP TO 100+ YARDS WITH THE RED DOT SCOPE ALONE AND UP TO 300+ YARDS WITH THE QUICK ATTACH MAGNIFIER YOU CAN MOUNT IN SECONDS DIRECTLY BEHIND THE RED DOT SCOPE.

THIS IS A HIGH QUALITY SETUP AND NOT CHEAP AIRSOFT RIFLE JUNK, THIS SIGHT IS SHOCKPROOF, FOG PROOF, AND WATER RESISTANT AND WILL.HOLD ITS ZERO THAT YOU SET WHEN YOU FIRST MOUNT IT WITH NO ISSUES OR WORRIES. THE RED DOT SIGHT AND MAGNIFIER ARE MADE BY PRIMARY ARMS AND THIS PARTICULAR SCOPE IS IDENTICAL AND BUILT WITH ALL.OF THE QUALITY OF AN AIMPOINT SCOPE BUT IT'S NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NIGHT VISION, THIS DIDN'T MATTER TO ME AND WILL NOT TO 99% OF PEOPLE, THE NIGHT VISION TYPE GLASS.IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND I.KNEW.I WASN'T GOING TO USE IT SO I DIDN'T BUY IT. ****I CAN USE THE RED DOT SIGHT AT NIGHT AS LONG AS MY RIFLE MOUNTED SUREFIRE° TACTICAL LIGHT IS ON AND THE LIMIT OF MY SHOOTING RANGE IS DETERMINED BY.HOW.FAR THE LIGHT SHINES, IT'S PRETTY FAR-AT LEAST 100 YARDS SO IT IS LIKE NIGHT VISION IN A WAY******THIS IS AN EXCELLENT SCOPE AND I RESEARCHED IT WELL IT A 5/5 RATING ON THE WEBSITE AND WAS VERY HIGHLY REGARDED, THE MAGNIFIER WAS THE SAME WAY- IT HAD ALL 5/5 REVIEWS AND MOST PEOPLE WERE USING IT WITH EOTECH 512 SIGHTS AND AIMPOIMT STYLE SIGHTS JUST LIKE THE RED DOT SCOPE I HAVE FOR SALE IN THIS AD. I CAN PROVIDE THE LINK FOR YOU TO CHECK FOR YOURSELF AND SEE THIS IS NO CHEAP CLONE AND YOU CAN READ HUNDREDS OF REVIEWS PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN PRAISING THE SIGHTAND MAGNIFIER GIVING THEM BOTH 5/5 STARS. THEY ARE ALL 5 STAR REVIEWS EXCEPT FOR ONE 4.5/5 DUE TO A SHIPPING ERROR THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SIGHT OR MAGNIFIER. EMAIL ME FOR LINK IF INTERESTED.

THIS IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED, THE RED DOT SCOPE WITH BRAND NEW BATTERY INSTALLED FOR UP TO 500 HOURS OF USE, WITH 3 RECTCLES (red dot,cross,red dot inside of a circle) TO CHOOSE FROM AND 7 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS TO MAKE EVERYTHING EASILY VISIBLE NO MATTER WHAT TIME DAY YOU'RE USING IT, I UPGRADED IT WITH THE FLIP-UP FRONT + REAR LENS COVERS. IT WORKS GREAT ANYTIME DURING THE DAY AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THIS UNTIL INVESTIGATING A STRANGE NOISE OUTSIDE ONE NIGHT BUT IT DOES GREAT AT NIGHT WITH GOOD LIGHT POINTED IN THE SAME DIRECTION (perfect if you have a weapon.mounted light). PLUS THE UPGRADED CANTILEVER MOUNT AND 3X MAGNIFIER WITH UPGRADED QUICK RELEASE STYLE MOUNT FOR INSTALLING/REMOVING IN TEN SECONDS OR LESS PLUS THE FACTORY SUPPLIED WRENCH FOR MOUNTING RED DOT SCOPE TO ITS CANTILEVER (high-rise) MOUNT AND MOUNTING CANTILEVER TO RIFLE. MOUNTS TO ANY PICATINNY/WEAVER STYLE RAIL AND OPTICS READY/FLAT TOP AR15/M4/AK PLUS ANY TACTICAL RAILWHATSOEVER.

THIS.ISNT CHEAP KNOCK OFF STUFF AND DOES AS.WELL AS ANY TOP QUALITY OPTICS.IVE EVER USED. THE.RED.DOT SCOPE, 3X MAGNIFIER, CANTILEVER MOUNT UPGRADE, MAGNIFIER MOUNT UPGRADE, AND THE FLIP UP LENS COVERS FOR THE.SCOPE COST ME.AROUND $350.

 I WANT A EOTECH 512 HOLOGRAPHIC SIGHT OR SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR BECAUSE.THAT IS.WHAT IM USED.TO.SHOOTING. I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY A RED DOT FOR A CHANGE AND ITS GREAT, ACCURATE, FUNCTIONS EASILY AND IS.EVEN LIGHTER THAN THAN THE EOTECH BUT I WAS TRAINED ON A EOTECH AND IM GOING TO STICK WITH WHAT I KNOW BEST.

I HAVE A NEW (except for zeroing and re-checking zero which was always perfect)  RED DOT.Scope.IDENTICAL.TO.AN AIMPOINT(not cheap.chinese.junk)  BUT JUST NOT NIGHT VISION COMPATIBLE.w/ Cantilever Mount.and.Flip Up.Lens.Covers and has new 500+ Hour Battery Installed, Brand New Never Used 3X MAGNIFIER with quick release mount.

It is pretty much impossible to find anyplace unless you go on gunbroker and are willing to pay about $900-$950 for one. CZ hasn't shipped any new ones in months and no dealers have them.

 This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired. Great gun for the range or home defense. Competition grade.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Gas tank is built into it, but it has a fuel port to allow you the option of hooking up an external can (I never needed xtra). So it frees up floorspace in the boat not having the can or fuel line to trip over. I was told Sears sold these in the 80's.

I had 2 of these because I liked the design of them so much but no longer have a boat and don't see one in my near future thus the reason for selling it now. This was the best of the 2.

Looking to get $250.00 out of it or trade for pump,sxs, 38 snubnose, AR lower or a Honda XL250 K0 model(1974) rebuildable motor yeah I know that one really is specific and a longshot but hey why not try you never know, or ???

With the prices skyrocketing on Garands and K98's and even Nagants, I figure I'm never gonna get to put my WW2 collection together the way I really want, so, I might as well pass this beautiful, all matching, battle hardened and proven rifle on down the line to someone who can really appreciate her. I've only fired her once, about 10 rounds, and she is without a doubt, the smoothest, easiest cycling rifle of all the WW2 bolt actions I;ve shot. It's no wonder this was such a beloved rifle for the Brits, and wasn't decommissioned entirely until 1991 (still served as a Sniper rifle up through Desert Storm for them). This is NOT a canadian Long Branch, this is a real deal Royal Arms Lee-Enfield. Stock is beautiful, with no cracks, scratches, gouges, or even really any discoloration. Bore is shiney and rifling is clear as the day the came off the factory floor. The accuracy of this rifle is about 1.75"" at 300 meters. Definitely a minute of man accurate rifle, loved by the Tommies, and an Icon of World War 2. Selling her WITH all the ammo I have for her, I will give the buyer an accurate count, but definately atleast 100-140 rounds. Total asking price for Rifle WITH Ammo........$740.00

Citadel firearms are made by a company called Howa, who makes a lot of firearms for some every well known name brands.
I bought this pistol brand new from Hatfield's Gunsmithing in Manassas as the brand came highly recommended from Sam himself.

Only a few boxes of premium Speer Lawman ammo have been shot through gun and the slide has NEVER been allowed to slam home on an empty chamber. This gun was primarily used for an online photo shoot for a local chicks with guns web site. But now I'm looking for a different brand of 45 because even though the quality of this handgun rivals anything Kimber is making these days, the fact remains that I am a cork sniffing brand whore who just wants some fancy-pants big brand name 45acp and that is why I'm selling this one. 

Unlike the photo attached, this handgun will include the original walnut grips, plastic case, one magazine and whatever came in the case originally. (The coarse black grips in the photo are an extra $20.00 if you want them.) There are also a few little rust freckles which crept through the brushed nickel slide near the rear sight where the weapon rubbed against my skin when I tried to carry it concealed one day. I was going to just shoot some Duracoat over it but I couldn't decide what color I wanted. If the little freckles bother you, you can Duracoat the slide however you like. OH YEA... Hattfield's Gunsmiffin' also added a green fiber optic front sight for me after the photo was taken.

If you want a bargain priced, factory customized 45, this is it right here!

[Sunday 9/1/2013 EDIT: More options available if you are willing to pay $750.00 instead of $500.00 Details below.]
The firearm currently has installed a beautiful set of flame maple wood grips in a translucent green color which matches the green fiber optic front sight post. This not only looks good but it increases comfort and retention ability when your hand gets sweaty. The alternate photo also shows a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster. $750.00 will get you all three sets of grips and the Serpa holster."

This is a Springfield Garand made in 1943. It is the Danish variety and has the highly sought after VAR barrel. The barrel is made in 1957 and is one of the only non original components of the rifle. It's throat gauge is less than one and the rifling is excellent, which means it's rarely been used. The stock has virtually no dings and matches the receiver. This is definitely a collectible model, although it shoots beautifully if you are so inclined (as I hope you are). The pictures do not do this rifle justice.

Total of about 20 rounds put through it for zeroing. Never bought the dies to reload this caliber so it was hardly shot. Bore is great! Some discoloration in the bluing, however rifle fires flawless. Also have a Simmons 3-9x32 scope for it but no mount. Willing to sell separate if you don't need the scope.

****UPDATE****
4 Collectors at the gun show this weekend has told me that there is nothing wrong with the finish on the rifle. All 4 has told me not to re-blue in order to keep it in it's original condition for collection purposes. The rifle is a post 64, made in 1981 and is in great shape for being that old. Action is excellent, very smooth for that year of production and the wood finish other then minor marks is in excellent condition beautiful grain. 3 of the 4 gave me the same price range to sell it for and the last was higher, however I'm not changing that asking price, and going to leave the price low

The action is hand bedded in to an olive drab Mc Millan A3 fiberglass tactical stock that is fully adjustable for comb height and length of pull and offers multiple steel sling studs.

It was a impulse buy, and I'm still not sure if I want to sell it, but the wife says I have to, (those of you who are married, know what I'm dealing with). So the description of this beautiful rifle is: This rifle came from the factory with Diamondhead flip up front, and rear sights. These are worth the weapon alone. Must see. The piston system is a Stag arms proprietary design modeled after the Daniel defense. I have sent exactly 30 rounds through her. Like all standard stag AR rifles it is chambered in true 5.56. I put on a sling attachment, and a BCM Gunfighter Ambidextrous charging handle,( if you haven't used one of these, you are missing out), and added and vertical grip/bi-pod. I have my slide fire in the pics. This is an option if you want it. If you don't want it, I can take it off and put the standard Stag six position mil spec stock. If you do want it, I will still give you the factory stock I am only willing to sell this to people in the Great State of Oklahoma. I drive all over the State, so meeting won't be the biggest issue. I have total 1680 in this gun. It's a steal for $1100 with the slidefire. Or 900 without."

It is super accurate and very concealable if you are looking for a CCW. I can carry this all day with the galco IWB holster no problem. If you want to add a laser or a flash light, the galco holster will accommodate this. I used to have the Viridian on this, which is why i got this holster. 

This is one of the only subcompact pistols where you will find that it has 13 plus round magazine and still reasonably concealable. The MP Shield, the infamous Glock, and others like it, carry less then 10rds. If ever in a shoot out, the first three shots will probably miss but the other eleven will be on target (plus one in chamber). Try doing this with a mag capacity of ten or less. This was the main reason this subcompact was so hard for me to give up, the mag capacity. 

The best part of this gun is the fact that it has night sights. The night sights are REALLY BRIGHT at NIGHT.

I will refund your money if this is not true. I was going to take the night sights off but it is now a good part of the gun.

TESTIMONIALS:

“There is a difference between carrying a gun and carrying a gun responsibly! The right to bear arms is a right to bear them as a trustworthy and upstanding citizen. These days, proper training is crucial for that right to continue. Jake’s class is the best course to begin your ongoing education to exercise your right to bear arms responsibly. I thoroughly enjoyed his class. The class was fun, interesting, informative and professional. Jake’s professional demeanor and style helped me accentuate my previous learning. It spawned in me a desire to be more responsible, safe and trustworthy as I bear arms. I have used guns all my life and have always tried to follow strict safety procedures. Jake’s course builds on what I have learned, but took me further. I came to understand the gravity and responsibility of carrying a firearm.

You bought more than you needed which means other people couldn't buy it at regular price and now you are giving us the privilege of buying it at almost double the price.

THIS is why we can't find ammo and prices are sky rocketing.

Edit 9/3/13: He contacted me and told me I paid too much @ $54 and that he paid $50. 

""I'm glad you paid 54.00. This country has something called a ""free market"" if you dont want to pay it then move on. Oh and you paid too much if you paid 54. i paid 50""

So now he wants you to pay $90 in the name of ""free market"". Flag this POS and the rest of the gougers and make it hard for them to resell their ammo. If they can't resell their ammo, ammo will start to reappear on the shelves and prices will come down."

- the scope minus the mount is $330 new, will include the mount.

This is a quality scope, I have only used it once to get it on zero and to try some distance.

I do not need it or use it, I went a different route. Its in quality Condition.

Will include the Quick Detach mount.

The 1-4x CMR (Close Medium Range) scope is the scope you need. This relatively short 30mm tube scope does not add a lot of weight to any rifle, and thanks to the large diameter of the scope tube, it lets in a lot of light for a bright target image. Also, due to the high quality fully multi-coated lenses, that image is also clear and sharp. An extremely practical circular reticle aids in quick target acquisition by drawing the attention of the shooter's eye to the center of the scope. To insure that the target is fully visible, this reticle has only a horizontal crosshair, with a partial vertical lower crosshair. The upper half of this reticle leaves the scope clean and uncluttered. Plus, the lower crosshair features short bar aiming points calibrated for standard .223 and .308 service ammo, which are very precise out to 600 meters.

The gun was purchased 9/16/2012.  Since that time I have gotten my concealed carry and purchased a Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry 45 acp and a Sig Sauer p238.  As such the TLE is spending most of its time in the safe and has less than 200 rounds through it.

I am buying a Browning Citori today and would like to use the cash from selling this gun instead of reaching into savings.  I went to Fisherman's and Northwest Armorny, two of the best places for low prices yesterday.  The gun, new in the case at Fisherman's 3 stores, is $929.00 with one magazine.

The Kimber will come with 4 Kimber (8 round) magazines, Bulldog holster, original box and paper work.   This is a $1050 package I am selling for $850 to get my shotgun.  That is $1 off for every round down the barrell.  Kimber says this gun is not even broken in, they recommend a 1000 rounds or more for break in.  This gun has factory installed Meprolight night sights and shoots like a dream.  Factory trigger pull between 4-5.  I really do love this gun and only my desire for other things lets me consider letting it go.

If you are interested we will set up a place to meet and we will disassemble the Kimber for your inspection.  The gun is in excellent shape

The exhaust has been changed out to drag pipes (I believe they are Jardine). The battery was also changed out to a larger model better suited for the 920, with the larger battery the battery cover doesn't fit.

After sitting without starting for about 6 weeks, I cannot get the bike to run properly. It will start but as soon as you hit the throttle it dies. I don't have the time to fix this issue so I am dropping my price to get this thing sold.
