It does appear to have late war features such as :  Narrow checkered hammer, 7 groove Cyuga Motors mainspring housing and the Ordnance wheel and all proper markings. It has a Flannery WWII barrrel, and Late war plastic grips with proper part numbers. The entire pistol has been professionally refinished in the same Parco- Lubrite Maganese based parkerizing used by Colt near the end of the war. Blued M.S. Little WWII magazine. All parts have strong markings. I have filled most of the markings for the pictures. It is easily removed if you want. This pistol is a VERY nice example . Again, it has been refinished, but is priced accordingly. 1,138,000 was the end of Colt marking the slide with the same serial number as the slide.  This pistol was made after that so it would not have a matching number.

Lightweight reflex sight combines lightning-fast target acquisition with military-grade durability specifications that meet or exceed those used by special operations personnel working in extreme combat conditions. The non-magnifying lens is crafted from lightweight, impact resistant polymer with an anti-reflective coating for a clear, crisp field of view. Sealed pushbutton conveniently located on the rear of the housing lets you choose between four pre-set intensity levels for the 3.5 MOA dot, or the default Auto mode that automatically adjusts to ambient light conditions. The MRDS fits any mount designed for Docter® red dot sights. The sealed housing is molded from advanced polymers to reduce weight without sacrificing strength, and is waterproof down to 66 feet for up to 2 hours. Extensive salt, fog, drop, vibration, and shock testing ensures this sight meets MIL-STD 810G standards, and will operate at temperatures ranging from -104° F to 120° F. Adjustable for windage and elevation in 1 MOA clicks. Powered by one 3-volt CR-1632 lithium battery, included; depending on output setting, continuous run time on one battery is up to one year. Top-loading battery compartment eliminates loss of zero by allowing battery change without removing sight from mount. Comes with a slip-on protective rubber cover."

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too.

The scope is digital camo also with target turrets and side parallax focus. The scope and the rifle stock camo colors are a little different, with the scope having more green than the stock. I have put about 60 rounds through the rifle and cleaned it religiously. Will shoot sub 1"" groups at 100 yards easily.

I have the matching rings for the scope but they set it way to high above the bore so I bought lower ones. The scope also comes with a sunshade. I still have the box for the rifle and scope, and all paperwork. I just never shoot it and it's too heavy to hunt with. If you are interested, call me at 252-three four one-8219. Serious calls only.

It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm I recommend you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / back round check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.  I hold the public classes in the conference rooms at Homewood Suites by Pensacola Airport (or your location for a private class of 4 or more students).  The class is $75 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.

 Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870 – the new Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged. KEY FEATURES: *Action design based on the venerable Model 870 – ultra-smooth and reliable *Rugged ArmorLokt coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces *SuperCell recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% *Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics *Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably *Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels *28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes *Sling swivel studs built-in *Includes Modified Rem Choke

The ATF wasnt sure on what to do with them so they added a 7 before and after the 56s and tack welded a thread protector on the muzzle. It still has the cleaning rod and is a squared back receiver. These are pretty rare rifles as the only ones in this configuration were in port during the 1989 import ban on assault rifles. I have owned many AKMs and place the Chinese as top quality as they come with chrome lined barrels and are incredibly reliable. This would make a great SHTF weapon.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5-Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly.

   I have about $600-$650 into this gun NOT including the price of the gun itself, but am more than willing to negotiate a price, I do not expect to get every last dime I put into this gun, and will be very flexible on trade values. Especially if I really like what you offer.

  All the parts are basically from Wilson Combat, with the exception of the trigger, which is manufactured by Cylinder & slide, the Meprolight Tru-Dot Tritium sight set, and the match barrel and bushing. Including all original parts which the gun came with, which is one SS 7 round mag, two Blued 8 round mags, and the case with all manuals and paperwork. 
  There is a notch which I filed into the slide, which eases wear and tear on the disconnector when racking the slide (the difference it made is very noticeable.) All rails have been filed and polished for a very smooth action, along with the feed ramp and barrel locking lugs. The gun has been very well cared for by me, and has not even been shot in it's new configuration. The new owner will have a fresh 1911 to start off with, with an excellent setup.
  Grips are Pachmayr Legend, I also have Hogue grips that came stock. Both grips are excellent and look very nice on this gun. I have a hard time figuring out which ones I like on it the most. Text me at 1-716-five five zero-zero four zero eight, or E-Mail is fine."

The Model 60, introduced in 1965, was the first.

The first production run had stainless steel front and rear sights.  There were many customer complaints, because these sights “washed out” of view when acquiring targets in high light situations.  So early on, S&W first changed the rear sight to a blued/black one, but retained the stainless front sight.  That did not correct the entire problem, so the front sight was changed to a ramp with red insert during the second half of the production years --- Problem solved! 

*****This revolver is the completely corrected version.***** 

The last model of the “66” was the Model 66-7 which was discontinued in 2005.

The “66 No Dash” is much sought-after today by many collectors.  A lot of people say that if they could only have one revolver, the “66” would be it.

This weapon is in incredible condition for its age.  The round count is unknown, but it can’t be many.  The cylinder face is ultra-clean with no carbon residue, and the cylinder turning line is almost imperceptible.

The barrel is pinned, and the cylinder is recessed.

It is wearing brand-new Hogue Goncalo Alves (exotic wood) grips.  I’ll also include older S&W medallion K-Frame grips, but they are not original to this revolver.

No box or docs, just one fine handgun.  Now is your chance to own one of these rare iconic revolvers."

The scope was used once on a AR-15 for about 20 rounds. The scope is basically brand new with the original box, and manual. The dial currently on the scope is meant for a .223 rifle, but it also comes with a dial for .308. The scope has Weaver mounts that I purchased separately and installed (scope cleared the hand guard on my AR-15 by about 1/8 inch). I am also throwing in a Sight Mark laser bore sighting cartridge with pouch case, it just needs the batteries (easy to lose, trust me). I bought this scope for $209.99 brand new 3 months ago, and it has been sitting in it's box since I used it right after I purchased it.

I am asking $175  for the scope including the scope mounts and laser boresight cartridge (approximately $45 worth of accessories).
