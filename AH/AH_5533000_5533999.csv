This is a great collector's piece!  Appraised at Cabelas's as 100% condition rating.  Appraiser considered this rifle to be a never fired, never issued government rifle.  Falls into the very unique collector's item... Includes:  (a)  Bayonet and bayonet sheath:  - 16 5/8"" long.  It has a Lithgow 1907 bayonet sheath. The bayonet stamp markings: Line 1:  MKI, Line 2: NWP, Line 3: 42.  There is an oil hole on the pommel which became a feature on the bayonets made after 1922.  This bayonet is stamped on the blade 42, for 1942, therefore the wood handle should be coachwood.  In Nov 1941 production was switched over to the Slazenger Factory and the Queensland Maple that was previously used was then replaced by coachwood.  (Coachwood is a slender tree of the rain forests of Australia and New Guinea, with close-grained timber that has a characteristic caramel scent and is used for cabinetmaking and veneers today.) (b) A Lee-Enfield canvas action cover. It covers the area of the bolt action, the trigger and the removable magazine.  The canvas cover is dated 1951. Appears to be never used. (c) A Lee-Enfield canvas muzzle cover.  It is designed to cover the muzzle.  The cover is dated 1952.  Appears to be never used. RIFLE MARKINGS (a) Serial Number:  The serial number appears in three locations:  (1) Right side of the chamber where the barrel screws in (2) Flatside rear edge of the bolt handle (3) Nosecap for the bayonet.  Each of the serial numbers start with the letter ""A"" and is followed by 4 digits. (b) Rifle has a brass butt plate. (c) Beneath the bolt handle are the following markings, it is in 5 lines:  (1) MA (2) LITHGOW  (3) SMLE (stands for Small Magazine, Lee-Enfield but called Smelly) (4) III* (5) 1945. (d) The marking ""BA"" is found in four locations on this rifle:  (1) On the left side of the trigger (2) The bottom of the trigger guard  (3) On the receiver behind the bolt handle.  (4) The front right side of the bolt.  (BA stands for Rifle Factory #2 Bathurst). (e) Marking on the right wing protector of the rear sight is ""OA"".  (OA stands for Rifle Factory #3 Orange). (f)  Marking on the metal band that surrounds the wood forestock that holds the front sling keeper are the letters ""MA"".  (MA stands for rifles made after 1926). (g) Stamped into the wood on the bottom side of the front forestock about 2"" back from the bayonet mount is ""SLAZ 43"".  (SLAZ stands for the Slazenger Factory produced in 1943). (h) On the safety, is the Roman Numeral;  III. (i)  The underside of the flip-up rear sights are marked WA 43.  (""WA"" stands for the factory at Wellington Annexe and 43 is 1943.) The wood stock is fantastic condition, as well as the metal bluing.  This rifle may have not been fired at all.  It is in unblemished condition. Selling price for the rifle, removable magazine, canvas covers for the action, as well as the muzzle, and the bayonet and sheath - - - all for $650. Location:  Sun Prairie, WI"

Look at the factory sight-in target, this thing is very accurate.    I will need to see ID in the form of a CCW (concealed carry) license or equivalent from you in order to buy it.  I will only meet in the Wausau area.More info off the internet:Walther PPQ M2 DAO 9mm 4"" 15+1 Black Poly Grip/Frame Black 2796066. The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The styling is elegant and trim with a sculpted grip that meshes smoothly into the hand. The PPQ M2 has a reversible mag release button and an ambidextrous slide stop. The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in conjunction with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe carry. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does not protrude from the back of the slide. The polymer frame has interchangeable backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile, 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. The Walther PPQ comes with 2 15 round magazines and is available with a 4"" or 5"" Tenifer-coated slide.Specifications:Unit of Measure: GNType: PistolAction: DoubleCaliber: 9mmManufacturer Item Number: 2796066Brand: Walther Arms IncItem Type: Hand GunWeight Per Box: 3.500UPC: REDACTED21Length: 12.0Width: 9.0Height: 2.5Weight: 24.5Capacity: 15+1Sights: 3-Dot Adjustable Low ProfileGrips: IntegralBarrel Length: 4.0""Safety: Firing Pin/Trigger"

The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.
Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.
The most impressive stat on the Scorpion Pistol is the price tag. It’s a whole lot of bang for the buck."

I got a rock river carrier from my local dealer becasue the original bcg I paid to have titanium nitrite coated and im keeping it for my sbr upper that im building. It has probably 500 rounds through it and the only reason for me to sell it is to finance the sbr upper im trying yo build. As most of you probably know daniel defense makes one of the finest ar barrels out there and of course all there parts are mil. spec. Rail is original and is a free float and has no signs of wear at all.....same with all the parts included(barrel, rail, charge handle....carrier....etc). It is all put together ...just needs a bolt group!  The daniel markings on the side read (DDM4V5). It can take either 5.56 or .223. It is virtually like new and probably not ever broken in yet. Barrel is cold hammer forged for longer life and has a 1/7 twist and is chrome lined. Im putting it at a great price so I probably won't barter much. Sale is in cash only and I can drive and meet if necessary! No thank you on any trades! Thanks for looking and have a great day!"

I'm selling the ammo I have for it too. I would have liked to keep it since it looks like the surplus imports have dried up, as well as the GP-11 ammo and the value of these is going to skyrocket over next couple years. Bore is decent, stock has plenty of character dings, but no gouges, bluing is well worn but no serious rust problems. Operates perfectly and shoots great. Let me know if you have any questions. I have 235 rounds of GP11. Some people are valuing this at over a dollar a round, I think a more realistic value is about $0.75 a round. I have 100 rounds of PPU and Hornady soft point ammo. New the boxes are $14-$18, I'll put a trade value of $0.55 per round on these. Rifle: $375GP11: $175 SP ammo: $55 Total Value:$605One of the calibers I decided to keep is 7.62X54R, so I would trade for an M44, M39, or other Mosin variant, I'm not very interested in a standard 91/30 though. Ideally, I would find a semi-auto battle rifle, either a VEPR with 20 or 23"" barrel or a Garand. Depending on the trade, I could add some cash with the rifle and ammo. The only other thing I'm in the market for right now is an AR upper or possibly a bow, but let me know what you have, worst I can say is 'No'. I prefer to communicate by email, once we get a deal lined up we can exchange numbers. Thanks for your interest!"
