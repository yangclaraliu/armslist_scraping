One is in a plastic aftermarket stock. The other is in the original wood stock, but I refinished it to look much nicer. The wood-stocked rifle's chamber is corroded, but the bore looks very good. May be due to corrosive ammo (that was advertised as non-corrosive, damn Traders!) and the plastic-stocked rifle's chamber looks good but the bore is dirty (not corroded, except surface corrosion at muzzle and action as shown in pics. Being sold AS-IS. Price for the pair reflects this. Buy them both for $495 shipped, as pictured, to your FFL in the lower 48. Will not sell them to a local California buyer unless the buyer is an FFL and comes to me; the hassle is otherwise too much. It is the buyer's responsibility, regardless, to ensure that these rifles are legal for you to buy and own in your area of residence.

These are not C&R eligible, I will NOT meet at a local shop, and cash & carry offers will be ignored (and be glad I don't report you to the ATF). I won't hold them pending any weirdness, either. These will be sold legally and transacted through a current, full-fledged FFL. Shipping them is preferred; it's easier."

Has all matching STAMPED serial numbers on Bolt, Floor Plate, and Receiver This is a century import has all the normal accessories. Bayonet that fits the barrel, Oilier/Cleaner can, cleaning tools, 2 ammo pouches, head space gauge, and Sling.

The 1939 year and older production do have a much better finish compared to the 1940-1944. Also there are far fewer 1939 and older most of the rifles you find were made during the height of WWII. This is a pre war built rifle

This has the Tula star as the Arsenal that it was built at according to some this arsenal built more accurate rifle. 

M.O. Marking... Double Date From the research I have done this means it was built in 1939 and then issued to the Ministry of Defense in 1950 . Possibly guarded a government installation at that time. Also has XX stamped on receiver. Don't know the significance of XX maybe capture marks?? Tons of information on 7.62x54r.net website

I briefly had a scout style scope on this rifle and it shot well at 600 meters using military surplus 148 grain russian spam can ammo. I have spent hours getting all the layers of cooper and powder residue out of the bore of this rifle. NOT COUNTER BORED

Very fun cheap rifle to shoot 7.62x54r surplus ammo is widely for sale on internet for around a 100 for 440 rds, and is comparable to .308 ballistics

Would like to sell in Minnesota need permit to purchase and face to sale.

298,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2876298,"For Sale:  10 Boxes Russian 7.62x38R Nagant Ammo - Brass Case, Steel Core","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 80,"Listed On: Saturday, March 29, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I found a near full spam can of this Russian made 7.62x38 ammo recently while cleaning my ammo vault. I've owned at least a half dozen Nagant Revolvers over the years and fired them extensively. To me they were always one of the finest surplus handguns ever brought to the states. That said I've always found that the real Russian surplus ammo was the very best shooting ammo. It's clean, dependable and designed specifically for the Nagant. Plus it features a heavier 108 grain bullet with a steel core while the commercially loaded stuff has a lead core 98 grain bullet. Then to me at least the Russian ammo seemed to be loaded noticeably hotter than what you can get from PPU or Fiocchi. I suppose it's a liability issue? The last piece is that the Russian ammo always shot more accurately. The only negative at all is that this ammo does use a corrosive primer so cleaning your gun is a must after using. Listing is for (10) 14 boxes or 140 rounds total. Head stamp is 38, 77 meaning it was produced at the Russian State Factory at Yuryusan, Russia in 1977. However it looks like it was made yesterday.

Asking price is $80. FTT with pickup in the Brandon area. You must be at least 21 to purchase."

327,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2876327,For Sale/Trade:  Rear Tine Tiller-Troy-Bilt,"Greensboro/Burlington/Reidsville, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 350,"Listed On: Saturday, March 29, 2014",Farming,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This tiller is still in great shape. It has seen very little action, runs great. It is self propelled and is reverse tine so it really digs in deep.
The cover for the belt is missing but that doesn't affect anything other than the look of the front. I actually found it better with it off so you can get to any rocks that get lodged easier.
Included is a brand new set of tines but the tines on the tiller are still in great shape, the tines just came extra when I got the tiller.
The tag says Pro-Line so I assume that is the model.

Please call or text me at 336-FOUR-FIVE-ONE-7162

Will trade for equivalent value in fire arms or ammo, 9mm or .40

If this post is still active, the tiller is still available."

455,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2876455,For Sale:  SAKO Finnbear L61R 30-06 (Pre-Garcia),"Newport, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 1,100","Listed On: Saturday, March 29, 2014",Rifles,Sako                                                                                 ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"What's Pre-Garcia?  It means a better stock finish.  Some of the Garcia's I've owned become sticky and lost their luster.  As you can see this one shines like new.  This particular rifle was imported by Firearms International (FI) in 1969. As well Garcia's don't show the quality in action and barrel polishing and so will not have the mirror finish.  In lower left photo you can see the partial  reflection of the scope lens cap in the shine on the barrel.  You'll notice the early models show a more immediate contour as the barrel leaves the action.  Late models are quite different.  Buying a Pre-Garcia ensures you a better value in the future.  You simply won't go wrong. Front sight hoods are missing from MANY SAKO's.  Not mine! Factory Hoods cost $100 or more if you can even find one.  SAKO Collectors demand original parts.  I fired less than 300 rounds through this rifle and decided it was a real keeper.  It this rifle has been a ""Safe Queen"" as I had many other rifles to shoot.  Very accurate, everything I fired shot well under an inch.  Some were half inch.  I put this away thinking I'd hunt with it some day.  43 years later... it's still there.  I hate to part with it, but I have an overabundance of 30-06 rifles, and just purchased a SAKO 7mm Mag.

I'm asking a fair price for this beauty, and I'm sure you will agree it's one of the best other than new you've seen.  I know there are a number to choose from.  But who else dares to show their rifle in close up photos like these.  Beware of rifles with lines in the finish.  These have been subjected to temperature extremes which cracked the finish.  There is NO WAY to restore the original appearance.  It won't affect the accuracy, only the value of the rifle.

""Hi Power. Take a true classic to the range. When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability.

Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever.

Sure, there are many, many  other full-size 9mm pistols on the market that are made to meet many different requirements. But in the end, every true firearm enthusiast should have a Hi Power in their collection. Having and shooting the best just means something.

A legend you can rely on.
The Browning Hi Power is one of the most revered pistols of all time. This ground-breaking firearm was originally designed by John M. Browning and perfected in the years following his death by Fabrique Nationale’s prolific designer, Dieudonne Saive. The Hi Power has proven itself around the world in the hands of law enforcement, military, special operations forces and law abiding citizens. Add a legendary piece of functional firearm history to your collection now with a 9mm Browning Hi Power.

Sights
Hi Power pistols are available with fixed, low-profile three-dot sights. The Hi Power Standard is available with optional low-profile target sights that are adjustable for windage and elevation.

Safety
A large, ambidextrous manual thumb safety is conveniently located just above the grip.

Magazine Capacity
Double-stack magazine design. 13-round magazine standard in 9mm. 10-round models in 9mm available where required by law. Follow state and local laws regarding magazine capacity when ordering.

Trigger
The light single-action trigger breaks clean and crisp. This is the system preferred by professionals around the world.

Frame and Slide
Forged from solid steel, yet still lightweight. The heft of the Hi Power keeps recoil light and manageable for accurate firing, even at a rapid rate. The balance in the hand is impeccable.

Learn about the operation and general function -- and get a look at a parts list and schematic -- in the Hi-Power owner's manual by downloading a PDF version of it now. Click here or on the photo. at right.

Editors note: The 9mm Browning Hi-Power was John Moses Browning's final design -- he was working on it when he passed away in Belgium. When you shoot a Hi-Power it is not just shooting ""another nine."" it is shaking hands with the greatest firearms designer the world has ever known. The web guys at Browning think that's cool. You will never regret owning this legendary pistol."""

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR

This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Just want to trade my H&K USP compact don't know why he thinks he needs to do this, but I will keep posting it until I trade it or sell it.
Used H&K compact .40 comes with factory night sights version 1 

Very clean only a couple small blemishes, round count is low, as you can see for the pictures there is very little wear around the barrel and ejection port area. This is a nice gun and very clean, so this isn't someone's every day carry that is all beat up. Plus it's a H&K, so not to many around and nobody is better in quality. 

Comes with 2 holsters, a Blackhawk and a IWB, holsters are hard to find for this gun, the IWB is perfect and makes the package worth more. 

2 magazines

After much thought, and a good deal of interest my thinking has changed. I will take 650 cash outright if I have to drive. I could be persuaded to take less if you come to me. This is well below what they run, new they are at least 840. With the holsters it's a steal.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
