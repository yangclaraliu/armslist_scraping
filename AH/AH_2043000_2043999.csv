Every one of us dreams of owning the Barrett 82A1. It's one of the ultimate dream guns. It has been featured toward the top of the food chain in the world of guns for 25 years. The design has been steadily refined until it's as proven a system as man can devise. It provides rapid, accurate firepower with untarnished reliability. In late 2004, the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division requested a medium/heavy rifle and cartridge combination. The .416 Barrett was designed as an improvement to the .50 BMG using NACA low supersonic drag equations to determine the shape of the projectile. The use of a lighter, narrower bullet results in a significantly higher muzzle velocity and superior ballistic performance to the .50 BMG, supposedly to such a degree that the .416 Barrett retains more energy than the .50 beyond 1000 yards. The projectile remains supersonic to out around 2000 yards. That's my typical ground squirrel shooting range."

I have also put on a Troy Industries Enhanced Carbine length aluminum drop in hand rail, black Magpul CTR Stock, Ergo Black pistol grip, AIM 4x32 Scope with dust covers, Field Dark Earth Magpul MOE Carbine handguards (Still in the original Magpul box they came in), FDE Hogue pistol grip (Also still in original package) and many more items.  All of the FDE (Field Dark Earth) items I bought to go FDE and Black but went with all black furniture instead so these are another extra I am including in the price.  I will also include 100 rounds of either .223 or 5.56 ammo with it.  If you know Sig than you know this is a ""Top of the Line"" rifle.  The barrel is the standard 16"" 1/7 Twist M4 profile barrel with the bayonett lug and ""F"" stamped front sight post\gas block. As is standard with Sig Sauer's M4 Rifles, machined into the lower receiver is a pair of quick disconnect sling mounts and also has a built in tensioner in the lower receiver to ensure a tight fit and no slop between the upper and lower receivers.  I am a 3 time combat veteran of the U.S. Army and have fired many AR platform rifles but by far this Sig is the best built, Most accurate, and nicest Looking M4 that I have shot and owned.  I am in the process of building my own rifle and have acquired ""too many toys"" according to my wife so I am selling my Sig along with a bunch of other AR parts and pieces.  I am asking $1300.00 OBO or I am open to trades of equal or greater value or a mixture of the two.  For more info call or text me, Josh, at REDACTED

This is about half of what I have. If you are looking for .45 hollow points or ""carry ammo"" just ask and I'll dig through the safe t see what I have. I do have a number of boxes of Winchester SXT and PDX1 ammo and misc other types.
 If you are from outside of New York or your profession makes it legal for you to own Hi-caps I have a number of those as well. That also goes for the guns I will be selling, you will need to be from outside of NY or in a profession that allows you to have ""assault"" rifles. I will want a hefty sum for them hough tbecause once I sell them and retire I will never be able to buy another so it has to be worth while to part with them."

I bought the gun brand new a few weeks ago. Shot less than 50 rounds through the gun. I like this gun, however I am looking for a much more compact pistol to carry for CCW. Gun comes with the usual stuff from the factory (i.e., hardcase, papers, spent casing, and owner's manual). The gun also comes with a 1-8rd factory magazine, and factory smooth wood grips, but it has a nicer Kimber tactical rosewood grips on it right now (brand new, cost me $40). I installed a new Smith & Alexander checkered mainspring housing  (pictured, cost me $35) on it a few days ago (factory mainspring housing including). In addition, I'll throw in a box (50 rounds - not pictured) of FMJ ammo along with the gun. You must be at least 21 years old or older to buy/trade this gun. And you must be a Kentucky resident and have a valid Kentucky Driver's License to buy/trade my gun. Thanks for looking.

This gives cabinetmakers the ability to offer over 18 profiles of rail and stiles for cabinet doors at a fraction of the cost of fixed knife cutters.

These cutters are packed with special features like: eased panel slot edges to prevent splintering and improve finishing, zero down time to switch from the moulding cut to the cope cut with matched reverse sets, and profiles that always match even after resharpening.

The RS2000 contains everything in the RS1000, plus nine different pairs of profile knives.

There are 1421 rounds of ammunition that come with the pistol. 1253 rounds are Yugoslavian with a 1986 head stamp. There are also 178 rounds of Bulgarian rounds with a head stamp from the fifties. Current dealer price for 1200 rounds of Polish ammo is $499.00 and that ammo sometimes has cracked necks. This ammo that comes with the pistol is corrosive, as is all Communist Bloc ammo.

I only fired 60 rounds through it and have no use for it anymore and, with the exception of a few aesthetic imperfections, it is in fine condition.

This rifle will come with the Bushnell elite 3200 10x40 mil-dot rifle scope (great for hunting at dawn as the reticle lights up when charged with a flashlight), Leupold scope mount with weaver top base, harris-type bipod, stock ammo pouch and whatever leftover ammunition i have, which is around 20 or so rounds.

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 is a 10-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Incorporating new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability, the PMAG 10 provides next-generation performance for those needing lower profile magazines.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® MR556A1 and FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S as well as AR15 mag wells with tighter tolerances. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit."

Description:
The GSG-5 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. It is built by German Sport Guns GmbH, a wholesaler located in Ense-Höingen, Germany. It was unveiled at the IWA & Outdoor Classics trade show in March 2007 following the legalization of previously forbidden military-style weapons in Germany.[citation needed]
This rifle externally resembles the Heckler & Koch MP5 style submachine gun. German Sport Guns produces its own line of accessories, including retractable stocks and railed handguards. Many airsoft MP5 style accessories may also be used on the GSG-5. Magazines for the GSG-5 are available in 2-round, 10-round, 15-round, 22-round and 110-round drum configurations.
The GSG-5 utilizes the H&K style drum sight that is adjustable for windage. German Sport Guns provides a weaver rail attachment that slides onto the top of the frame, allowing other sighting systems to be added."

Hey there, I have a beautiful 1973 Corvette stingray T-top here. Had the car for a little while now, and while I have LOVED my time with it, I would like to try a different flavor of sportscar, and need some money for school. Car has a full flowmaster exhaust, Holly carb, and a bored out 350 for performance. Body is 85% with some nicks and a bad paint spot, interior is 90% with the center console needing a little love. All that needs to be done is re-solder the turn signals, and the speedo. That is it. Break lights and head lights work great.
