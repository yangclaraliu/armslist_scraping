The Battle Comp is designed as a compensator which utilizes a single, contained baffle which reduces muzzle flip and recoil immensely.
The Battle Comp's design seeks to provide all the benefits of a brake/compensator, but minimize the distracting concussion which accompanies most dedicated competition muzzle brakes. The Battle Comp 2.0 is designed to be compatible with suppressors designed to work with A2 style flash hiders, such as the popular Gemtech HALO and now discontinued AAC Omni sound suppressor.
Designed for tactical use, the Battlecomp 2.0 is a simple and effective muzzle device.

TRADES (Specific!): Clean and/or low-wear SuperRedhawk Hunter in .454Casull takes the cake. I'll accept a Super Redhawk or Redhawk in .44RM or .45LC, but only in hunter form (7""+ bbl) and with scope mounts. If you have a scope or red dot on it, I'm open to negotiate a bit extra for it.

777,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5550777,For Sale/Trade:  Diamondback DB9 – “YF” Series - Flat Dark Earth & Black - 9mm,"College Station, Houston, Texas",$ 275,"Listed On: Sunday, June 5, 2016",Handguns,Diamondback Firearms                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"Almost NIB Diamondback DB9 (9mm) in Flat Dark Earth with black slide. The serial number begins with “YF” which is the most recent series Diamondback makes.  They finally got it right with this series of the gun and this one has performed flawlessly.
I truly wanted this gun to work for me but it’s a little snappy for my old arthritic hands. That’s a shame because this one’s very reliable, unlike some of the older series DB9’s out there. I bought it new a few weeks ago (can show receipt) and it has approximately 100 rounds through it. It really didn’t need any breaking in and has worked just fine from the start.
The DB9 is an outstanding pocket-carry design with a smooth trigger, very similar to a Glock (even down to its take-down method). It's light weight with an ultra-flat profile (11 oz. weight & 0.8 inch width) and that makes it the lightest, slimmest, and smallest 9mm available (you won’t have to settle for a .380). It's easy to pocket carry and just disappears in your pocket or purse.
I’ve found that the DB9 likes a steady diet of Remington UMC 115 gr JHP’s. These rounds run toward the lower end of the SAAMI spec for overall length. I’ve put a digital caliper on these rounds and they average about a thousandth of an inch shorter than most other 9mm rounds…certainly within the SAAMI spec but just short enough to accommodate the tight tolerances of this micro-nine. This DB9 loves them and if you feed it well, it will perform for you.
The full package comes with Diamondback’s really nice hard case (like a Pelican case), trigger lock, all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo). It also includes four 6-round factory mags supplied by Diamondback with pinkie extensions (all four are the good ones made in Italy), and the lifetime factory warranty. 
I prefer face-to-face transfer in east Texas without shipping. Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TX driver’s license or permit.   I’m in College Station so the triangle formed by Austin, DFW, and Houston is do-able.  If we can meet halfway or even partway to reduce my driving time, that would be much appreciated.
If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home. If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.
I prefer cash so I can go buy a more arthritic-friendly gun, but I'd consider the DB9 plus some cash for a soft-shooting Glock 42.
Sorry, but I’m not looking for low-ball offers. Thanks!"
