Has the ati bent down bolt and has been drilled and taped for a scope mount. The new bolt it welded on not threaded. Looks a little rough but works fine. The screws for the mount and scope rings have been blue loctited, I've only shot 40 rounds through it but it doesn't appear to be getting loose anytime soon. The scope is a 36x44 BSA brand and comes with two sun shades short and long ( pictured ) and the box it came in, it's also leveled to the gun. Would like to keep the bipod but will sell for an extra 50.00. Would also sell it minus the scope and bipod for 300.00. The reason for selling is its just a tad heavy for my taste. If you plan to sport up a mosin you can have this one and save some cash on gunsmith expenses. 150.00 for the gun 150.00 for the stock and 100 for the scope. As you can see this is quite a competitive price vs the asking price of most mosins in stock configuration (200 on the cheap side these days which I think is bs!) and the stock would be around 200 after shipping in most cases, so you got the scope mount and labor for free. Not really considering offers lower than my asking price because I would rather sell to a friend or co worker at a discounted price, sorry guys
Would also sell for 250 w/o scope, rings or bipod

Yes, this is indeed an Arsenal and NOT a FIME group, russian (closest thing you can get to a real AK103). Completely unfired and BNIB. This thing is a beauty. Includes the following;

1. All Original parts 
2. All manuals and papers 
3. X1 Four cell AK chest rig 
4. X1 10 round ban mag 
5. X1 cleaning kit 
6. X1 30 round steel magazine 
7. X1 Russian tan AK sling that is heavily used and has real enemy art on it. (It is one of a couple i liberated from a few Taliban guns we captured after an enemy engagement during my last tour to Afghanistan in the Wardak province). 
8. X1 US palm combat ergo grip 
9. X1 Krebs custom Ak lever 
10. X1 blue force group front sling adapter 
11. X1 Echo 93 sling adapter (goes on the side and allows QD sling attachment from the side of the rifle without impeding the folding stock or selector lever)

Price is 1500 plus shipping and insurance. NO TRADES. The gun has no issues at all to my knowledge.

Please do not lowball. If you have a reasonable offer go ahead and shoot it my way, but these are extremely hard to come by in this condition.

If you value your trade at retail price, so will I. Some people come to me and want to trade their 1,000 gun to me valued at 1,500. I realize we have to take a hit so I just want a fair deal for both of us. If you can get this gun cheaper, then get it, dont contact me valuing a 1,100 AR for 2,200 used. Go to gunbroker and check your prices. Im open to many trades, lets make this work. I need cash mostly. Dont contact me if you are not ready to make same day purchase. Also Im not going to sell my gun to someone who is funny looking or sounds funny. Be presentable and reasonable please.

Can't say enough good things about the Metro Arms 1911's. I have owned several Kimbers, Springfield, Remington 1911's but in my experience, this AC Trophy will hold its own with any of them for accuracy and reliability! I also have the American Classic II and the Commander version 1911's and they are all outstanding pistols too. I use both the 5"" models for IDPA and other competitions and it has always been 100% reliable and very accurate. They're hard to find and I sure hate to let her go, but need the cash. You can own a brand new, high quality yet reasonably priced 1911 for just $650 Firm! MSRP is $798. Priced to sell quick.

Comes with everything except the TiRant 45 suppressor (obviously) but does include the Pelican case.
Since you can't buy these by themselves, I'm just going to subtract the price of the TiRant and knock some more off of it. Paid $2,200 with suppressor ($750 for TiRant), so by itself the price would be $1,450. I'm asking $1,200."

I have for sale or trade a Marlin 30AS 30-30. Gun shoots great and I bought it for hunting and plinking before I assembled a 6.8 AR platform. I'm whittling my collection to mostly AR's, M1As and a couple bolt guns so I don't need this one.  It appears well loved by the previous owner as there is a little bluing loss and on the barrel and some scratches through the finish (not really into the wood) on the stock and forearm.  This rifle has the micro groove rifling and a safety.

I've shot this with the irons out to 150 yards and easily hits a chest size plate offhanded. I should have a scope base, rings, ammo, reloading components, etc. I can offer for the right trade or additional cash.  The price listed is for the rifle only.

Bersa BP9ODCC 9mm Concealed Carry 3.3"" 8+1 OD Poly Frame/Blk Steel Slide

The BP CC (concealed carry) is the first polymer-framed handgun from Bersa.
It was specially designed for concealed carry providing accuracy and fire
power in a lightweight, compact, ultra thin handgun. The BPCC's ergonomic
design improves line-of-sight and provides greater control during use. It
incorporates a single-stack 9mm profile, Picatinny accessory rail,
polygonal rifling, short reset DAO trigger and striker fire system. The
front sight is interchangeable with Sig Sauer #8 while the rear sight is
interchangeable with Glock rear sights. BP CC also has a loaded chamber
indicator and an ambidextrous magazine release. The result is a cost
effective conceal carry handgun that performs.

As you can see by the pictures, it does have some use wear but this scope is a tank! It was designed to withstand the rigors of the modern day battlefield and it has held up very well with U.S. soldiers and special forces. Another plus is the lifetime warranty that comes with U.S. Optics scopes, regardless of whether or not you are the original owner. I cannot say enough good things about this scope.

The U.S. Optics SN-4s is a terrific choice to mount on an AR-15 or similar semi-automatic rifle (will not mount on a FNH Scar 16s). At 1x magnification, the user can shoot with both eyes open at point blank range and at the maximum 4x magnification, the user can rely upon precision shot placement at much longer ranges. The fully multi-coated Schott glass lenses allow full transmission of 94.6% of available light, which when paired with the red illuminated reticle, makes them ideal for use from dawn until dusk. The illuminated reticle is also adjustable via an 11 position rheostat to allow the user to adjust intensity. Windage and elevation knobs are U.S. #1 5/8 MOA Slimline which are finger adjustable to allow for quick adjustments whenever the need arises. Each U.S. Optics Rifle Scope is hand-built by one person to ensure that the utmost care is taken in producing a quality scope.

It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years. All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers. The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011...Only going too shipped too FFL and i won't do face to face because of the bad expreience i have in the past...only serious buyer should contact me only.

It is marked as a factory test fire (from the Kahr website: Q. What does the ""U"" on the trigger guard of my pistol mean? A. If there is a ""U"" engraved on the trigger guard of your pistol, it is a factory refurbished and test fired model (often sold as a ""test fired"" gun). From what I understand, Kahr pulls some assembled pistols off the assembly line, fires them and marks them as a factory test fire. The advantage is the break in process is already started and you get a new condition pistol at a discounted price. 

It is in the factory box just like you would get a new one. There are no scratches or any marks on the pistol other than the barrel hood which indicates it has been fired at the factory.

No aftermarket parts, about 300 rounds fired through it. Comes with speed loader, 2 mags and everything that comes with it in the box from the factory. It is in good condition, hardly been holstered so there are really no scratches or markings on it- pretty much a brand new looking gun.  I'm just not really into the .40 cal. I would like to meet in Bellingham and would prefer a CPL."
