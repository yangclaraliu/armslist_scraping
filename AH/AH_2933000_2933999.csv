I have here what I believe to be two factory high-capacity mags from a PT92.  I used to own a very clean PT92; now I do not and no longer need these mags.  According to my research, they should fit PT99 's, as well as all the varients.  They will also fit the early Euro magazine release guns because they have the notches by the heels (as seen in the second pics).  They are in great used condition, with no dents or damage of any kind.  They probably retain about 90%+ of the original blueing.  They are made of heavy steel, with metal heel plates and spring retainer plates.  The springs are stong, and the mags feed as they should.  They are marked up to 15 rounds on the end.  The price is $50 FOR BOTH.

I can ship them for an additional $5.85 for priority, as long as high capacity mags are allowed in your jurisdiction.   Thanks for looking!"

Also known as the FN-49, this rifle also was bought by various countries and in various calibers. It was used by the Egypt, Indonesia, Brazil, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Argentine, Congo, Colombia and probably some other countries. It was also tested in the USA and Great Britain. The development of the new semiautomatic rifle began at the FN in the late 1930s under the leadership of the famous firearms designer Dieudonne Saive. The work at FN was suspended during the German occupation of the Belgium, but Saive and his team managed to escape to UK and continued to work there during the German occupation of Belgium. Assoon as Belgium was liberated, Saive returned home and resumed work on the new rifle. As noted before, new rifle was ready in the late 1940s and was quickly adopted by the numerous armed forces. It was a fine design, made from high quality materials and with great skill, but somewhat too expensive and it soon became obsolete, especially with the appearance of its direct descendant, the famous FN FAL rifle.
The SAFN-49 is a gas operated, semi-automatic, magazine fed rifle. Selective version of this rifle was manufactured in noticeable quantities, but, owing to its powerful ammunition and small magazine it was probably an unsuccessful attempt. SAFN-49 used a short-piston stroke gas drive, with gas camber and a gas piston-tappet located above the barrel. The gas piston has its own separate return spring. The tilting bolt is linked to the bolt carrier, and tilts down to lock into the floor of the milled steel receiver. Charging handle is mounted at the right side of the bolt carrier and reciprocates when gun is fired. The SAFN-49 is fed from non-detachable, box magazine that holds 10 cartridges. Magazine can be loaded through the receiver opening with loose cartridges or standard 5-rounds stripper clips. Magazine has a bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round from magazine is fired. The gas chamber features a gas regulator which also can be used as a gas cut-off, which is required to fire rifle grenades. Barrel is equipped with muzzle flash hider and a bayonet mount. The single-piece stock is made from wood and has a semi-pistol grip and a separate upper handguard. Front sight is mounted on the gas chamber and is protected by two side ""wings"", rear sight is of adjustable diopter type and is mounted at the rear of the receiver. Special scope mount can be installed at the left side of the receiver. The safety switch is located just above the triggerguard at the right side of the gun. When safety is engaged, the safety switch lever protrudes into the triggerguard to interfere with trigger finger, so the state of the safety could be inspected without the single look at it."

with 50 rounds of 325gr Hornady FTX (1700 FPS) Ammo.

Caliber:  .458 SOCOM Chamber

The .458 SOCOM AR is hard to come by and for good reason.  The .458 SOCOM round is capable of stopping anything in North America right in their tracks.  (Hogs, Bears, and truck engine blocks don't stand a chance).  

Here is the Rifles Configuration:  
-  ROCK RIVER ARMS .458 SOCOM MID-LENGTH A4 COMPLETE UPPER HALF with Free Float Steel Hand Guard Tube.
-  Includes complete bolt carrier group and charging handle assembly.   
-  Lower half is a SAA SA-15 ""Grim Reaper"" AR15 Stripped Lower Receiver  (SAA-STPD-Reaper-SA-15)   *(I bought the SAA AR-15 lower at the height of the 'panic' so I’m embarrassed to say what I forked out.) *
-  Lower Receiver has CMMG Lower Parts Kit. 
-  RRA banded Hogue Grip 
-  Hogue Handle Storage Adapter (Fits inside our Hogue AR/AK Monogrips complete with battery cradle that can store 3 SureFire 123A, 2 AA batteries or 4 2032 batteries
-  RRA adjustable stock (with RRA special 1"" thick soft rubber butt stock pad – you’ll be glad it’s on there.)
-  Comes with 50 rounds of 325gr Hornady FTX (1700 FPS) Ammo.  (New high quality .458 SOCOM factory rounds with new brass).
-  1 PMAG Magazine included.

All items are brand new.  Round count is zero on both upper and lower.

Rock River Arms (RRA) .458 SOCOM Complete Uppers Halves work with common AR-15 other lowers.  

The 458 SOCOM uses normal AR hand guards and optics.  The SOCOM requires no specialty aside from upper and also uses standard AR-15 parts and tools!

I really like the 458 SOCOM and will circling back to replace it at a later date.  My main reason for selling it is to make moves to aid in buying a few NFA items before governances change and make them harder to get.

$1,349 or OBO

I need to put the below to quantify my early iteration of the ad:

I will consider selling the Complete upper only with Ammo.  Make me an offer.  

(Please understand when I say sell that means cash offer for the upper + ammo.  Please do not offer me trades on only the upper.  I am not entertaining those offers.  (And if you make an offer and don't hear back it's probably because you low balled me.  Hold your breath and continue waiting.  It helps - me anyways.)

I am open to trading the completed RRA AR-15 (not just the upper) for the select guns in the list below but deals need to be for trades of equal value.  To be clear that means just because your gun is on the list below doesn't mean I will take your $550 gun in full trade for the .458 SOCOM; you would need additional cash or multiple firearms for your side to even out the trade."

The name “Pug” may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (“much in little”) in reference to the small and convenient size. Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1” heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark. Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm “leash” on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite.

 The pedigree is pure North American Arms. Quantities are limited and available for only a short time.

 As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

It has been shot sparingly and used for rifle training for my son.  He has since moved on to an AK-47 like dad and since we don't own an acreage to snipe varmints it is for sale.

It comes with everything pictured.  Factory 10 round mag and an additional Remington 25 round mag.  Both feed perfectly.  More importantly that is 453 rounds of CCI Mini-Mags, in my opinion the best .22LR you can get short of crazy expensive match-grade stuff.  You get the gun with the scope, the mags, and enough ammo to start a caddyshack grade war with any rodents.  Cash price is 200 firm.  Budsgunshop.com (best prices) has this gun for $204 then add an FFL transfer, ammo (good luck finding it), and the extra mag.  My cash price is a very good deal, I don't believe in trying to hose good people over.

Ammo is fresh range brass 115gr FMJ 500 rounds new in the box.

I became too attached to Berettas like the one I carried in Iraq so I now have a 92A1 and no longer need this Glock.  I saw a new Glock gen 3 this week at Academy for $529 then add tax, buy an extra Glock factory mag and then spend a few weeks trying to find affordable 9MM ammo and my price becomes a very good deal on a super reliable gun.  Cash price is firm and is the most I am willing to lose on it.  Can afford to keep it but there is a super expensive 686 SW revolver I have on hold right now at a gun shop to buy and I really want it.  If you don't need ammo I would do just the gun+3mags, box, etc for $500 cash.  Ammo is not for sale separately I have other guns I can use it in.

I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one.  I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying.  Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five.  If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

(The .300 AAC Blackout was designed to give the M4 platform increased power and penetration on intermediate barriers with minimal recoil while retaining the 30-round magazine capacity. It provides excellent terminal performance and accuracy when run suppressed with subsonic or standard ammunition. 

The .300 blackout uses the same mags, BCG, lower, and upper parts as a standard AR15, literally the only thing you have to change to convert a standard AR15 to a .300 blackout is change out your barrel.)

Flash Hider-

The AAC Brakeout Flash Hider Muzzle Brake combines the best features of AAC's Blackout flash hiders and Blackout muzzle brakes into a single, high performing unit. The Breakout's rear muzzle brake chamber is open on both sides and on the top for reduced perceived recoil & muzzle rise, yet closed on the bottom for minimal environmental disturbance when shooting from the bench or prone positions. The 3-prong front end incorporates elements of the Blackout flash hider's effective design to minimize muzzle flash. All Breakout flash hider muzzle brakes are machined from high strength aerospace 17-4 stainless steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish. 

This 51T Brakeout works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

My research shows it comes with 2 magazines and according to internet, these extra magazines are fetching $90 per steel 556 mags.  According to online sources (Gunbroker, etc) I am asking a fair price for a lightly used Norinco 84S-1 AKM underfolder.
I am not in a hurry to sell this. If this ad is posted then the rifle is available. Buyer must have valid OH ID and meet FTF at location of my choosing."

Feel free to email me for the video footage of my function test at the range.  Local buyer can meet face to face for sale.  Outside of driving range will have to be shipped to an FFL.

The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement. Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. 


Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.

Snag-Free, Modular Design, Loaded with Features

The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.


Reliable, Pleasant to Shoot and Easy to Maintain

This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.



Whether it is for official military and law-enforcement use, for home defense and concealed carry or as an accurate and high-quality pistol for recreational shooting, the PX4 Storm is one piece of gear that will never let you down. It is also available in stainless steel, compact and sub-compact versions--making this line even more versatile for a variety of uses."

It is chambered in .32 centerfire.  I believe it was made in the 1890's, and it has a beautiful patina.  It is in good enough condition that it may be shootable; but you will have to use your own judgement on that.  On full lockup the cylinder has some play, but a lot less play than any other revolver of this vintage that I have had.  The hammer spur folds up and out of the way to give it a similar profile as a bobbed hammer.  Pretty slick little setup.  The bore has some pitting, but again not as much a most guns of the vintage.  The rifling is still easily visible.  This is a complete, functional, all matching #s revolver.  The action is smooth, but could use a good oiling.  Great collector's piece.

It has top and bottom rail for all your gizmos and gadgetry, has vey light and crisp single action trigger and comes in the box with manual.  I got the Rhino described as unfired and that appeared to be the case when I went to clean it, but if it has been fired, it was very little.  I've yet to shoot it myself, but have read the recoil is very light because of the design, only selling/trading because I have several other .357 mags.  It was carried and has a some handling marks and a couple small spots in finish on the edges, you can barely see in the pic, I would still say overall excellent condition.  This one is very comfortable in the hand IMO, and is pretty light as well, much lighter than it looks.  Here are the specs:  http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/prod uct/details.cgi?pdesc=Chiappa-Rhino-Handgun&i=721097&r=view&siteID=je6NUbp ObpQ-clH21eaGFFT2WqpaotubFA  

$920 cash or will look at good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

Not in need of anything at all right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of since I know cash can be tight for folks, not limited to:

Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers or complete rifles in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf or .450 Bushmaster would be cool. 
Daewoo
Colts 
FAL 308/7.62 
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers. 
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal.
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one. 
Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power range.  Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top, maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm or other 1-6x optics.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,
.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

I do not HAVE to sell, just trying to make room in a crowded safe, I just don't need an extra safe queen right now.

The price is firm, so please don't ask, I will not take less.

$2000- CASH ONLY! I will throw in 300 rounds of target ammo in the Remington STS hulls that can be reloaded many, many times. This ammo is worth a couple hundred bucks easily.

As far as a trade, it would have to be something really juicy, and tipped in my favor.

Please call REDACTED

When I say ""good"" condition, I mean that the original bluing is still on the gun and in mostly good shape. There is some wear on the receiver and barrel. I'm not a professional grader, but I would put it around 80%. Mechanically, it is 100%. The leather buffer in the back of the receiver is present and looks to be in good shape. The wood stock and handguard are in excellent shape, no cracks. It is a full choke barrel that I measured to be 27"" from the receiver to muzzle. Takes 2 3/4"" or 3"" shells. According to the date code on the barrel (""ERR""), this gun was manufactured in October, 1946 and has a 7xxxxx serial number. I had the intention of cutting down the barrel and making it into a home defense shotgun but decided to go another way. I'd like to get $400 out of this OBO. I would also consider trades, especially a home defense/tactical shotgun. Would prefer a semi-auto, but will consider pumps (especially a Remington 870). Will consider other pistols and rifles too.

Buck Mark Pistols. Rimfire pistols, built the Browning way.
Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX™ and Ultragrip DX™ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes

NH purchasers must provide ccw or ffl transfer. Will ship to out of state ffl for cost of shipping. Gun has been test fired with factory and hand loaded ammunition, and inspected by a gunsmith.

For those unfamiliar with this superb cartridge, the following is some information shamelessly plagiarized from variety of sources, and one of my pictures is a photograph showing the difference between the 5.56 (.223) and 6.8 cartridges.

6.8 info:
The 6.8 SPC (6.8x43mm) was initially developed by MSG Steve Holland and Chris Murray, a United States Army Marksmanship Unit gunsmith, to offer superior downrange lethality over the 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington in an AR pattern service rifle with minimal loss of magazine capacity and a negligible increase in recoil. 

The 6.8 SPC is capable of pushing a .277 caliber, 85gr bullet to over 2900 FPS. 110gr bullets easily achieve 2500 FPS with factory loaded ammunition. Appropriate hand loading can achieve even higher velocities and enable the use of heavier projectiles up to 130 grains, which dramatically improves terminal ballistics over a 5.56 Nato/.223 Remington at long range.

The 6.8X43 was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

For hunters, the 6.8 SPC cartridge is a significant improvement over the 5.56 (.223) cartridges currently available in the AR-15 platform. The latter cartridges fall below .243 caliber, which is what many counties and states in the USA have chosen as the smallest caliber legal to humanely take medium sized game such as coyotes, wild hogs, deer, black bear, caribou, and small- to medium-sized elk. It is gaining popularity among hog/boar hunters. By adopting 6.8 SPC, a hunter also gains the ability to use the AR-15 platform for hunting out to 300–400 yd (depending on load and chamber, out of a 16"" barrel, further with longer barrel)."

The Smith and Wesson Model 39 was a semi-automatic pistol developed for the US Army service pistol trials of 1954.[1] After the Army abandoned its search for a new pistol, the Model 39 went on the civilian market in 1955 and was the first of Smith & Wesson's first generation semi-automatic pistols. Used by the Illinois State Police and the US Navy SEALs, it was a groundbreaking pistol for use with the military and law-enforcement agencies.

Very few rounds put through it since new (Approx. 40). Excellent Condition. Wouldn't be selling it if I didn't need the cash.

Sorry I am unable to accept trades.

 If you low ball me, you are wasting your time, my time, and most likely will antagonize me so if you come back with my price later I probably won't sell it to you. I don't play that game, suggest you don't if you want this firearm. The government does a great job of robbing us, we don't need to do the same to each other.
