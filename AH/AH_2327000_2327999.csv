The SR9C is one of the slimmest and most ergonomic 9mm pistols on the market today, and the compact model offers an even smaller, more concealable option, ideal for discreet carry. 

The SR9C compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. 

The SR9C compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9C is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or blackened finish.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

For sale is a
1969 4"" nickel colt python with original near mint (safe queen) grips.
Python only shot twice at the range by me. Prior to that it looked nearly flawless, appeared unfired, but the range trip has resulted in small nickel flaking off the cylinder after my first trip to the range, otherwise perfect. Colt could refinish cylinder for $150 which is what I'll do if I do not sell. Perfect lock up and timing, trigger smooth as wiping your ass with silk. Two inch group at 75 yards.

For sale is a
1969 4"" nickel colt python with original near mint (safe queen) grips.
Python only shot twice at the range by me. Prior to that it looked nearly flawless, appeared unfired, but the range trip has resulted in small nickel flaking off the cylinder after my first trip to the range, otherwise perfect.

Puttin this up for now to see how it goes. This was my placeholder M27 until I got another. Tikka barrel, made in 1928. Bolt and receiver match. Bluing is good, bore is how these usually are a little dark but still has shine and strong rifling. Stock has the usual wartime dings and dents but it does have the swivel style sling mount on the bottom of the butt. No cracks or structural damage. Nice solid rifle. NOTE: the bluing is actually a lot darker in person. The way the sun is hitting the metal in the last pic makes it look a lot more like a dull gray vs a flat black.

Made entirely of forged steel, yet is extremely lightweight and has very manageable recoil. This gun was manufactured in 1956, and you won't find a modern shotgun as reliable as this one right here. Ejects and feeds only from the bottom of the receiver, 4+1 capacity, and a modified 18"" barrel. It is outfitted with a Choate pistol grip, making this shotgun perfect for home defense, as it is very compact. Compatible with 2 3/4in. Shells ONLY. I also do not suggest using anything but No. 8 and 9 birdshot loads. As I've stated in the title and above, the barrel is modified. The receiver is drilled and tapped at 45 degrees, with a mount in place. Very crisp rifle-like trigger pull, safety button located rearward of the trigger. This gun has been kept clean religiously, but shows minor wear on the bluing. Will send pictures only to serious buyers. E-Mail me anytime and will respond as fast as I can."

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass-reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The USA."

I purchased this one for my wife to carry as she loved mine, then she decided to file for divorce last week. Im not desperate to sell this but I see no need to keep two.

It also has the 2 standard 10 rd mags, with 2 additional 12 rd mags with collars. It has 2 holsters (1 Fobos, 1 Bulldog) Has keys, case, cleaning brush and speedloader. Here is the price breakdown of what I have invested in the pistol/gear.

Taurus PT145 Millennium w/Stainless Slide ($379.99)
2 Extra Taurus 12 rd mags ($38.99 x 2 = $77.98)
Taurus Collars for 12 rd mags ($6.99)

Federal Premium Low Recoil 165g JHP Hydra-shok  20rds ($24.99)

That total comes to $692.89 BEFORE tax. Now I'm not trying to recapture my money here. I realize all these items are now consider ""used""except the ammo. I'm a realistic person, and I would take $550.00 OBOB for everything. That's $140.00 less than what I paid before tax. Shoot me an offer and we can go from there. This gun has an AWESOME trigger pull. It's small and light, and you can't get 12 rds of 45ACP in many guns this small. 

*This model is discontinued so they are harder to find now. The new series 2 has not relased the .45 yet only the 9mm and 40cal. Taurus has an amazing LIFETIME warranty that follows the gun to whomever has it in their possession. This is a private party sale so you do NOT need a PTC or PTP. You MUST be 18 yrs old, and willing to do a bill of sale that will include your DL #.
