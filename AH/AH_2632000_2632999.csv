I did a power search on Armslist for all United States to determine market value of this od green 27. This is the only Gen 4 listed for all USA. There are several Gen 3 models and dealers are asking upwards of 650 for these. Yes it is still just a Glock 27 but finding an OD green Gen 4 might be more challenging. 

Previous trade agreement that I had for this pistol did not work out from other guys end, so this 27 is back on the market.

All are new in their original packaging. There are no rounds fired through these. I am parting ways with them due to a modification I made to my 1911. 

When I modified my 1911 with a Wilson Combat Magazine Well the dimensions of the magazine's plastic component would not allow the magazine to seat properly. This was due to the magazine well coming into contact with the plastic part of the CM magazine and stopping the magazine from positively engaging in the pistol grip.

I am asking $45 for all three magazines and, if you are not local to me, $7 on top of that for shipping and handling through USPS Priority.

-Youâre ready to learn how to SHOOT â or-
-You want to brush up on your existing handgun skills â or -
-You are ready to begin taking your personal safety to the next level!!


Carolinas First Defense âLadies on the Rangeâ classes are taught by Jesse and Jennifer Saucier. We compete in practical shooting events on local, national and world-wide levels.

 We want to focus on getting more women out to the shooting range! We have seen a recent influx of women at our local range, but they are usually watching their âsignificant otherâ shoot. We think that if you are going to take time out of your busy day to go to the range, you may as well be shooting your own gun!

 If this concept of shooting (and no longer just watching) interests you, please take a look at our class schedule. All of our scheduled events on this page are for WOMEN ONLY! Our shooting environment is low-key, safe, supportive, and a lot of fun! We have purposely made these classes smaller, by limiting each class to six ladies, because we want everyone to get the one-on-one assistance that you deserve. 

 Why Do We Offer This Class?

 -To ASSIST women with firearms safety and basic to advanced pistol instruction. 
-To EMPOWER women with the knowledge & confidence required to shoot a handgun proficiently. 
-To INCREASE the number of responsible women firearm owners.  There are far too many women at the range       watching their âsignificant othersâ enjoying the sport. 
-To ENCOURAGE women to get out of their comfort zone and compete in organized shooting sports. 
-To EDUCATE women about firearms ownership and the importance of our Second Amendment Right.

 âLadies on the Rangeâ Class Information

 -Our âLadies on the Rangeâ class is for any woman who is a beginner and inexperienced with shooting.
-The âLadies on the Rangeâ class may also appeal to women that want to brush up on their basic Pistol       Skills.
-If you have your CCW and want to expand your knowledge of shooting, this class is a good start!
-No previous pistol / shooting experience required.
-You must be 21 years of age or older to enroll.  16 â 20 year olds may be conditionally accepted, but parents must be present at all times during the class.

 The following areas are discussed during this course:

 *Range Safety Rules 
*Gun Safety Rules 
* Fundamentals of Pistol Marksmanship
* The Draw and Proper Presentation to the Target
* Reloading Drills
* Malfunctions
* Firing Multiple Shots on One Target
* Training Methodology and Drills

 CLASS SIZE

 Openings are limited to  6â 8 students, based on group experience and individual skills. If the class is full, we will notify you of other optional dates. 

 CLASS TIMES

 This class is a four-hour class and starts promptly at 8 a.m. and will end around 12 p.m., or our afternoon class begins at1 p.m. to 5 p.m..

 CLASS COST

 $100.00 per person if you bring your own revolver or pistol, magazines, 150 rounds of ammo, and holster.
-OR-
$135.00 per person, which includes the ârentalâ of a .22 caliber pistol, magazines, ammo and holster.

Cleaning Rod                     -   $10

Total Value:                     - $565 plus tax

So you'll get over $565 worth of gun fun for only $370. Sounds like a great deal to me!

I've heard of people using these to bury cashes in them for safe keeping; they seem strong enough but I don't know.

They are surplus and have the usual wear and tear.  They have 8 carrying handles and LOTS of butterfly latches.   Designed to be water/air tight and have a pressure equalizer button built in.  Honestly, I do not know if they are still water/air tight.  I've shot the seams with a hose and they've kept the water out but I don't have a pool to dunk them in.

This pistol has been assembled from new in box, quality parts and no corners were cut in the assembly process.  I built this with the goal of having an AR-15 Pistol with a barrel length less than 10.5"" that would feed any type of ammunition, use mostly standard parts, and be reliable enough for any purpose including self-defense.  I've shot 6 to 10 magazines of various ammunition through it including: 55gr FMJ, 62gr XM855, 70gr Barnes TSX, and 77gr Sierra Match King.  All types have cycled reliably with no problems.  The gas block was professionally fitted and installed to the barrel using a manual mill to bore the block to a machined fit and to precisely dimple the bottom of the barrel to accept and lock in the set screws. This ensures the best fit possible and a gas block installation that will never shift. All parts were installed using the correct drivers/pin punches and the barrel nut has been torqued to spec.

The gun will also come with a pair of USGI aluminum magazines.

Asking $1000 OBO.

Buyer MUST provide NC ID, CCW or Pistol Purchase Permit, and Sign a Bill of Sale.

This rifle is 100% original with the original cartouche marks on the stock. It is fully functional and everything is intact and works as it should. I bought this rifle in 1987 when the Firearms Protection Act of 1986 allowed the importation of surplus military rifles into our country again. This rifle is from the first batch of imports from that era and these early imports were hand picked and were the best of the bunch. I removed the cosmoline this rifle came packed in, wiped it down, and fired 20 rds of non corrosive ammo thru it for a functions check, everything worked as it should and it shot a very tight respectable group. I then cleaned the bore, applied a light coat of oil to everything, then put it into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat largely untouched since. This rifle is complete, fully intact, fully function, shoots to point of aim and has not been modified, restored, or altered in anyway from its original configuration. The condition of this rifle is far above that of most M1917s I have seen; the blueing is very nice, there is no rust, the stock is in very good original condition, and 27 years ago I put a US milspec leather sling on it that still looks like the day it was made. The bore has no pitting or rust that I can see with a bore light and the rifling is excellent; the lands and grooves and sharp and crisp. You will not be disappointed with this rifle. I am retiring and have way too many guns than I can take with me when I move so I am selling the last and best of my military rifle collection. I will meet buyer between Charlotte Hall and Upper Marlboro for a FTF cash and carry deal during daylight hours in a public setting, buyer must be MD resident or active duty military living in MD. This sale has no tax, no shipping or transfer fees, no paper work, no govt registration, and it is available now, and this transaction is 100% legal in the state of Maryland. Buyer must be a MD resident who is not prohibited by law from owning firearms or active duty military living in MD.

I easily have $300 into everything pictured, will sell for $225 cash.  Lowball offers will be laughed at and ignored.  FTF transaction and I will travel a reasonable distance for serious buyer.  Please include a # I can reach you at and I will respond quickly.  I will not respond to vague emails asking if its still available, etc.  Thanks!"

Beretta Nano 9mm Compact Pistol with Matte Black Finish, 3 Dot Sights â JMN9S15
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a fully removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nanoâs extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanoâs magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nanoâs sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

I am seeing them on the Gunbroker.com go for a LOT more than this I think. Check them out and see. These have always been expensive rifles, and they are even more-so now that Remington has bought out Marlin. This is a real Marlin though and is a quality rifle. 

I would rather that it go to a local New Mexican here than an auction, so I will list it for a few days. If nobody wants it, I'll take it to the auction online. Pictures show the rifle without the original white line spacers installed. Fortunately the previous owner was conscientious enough to include them when I bought the rifle. I never reinstalled them just because I liked the way it looks better without them. They will come with the rifle, or I can just install them before you pick it up. 

Condition is almost perfect except for one thing. The rear swivel has been relocated back about 1 1/2 inches. The original hole has been nicely plugged with a polished wooden peg. It is only visible from the bottom, and fits quite well. Anyone who wants to change it should be able to put a wood screw in it and then pull it out. I was told it is a friction fit on that plug. The original seller/owner is a friend of mine and I have absolutely no reason to doubt him since he has always been a straight shooter to me.

 Other than that , I would rate the rifle at about 99%. Bore is perfect, no scratches on the metal, etc. I never actually bench rested it, but I do recall shooting Coke cans regularly at 100 yards with no problem. It is right in there with my old Winchester Model 62A in that department. Empty shotgun shells offhand at 25 yards are so little challenge that I moved them out to 50. These rifles hang well, and if you are considering it, you probably already know that. I have never taken it hunting and neither did the previous owner, so it has no field dings or briar scratches, etc. It is a nice rifle, and other than the plug repair it looks brand new.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and we can arrange to meet. I no longer put my number in these ads because of all the Nigerian scammers out there. They will email me but I won't even reply. You shouldn't either, since they are just looking for your email address or phone number.

At any rate, thanks for reading my ad. If I didn't already have a thousand dollar .22 plinker, I would keep this one. I will miss it for sure.

It comes with the case, manuals, 2 backstraps, 3 13 round magazines, two of which have the pinky flip down, and magazine loader.

Some basic features of the weapon are that the safety/decocker is ambidextrous, the magazine release is swappable to left or right shooter, the back straps are swappable, and the trigger pack is easy to remove for cleaning. Since it is hammer fired, DA trigger it gives you second strike ability. The SA/DA trigger is very good. It has a short rail for a light, and finger memory dimples for training.  The barrel is stainless steel to protect it from sweat."

I detailed the interior and fixed numerous other ""cosmetic"" things. I removed the remote starter and aftermarket radio. I have 2 factory radios (not installed) that come with.

I've noticed a tranny fluid leak and the truck doesn't seem to do well going over 20-25mph. to get it home you'd have to fix it here or tow it (or drive 25mph the whole way). If you have mechanical knowledge then you may be able to get her fixed and up and running well again in no time. and I have no time lol right now to do anything with it. before it sits any longer...come and rescue this truck! Could be a great farm workhorse. it could easily be parted out for well over $1000 if that's what you're in to...or it might be an easy fix. I'm honest and easy to get along with and I'm negotiable. You can come take a good long look at her any time you want.

Hello all and thanks for viewing. I am selling my blued Ruger Super Blackhawk .44 magnum with a 7.5 inch barrel. This gun is an excellent shooter that is incredibly accurate with less than a 4lbs trigger pull. I have shot this firearm plenty; at least 400 rounds down range with zero malfunctions. It is reliable and very powerful being a .44 magnum. 

It is in excellent condition with all parts working perfectly. Has some light wear areas around the barrel and grips but has been well taken care of  and still has a deep bright shinny bore. It has no rust or pitting , I keep all my firearms well oiled. 

I am asking $550 dollars for the firearm and will include a very nice $100 custom leather holster for free along with the firearm. Also comes with a padlock and a soft gun case for transportation to and from the range. Need FFL transfer and must be local. Thanks again for viewing. You can reach me at either through the e-mail associated through this listing or by calling (951) three one zero, 02 zero four. Thanks and hope to hear from you soon, Dav."

OUR TERMS and CONDITIONS;
Buyer must be 18 years old for long guns.  You must be legally able to own or possess a firearm. You must secure a current FFL in your State of residence and in your area for us to ship the firearm to. I will only ship this firearm to an FFL. I will need a legible copy of his FFL with dealer ID, signature and expiration date. If I can't read it or I can't check it out or it is not clear and legible I will not ship the firearm. Please have your FFL put the buyer/owners full name, home address, home phone number, and his information on the FFL for our records and so I can match the buyer to the FFL and to the firearm.

I am a Federal Firearm Licensed Dealer. You must abide by all Local, State and Federal Laws and it is YOUR responsibility to know your local laws before buying. Not my responsibility! There will be a 25% re-stocking fee if the firearm cannot be delivered as agreed on any canceled or returned item after payment.  Shipping will be paid to and from by you accepting the firearm and on any return firearm.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out. Your payment, by cash, Personal Check, Certified Check, USPS Money Order, and now we accept Credit Cards as well. I wouldn't recommend cash but if you must send cash, go ahead, I'm honest and will accept cash as your payment.  Personal Checks must clear my bank and I will not ship until I get confirmation your check has cleared, usually about a 7 to 10 day wait after deposit. Certified Checks must also clear but usually have a shorter wait time. USPS Money Orders must also clear but usually very fast and sometimes I can cash them at the Post Office. All major Credit Cards are accepted, except Discover, but you must call me to give me your CC information, number, expiration date, CCV and Name on the card. There is a 3% up-fee/surcharge on Credit Cards on the full amount including shipping but as soon as the funds show up in my account I will ship. Usually about 24 hours.

Your payment is due in our hands or account within 7 calendar days after you agree to buy.  NO excuses, NO extensions accepted. Call me or e-mail with your information. If you do not pay within the 7 days as agreed I will re-post this firearm.  Your call or e-mail will not change this. Longuns, Rifle, or Shotguns  etc., firearms will be shipped UPS Ground for $38.00, paid by you so add to the amount of the firearm, and Alaska is an extra $10.00 with a signature required on all firearms. Insurance and other shippers are optional and may cost extra.  I almost always add insurance to the shipping.

The name of my company is ""Gid-R-Dun Rod and Gun"" and we will Gid-R-Dun!

Please if you cannot or will not pay on time please don't tell me you will.

Also note that we will provide prompt service and ship as soon as the funds and  confirmation allows us to do so. I will attempt to ship within 2 business days after your payment is confirmed and I have a legal FFL in my hands and I have verified his FFL.

We reserve the right to end this sale early at any time if there are no inquiries or e-mails regarding this sale.  If you want to buy this firearm please let me know ASAP.  The first person to contact me has the first right of refusal.  I will only take this firearm off the site when I have money in hand for the purchase.  Only then will the firearm be taken off our shelf waiting for your payment to clear. This firearm will remain on our ""For Sale"" shelf until that time. Please ask all questions before buying. My name is Brad, REDACTED or e-mail me at REDACTED

I support the NRA and so should you. Membership is $35.00 for one year but I can sign you up for one year for $25.00 and I'll pay the extra $10.00 for the one-year membership. We need the NRA more than ever right now so I urge you to join if you are not already a member.  If you are not a member and sign up through me ask about our extended NRA discount on this sale.

If you don't want to lose your gun rights and you don't want more Government CONTROL, and you want to be able to buy guns and ammunition, and you want your gun stores to stay in business, - JOIN THE NRA!!!  Let's vote them out of there, and ""God Bless America""
If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales tax, on top of everything else. You can come into my shop and buy direct and save the shipping if you live in Washington State but read everything above.  You will need to fill out a form 4473 and pass a background check if you want to come in and buy direct.

I will not ship anything anymore to CA, MD, Hawaii, DC, NY, NJ, MA, Colorado or Connecticut now, or some cities in Illinois. Not my problem that you live there. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know the laws of your area, local, City, State or Federal. If this firearm is illegal for you to own in your area, you will be charged a 25% re-stock fee if your FFL Dealer cannot transfer to you. Not my problem. You will pay shipping to and from.  Thanks for looking!

SPECS: 

The SM25004 LoPro Green Laser and Flashlight Combo Features the same low-profile design thatâs currently available only to military personnel, Sightmarkâs LoPro Combo delivers optimal precision accuracy and versatility for a minimal price. This multi-functional laser and flashlight device can be mounted on a picatinny or weaver rail either in front of a riflescope without interference with field of view or on the side of the quad rail. Its 220 lumen LED flashlight can be used for clearing a room or quickly spotting targets in pitch black darkness, and the laser is offset for clearing front sight post.

The LoPro Combo is equipped with push button and pressure pad operation, simplifying use and allowing the operator to quickly place the light where needed. Featuring 1 MOA-click adjustments, the hand adjustable windage and elevation turrets permit the user to zero in the laser dot for close-range shooting. Visibility ranges from 50 yards in the daytime to 600 yards at night. Constructed of high performance thermoplastic, the LoPro Combo yields a weather resistance rating of IPX6, making it exceptionally reliable in a wide range of harsh climates. Built for durability in tactical scenarios, the unit is also resistant to 1,000Gâs of maximum recoil
