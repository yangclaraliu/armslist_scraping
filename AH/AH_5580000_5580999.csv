A few things I would not mind having more of right now would be, Beretta CX4 9mm Carbine that takes 92 mags or even the PX4 and I'll get the $20 adapter.  Might consider the .45ACP model just for the heck of it.  Stripped AR-15 or AR-10 lowers(Spikes, RRA, Mega, Seekins or similar billet or forged), lower parts kits without trigger parts, nice triggers single and/or two-stage, buffer, tubes, springs, stocks and lightweight rails.  Will also trade for a Kel-Tec SU-16C, wanting the ""C"" model only.
Ammo in the common rifle and pistol calibers(no .40S&W please) to help complete a deal, but I have plenty, so not in need of any specific caliber.1oz. silver bars, rounds or Eagles and grams of gold.  Please check current prices, the value of the metals need to equal the cash price.Maybe optics like Eotech and Aimpoints with nice magnifiers, just give me the model and trade details.Ftf in the Garland area only or will ship to TX resident for $30 more.  Must be able to legally own a firearm in TX.Thanks for looking!"

https://youtu.be/g6e2im4uoQo
  Concealment:
 
 The .FIVE-O Holster offers the ultimate in concealability.  This appendix-carry style holster, favored by SpecOps military personnel, is literally invisible when worn without a jacket or shirt, and is virtually undetectable except with the most complete pat down.
 
 Rapid Withdrawal: The Holster derives its name from its amazing speed of withdrawal that enables the weapon to be drawn and fired within half a second or less.
 
 Mobility: The .FIVE-O Holster offers maximum mobility. Because the holster fits below the waist, it even provides for rapid withdrawal when seated.  The position of the weapon also allows for ease of movement when running, sitting, or engaged in defensive measures.  And because it accommodates most large and medium frame pistols, with a left or right-handed shooter, it eliminates the need for purchasing multiple holsters for different handguns. 
 
 Comfort: The holster is designed for extreme comfort to allow the user to wear it all day with no downside effects.  Medical professionals endorse the appendix-carry style as a proven method to prevent chronic back ache and fatigue typically caused by wearing a side-holster, or worse, a middle-of-the-back holster. 
 
 Specifications:• .FIVE-O Holster Face and Buckles: Ultrahigh molecular weight, High-density (H.D.) polyethylene compound• Belt: 51cm-152cm length. Polyester/Polypropylene/Nylon• Magazine receiver and Velcro fasteners: Heavy duty Poly/Spandex and Polypropylene fibers• Tan or Black color selection
 
 WEARING INSTRUCTIONS:
 
 1. Adjust the JJ Racaza Ultimate Concealment Holster TM belt around waist for a comfortable fit. 2. Top of holster MUST be at the same level as top of waistband of trousers/shorts. Allowing the top of trousers/shorts to extend above the holster will prevent a smooth pistol draw. 3. Insert pistol inside the holster, ensuring that pistol trigger guard rests fully against holster post. 4. Pistol sight must be braced by the holster brace located on the left or right side of holster. 5. Once inserted, adjust pistol to prevent the barrel from interfering with sitting/walking/running.
 
 CAUTION:  TRIGGER FINGER MUST BE OFF TRIGGER WHILE INSERTING PISTOL TO AVOID SERIOUS INJURY.
 
 DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS
 
 1. Push the pistol barrel upward with the WEAK hand. 2. Once the pistol grip passes above the waistband, grasp the grip with the STRONG hand.
 
 Frequent practice will enable a smooth and effortless pistol draw.

EAA SAR B6P Sarsilmaz Compact 9mm Semi-automatic Handgun. ""No wall flowers at EAA."" That's one of EAA's mottos, and we think it's a good one. So what does it mean? It's simple. It means that EAA builds workhorses that are meant to take abuse and keep on shooting - at a price that makes sense. They make everyday shooters, not expensive ""wall flowers"" or wall-hangers.That's the case with the SAR B6P, an updated take on the iconic CZ75 that's built first and foremost to shoot. First, EAA took the frame and recreated it in polymer. Then, they improved the ergonomics... resulting in a pistol that feels as good in the hand as anything out there. And it's all yours for an amazingly low price. If you want an affordable CZ clone, and if you're looking to stretch your budget to the absolute max, this is your best bet.EAA SAR B6P Sarsilmaz 9mm Semi-automatic Pistol special features:   Made by Sarsilmaz Armory, imported by European American Armory Ergonomic grip fits the hand beautifully Auto firing pin block safety and manual safety  Specifications:   Caliber: 9mm Action: Semi-automatic (single action / double action) Capacity: 13+1 Barrel length: 3.8"" Frame: Polymer Grips: Polymer Sights: Fixed 3-dot Overall length: 7.5"" Overall weight: 25.6 ozs."

If you know about these rifles the price surely got your attention. Unfortunately there is a reason it's not priced at $800+ and that would be because someone put a brake on this, tapped one extra hole on top of the receiver for a scope mount, and put it in a plastic stock. Aside from that this rifle is great. As with all the older Varmint Special rifles it has a wonderfully blued bull barrel, smooth action, and fantastic trigger. I've only had the opportunity to shoot 100 rounds down this particular rifle but it was a fine shooting weapon. A great opportunity to own a fine shooting Remington without the crazy price the BDL Varmint Special rifles usually command. As I am only selling to cover some moving related expenses, I am not interested in trades at this time."

The ak has a few modifications done to it. It has a RS regulate 30mm optic mount with a primary arms red dot. The safety lever has a tab so you can manipulate it with your finger instead of taking your hand off the grip. The magazine release has a ambidextrous tab that can be pushed by your trigger finger to release the mag. The gas tube is kind of a hard to find part. It's a parabellum armorment ratchet charging system. It allows you to charge the ak from the left side of the gas tube like an mp5. It's a rare item you can look up the history of it or email me about it. It's a great system and hopefully they can produce them again in the future but for now there's just a few out there. The hammer and trigger have been worked on to give the gun a much smoother action. The handguard on the ak is one I actually fabricated and fitted with rails for accessories. It's completely sturdy, made from the same structural grade aluminum the m4 handguards are made from. It's lightweight and stays cool. If you don't like it I also have the stock hogue handguard that goes with. Also the stock gas tube comes with. There is 4 Croatian mags with the bolt hold open lips. 1 Korean mag, 1 tapco pmag, and 1 arsenal 10rnd mag. I have over 1200 put into this rifle so please serious offers only. May sell accessories if you want just a certain piece. I know it's a high price for an ak but it has a lot of high price accessories on it and and it's built up. It's also not a pos wasr.
