I am not in a rush to sell this firearm.
If interested and you live in Illinois, I will only sell it to someone 21 or over (its a handgun) and you must have a valid foid card.(no exceptions)
I work at one of the largest gun stores in the US so I know how firearm transactions take place.

Gun is not sighted in. I am willing to drop price by removing Optic.

This carbine is a blast to shoot, simple recoil action means no gas block, gas tube, or 
fouling problems like an AR.  10mm out of this 16"" barrel is really cookin'.  I've enjoyed this gun, but I just don't see myself getting a companion Glock 20, and that was the original plan.  For details, check http://mechtechsys.com/glock.php

I haven't shot this gun much, fewer that 200 rounds.  I have all the cases I fired 
through it, and 175 factory fmj 10mm rounds that are available with the gun.  3 
standard 15 round mags glock mags, factory mag loader, as well as Ghost lightweight 
trigger connector (advertised 3.5 lbs pull).  This is currently installed on the gun, 
easy for you or me to change (comes with original connector).  The Glock receiver is a gen 3 regular G20 (not SF).

Screaming deal at $750 for everything (including ammo).  Open to trades and offers, 
check out the list of what I'm after, but feel free to offer anything.  Worst I'll say 
is 'no'.  Washington ID and CPL required, bill of sale for my records only.  I'd rather not ship but I'm willing to ship it at your cost.

The fact is, I had over 30 people initially email me an offer. Most never responded to my email back to them. Looking for trades first. If you have something broken or rusty or neglected, I'm more interested in trades. I have a series 70 mark IV nickel plated. Grips are alpaca (Mexican silver) I have looked extensively for grips like this and never seen any, so this is definitely different. Shoots nicely, like every Colt does. 1 Wilson combat mag is the only mag I have. There is normal copper coloring in spots, there is finish flaking on the barrel. I have included pics.
So here is where I am: I would prefer trades. See below for the list I'm interested in. Unless you are very close to me or willing to come here, trade will happen next weekend. What you are trading will have an effect on how far I am willing to travel. If you are in, or come to, Everett, Marysville, or Arlingrton, we can trade today or during the week. If you are not serious, don't waste either of our time.

The Laser:
The Crimson Trace laser for the Smith and Wesson M&P Shield.
This is the model LG-489.
This fits both the M&P Shield for the 9mm and the 40 S&W.
I do not have the box, only the laser itself, the two screws, the two allen wrenches, and the two mini-brushes for the laser.
The battery included works fine.
This laser is easy to activate with the button on the top of the grip which results in a natural, quick, and automatic activation.

The Holster:
This is a Kydex, inside-the-waist holster for the Shield with the laser.
This is a PJ Holster. Take a look at its review on ""Falia reviews"" YouTube video.
This is for a right-handed person.
This holster has a 15 degree cant.
The retention is great and you can adjust with the screws of the holster.
The over-the-belt clip is 1.75 inches.
As you can see from the photos, this has a sweat guard/shield so that the gun does not touch your body.
This is all one single piece of Kydex. As you can see, it is very thin and there is no extra pieces of Kydex hanging out anywhere. As a result, it feels like you are just wearing your gun without any excessive holster material.
Obviously, the gun pictured is only for demonstrative purposes and is not part of the sale.
As you can see from the pictures, there is no damage to any of these items. I'm only selling these since I've realized that I'm just not a laser guy."

This is a great package for a new gun to CCW or IDPA/IPSC competition.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

The gun's condition is about 90%. There is minor holster wear and a couple of small dings. There is no rust at all, and it is kept extremely clean and always fired well lubed with Slide Glide.

I also am including 9 magazines! Each magazine is a 12rd magazine, and each magazine has BRAND NEW Wolff extra strength springs in them. With these springs the mags are like new! New Sig mags are $40 each when you can get them at a good price!

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! High Noon offers an option that is on this holster called ""lining"", and it is basically a synthetic lining that is super slick and reduces holster wear. It also has water repellant properties. This is a $140 holster!

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster . It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

Finally, I will include two boxes of self defense JHP ammunition just to sweeten the deal.

I was originally asking $1,100 for this package - but I want to get this thing sold. I am now only asking $950! With my asking price this low, I am firm on the price."

People who get ignored:
- Shaddy People. This includes asking me to do illegal things, attempting to skip out on a PPT at a licensed FFL, or having an email or saying anything to me that makes it sound as though you are prohibited or incompetent to own a firearm.
- People who ask me to bid on their behalf. I don't mind offers but low balling or asking for me lowest price is annoying.
- Don't just email me your phone number. Between here, GunBroker, Ebay, Calguns.net, AR15.com I am very used to communicating, buying and selling online and I have done it a lot. We can exchange emails and agree on a meeting place and time before I call or send my phone number."

The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. See the pictures.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the hand guard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hard coat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined 16” 1in7 twist barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle."
