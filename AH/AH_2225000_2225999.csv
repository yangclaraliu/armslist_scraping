This is a 2,975 cubic inch capacity waterproof, gas-tight amphibious rucksack - designed to meet the requirement of swimming, diving and submarine lockouts. It provides protection via DUI’s 3-bag concept. The waterproof bag is heavy duty nylon butyl rubber trilaminate. A 1,000-denier Cordura stuff sack is included to store the equipment in to protect the inside of the waterproof bag. The outer Cordura bag takes most of the abuse. All of the straps are sewn to this outer bag so the least amount of stress is placed on the waterproof bag. The bag also includes a zippered weight storage area that incorporates DUI’s patented quick release weight system in the event the weights had to be ditched. This bag is ideal for water and land use.

See http://www.dui-online.com/mil_bag_ruck.htm for more information.

DUI produces gear for the US special forces so you know it’s the best made.  You will occasionally see either the inner or outer bag for sale, but they are always in used condition.  This is the complete system

The Remington 1911 R1 Centennial pairs the historic accuracy, reliability and overall design of the platform with modern manufacturing technology to provide for a pistol that is produced to exacting tolerances tailored for match-grade performance right out of the box. It features a five-inch stainless barrel (1:16 inch twist) with an overall length of 8 1/2 inches. The precision-machined slide and frame, which is joined by custom rosewood grips that include a brass Remington medallion, are constructed from carbon steel and feature a satin black oxide finish that adds protection from both rust and corrosion. The single-action trigger mechanism boasts a crisp trigger with a pull that is rated between just 3 1/2 and five pounds. And though the pistol weighs in at a respectable 38 1/2 ounces, it is easily handled by shooters of all sizes and skill levels. Other features include a beavertail grip safety with checkered memory bumps alongside a manual thumb safety and a dovetailed brass bead front sight. As noted, the pistol is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge and includes two seven-round anti-friction magazines.

This gun was bought from Powder River Precision in Baker City, OREGON. http://powderriverprecision.com
These guys are the XDm gunsmiths of choice for top shooters. The guy who bought it new had it ordered with their in house trigger job, an extended mag release, a Dawson Precision Adjustable Bo-Mar type rear sights w/ green FO front sight. It has a stainless guide rod and comes with five factory magazines. One of the magazines has an new Arredondo extended base pad installed. The factory case with the holster and magazine pouch are included as is and additional holster made by Blackhawk. The grip has had a texture job done to it. Its not too aggressive. 

The original owner left it on consignment with a friend of mine, I bought it to use as a back up gun for USPSA but got another Glock instead. I have shot it enough times to know it runs well.  I have no idea how many rounds were shot thru it but it has plenty of life left in it. It does have holster wear consistent with being used in a plastic holster.  

I have a few more pictures, email me at REDACTED or text at REDACTED.

Gun is in Huntsville, AL.  Looking for a local sale but will ship to your FFL for an additional $30. Your FFL must accept a transfer from an individual. I will not shp to Hi-Cap banned states. No sales to CA…too much of a PITA.

It accepts 20 or 30 round AR-15/M-16 magazines; either metal or polymer. (Pistol comes with one 20 round magazine.) Pistol grip and trigger group swivels 40°s left or right, in order to fit up against your forearm, for left or right handed usage and to expose the front post and rear v-notch sights. This particular pistol has its original AR-15/M-16 hard plastic/Bakelite grip and is in 99% + condition (it is all original, with no modifications. This unit is obviously used and shows some minor wear). Also, located on the butt end of the upper receiver is a sling attachment. The original design was intended as a pilots’/aircrew members’ survival weapon and was to be mounted in/on the back of their seat in airplanes and helicopters. This was intended to afford a pilot or aircrew member a larger weapon than just a small six (6) shot revolver if downed. There were 3 variations, this is one #2 with car flash hider NAM rubber bag AR-15 style safety on the left rear of the lower receiver; and an AR-15/M-16 magazine release button is located on the right lower receiver. Please NOTE: There is NO shoulder stock on this firearm; therefore it is classified as a semi-auto pistol."

Product Description: Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

New for 2010, the Model 92A1 and 96A1 represent Beretta’s evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol.
Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two,these pistols feature:
A. Higher capacity magazines: 17 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. THREE magazines included per pistol.
B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.
C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1’s have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Internal recoil buffer: Increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition.
E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.
F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices."

He was the only owner and has had it approx 2yrs. It has a new Wilson Combat Buffer Spring and new Black Hogue rap around grips. This gun has had a full interior polish job including chamber and feed ramps and will now chamber all jacketed or rubber tipped hollow points. It comes with a Blackhawk CQC SERPA Holster and 4x mags. 2x original Taurus 8rd and 2x Chip McCormick 8rd. This gun is a sweet gun for one of the cheaper 1911's. The only problem with this firearm is cosmetic it has some holster wear on the slide but can be fixed relatively easy.

I know a guy who has 200,000 rounds through one of these Kimber .22's. All he changed were the springs. I bought this to shoot all the time. I am going Glock and buying a Glock .22 conversion kit instead. I am a Wilson Combat 1911 guy and but this Kimber really impressed me. 

This was only fed copper jacket rounds. It feeds nearly any round with reliability. I fired 500 rounds of quality .22 lr ammo through it. This thing runs like a Ferrari! I made standing hits on a head sized target at 100 yards with it. Extremely surprised how accurate it this 1911 is. 

If you want to get really good and actually afford ammo buy this and shoot it often. This is the best .22 on the market and I hope my Glock conversion kit runs as good. This Kimber is built tough to shoot all the time. 

I own mostly high end Wilson Combat 1911's. This Kimber runs just as good! I would keep it but I want to go 100 percent Glock. Need to sell the stuff that i'm not using. My loss is your gain. 

This is the silver model that is stainless steel. I have the factory case, paper work, and 4 Kimber magazines for it. Mags are expensive but I have 4 of them. This gun came as a dedicated .22 and runs like a dream. I would get this also for teaching others how to fire a 1911. My gf didn't know how to fire one and I used to carry a gov't model. This allowed me to show her in case she needed to use my gun. 

Very slight ware as this gun is not even broken in yet! 

Kimber rim fire pistols have the same features and unequaled performance as Kimber center fires. Adjustable sight, bumped beavertail grip safety and extended thumb safety are standard. Aluminum slides and frames make rimfire pistols exceptionally light—ideal for young shooters.

I got this pistol in on trade primarily to prove a point to a few friends that there guns can actually be quite good. It is still in very good condition. I just had it at the range this morning, so depending how long I have it I may clean it before it sells. I put 100 rounds through this gun with no major issues whatsoever. It has had a total of less than 125 rounds through her including my 100. I ran FMJ and JHP through this and it fed both the exact same with no jams for me. Now that I have proven my point to them on this model, I am selling/trading this one to get another one. I am willing to trade up or down and have various other items to sell trade as well. It is in great condition an doesnt show major wear and comes with box, 2 magazines, paperwork, lock, and two keys. I also have ammo for it that could be included for the right price. If you have any questions on it please let me know and we can try and make a deal. My cell is REDACTED (text only please). I am flexible on the price, but please be reasonable and I will do the same. This is sold as is and where is (just like every other one), but still has the paperwork to use jimenez's warranty if needed to in the future. So please ask all the questions you want now so you can be sure you want her. Im not trying to hide anything, just being realistic.
Thanks for your time, and have a great evening.

I have available for sale or trade a Hi-point C9 9mm pistol. I got it in trade to prove a point to my buddys that these can be reliable guns. I put 100 rounds through this gun of FMJ and JHP with no mishaps or problems whatsoever. This gun is still in great condition and will come with one mag. I just had it at the range this morning, so depending how long I have it I may clean it before it sells. All it needs now is a new home and a good cleaning!  I can also include ammo for the right trade or cash offer. I am only selling this to fund getting another one of these kind of guns to continue proving my buddys wrong. I am flexible on price and reasonable so long as you are as well. I am willing to trade up or down and have various other items to sell trade as well. This is a fantastic and inexpensive gun that is actually not bad at all to shoot. Even though it shoots fine for me, this gun is as is, where is, so please ask any questions you have now. Im not trying to trick anyone, im just being realistic. My cell is REDACTED (text only please). I can shoot additional pictures if you want and answer any questions that you want via my cell or email."
