Nice size, very little recoil and of course, it's a Sig. It is used and shows some use and wear around the firearm but nothing that affects the functionality. Makes for a great hunting gun or truck gun. I took a bore shot as you can see it is bright and clean. No issues or pitting. Comes with 1, 8 round Pro-Mag. Only reason I'm selling it is because I wanted to get a semi-auto that I could carry around for just GP but I have to face it, I'm a revolver guy. I just have to live with that. The gun is very accurate at the range at 21' (or 7 yards). I'll even throw in a box of 9mm if you buy at my asking price. Hope that helps."

I had purchased it to shoot in my Berretta Xtrema and never used it. I have since sold the gun and thus have no use for it now.

The tube design of the Comp-N-Choke allows gases to vent through slots creating a braking system which reduces recoil. No special wrench is required. Normally, it can be removed by hand or with any object that will fit the holes in the end of the choke tube (nail, small screwdriver, etc.). It has precision machined slots that grab the wad momentarily to allow shot to separate from the wad before exiting the barrel, improving shot pattern consistency. Comp-N-Choke tubes are made to precise tolerances with high-quality steel. Workmanship is 100% guaranteed.Supported by more than 20 years of research into shotgun ballistic dynamics and tight tolerance computer (CNC) machining, Comp-n-Choke choke tubes deliver more precise, denser patterns to your target."

I hope nobody is dumb enough to fall for this guy's scam.  The most expensive part is the $300 scope that he claims he spend $600 on.  His reasoning for this $1000 gun being worth ""thousands""?  Because it's a $1000 barrel.  That's right, a $1000 barrel on a garbage DPMS lower.

I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

Has been fired 80 times. 50 times 45acp, 30 times 45lc. I will even toss in the rest of the 45lc box of ammo i have. 
Was new unfired when i got it just a few days ago. Has been re-cleaned and frog lubed.


Simple list, simple sell. If you want it get with me. It is in mint shape.
This is one of the last ones out of acusports
the model is
krbn-45wx with rosewood grips. Most of these came with black lamintate grips. Some came with rosewood. 5.5 inch barrel 

The price is 650 and my tax which came to 695.50

data information from a ruger guru on 01/27/2014

this is probobly one of the last accusport guns shipped. or one of a few ruger may have had left from that had shipped to williams shooter supply. there were 1675 of this one from 2005 through 2007. then williams got in on the action and had ruger make 333 more which were shipping into year 2010. Williams has been the exclusive distro since.
end

I called williams and they did not have this serial number, so it had to be one of the accusport ones.

Most of these come with the black laminate grips and not rosewood like this one.

Cosmetic is superb. if I do not sell it today 01/29/2014 by end of the business day have a prospect I might just trade it in on a semiauto i have been looking at at trade n post here in fremont, or an arsenal slr95. Who knows. I do not keep things all that long.


You will not find another one this nice that you can examine yourself. It shoots perfect. It also comes with a 45 acp cylinder as well as the original 45 long colt cylinder. Making this a really great value. The pistol is in like new shape. It was made in 1995. 

cash only, local sale only, no trades. Wifes car needs some work so selling. I just got this a week ago.
I have other pistols for sale also.

Wholesale/dealer cost on all of this, NOT INCLUDING SHIPPING OR TAX is OVER $3500. I was told shipping would be another $500 - $1000 on top of that.

This is truly one of those very rare situations to save a bundle of cash.

I am not an expert in this field but from what I have learned this set up is perfect for a household or apartment building for 1 -- 8 occupants. If there are more people you could either go with more panels or let your backup water heater provide the extra hot water. Either way using this solar hot water system will definitely save you money and will probably pay for itself in just a couple years.

But keep in mind, the average consumer would have to go through a dealer and there is no way to get any of this at dealer cost, without tax, without installation, and without shipping. This is truly one of those very rare situations to save a bundle of cash.

For the above system I am asking $3000.

I am not an expert in this field but from what I have learned this set up is perfect for a household or apartment building for 1 -- 8 occupants. If there are more people you could either go with more panels or let your backup water heater provide the extra hot water. Either way using this solar hot water system will definitely save you money and will probably pay for itself in just a couple years.

I never fired it.  Bore is shiny/strong rifling.  12rd detachable magazine. Bolt, stock, receiver, magazine, rear sight and barrel match.  Everything with numbers. I have more pics on request. The Rifle 7.62mm 2A/2A1 (also known as the Ishapore 2A/2A1) is a 7.62mm NATO (7.62×51) calibre bolt-action rifle adopted as a reserve arm by the Indian Armed Forces in 1963. The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board in India, soon after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.
The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force other than specialized sniper rifles. The Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as "".308 conversions"". In fact, the 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles: they were designed and built right from the outset to fire 7.62mm NATO ammunition.
Due to fluctuating supplies of affordable .303 British ammunition, the Ishapore rifles are becoming increasingly popular with civilian shooters and collectors in Australia, United Kingdom and the United States.
Externally the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifle was based upon (and is almost identical to) the .303 British calibre SMLE Mk III* rifle, with the exception of the distinctive “square” (10 or 12 round) magazine. The rifle was designed to allow the British Pattern 1907 (P'07) sword bayonet to be attached. There were other differences to the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifles that include the use of improved steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62mm NATO round), and a redesigned extractor to cope with the rimless round. Production of these rifles started in early 1960s and is believed to have been discontinued in 1975. The original (2A) design incorporated the Lee-Enfield rear sight which had metric graduations out to 2000 meters. The re-designated ""Rifle 7.62mm 2A1"" incorporated a more realistic 800 meter rear sight. The stock is recycled from the No. 1 Mk. III armory stock, with the addition of a cross screw forward of the magazine well.

This is the shotgun that was sold in Sears stores up until the 1970's I believe, and has a Sears marking on the bottom of the receiver. I am not sure about the exact year, but I would think mid-60's. It is in good cosmetic condition with some scratches on the receiver. These are aluminum which makes refinishing a bit more difficult. The gun shoots VERY nice and everything works exactly like you would expect it to.

I am keeping most of it for myself but I have 3 complete systems for sale plus more hot water equipment like tanks and electronics.

I have 3 complete systems for sale and 1 more that is mostly complete. The systems are from Free Hot Water out of Palo Alto California. Everything is brand new and the system is pretty much all there. All you need as far as I know are the lines that go from the panels to the tank. You can get them at Lowe's, HD, or any plumbing store.

The system includes;
2 -- 5000 series solar collectors
1 -- S400 L 79 gallon tank
1 -- TDC3 Pump station controller
1 -- Expansion tank
1 -- Water tempering valve
1 -- Air vent
1 -- Single line pump station
1 -- Roof flashing
2 -- Tubes of calk
Misc. fittings
Mounting hardware for solar panels (I'm not yet sure how they mount or which hardware you'll need but there is a lot of mounting hardware there. I'm pretty sure I have what you will need.)

The dealer I bought the equipment from told me this would sell for $8000 not including tax or installation. Wholesale/dealer cost on all of this, NOT INCLUDING SHIPPING OR TAX is OVER $3500. I was told shipping would be another $500 - $1000 on top of that.

For the above system I am asking $3500.
(I will help you load it but unfortunately delivery is not an option)

I am not an expert in this field but from what I have learned this set up is perfect for a household or apartment building for 1 -- 8 occupants. If there are more people you could either go with more panels or let your backup water heater provide the extra hot water. Either way using this solar hot water system will definitely save you money and will definitely pay for itself in just a couple years."

BUT - it is great shape, shoots well, and is fairly unusual nowadays. LOL, I know what you are thinking. It's unusual for a reason. WUHG. World Ugliest Handgun!!! SO ugly you will brag to your friends and show it off like I did! This is the Shar-Pei of handguns. Especially to you young guys who are used to Glocks. You must be thinking I am crzay right about now. 

Nope.

This Iver Johnosn is a bit unique in that it is a topbreak, as well as a hand ejector. The rear sight boss is also the catch to open the revolver so it breaks open like a shotgun. Then you eject the emptys with that rod that is under the barrel.  It has a modern sight picture, and the previous owner put a dab of bright orange paint on the rear face of the front sight. I just left it on because it is quite visible, but it will just wipe off if you want it gone. Condition is about 99% to new and it even has some nice swirly factory plastic grips. They are indeed factory, believe it or not. 

All kidding aside (if that is possible with this revolver) it is actually quite well made. I looked it up when I got it, and it was apparently made in 1967 before Iver Johnson fell on hard times. The Iver Johnson Arms and Cycle Works (yep, that was their name) was at one time the largest gunmaker in the US, but they kept making handguns like this long after they were out of style. I originally bought this revolver to keep in my truck, but it turned out to be just too nice for that. I recently sold my collection of Iver Johnson antiques, so it no longer fits my collecting needs.

This is chambered in .38 S&W, not .38 Special. I have a few rounds on hand that will go with it. Last time I was in Ron Peterson's they had boxes and boxes of that ammo, but no .38 Special. So in a way this is a good thing. The .38 S&W uses a bullet that is slightly larger in diameter than a .38 Special in case you didn't know. It is a true .38 where the .38 Special shoots a .357 bullet. Confusing, yes. The .38 S&W came before the .38 S&W Special though. It was the British Commonwealth service ammunition during and until well after WWII, and is effective while easy to control. The two rounds are not interchangeable obviously. 

At any rate, I actually like the way it looks and shoots, and it is probably a future collectible if it isn't already. I have been around guns a LOT for the past 45 years, and this is the only one  in a large caliberI have ever seen, let alone owned. I think you will like it. I have shot 27 rounds through it, and when I got it, it was unfired. So if you want to take a trip back to the 1960s this handgun will do it. It isn't a Glock, but it will never jam, and when something goes wrong in the night it will always shoot. I joke about the looks, but the finish and fit on this gun is way above what most guns can offer nowadays. 

Best of all this is a real handgun in a serious caliber for not much money. 

Thanks for reading my long winded ad. If you want to see it, contact me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call you to arrange to meet. If you are out of reach to drive to Santa Fe, this is a modern handgun, so I would have to ship it to an FFL. Shipping on handguns usually runs around $35-$40 since they have to go overnight.

If you like unusual but practicall guns, bring your money when you come up because I think you will like this one.

A mil. spec. tactical binocular with reticle, which can be used in conjunction with a variety of mil. dot or other reticles and riflescopes. This is the model used by many law enforcement and special operations units (they discourage us from telling you which ones), so let's just say these binoculars are ideal for many tactical applications under extreme conditions, especially if you're constantly on the move. This 6 x 30 is lightweight, compact, and fits easily in a coat pocket; brilliant optics deliver excellent performance in low light, and at only 18 oz., their nighttime or low light performance is truly impressive. They would be great for military use, survival, hunting, bird watching etc. The 6x30R gives you a wider range of view and better light gathering at night.

The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
 With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability.  While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out! ""Have neer seen one like this""  the weapon bears No refurbishment marks or other countrys arsenal  markings! The metal has not a mark on it is stone mint! The magazine follower, action etc have no wear! Mint bore. All matching. No refurbishment marks from other countrys !!
 This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine.  This rifle saw little to no action its entire life, maybe an officers or political gaurds weapon

The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was apreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle."

• A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
• The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
• Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
• Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
• The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
• Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
• Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
• Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
• 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
• Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
• Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.
