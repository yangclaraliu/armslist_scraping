This rifle is in near perfect shape, it's been carried in the field for a total of about 4 days. There's one blemish on the stock that can likely be easily fixed.

You've been asking for a couple +P 45 AUTO RIM loads for a long time, so by popular demand, here they are. Both loads are using high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated a flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the equivalent of +P+ 45 ACP ammo or as it is also known, 45 Super. These are very stout loads, but will not harm modern 45 ACP revolvers, nor will these loads harm any post war 45 ACP revolvers. Feel free to safely shoot these loads in any post war 45 ACP revolver that is in normal good operating condition.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun gives speeds almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 and 6.5 inch barrels. This is NOT a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel. Also, we are aware that the 1937 manufactured model 1917 we used as a test gun, (see below velocity chart) is not post war.

Item # 32A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1031 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 945 FPS
S&W model 1917 (1937 Production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1043 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1070 FPS

Item # 32A - was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot right through stick frame and drywall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 30 inches of penetration on live flesh and bone."

The AP-9 looks like a small submachinegun, but has no automatic fire function. This firearm is basically a large pistol that looks very much like the Intratec TEC-9.
The standard AP9 has a 5"" barrel; the AP-9 target began with a 12"" barrel (AP-9/12), but this was later reduced to 11"" (AP-9/11 Target); they both have a separate fore end and a fluted barrel. These firearms were banned by most states after the passage of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and other pieces of legislation, even after more cosmetic changes designed to make them appear to be less threatening. After the Federal Assault Weapons Ban of 1994 a ten round magazine was introduced. Original magazine capacities included 5 round, 10 round, 20 round and 32 round capacities.

The principal designer was George Kelgren, formerly of the the Intratec and Grendel firearms companies. The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all! >>>  INCLUDES - LARGE RED DOT (8 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS) SIGHT FOR QUICK ACQUISITION - 150 LUMEN PUSH BUTTON TACH LIGHT - GREEN PUSH BUTTON LASER (5mW) - SQUID FOREARM WITH RAIL - SLANT FOREGRIP (VERTICLE NOT LEGAL ON A PISTOL) - (1) 30 ROUND METAL MAG - (1) SUREFIRE 60 ROUND DOUBLE STACK METAL MAGAZINE - SOFT CASE W/ 4 MAG POUCHES - CENTER CARRY SLING - DOOR KNOCKER FLASH HIDER - 100 ROUNDS OF 5.56 X 45 AMMO.

New for 2010, the Model 92A1 and 96A1 represent Beretta’s evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol.

A. Higher capacity magazines: 17 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. THREE magazines included per pistol.
B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.

C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1’s have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.
F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices.

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™

The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
Loaded Chamber Indicator

The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety

All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
Fail-Safe Disassembly

The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
Secure Grip Texture

The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.
Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case

To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.


ERGONOMIC

Superior design features give the XD-S™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.
Picatinny Rail System

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.
Short Reset Trigger

The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.
Snag Free Sights

The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight.

Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.
Mould-Tru Backstraps

With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.
Slim Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.
Sure Grasp Slide Serrations

The serrations on the XD-S™ not only make this firearm more attractive, they are functional. The slightly rounded design, extending to the top of the slide, limits the possibility of a snag when drawing the pistol.

This was the only 22 magnum I was able to locate new. My dealer advised me Marlin is having a hard time keeping up with the demand on these guns. This one is flawless. Not a scratch or scuff at all. I've shot one clip (7 rounds) and its dead acurate at 75 yards. By far the best I've ever purchased new. I'm just testing the waters on selling it. Would really like another 44 magnum and this will help pay for it. This gun has everything it come with in the box all plastic and paperwork. Send me your offers and no low balls. I know what its worth and how hard they are to come by. My name is Jeff. You can email me or shoot me a text since I work 3rd and I'll get back asap. REDACTED. Willing to meet if your serious.

This is new Springfield XDs handgun, black on black, and has only had 50 rounds fired through it.  Technically I can't sell it as new because it has been fired.  I purchased it as a gift for concealed carry, but my wife prefers a manual safety. It is priced to sell! 

It includes two 7 round flush magazine, both with after market Pearce Grip extensions. This is a Springfield XDS 3.3 chambered in 9mm. It is the single stack slim concealed carry you have been hearing about. At only 1” wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. And with it, you get the power of a 9mm with superior control and comfort without sacrificing important safety features. A game-changer in the marketplace, the XD-S offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from Springfield’s XD line.

This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. The low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. Comes complete with carrying case, two 7 round magazines, gun holster, mag holster, barrel brush, manual, and some spare front sight fiber optics.

Fires the 5.45x39. The gun is in good shape, the bolt has some minor drag when manually pulled but I ran 30 rounds of surplus through it with no feed or ejection issues, accurate as any reasonable AK.

Bought it at a gun show and I've decided to liquidate some of my AK collection. The ONLY trades I would consider would be for a Ruger SR1911 or Blackhawk in .45 colt with bisley grips. There is literally nothing else I'm interested in trading for right now.
Can meet in DFW area. Will ship to FFL if you pay the fees, I work for an FFL dealer so shipping not an issue.

Appears to be mostly matching, the actual bolt may be a force match.

In effect, the hunter was using high-speed .22 caliber bullets, fired from a standard .30 caliber rifle. This worked particularly well when the hunter wanted to carry just one rifle. By carrying both .30 caliber ammunition and sabot-loaded ammunition, the hunter had the equivalent of two guns-in-one.

Don't wait till after you needed it to think about it. A Stealth Flashlight/Stun Gun fits the bill perfectly, whether inside your home, walking your dog, jogging, camping, backpacking, hiking, biking, security, food delivery, guard work, working nights or you just want some peace of mind and protection for your family and friends. This makes the perfect gift, and they will love you for it! Every house, purse, car, truck glove box should have one of these Flashlight Stun Guns in it. This is a 200 Lumen (Very Bright) Flashlight made from Aircraft Grade Aluminum Alloy. A flick of a semi-hidden button and it is now a 25 Mil. Volt Stun Gun. Wear it on your belt in the supplied pouch. Not everyone wants to carry a gun or is willing to kill somebody for that matter. Do not settle for some 1-5 Mil. Volt Stun Gun.

A 2 second zap puts a 200 lb. man on the ground and he is totally immobilized.

The bore is good and the wood free of any major dings.  I have put less than 500 rounds through it, so I'm not exagerating when I describe it as ""like new"".

The rifle has a 1980s manufacture date and was imported before the 1989 law, so the folding bayonet is legal.  That being said, I will be glad to remove it before the sale takes place should you have concerns about such things.  (they are held on with a single screw)

Included with the rifle are the sling, the in-stock cleaning kit, two of those 30 round detachable magazines that replace the normal internal magazine, a clip on muzzle break, and (not shown) about 15-20 stripper clips.

I will meet the buyer at a public locaion in the Austin area, and will travel as far as Waco or San Antonio to deliver to an out of town buyer.
