The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

This gun is in great condition, like new.  I've put less than 300 rounds through this pistol.  It is a small, compact 9mm pistol that is great for concealed carry.  I am selling to raise money for other purchases.

The gun sells with:

1 Extended magazine
3 Flush magazines
1 Remora ""in waist band"" IWB holster, leather lined with a ""right hand sweat shield""

I've carried other pistols with Remora holsters, and I find them to be extremely comfortable and secure for carry with a good fitting pair of shorts or pants and a belt.

I've got $70 into the extra magazines and $40 into the holster.  I've seen the gun retail for as little as $390 with tax, which is far less than I paid for it several months ago.  However, to be realistic, I'm asking $425 for the package.  This package is a great way for someone to buy a gun that is ready for the range and for carry.

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer.

The ONLY reason that I am selling it is that I am in a cash crunch for school.  I honestly plan on buying another PPQ the minute I can afford another one.  If you have ever picked one of these guns, then you know I don't really have to say anything else.  And they function just as perfectly as they feel.  The trigger pull and reset are absolutely phenomenal.  They sell themselves, enough said.

I have carried this gun daily since Jan 2012.  It has had 3000 rounds through it (+/- 100 rds), and I've only ever had 1 failure out of it (due to a warped piece of brass).  I work in the firearms industry, so you can rest assured that this gun has been cleaned and cared for properly.

This is the first generation PPQ (i.e. ""M1""), with the mag release on the trigger guard.  The firearm is in flawless operating condition, and in excellent cosmetic condition with only minor holster wear.  Gun also comes with a Blackhawk Serpa belt holster (w/ paddle) and a Blackhawk 3-slot leather pancake holster.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Aimpoint CompM4s

The Aimpoint® CompM4s sight, with low battery compartment, belongs to the CompM4 series sights which are the finest sights Aimpoint has ever produced. Improvements include improved energy efficiency that provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery!

I have only shot 200 rounds through it and it is only a year old.  I have liked this gun for CC, but speaking as a woman, it is just too punchy for me.  The gun is in near-mint condition.  There is a very small divot on its underside, but it is not noticeable at all.  I had FireSights installed on this gun (fiber optic sights), which make it look even more beautiful and make it more functional.  I did have a problem with the mag latch, but I sent it to Ruger who replaced the mag latch and spring for me, so it is still technically new!  To top it off, I bought a stainless steel guiderod to lessen the recoil.

This sale includes:
-Ruger LC9
-The original box (with booklet, take-down key, lock and original factory sights)
-Two mags (one made in Italy, one made in USA—this one has a scrape down its side, this was from the mag problem; both have the pinky extensions)
-A Flashbang Ava holster (made for women, very comfortable, in very good used condition--*****if you don't want this, that is fine*****)
-A Ruger pouch (that came with the gun)

Buyer pays for background check ($15) and CBI check ($10).

If you are out-of-state, the shipping (through an FFL) will be $10 + cost of shipping (it will be insured, of course).

429,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2111429,For Sale:  1987 Honda Fourtrax TRX250X,"t.w.peterson@prodigy.net, Janesville, Wisconsin","$ 1,800","Listed On: Tuesday, October 22, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Straight from the first original line-up of Honda to replace the once legal then outlawed all-terrain 3-wheeler, the Fourtrax series of quad runners had some mighty big trail shoes to fill, but they did not disappoint, and this bad-boy trail racer was no exception.  It might be “just” a 250cc, but this quad is NOT for the kids.  The top end of the motor has been bored for that extra “pop” in speed, not that it needed it, because it still jumps off the starting line better than most other makes ever did new, and will buck off an over-confidently careless rider as easily as an unseasoned one.

Like too many of my other toys, this one just doesn’t get used any more because of kids and time schedules (and honestly, I just don’t bounce as well as I used to either), so I need to find it a good home.  This machine has been ridden hard, but has also been maintained with genuine Honda OEM mechanical parts, and regular oil and filter changes.  It has been flipped, but it has never been sunk in the mud or wrecked.  The frame is in perfect condition, and there are no fluid leaks from the motor or mechanics.

In the last 300 miles of riding and in addition to the minor maintenance, it has also had: a carburetor rebuild and tank flush (but the half tank of gas in it needs to be drained and fresh put in, it’s just old); new drive sprocket and cover, drive chain, tension pad and rear axle sprocket replacement; the rear end was rebuilt with fresh bearings, grease and seals; a new skid plate and rear brake disc and pads were installed; the mono-shock was replaced; the front wheel bearings were cleaned and freshly repacked; the brake fluid was drained and fresh fluid put in; new rear aftermarket body plastic was installed; rear and then front racks were added.

In addition, I have the stuff but haven’t gotten around to installing yet:  a rear tow hitch; a new front light/ignition key housing; a new control switch cluster; new vinyl for the seat.  I am also including the helmet with 3/4 flip visor, gas tank saddlebags, owners’ service manual, a spare grip, and some older parts like an air filter for high-dust riding, the last drive chain for spare links, and some other miscellaneous items.

I will accept cash or certified cashier’s check; absolutely no personal checks.  I’m asking $1,800 for this quad runner.  That may seem a bit much for the year, but I know how well it performs compared to other newer, supposedly performance-modified machines, and I know that it has been maintained better than 95% of other used machines.  You will have a better chance of negotiating price if you have cash, although I may be interested in a partial trade, if you have an AR platform NIB tactical rifle that employs gas-piston cycling or an AK or SK platform tactical rifle that is either NIB or LNIB with very low rounds through it.

 I have for sale a used Glock 23C with about 300 or so rounds thru it. Item was cleaned after every use and stored in my safe, I am the original owner.

  Firearm has standard glock sites, also has an over travel set screw in it to stop the trigger from over traveling, and has some other trigger work done to it...trigger pull is 4.9/5.0 and is smooth, it least for a glock.

 If you know what your looking at you know how hard it is to come by one of theses.. G23 yes but a G23C?  so this is a very rare find and at a great price and in almost new condition.
 The 23c is made from the factory with a compensator to help in the reduction of muzzle lift and it works.. i would compare the muzzle lift to that of a standard g19.. it is much easier to get your sites back on target when there is less muzzle lift.

 Included is

 23C

case

 spent factory shell

 paper work

 glock speed loader

2 glock mags

THE WWB 100 RND BOXS ARE NOT INCLUDED!!!

 plus the added trigger job, this gun has NOT one scratch on it and trulley in a great find....

 If interested MUST HAVE CCW OR FL VALID DL AND MUST SIGN A BILL OF SALE... PLEASE FEEL FREE TO ASK QUESTIONS. I WILL TRAVEL LOCAL ONLY AND I AM NOT INTERESTED IN ANY TRADE
 PRICE IS FIRM 

 Thank you"

Cons-
At one point in time(Prior to my ownership) the quad rails were painted tan and then the paint was removed but there is still tan residue in the creases of the rails, this can easily be removed if the correct solution is purchased, it isnt that noticeable but up close it is.

All markings, engravings, pressed letters on the exterior of the firearm have been filled in with color(I think it looks good but some may not). This is also easily removed by unloading the rifle, and taking a lighter to the areas and melting out the colored wax.

Round Count is unknown, I have only fired 30rds through the magazine myself but it fired flawlessly.

Although I seem very specific on this post of what I want, feel free to send whatever offers you have, the worst I can say is NO. Some may think this is asking a little much but like I said, I have no issues keeping this rifle, I'm just trying to see what offers I could get.

Chambered in 9mm, the gun does resemble its .380 counterpart. The two pistols also share many of the same features. The P938 is a single action pistol in a lightweight alloy-frame that can be carried “cocked an locked” in a manner similar to the 1911 handguns. It has a crisp trigger that makes for a more pleasurable shooting experience than most double-action-only subcompact pistols. The Sig Sauer P938 frame is short, where the magazine is single-stack, allowing for a much thinner profile than a double-stack sub- compact pistol. The P938 is only 1.1” at the widest point. Reduced thickness comes at the cost in capacity, however, as the P938 mags only hold six rounds. The Sig Sauer P938 is equipped with tritium night sights, in transverse dovetails, and offer the standard three-dot combat sight setup. The safety is ambidextrous thumb activated with a positive detent (a spring and plunger in the frame) and works positively from both sides. Unloaded, the Sig Sauer P938 only weighs 16 ounces. Considering the SIG has an alloy frame, instead of a polymer frame, that is fairly impressive. Sig Sauer P938 accuracy is excellent for a micro compact pistol."

The serial # is BFL73XXX and all the numbers match.  I just found out from Glock that this old timer was imported in March of 1995!  This makes it at least 18 years old!  Note: this Glock has no rail.

Here are some specs from the manufacturer:

Rugged grip panels made from tough G10 fiberglass offer the durability and superior gripping texture of modern composite materials. Advanced G10 laminate won’t absorb moisture, resists impact, and won’t expand or contract due to temperature fluctuation—perfect for all-weather operations and extreme conditions. Texturing is CNC machined into the laminate, then hand-finished to ensure uniform pattern depth. The hard surface allows the texturing to be cut a little sharper to give more “bite” than traditional checkered wood grips.  Aliens - Originally designed for the Precision Weapons Section of the U.S. Marine Corps, these grips feature Mfg: Vz Grips SPECS: Machined G10 fiberglass composite. Approx. .275” (7mm) thick.

This is the first year that winchester released the magnum round in the 300 caliber. The rifle has been floated and glass bedded for better accuracy. It also has an aftermarket muzzle break to reduce recoil. This gun is a very popular gun, and is the only year of the magnum prior to the change in 1964. This is a very rare gun. (scope not included)

The .300 Winchester Magnum is a popular, belted, bottlenecked magnum rifle cartridge that was introduced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1963 as a member of the family of Winchester Magnum cartridges. The .300 Winchester Magnum is a magnum cartridge designed to fit in a standard length action. It is based on the .375 H&H Magnum, which has been blown out, shortened, and necked down to accept a .30 caliber (7.62 mm) bullet.[2]

The .300 Winchester is extremely versatile and has been adopted by many shooting disciplines. The cartridge has found use by hunters, target shooters, military units, and law enforcement departments. Hunters found that the cartridge was an effective all round hunting cartridge. The .300 Win Mag remains the most popular .30 caliber magnum with American hunters, despite being surpassed in performance by the more powerful .300 Weatherby Magnum and the newer .300 Remington Ultra Magnum.[3] It is a popular selection for hunting moose, elk, and bighorn sheep as it can deliver better long range performance with better bullet weight than most other .30 caliber cartridges. Military and law enforcement departments adopted the cartridge for long range sniping and marksmanship. As a testament to its accuracy, since its introduction it has gone on to win several 1,000-yard (910 m) competitions

Introduced in 2008, the P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide. Extensively tested, P30L model has been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions."
