Holes, inletting and pin locations have been cut to final dimensions and accept standard AR-15 magazines and components. Clearly stamped safe/fire switch position indicators ensure that you can easily identify the service state of the rifle.

This factory new stripped lower receiver allows you to build a custom AR-15 from the ground up. Mil-spec dimensions and coating ensure the highest quality and correct component interface.

Federal law requires that you be 21 years or age or older to purchase a stripped receiver or frame. If a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun. However, they still are ""firearms"" by definition, and subject to the same GCA limitations as any other firearms. See Section 921

 In 1982, the BLR Lightweight 82 was introduced. Several similar models of the BLR were also designed, including the BLR lightweight and the BLR lightweight Takedown. Manufacture of the Browning BLR Lightweight 82 began in Belgium and presently continues in Japan. The Browning Lever Action Rifle measures forty inches in length and comes equipped with a twenty inch barrel, allowing for high accuracy. Depending on the caliber of the rifle, the magazine will typically hold four rounds. Both long and short actions are also available. The Browning BLR Lightweight 82 is an excellent hunting gun and is very commonly used in big game hunting. This lever-action rifle is highly preferred by many hunters not only for its extreme accuracy, but also due to its light weight of just six and a half pounds.

Product Details:
The Winchester Model 1894 was the first commercial repeating rifle built to be used with smokeless powder. The 1894 was originally chambered to fire 2 metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. In 1895 Winchester went to a different steel composition for rifle manufacturing that could handle higher pressure rounds and offered the rifle in .25-35 Winchester and .30-30 Winchester. The .30-30 Winchester, or .30WCF (Winchester Centerfire), is the cartridge that has become synonymous with the Model 1894.[3] Starting in 1901, the Model 1894 was also chambered in .32 Winchester Special.

The Model 94's combination of potent firepower in a compact, lightweight, comfortable to carry, and quick-shooting package has made it an extremely popular hunting rifle, particularly for white-tailed deer in the dense forests of the Eastern United States, where most game is killed at relatively short distances. As a result, it was the first sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units. The millionth Model 1894 was given to President Calvin Coolidge in 1927, the 1½ millionth rifle to President Harry S. Truman on May 8, 1948 and the two millionth unit was given to President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. (Source Wikipedia)

The color and stain on the stain is uniform and there here are a few dings and bruises.  The barrel and tubular magazine maintain most of their original bluing. The bore is still bright and clean. The receiver has a majority of the bluing worn off and a few marks of rust but overall the steel is shiny and maintains its luster. The action is smooth and crisp and functions to spec. The trigger breaks clean. Rear peep sight bluing and spring tension intact.

Miltary Green - Sub 2000 - ASNIB 
 This one was part of a sequentialy numbered pair. It is not the same gun that some of you wrote me about last week, it's even better.  I never expected to see it again but it was returned to me by a family member so I'm keeping the other one. This one is unfired! and in mint condition. While the box is totally falling apart the manual and sight adjustment key are still sealed in.  It comes with two unfired factory Glock 33rd mags. The 10rd Glock mag that they breifly shipped them with after the debut of the poly model, and one 17rdmag all Glock factory. Not looking for trades this week.If your looking at this you already  know I'm well below the GB or any other net price range for this carbine but will entertain any reasonable cash offers.The gun is as new in box, with all the inserts that normaly fall out, the book, sight adjustment key and the mags described above. It as nice as you will ever find one in the "" Military Green"" configuration. Oh the Kel-Tec Cap is NIB and you get it as well. Sorry but for now it is only vailable in the Kentwood, LA. area  due to some temporary medical issues. Thanks for looking. 

Also, one XDS 45 acp in excellent condition! $450.00

The Springfield Armory® XD-S™ .45 ACP Pistol is a single-action, striker-fired pistol that features a steel barrel with a Melonite® finish, a 1"" single-stack black polymer frame, a forged-steel slide and a textured grip. The pistol has a USA (Ultra Safety Assurance) Action Trigger System™ with a short-reset trigger, a grip safety and a loaded chamber indicator. The pistol comes in a multi-use case that also includes a double-magazine pouch, 2 stainless-steel magazines, 2 interchangeable backstraps, a cable lock and a paddle holster. Fiber-optic front sight. Low-profile dovetail rear sight. 

This gun was purchased new by me. I realize that this is unwise but I have several XDs and I have a lot of faith in them. I dumped a single mag through it to see if anyone writing on the web was telling the truth about the controlable recoil. Happy with it I started carrying it in a pocket holster and that went on for several months before I rotated to another pistol as I am apt to do. It's in excellent condition and is sold as new. It comes with everything in the box ( mostly untouched)  Let me state that this gun is in the early voluntary recall numbers. After reading some opions here and bouncing around diferent forums I had decided not to send it in. I recently changed my mind when I considered I would be taking value from the gun. I paid just over six plus tax for it. If you have the patience to wait for it to get the upgrade and the extra mag they are including all at NC then I'm certain it will be worth six again. I do not have the patience. 
The price for this gun is $450.00. I'm sorry but I seriously can't drive for a few days due to medical reasons, so it's onlly available in Kentwood, LA. at the moment. Thanks, for looking. 
That's$ 525.00 for the Kel-Tec and $450 for the XDS."

Product Details:
Sure as autumn arrives, the Model 870™ Wingmaster® rises to meet another day in the upland fields and woods of America. The Model 870 is so smooth and reliable that today – nearly 60 years after its introduction – it’s still the standard by which all pump shotguns are measured. With a receiver machined from a solid billet of steel, it is the model of enduring strength. True to its original design, the pump glides with silky surety on two twin action bars for the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. These characteristics, along with its flawless balance and natural pointing qualities have made the Model 870 the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – of any action type, from any manufacturer. As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon. (Source: Remington)

Miltary Green - Sub 2000 - ASNIB 
 This one was part of a sequentialy numbered pair. It is not the same gun that some of you wrote me about last week, it's even better.  I never expected to see it again but it was returned to me by a family member so I'm keeping the other one. This one is unfired! and in mint condition. While the box is totally falling apart the manual and sight adjustment key are still sealed in.  It comes with two unfired factory Glock 33rd mags. The 10rd Glock mag that they breifly shipped them with after the debut of the poly model, and one 17rdmag all Glock factory. Not looking for trades this week.If your looking at this you already  know I'm well below the GB or any other net price range for this carbine but will entertain any reasonable cash offers.The gun is as new in box, with all the inserts that normaly fall out, the book, sight adjustment key and the mags described above. It as nice as you will ever find one in the "" Military Green"" configuration. Oh the Kel-Tec Cap is NIB and you get it as well. Sorry but for now it is only vailable in the Kentwood, LA. area  due to some temporary medical issues. Thanks for looking. 

Also, one XDS 45 acp in excellent condition! $450.00

The Springfield Armory® XD-S™ .45 ACP Pistol is a single-action, striker-fired pistol that features a steel barrel with a Melonite® finish, a 1"" single-stack black polymer frame, a forged-steel slide and a textured grip. The pistol has a USA (Ultra Safety Assurance) Action Trigger System™ with a short-reset trigger, a grip safety and a loaded chamber indicator. The pistol comes in a multi-use case that also includes a double-magazine pouch, 2 stainless-steel magazines, 2 interchangeable backstraps, a cable lock and a paddle holster. Fiber-optic front sight. Low-profile dovetail rear sight. 

This gun was purchased new by me. I realize that this is unwise but I have several XDs and I have a lot of faith in them. I dumped a single mag through it to see if anyone writing on the web was telling the truth about the controlable recoil. Happy with it I started carrying it in a pocket holster and that went on for several months before I rotated to another pistol as I am apt to do. It's in excellent condition and is sold as new. It comes with everything in the box ( mostly untouched)  Let me state that this gun is in the early voluntary recall numbers. After reading some opions here and bouncing around diferent forums I had decided not to send it in. I recently changed my mind when I considered I would be taking value from the gun. I paid just over six plus tax for it. If you have the patience to wait for it to get the upgrade and the extra mag they are including all at NC then I'm certain it will be worth six again. I do not have the patience. 
The price for this gun is $450.00. I'm sorry but I seriously can't drive for a few days due to medical reasons, so it's onlly available in Kentwood, LA. at the moment. Thanks, for looking."

This gun has been fired 5 times.  Was a gift for my son and just a bit to much for him right now.  Very smooth action.  Thus is a Remington 870 clone so most accessories will fit it.  Would keep it but just do not care for a pistol grip on a shotgun.

E-RPC, LLC, is proud to introduce the REMINGTON MODEL 1911 R1 CENTENNIAL. The opportunity to own a commemorative pistol of this quality is rare and this model will only be available for a limited time. Since its adoption by the US Army on March 29, 1911, the M1911 pistol design has proven timeless. Remington's experience with the pistol design started under the UMC moniker just before the end of World War I. In 2010, more than 90 years later, E-RPC, LLC re-introduced the Remington Model 1911 R1 pistol to a new generation of handgun enthusiasts and collectors.

Glock Gen 3 Model 22; 40 caliber handgun; plus a nice set of extras!

PLUS:
9mm conversion barrel (Lone Wolf Distributors, $119)
2 Glock OEM 15-round mags
1 aftermarket 31-round mag, has a +2 on it ($45ish)
OEM Glock easy loader
Original Glock case
Owners Manual
Cleaning rod
Partial box (15rnds) Hornaday Critical Defense Ammo (I own no other 40 cals so I'll throw this in)

Round count through 40cal bbl is very low (100 or less?)
Mostly shot it as a 9mm (250 ?)
Pistol was carried (vehicle gun) more than it was shot.
Does show handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks in the black finish, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. They are ""swirlys"" from carry in a Kydex holster (already sold in a separate listing). Note the finger index mark on the trigger guard on side opposite ejector port. This is a 100% reliable, great shooter grade/carry gun, not a show piece!

For the whole setup, $450 should be a fair price. With the accessories, that's roughly $350 for the pistol itself, $50 for the 9mm barrel, and $50 for an extra 15-rnd OEM Glock mag, an extra aftermarket 29-rnd mag, an aftermarket +2 mag extension, and a partial box of expensive self defense ammo . . .  should be a GOOD DEAL !"

I will consider all pistol trade offers of equal or slightly higher value.(lower value pistol trades will be considered if they come with cash or ammo)

Comes with the box and papers this is a JM stamped gun not REM, it also has the safety thru the receiver. These guns in this condition are very,very rare. Price is $1200.00 Maybe interested in trading for a nice LH Trap 12ga or a 1911. Thank You for looking."

Aside from some light holster wear on the barrel it is in excellent condition.  Is incredibly light and exceptionally easy to carry.  This is a Total Titanium model, 100% titanium, NOT the aluminum framed, titanium cylinder Ultra-Light model M85, MSRP is in the $650 range.  Will come with a Fobus paddle holster.

I'd like to trade for one of the polymer framed revolvers, either a Ruger LCR .38 or .357 or S&W Bodyguard .38 (the revolver, not the .380).  Would be a good choice if you'd like to have the same .38 snub nosed gun but with the easier to shoot SA/DA trigger compared to the DAO.

This is for trade consideration only as I'm not interested in selling it outright, rather trade only. I really like it, however my other handguns are all chambered in 9mm & 45acp, so I'd entertain trading it for a different, high quality handgun chambered in a 9mm or 45acp. Feel free to send me an email with a phone number and I'll respond promptly. If I'm not interested, I'm happy to say ""no thanks"". I just thought I'd throw it up here and see if anything pops up that I don't know I ""need"".
