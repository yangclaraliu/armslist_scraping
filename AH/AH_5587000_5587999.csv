Put on a Badger Ordinance 20 MOA rail with a Vortex Viper PST 6-24X50 MOA FFP optic sitting in Vortex precision matched rings, and a Vortex leveling bubble. Has a Harris bipod up front. Close to $3k invested after all was said and done, this rifle will make one hole groups all day long with factory match ammo(picture provided is two three shot groups at 200 yards out of a cold barrel using Federal Match 175 grain SMKs).

Comes with one 30 round GI magazine. Excellent condition, fired only a couple hundred rounds. This is a Daniel Defense Factory gun, not a parts-built gun. This has a 10.3 inch barrel and is legally a pistol, not a rifle. The brace is very nice, and makes it way more solid and shootable than just the buffer tube that comes on the pistol. This is Daniel's non NFA variation of the MK18 SBR which has been extremely popular within the Law Enforcement and Special Operations communities. A newly designed Pistol Receiver Extension classifies it as a Pistol and not a Short Barreled Rifle (NFA regulated items require ATF approval and a tax stamp). The Daniel Defense MK18 features the railed forend Daniel Defense currently provides to USSOCOM and a 10.3” Cold Hammer Forged Barrel, the same length commonly used for CQB operations. The MK18 RISII features the Bolt-Up System and has been rigorously tested prior to fielding by USSOCOM (currently over 15,000 units). This pistol comes equipped with the rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Pistol Grip with an integral trigger guard and soft touch overmolding. The MK18 Pistol by Daniel Defense is unmatched in size, weight, and performance. The MK18 Pistol is available with a Black or FDE Type III Hard Coat Anodized Rail System.PLEASE READ****: Ohio residents with valid DL or CCW, can pick up at my office building in New Albany.  I cannot travel to meet folks anymore, sorry no exceptions. Aimpoint shown isn't included. Not looking for any trades.Thanks for looking!"

It has a bore diameter of .311, so it prefers the cheap foreign ammo (even the steel cased stuff) over the expensive American ammo that uses .308 bullet diameters. This also has the 'set' trigger that is activated by pushing the trigger forward. This lightens the trigger pull to be extremely light for shooting from a rest. This rifle is almost brand new and will come in the original box with 2 factory magazines.For a full price offer I can include several boxes of ammo, since this is the only 7.62x39 I own.This picture is from the web site and is not of my rifle, but it looks the same."
