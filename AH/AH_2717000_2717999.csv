This IS NOT a Remington REP gun!!!!! Another fine Marlin out of my collection. The box is not 100% perfect but the gun looks to be. This was one that was put back as an investment. I was told there were only 500 made. Possibly a rumor but that's what I was told. What you see is what you get. The box some literature and the hammer spur.  If you need it sent from an FFL to your FFL please add an additional $25. Payment by United States Postal Money order only.  Thanks and good luck.

10,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2717010,For Sale/Trade:  22 Long Rifle Ammo for Maverick 88 (5+5+5+5),"Charlotte/Belmont/Gastonia/Kings Mountain, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, February 27, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I would like to trade the 22LR ammo in the photo for a Mossberg Maverick 88 12-gauge with an 18.5"" barrel. I know I can't get a Glock out of it, but I am looking for this $150 shotgun for HD and because I can throw a turkey choke on it if and when I need to take it hunting (once every few years). My .410, 20-gauge, 12-gauge, and 30-30, were lost in a house fire a few years ago and I never got around to replacing them.

If I were to sell these outright, I would have to charge much more than the value I am giving them here, since I would have to include gas and time (LOTS of looking). I would not feel right even offering to sell them for the prices I would have to ask. So they are not for sale.

I am not trying to overprice the ammo or take advantage of the ""shortage"" of 22 long rifle ammunition. I just have an equal value of ammo I would like to trade before I start searching, comparing prices, and ultimately shelling out the money for the Maverick.  For those who don't like the ammo-for-guns trades, keep in mind I am looking to trade around $150 of ammo for a $150 shotgun, even if you got it at a gun show for $130, which I consider to be different from trying to charge $55 for a $25 box of Federal bulk.  This is my figuring:

5xRemington SubSonic + 5xRWS Target Rifle + 5xCCI Stinger + 5xCCI Mini-Mag =
5x$5 + 5x$8 + 5x$10 +5x$10 = $165

Stingers and Mini-Mags can be had for a little less at Wal-Mart, but I wish you luck in finding them at WM. They definitely do not carry Subsonic or RWS rounds (I recommend the German-made RWS's - they are the most accurate of all listed).

If you'd like to get rid of your Maverick, or perhaps something else, let me know what you have in mind. The ammo is not for sale - only trade."

These are all listed in individual ads as well.  An early semi-auto 12 ga duck or trap shooting shotgun, one semiauto 380 handgun, one bolt action .410 shotgun, one single shot top break 12 gauge  shotgun and one double shot top break derringer pistol.  Armslist only allows me to only post 3 pictures, please email for more

I'd prefer to sell the lot as a whole, but willing to bundle certain guns together or sell separately.  Interested in trading the whole lot for an AR15, Kimber 1911, something of equal or lesser value.  Or for two handguns together like maybe a Glock 26, Judge, SP101 .357, Sig P238, Beretta PX4 Storm sub-compact, or an FNS9.  Or one of these and a different gun?  Perhaps maybe a Traeger Lil Tex Elite.  Will consider other trades for a .308 rifle or other interesting guns, not too interested in antique collectors specimens much anymore, I have enough wall hangers...

First up!
Belgian Browning A5 semi-auto 12 ga with muzzle break.  This gun was professionally reblued and is flawless.  The stock looks like it might have also been refinished.  This would be a great addition to your collection or used as a duck hunter or trap shooter!  $500

And!
RUSSIAN MAKAROV .380 B-WEST IJ70-17A BLUE CHROME
This thing is pretty neat. The slide is blued chrome. Black grips with rubber thumb pad. Decocker and safety. Adjustable rear sight. Comes in the original box with one magazine and the cleaning/take down tool. It's had about 200 rds through it. It was a carry gun for a bit, mainly in a leather holster, so holster wear isn't necessarily bad. Very clean, ver accurate. There is 25 rds of Lellier and Bellot with this gun. I'm asking $300 or trade for a different handgun.

And then!
Mossberg 183KC, 410 Gauge, Bolt Action, Probably Dates To 1950's, Total Length 45.75"", wood furniture, modified choke, nice dove gun!  $200

And Then,
New England Firearms ' Pardner' Model SB1, 12 Gauge, 3"" Mod, Single Shot, Break Open (Superb Bluing And Beautiful Wood Grain!), shot maybe 5 times.  Total Length 43"".  $200

And Then and Then!
Davis Industries Derringer Model DM, 22 Cal., top break open upside down, holds two bullets, spring loaded ejector, wood grips, 4.25"" TOTAL length!  Perfect chrome!  Not a scratch on it.  $200

Must be an Oregon resident, at least 21 years old, no felonies and meet FTF near Gresham.  No Flakes please!

I'm looking for $1200 for the whole lot or equal/lesser trades listed above.  Or priced individually for single transactions, best value for the entire lot as a whole.  Again I will break up the lot into separate bundles or sell individually for the right cash or trade amount.  

SERIOUS inquiries only please.  No flakes.  My time is just as valuable is yours, please show some respect for others, as for yourself.  If you are interested in the whole lot or just one gun, please leave me an email with your phone number I can call or text you on, please advise which you prefer, I text a lot"

It is cerakoted in a gorgeous special edition bronze to match the shields, and armor of the Spartan warriors of the battle of Thermopylae.
This is likely the baddest rifle I have ever seen. The second u look at it, u know that it's a one-of-a-kind bcz the bronzing looks amazing, and the detailing job is just wicked. Whatever u are looking to accomplish can be done with this weapon. Whether u want to put devastating 7.62 rounds on a home intruder at 8 yards, the leader of an invading angry mob at 1200 yards, or a hole in paper at any range the 308 ballistics can handle, this is the rifle u want for the job. Make no mistake, despite the detailing, and how cool it looks, this weapon is a warriors tool for combat, and doesn't need to be a safe queen to hold it's value. If I kept it, I would have crowned it with a Night Force or Steiner tactical scope, but, as fate may have it, it has to go. My loss is your gain. Will accept trades in silver or gold bullion, and am only going to deal with those who are meeting me locally, with cash. Here's some stats I lifted.

It comes with one 4 rd magazine. Also included is a Bushnell 4-16x40 scope with red/green light-up reticle. 
The rifle was used when I bought it from a dealer so I can't be sure of the round count. I took it to the range once and put about 30 rounds through it. It shoots great, but I'm not that steady with the kickback from a 30-06 which is another reason I'm selling it. I like the low recoil from smaller rounds like in an AR. 
I would like to get out of it what I paid for it, but I know that may not happen so I'm asking $600 obo.
I am willing to trade so let me know what you have. I don't care for revolvers. I would really like a Glock 20 or something else in 10mm. I'll throw in some cash for the right gun. 
Email me with your cell # if you want me to text you. Otherwise we can just communicate through email if you prefer.
I am also wanting to  get a PS4, so if I could get $500 for this that woild cover the system, one game and sales tax."

Chambered in 7.62x51/308.

I've seen these rifles sell used for as low as $564, as high as $900.
The rifle has a hk91 tri rail handguards. $119
As well as as Magpul precision adjustable stock. G3 model. $255
The scope is mediocre. Illuminates red/green. But is mounted by the g3 picatany rail.
The previous owner used an adhesive (very well) to hold it steady. You are still able to use the adjustable rear iron sights.
I have quite a few mags, (they cost like $5 online) I think 12 of them.

I have the original brown furniture. And a green set. 

Now the more honest part.
The paint job looks good from a yard away. It's a black/white digital urban camo.
However (done by precise owner) is a 4/10 at best. 
The rifle double fires cheap crap ammo.
There is nothing wrong with it, however investigating it I learned the blowback operation of the rifle is to violent, the cheap ammo is struck and primer ignites during the seating of the round.
I put a lesser firing pin spring in it to resolve the issue. But to be safe I stopped buying the cheap stuff (like $5-10 a box) 
Anything sold buy Winchester, Remington, blazer all work flawlessly.
And usually run $15 a box or up.

No more cold, numb fingers getting scraped and cut! These also make excellent work gloves too! I have all sizes. Payment through PayPal is fast and secure. Shipping is FREE!!! Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

UPDATE: This is from a customer who bought a pair of these for his brother who is a U.S. Navy SEAL currently deployed:

This is a sweet shooting gun! Closest thing you can get to an authentic Belgian-made rifle. Top quality, not a mixmaster ""parts gun"". Today these guns, when you can find them, run anywhere from $700-$2000 with the premium prices going of course to the SAR-48 rifles, especially the Bush and Match variants. This was a SAR-4800 SPORTER MODEL IN .308 Win. cal., Mfg. 1990-1998. The fugly thumbhole stock added to comply with the Assault Weapons Ban (BOO!) is gone, and it has the correct pistol grip and buttstock of the SAR-48. This is an authentic model of the Belgian semi-auto FAL/LAR rifle, 21 in. barrel, has two 20-shot mags. Just about every western military adopted FN's FAL in the 1960s. More than three million of the guns were made, not only in Belgium, but also in England, Australia, Austria, Brazil, and others. This earned it the moniker of 'The Free World's Right Arm"" which it held until fading to history in the 1990s. With the dawn of the 1980s, people were very interested in the FAL design. FN had imported the guns into the country in a special semi-auto only variant in the 1970s but this supply was now cut off. Giving the public what they wanted, Springfield contracted with licensed-FAL producer Imbel in Brazil to make a semi-auto metric pattern rifle for the US import market. Labeled and marked as the SAR-48, this rifle was as close to a Belgian made real deal FAL as you could get, other than the fact that it was semi-auto only. From the barrel to the gas piston action to the grips and mags, the gun was authentic. It was imported into the country in three subvariants from 1985-89. This included the standard 21-inch barrel model, a 18-inch barreled ""Bush Rifle"" and an Israeli ""Match"" pattern rifle with a heavy barrel, mounted bipod, flash-hider, ribbed forward furniture and flip-up plate on the butt of the stock. The gun was a hit but after 1990 had to be changed to comply with the coming Assault Weapons Ban. Sold as the SAR-4800 Sporter, this was the exact same gun as the standard SAR-48 was with a few tweaks. Gone was the evil buttstock, replaced by the abomination that was the thumbhole plastic stock. Likewise, this model was also offered in .5.56/.223 to appeal to the masses who felt 7.62 NATO was too stout. After 1994 when the AWB took effect, it was sold with just a 10-round mag, although any metric FAL mag would work in its well. Sadly, importation of even these guns was stopped in 1997."

The AR has a free float handguard with a collapsible stock, single point sling, and gunsmith tuned internals. 1 loaded mag and soft case included.

The glock has been frame tuned by a certified gunsmith, same one who worked the AR. The frame has had frame reduction on several key points, including under the trigger guard, so folks with bigger hands can fit the gun well. For reference, I stand 6'5 and carry a gov't size 1911 for conceal. The 23 fits my hand well. The trigger snaps cleanly. I have one mag for the gun, and that will be loaded as well. The gun has night sights, and while qualifying for my job doing a night shoot the sights were incredibly bright.

I am selling the two seperately, the AR for 1100 and the glock for 575. The other listings are posted. But if you purchase the 2 together I will sell for 1550. Thats pretty hefty savings.

Colt 2” Blue Detective Special .38, Mfg. 1977. Stock # MSH272710JA. Serial # 557xxM. One of over a thousand Modern and Collectible firearms, including Antique, Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a Colt Detective Special, a 2” barreled, 6-shot .38 Special revolver, made IN 1977. The Colt “Snubbies” were often favored by Police Detectives and others over the Smith & Wesson Chief’s Specials, as the Colts had a full 6-shot capacity, as opposed to the 5-shot S&W. The all-steel pistol has a polished factory blue finish, and checkered wooden grips (these un-marked grips are the correct factory grips for this period). The grips show only mild wear, but the pistol has quite a bit of holster wear, mostly on the barrel, also on the cylinder. The bore is shiny, and DA trigger pull is very smooth – overall an 85-90% gun.

I have a Sporterized Lee Enfield No4 Mk1* .303 British Rifle for trade, I took the original cut down wood stocks that someone had bubbafied and installed a New Set of ATI Dark Earth Brown Synthetic Stocks, gives it a unique look, it also has a New ATI Scope Mount on it, it is ROCK SOLID, and a New Set of Weaver Quad Lock rings, the Rifle is ready to be scoped. This doesn't stretch the casings like some other Enfields do, that's cause the bolt head's are designed to wear out and be replaced, this one isn't worn out yet. This is the Dual Groove rifling barrel, rifling is strong and prominent, the outside of the barrel could do with a reblue, it's patina'd, I was gonna have it shot blasted and matte blued to give it a dull color for hunting. The sling and the scope mount and rings are included! This rifle has New Zealand government marks, it is a 1943 Manufactured at Long Branch Arsenal in Canada. Does have a 10rnd Enfield Magazine, but I don't know if it's the original, it's not marked, the bolt does match the rest of the rifle, so it hasn't been lost! I have polished the bolt to smooth it up a little, it is smoother.

Looking to trade for a Pistol, 9mm or above, no Kel-tec or Hi Point, would like a S&W 39, 59, 469, 5906, 3906, etc. in Nickel finish, 1911 ?? Worst I can say is no. No .380ACP, it might be 9x17mm but it's not anywhere near a 9x19mm Parabellum. Would like a Ruger P94 .40S&W

FTF transaction only, will NOT ship so don't ask, and will not add cash for boot, so don't ask!

Only meet in Sapulpa, afterall, you're wanting to trade for my rifle, not driving to Coweta or Checotah or Muskogee, you must come to me.

I prefer the E model because it doesn't look and feel like a corncob on the front end with all of the Pic rails. The fore end is slender and more comfortable and I add pic rails only where needed.

Bought this Ruger for Christmas gift. Too much gun for my son. As outfitted, this rifle is short, extremely maneuverable, and the back up iron sights are not strung out the entire length of the rifle-- They're for BACK UP, so they're tucked away until needed.. I've put 50 rounds down the bore (and shot hundreds of bad guys on the big screen after the family goes to bed), so other than that the gun is brand new. This is a PISTON operating system, not direct impingement. I shot DI rifles in the ARMY, and much prefer the piston rifle for adjustments and cleaning. This rifle includes the following:

-  one (1) 20 round magazine
-  one (1) 30 round magazine
-  Ruger soft carry case
-  Bird cage flash hider (not shown in pictures)
-  Fixed, Short MAGPUL MOE Stock (original Ruger Collapsible included)
-  DOES NOT INCLUDE SCOPE, RINGS or MOUNT  SHOWN IN PICTURES- If you want the scope, add $400.00. The scope details are : VORTEX VIPER 1-4 x24, 30 mm tube, lighted reticle, WARNE 30mm Quick Detach Rings, BLACKHAWK 1/2x9inch Scope Riser (a $525 scope with $70 rings, if bought new)"
