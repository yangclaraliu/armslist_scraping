It's a Springfield XDm in .40, with a 3.8"" barrel. It's in like new condition, in the original box with all accessories, just as it came from the factory except that it's been upgraded with True-Glow sights. The owner isn't a serious shooter, and my guess is that it's had less than 100 rounds shot through it.  It's immaculate and probably never been holstered, just taken out of the box and shot on one or two outings.  I think the reason he's selling is that it's a little much for him. He carries a .380, recently stepping down from a 9mm. Included are two 16 round mags, holster, mag holster, speed loader, cleaning brush and manual/paperwork just as new.  Check Springfield Armory's website for specs, and Bud's for price comparison.  Call, text or email if interested in saving some money on alike new gun.

This gun has been shot very little and overall condition is excellent to like new both internally and externally.  I've owned this gun since 2012 and have only taken it out 2 or 3 times.  I bought it from the original owner.  If you're in the market for one of these TSW 40s then you will not find a better example.  The only ""flaw"", if you call it that, is that the night sights have faded out.Four (4) factory Smith & Wesson magazines and original box are included with this pistol. Face-to-face cash deal preferred.  Must have NC purchase permit or concealed carry card.  Must be willing to sign bill of sale.  I will ship but contact me first for terms, you will be required to pay my FFL expenses."

This scope typically sells for 699.00 at most online and big box stores."

Made for the Norway Ski Patrol. Features NP3 Plus on ALL internals, 3.5lb Trigger, extended slide release, trigger guard has been rounded and also cut for higher grip. One Conceal Carry Holster and 8 magazines. I have original case for pistol.  I picked it up for 1,200+ but I'm letting it go for less. Good Luck
Questions people have asked. I'm the original owner and I've only put 50 rounds through it.ALSO NP3 PLUS EXTREMELY CORROSION RESISTANT: A 1mil (.001) thick coating of can withstand a salt spray corrosion test of 1000+ hours per ASTM B-117
SELF-LUBRICATING: PTFE is deposited throughout the coating so for most firearms no additional lubrication is needed after initial break-in.
ACCURATE PLATING THICKNESS: Coating thickness can be predetermined for nominal tolerance to suit your weapon system.
VERY ABRASION RESISTANT: NP3® Plus is a very hard, abrasion-resistant coating with an as-plated hardness of Rc 35-50. In certain applications it can be heat treated to Rc 68-70
EASY TO CLEAN: NP3® Plus is easy to clean; in most cases wiping with a rag will suffice (We do NOT plate the inside of barrels; these need to be cleaned conventionally).
LONGER FIRING PERIODS: NP3® Plus allows for longer firing cycles as the dry, self-lubricating PTFE-rich surface makes it harder for powder residue and debris to adhere to surfaces
PLATES TO MOST GUN ALLOYS: NP3® Plus can be plated to almost all alloys used in the firearms industry. This includes steel, aluminum and stainless steel.
SERVICE LIFE IS EXTENDED: NP3® Plus has a high lubricity and low coefficient of friction; therefore, the life expectancy of a firearm will be greatly increased due to less frictional wear.
NO COROSSION MIGRATION: In cases where the coating is damaged and perforated, the corrosion shows no tendency to spread or migrate under the coating.
EASY TO REPLATE: NP3® Plus is chemically strippable and can be re-plated without any damage to the substrate. Weapons subject to heavy use can be refurbished to as-new condition.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design. The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy."
