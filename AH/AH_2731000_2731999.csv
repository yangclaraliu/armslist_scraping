One of a kind built by my father and my uncle(Master Machinist) for me to shoot IPSC back in the day. Never happened due to military deployments, less than 200rnd count down barrel. Money is great but really looking to trade on a .348, .356, .358 Winchester or Marlin, Browning preferably in 24"" barrels. 20"" barrel lengths will be considered. Brownings should be steel receivers not lightweight models.

I am Active Duty Army, so must arrange to meet if local and keep the meeting due to time constraints. I am willing to work a deal for the right gun. I will ship to FFL and receive from one -not a big deal. 

I know what this pistol is worth so don't bother low balling me but reasonable offers of trade or cash will be considered as I do not need to sell just looking for the right deal or the cash to put down on one of the guns listed above. I am listing this below retail.

- TOTAL RETAIL VALUE IS WELL OVER $500. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO GET THIS GEAR ON THE CHEAP! I'm selling this kit to fund a Remington 700 project, and for no other reason. 

First off, the Ares Armor Combat XII Pack. This thing is sweet. It has two internal hydration sleeves that also work well for organizing gear. It has pouches on top with room for (6) 30 round 5.56 magazines. These pouches have bungee retention. The pack can be used as a standalone assault pack or it can be integrated into your plate carrier (as I have done). The pack was originally designed for snipers and the way that the pockets are oriented on the back allows for an outstanding rifle rest. The entire pack is covered in MOLLE webbing that is multicam, and there is a large panel of multicam hook and loop on the outside of the mag pouches. This is the best thought out pack I've ever seen, hands down. 

I have this kit setup perfectly to integrate the Ares Armor Combat XII pack and the Banshee Plate Carrier. The clip system is show in the photographs. Basically, the shoulder straps of the pack are removed and the pack is clipped directly into your plate carrier. This removes the problem of numb arms, armpit chafing, and trying to slide the straps of your pack over your body armor. To access the pack, all you need to do is unclip one side of the pack and swing it over. Grab what you need and swing it back and re-clip. Too easy. You can reinstall the packs shoulder straps in 5 seconds by clipping them back in. 

I have the system to run the Banshee with or without the cumberbund. Both will be included in this auction. This is the most comfortable plate carrier system I have ever worn. Check out the reviews, you wont be disappointed. 

******All pouches are sold empty! I have them filled for display purposes only. BALLISTIC PLATES ARE NOT INCLUDED. The backpack will be empty and NO MAGAZINES ARE INCLUDED WITH THIS LISTING. THIS LISTING FOLLOWS COLORADO STATE LAWS AND POLICIES. No patches are included with this rig. *******"

I collect tax if sold in NC and actual shipping cost will be figured into the final cost if needed.
If out of state, then I must receive your trade and I will send mine out to your FFL and they can transfer it to you. Please don't offer to drive here to pick it up because I won't sell face to face to an out of state resident. If this isn't cool with you, that's fine.
I would rather trade this than sell it but who knows??? Looking for an FN SCAR in Dark Earth. I would rather the 7.62 version, but not opposed to a 5.56.
I have owned this gun for a few years and just recently fired a mag through it and decided I didn't like it. With bullpups, you either love them or hate them and this one to me is nothing like my Microtech, hence I want to get rid of it.
The pics shown are with a Trijicon Tri power, which is NOT offered in the deal. It came with a factory optic and optic cover and will be traded or sold with the factory optic. I have the FN mag and box to go with it. The gun is in excellent condition, again, fired one mag.
Make offer for sale.
And if I don't respond to your email, I'm probably not interested in your offer, but give it a try anyway."

It also has an AAC muzzle brake. 

I also have an Aimpoint Comp M4 and a Leupold Mark 6 3-18x First Focal Plane scope with locking elevation and ZeroStop.  It is mounted on 6 screw A.R.M.S. quick Detach scope rings.

When they ship the Match barrel it will for sure be sub half minute accurate.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

Save your money and take a look at this Russian Saiga 7.62x39 AK-47!

All original Russian AK-47 from the famous Izhmash factory with the same hammer forged chrome-lined barrel has been converted to the same high standards as the Arsenal Factory rifles. 

It's all in the details... Compared to other converted Saigas this rifle's receiver has no ugly plastic plugs, holes, or rivets where there shouldn't be.  Eight U.S. parts to be more than 922r compliant. Traditional 14x1 LH thread with AK-74 style muzzle-brake (reduces felt recoil). Traditional cleaning rod and holder installed. This is no half-ass Century Build or typical DIY Saiga conversion. All the attention has been paid to the details. See the pics and judge for yourself.

This rifle shoots wonderfully. It patterns well at 100 yards, hits where you expect out to 300, and of course always cycles -never jams.

Less than 500 rounds of non-corrosive ammo down the barrel. Comes in original box with original paperwork and accessories.

If you've been looking for an authentic quality Russian AK-47 you know what they sell for. You won't find a nicer Russian AKM for cheaper anywhere but feel free to make reasonable cash offers. Not interested in trades at this time.

Please include your phone number if you wish a reply. This is a face to face bill-of-sale transaction only, no taxes & no shipping. If you are reading this, the AK is still available. Ad will be pulled immediately upon sale so no need to ask.

Thank you for your interest.  I am in Bisbee but go to Tucson on business.  Feel free to contact me with your offers."

I got this handgun on a trade last week and I shot it about 60 times this weekend. It really shoots great, especially for it's size. I was actually really impressed with how easily it handles being that it's so small. It is extremely controllable.


I think I would rather have something else to play with at the moment and this gun has the least sentimental value to me, so I'm offering it up for sale/trade. It really wouldn't hurt my feelings to keep it, but I've got a few other interests at the moment.

I will be happy to sell this to a resident of another state; however, it must go through an FFL transfer and the buyer will be responsible for all shipping and transfer costs.

I'm including 2 fixed choke barrels in this sale. 30"" Full Choke and 26"" Skeet Choke. The 301 is the predecessor to the current model 391 and is hands down the softest shooting, most reliable semi automatic shotgun brand in the world. I have several Beretta's and just bought a Ducks Unlimited 301 to replace this 301. This gun features extensive engraving on the receiver which really stands out as a nice add to some that don't have it. The 301 magnum provides the versatility of shooting a light, 2 3/4"" 7/8 oz load up to the 3"" magnum for ducks. The metal is very good to excellent with the only detraction of the hunting scratches on the one side of the butt stock as shown on the photos. They are not deep and wouldn't take much to refinish if desired. I'm offering the gun for $575.00 and the extra barrel for $125.00. $650.00 for both. Prices are firm. You won't be disappointed if you're looking for a reliable semi auto. You can call, email or text Andy @ REDACTED   Thanks"

With that comes many questions... Should I buy all the tools so I can build one rifle? Where on earth can I get some good help to build my dream AR? How do I make my DPMS into a solid shooter? 
The answer is you grab a Fox!
I am a small arms repairmen for the US Army. I have served in Afghanistan, and have over 3 years of experience working on Army weapon systems. While this is not a long time for a civilian gunsmith, this translates into working on thousands of weapon systems, and building hundreds of ARs. I am unwholesomely talented at my job. 
So what am I offering?
I have my own tools and gages. I will construct, upgrade, gage, and inspect your weaponry. Want to build an AR? Who better to do it than a government training mad-gun tech who has done this a thousand times in combat conditions. 

Rates are negotiable, and I will work for trade. Paying for my gas to come to you is a must. I will not travel more than 250 miles from post. I will not supply any parts because I still work for the army and this is a conflict of interest. What I will do is provide the very best of service and care for your weapon systems, build them safely and under the standards used by the US Military. If you are not satisfied by my level of work, I will fix it for free. 
Constructing weapon systems on your own is dangerous, and unforgiving potentially costing you hundreds of dollars in damaged parts. I will do it right the first time and make it last. I will also consult with you to get the very most performance for your dollar. I know every field mod that will build you the rifle or pistol that will performed under desired conditions. 

I look forward to hearing from you!"

For almost a decade, Cold Steel® offered a small, wicked looking, boot knife called the Culloden®. It was based on the traditional Scottish ""Black Knife"" or ""Skean Dhu"", as it was more commonly referred to, in Gaelic, the ancient language of Scotland.

For the dawning years of this century, however, we have created an entirely new tactical folder, that takes some of its design cues from the ancient Skean Dhu. 

Our new Caledonian Edge™ features a number of modern variations and refinements on its older predecessor. The blade is made from virtually unbreakable San Mai III® blade construction and like the original Skean Dhu, features a thin, acutely pointed tip that's as sharp as the proverbial needle. It glides effortlessly through even the most puncture resistant materials. Additionally, its precisely and carefully hollow groud.

The traditional jimping seen on the Skean Dhu of old has been retained and provides an aggressive, non-slip platform for one's thumb and forefinger, allowing for better control when using the blade to cut or pierce.

The Caledonian Edge's™ handle sports a palm-hugging profile and a relatively thin cross section that augments its covert qualities. It's flat enough to resist rolling or twisting in one's palm yet comfortable enough to accommodate a wide range of gripping styles. A perfect blend of strength and beauty, it features a superstructure of attractive, highly polished, black Micarta scales and custom Titanium bolsters that are bolted, utilizing the latest in high-tech fasteners, to a strong, yet lightweight Titanium liner substructure.

The Caledonian Edge's™ leaf spring locking mechanism will protect your fingers from its sharp edge. It's made from Titanium and is hand fitted to the closest tolerances possible. It has proved incredibly tough and reliable even when exposed to our most brutal tests.

For discreet carry and immediate access, the Caledonian Edge™ comes with a brightly polished stainless steel pocket clip and thumb stud on the blade. This arrangement allows a wide variety of carry options as well as lightning quick one handed opening."

If you read reviews, you will find that this is an EXTREMELY reliable .22lr that will shoot any ammo you give it. Unlike most ""tactical"" .22's, the upper is all metal (except for the handguard), the lower is a nice, thick polymer. The Sig 522 is also a great choice for a tactical .22 because it doesn't use expensive proprietary magazines. It uses AR15-22 conversion magazines such as the ones from Black Dog Machine (BDM). It comes with two 25-round and one 10-round BDM magazines. Well cleaned and oiled. Excellent cosmetically AND mechanically. The only issue 522's have ever had was a problem with the recoil rod using an e-clip where it attaches to the bolt. Sig offered a free upgrade that replaces the e-clip with a new drilled rod with a roll-pin tapped into it. This rifle HAS the new recoil assembly (even though I never had problems with the old one).  $525 for just the rifle, $600 with the 1400 rounds of ammo."

Gun included (Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 + extras),"Snohomish, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,000","Listed On: Friday, March 7, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The concept is simple. You buy this bag of ammo at an incredibly inflated price, and I'll throw in a gun to shoot it with.
And lots of magazines.
And a scope.
And a bipod.
And a foregrip.
And a buttpad.
And some more ammo.

Who wouldn't want a deal like this?
No, I won't sell the ammo without the gun. I would sell the gun without the ammo, but who in their right mind would want that?
No trades.

I DID NOT COUNT the ammo in this bag. It is a gallon-size ziploc bag, and it weighs 16.5 pounds. I DID measure out 1 lb, and counted that. It was 142 rounds. So 16.5 times that would be roughly 2,343 rounds. Plus or minus a few.

But wait, there's more! If you buy today, you also get the neato ammo can sitting next to the bag in the photo.


Here's some more information about the gun. What gun? The gun you're buying so you can get this ammo.
It's a Smith & Wesson M&P 15-22 A1 (model 811033).
It has a flash hider and removable iron sights, and comes with a bunch of extras (see below).

This is not one of the early models that had feed and ejection issues - it's a good one.
I've only had a few failures, and that was with the cheap Winchester XXX stuff, mainly due to the square nose jamming on the edge of the chamber.
This rifle will cycle subsonic 40gr rounds just fine with or without a suppressor attached, and the bulk pack Federal 32gr all day.

Extras Include:
NCStar BiPod
UTG Foldable foregrip
Barska 3x9x42IR scope
Adjustable iron sights
Two 50-round Black Dog drum magazines
Ten 25-round magazines
Three 10-round magazines
Butt pad
The ammo that is currently in the magazines (380 rounds)

If you pay my asking price, which I think is fair, I will include a UTG covert carry bag (see photo). If you offer me a low price, I'll start removing things like the bag, the ammo, the magazines, and the scope, which I will sell separately if needed. I'd prefer a package deal and a buyer with a fair attitude, but I will split it up if I have to.

I am not desperate for cash, so I will not let anyone ""take it off my hands"" for peanuts. The price is firm. Just try and beat it elsewhere. Make sure to include shipping, FFL, and sales tax in your calculations.

I'm looking for a no-hassle sale with a reasonable person who knows what he wants and doesn't screw around. If that's you, I'm willing to drive a bit to meet you halfway to make the deal.

For my own protection and peace of mind, I'll need you to have a CPL and WA driver's license. I will take a picture of these at the time of sale, but I won't send in any paperwork to the state. If that doesn't work for you, we can't make a deal."

The Bersa Thunder .380 offers an alternative to the Walther PPK or Sig P232 or P230. It is characterized by its distinctive shape and handling. The Thunder is remarkably similar to the Walther PPK used by James Bond in countless films over the decades. This design is ideal for concealed carry due to the small size, Double/Single Action, manageable recoil, lack of snags, and striking style. Whereas the PPK, P232 & P230 can cost as much as $600 or more, this Thunder set only costs $340."

The revolutionary LWRCI™ PSD™ rifle offers incredible fire power in a tiny package! Smashing the paradigm that small close protection weapons be relegated to pistol-caliber submachine guns, the PSD brings the 5.56mm NATO round to bear on threats out to 300 meters!

The LWRCI™ PSD™ rifle is outfitted with our patent-pending ARM-R™ rail system, featuring a removable top platform and return-to-zero reinstallation with no tools required. The carbine- length rail over a low profile gas block gives the operator their choice in rail-mounted BUIS and is ideal for optics.

The PSD™ rifle combines submachine gun size with a battle rifle cartridge and our ultra reliable gas-piston operating system, offering the professional shooter never-before realized capabilities in one sweet little package.

It's still a very new pistol and has been very well taken care of. Comes with everything factory new (2 mags, case, etc) and has only 200 rounds run through it; shoots damn well for such an inexpensive gun. I'm looking to fund some other pistols and have no need for another 9mm at this point. 

I'll send more pictures on request via email. If trading, I'd prefer to trade towards a .22 1911 (not any of those zinc alloy guns, either) or something interesting. I'll add cash on my end if I am interested. Let me know what you have. 

Would prefer to meet FTF, but I am willing to ship. If shipping, I prefer discreet PayPal or money order.
