Anywhere from 1/8"" Thick up to 1/2"" thick. Sizes ranging from 3"" in diameter to 10+ inches in diameter.

The ones in the picture are 3.75"" - 6.5"" 

They are really fun to shoot at and make a nice loud ping when hit. I'd like to get 2$ a piece for the 3/8"" thick ones and 8$ for the 1/2"" thick ones. There are only 6 half inch thick plates right now. But I can get more later. I also have some bigger diameter ones coming in. 14+ inches in diameter. (Won't be in for a couple of weeks)

Currently have (6) 6.5"" Diameter half inch thick plates and assorted smaller 3/8 thick plates. 

I will say this. These are not AR500 grade steel, but most common pistol calibers will not go through this steel. But a rifle most definitely will. I have shot 3/8"" - 5/8"" thick with my mosin and Fal and both go through it. 

I hold no responsibility if anyone gets hurt while shooting these. So just be smart about it.

Early model 1415 for sale.  They are a quality rifle and very accurate made in West Germany.  I haven't done anything to this but clean it and shoot 10rnds through it.  It shoots very nice for its age.  I have researched this model and I believe I'm asking a fair price for its age and condition.  It has a 5 rnd. magazine and spring is strong.  It also has a nice scope on it but I couldn't find a manufacturer on it, only that the mounts and rings are Weaver.    Face to face only, I will not ship. Please don't ask.  For fast response please text 570-six0six-eight85one.  If you reply through Armslist you must include a local phone number for me to contact or I will not respond.  Do not send me a message asking if I still have it, if your serious, you will provide the information for me to contact you.  First come first serve, I will not hold or take deposit, I have been burned too many times before.    Serious inquiries only please.   I am a man of my word and I expect the same.  Thank you for your interest."

Prefer pistols,but will definitely consider revolvers in .357 magnum. Gun does have a 30/06 bushnell scope on it. Again this gun is nice,but not pristine. It is a hunting rifle. If it does not trade thats fine I will keep and use,but figured someone may need it more than I do. NOT FOR SALE. Trade only. You can contact through this site or text me at REDACTED. Name in Chris"

The rifle is circa 1970's manufacture and is in excellent and unfired mint condition. The overall length is 50 inches with a barrel length of 33-1/2 inches. The blued barrel is Octagon shaped and is .45 caliber bearing serial number 3722. The wood is nicely grained oak, with brass trigger guard, butt plate and patch box. The receiver plate on the right side is blued with gold scroll designs. On the left side of the barrel it is marked ""Sears, Roebuck and Company, Il. Made in Japan, Miroku 3722"" and the right side ""Kentucky Rifle Model 292.51765, .45 caliber black powder only"". Ram rod is intact. I inherited the rifle from my grandfather and have owned it for nearly 20 years. This is not a kit gun and not comparable to the ""Ultra-Hi"" kit models. The quality is top-notch all the way. For those that don't know, Miroku makes high-quality guns for Browning, Weatherby, and Winchester. An almost impossible to find rifle of this age and in this condition. $325 cash; a little more in trade.
