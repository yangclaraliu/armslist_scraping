Rifle has seen about 3000rds, 1000 or so on the new barrel. Not a safe queen so it has some nicks and dings which makes it difficult for me to price. Let's go with $1150 and I am open to cash offers and trades that involve KSG, RFB, or SLP. Don't need to sell it so no lowballs (sad that needs to be said) but if you think I am high make an offer and we'll see if we can work a deal. 

FTF in Okc metro and you will need to have an OK SDA Permit, Military/PD/FIRE/EMT (active or retired), or willing to complete a 4473 at a LGS (Cost is on you).

The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect."

Fill up a few of these heavy-walled brass tubes with your favorite ammo before heading out. Reload in seconds instead of tediously fitting round after round into the feeding slot of your rifle.

Here's how it works: before you go shooting, just drop cartridges bullet-end first into the  speed loader and pop on the heavy rubber tip for safe storage and carrying. Take them with you when you go out shooting (I carry my pre-filled speed loaders 5 at a time in an archery quiver - that's almost 100 rounds). 

When it's time to reload,  just grab a tube, pop off the cap with your thumb, pour in your rounds, and you're ready to go!

Field-tested! Fast and dependable loading every time! 

Heavy-duty 1-piece solid brass construction (the brass tubes are U.S. - made by the same company that supplies the rifle manufacturers). We've integrated a solid brass anti-roll base. No brittle plastic parts to break. No moving parts to worry about. 

Heavy-duty natural rubber cap stays put even when filled tubes are shaken or dropped, yet comes off easily with the push of a thumb.

Designed, tweaked, tested and hand-crafted in Colorado from 100% U.S.-manufactured high-quality components for years of service.

Individual speed loaders: $ 9.95. 
                           2 – 5: $ 7.95 ea.

Shipping: anywhere in the Continental U.S. For $7.50 (we can pack up to 5 loaders into each mailing tube per shipment).

Solid as a rock. Lifetime guarantee.

Please specify number of rounds your rifle takes. I custom make these tubes for my customers based on ""specified capacity"" + 1."

I'm looking to trade it for something in .40 as I have a lot of it laying around.  Not really particular, so let me know what you have.  However, I'm not interested in Tauruses unless you have a PT100 or a Millenium G2 Pro in .40.  Not particularly interested in 9mm guns but I might still consider them.  I would be very interested in a Tri Star C-100 or T-100 though.

Not really interested in selling it, so I will keep it if I cant find the right trade.  May add a little cash for the right trade but looking for a straight across trade or as close to it as possible, Ive spent way too much money on guns lately.

Retail cost is $1,318 per the DUI retail price list which is no longer published.

This is a 2,975 cubic inch capacity waterproof, gas-tight amphibious rucksack - designed to meet the requirement of swimming, diving and submarine lockouts. It provides protection via DUI’s 3-bag concept. The waterproof bag is heavy duty nylon butyl rubber trilaminate. A 1,000-denier Cordura stuff sack is included to store the equipment in to protect the inside of the waterproof bag. The outer Cordura bag takes most of the abuse. All of the straps are sewn to this outer bag so the least amount of stress is placed on the waterproof bag. The bag also includes a zippered weight storage area that incorporates DUI’s patented quick release weight system in the event the weights had to be ditched. This bag is ideal for water and land use.
I have two bags as of right now.
See the DUI website for more information.

DUI produces gear for the US special forces so you know it’s the best made.  You will occasionally see either the inner or outer bag for sale, but they are always in used condition.  This is the complete system and recent manufacture."

Looking to sell this rifle considering I dont use it often and to fund other projects. The rifle comes with 4 steel 30 rd mags as well as a nice padded carrying case. Taking serious offers only, this rifle is almost 30 yrs old and looks like it came out of the box yesterday. Fastest way to get ahold of me is txt 813.297.6247. Thanks for looking."

Replaces the issue kidney pad used with the ALICE pack frame but with a number of improvements. Most importantly, our Super Belt utilizes 1.5"" padding for maximum comfort. Other features include a dual adustable front buckle and side webbing attachment points to allow additional modular gear to be attached directly to the belt. Two easy to use adjustable buckles replace the awkward 'ratchet' style attachment system on the issue kidney pad. The Super Belt is a must have for anyone seeking more comfort and durability with their ALICE or MALICE Packs.

Some features:
Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.
Accessory Rail
Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories."

Model 10/22 TDTMB  
Rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. Friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a 16.625 inch threaded barrel with flash suppressor. Adjustable sights. Ten round rotary magazine. Stock is dipped in Mossy Oak Break-Up camouflage.

Functions and fires wonderfully (A lot of the FTF issues with these rifles are from the ammo, NOT the rifle.. Hard primers and time )
there have been a few times I have had to eject, then reload a round to get the primers to pop.
This rifle is Numbers matching minus the Stock..
Over all excellent rifle, I have a few more of these rifles and they are a joy to shoot
and a Unique part of history.

*** I also have 50rnds of ammo to go WITH the rifle, and have more 7.62x45mm for purchase if you choose.
Any questions feel free to ask and I will answer best i can,
Thank you.

The Range Officer is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at
an affordable price. One of the goals was to create a pistol that is
acceptable in many different styles of shooting competitions, so the
shooter can decide which one he likes most. It is built with the same
precision as the Trophy Match, and TRP models, but Springfield has removed
the extras that result in a higher price. It is everything you need in a
competition model at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your
future needs.
