I had this mounted on a dedicated .22lr AR. I took it to the range twice. If I didn't tell you it had been used, you would never know.
I recently put a brand new battery in it, I suspect the one it shipped with had been sitting for some time, as it did not last long.
This is complete in the box, with manual, Allen wrench, and cloth.
This would be perfect for just about any .22lr or small caliber application. I'm not sure how it would handle recoil on larger caliber weapons.

5 MOA dot is ideal for most shooters

 This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 



Technical Information: 

•Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity.
•If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load. 


NOTE: All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols.

XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls.

PredatAR® 5.56 Overview:

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO AR-15 rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger.

Text me at 713 four 1 zero f o u r   2 7.  7

The Caldwell XLA Bipods provide a stable shooting support that conveniently attaches to almost any firearm with a sling swivel stud. XLA bipods solidly clamp to the swivel stud of the firearm and remain firmly in place without swiveling or twisting while shooting. The lightweight aluminum design adds minimal weight and deploys quickly, with legs that instantly spring out to the shooting position with the touch of a button.

The legs are notched for easy indexing to a specific height. There is a connection point for sling attachment and multi section legs that collapses forward allowing for convenient carry of the firearm. Soft rubber feet provide enhanced stability, while the padded bipod base protects the firearm's forend.

Note: Pivoting Models - In the real world of hunting, the chances of the ideal shot opportunity occurring while on a level ground are slim-to-none. A pivoting bipod will allow the shooter to compensate for ground that is unlevel by up to 20°. The lower portion of the bipod pivots independently from the upper stock mount, allowing the firearm to be quickly leveled on uneven ground. The tension knob can be adjusted to control the resistance of the pivoting motion."

The Izhmash Saiga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Models are available with side optic mounting rails, bead front sight, V notch rear sight or leaf rear sight. Included is a detachable five round magazine"

New in box Ruger 22/45 with threaded barrel

Ohio Residants add 7% sales tax

Shipping available for actual cost via FedX 

Checks welcome and firearms will ship after check clears

If your interested in Lilencers for this device let me know.


Home on the Range LLC 22LR Silencer Program

 22 Rimfire suppressor from RockCreek $275.00 and includes Ohio sales tax. Silencer is threaded with 1/2x28 thread pitch. 

All NFA devices upon application for transfer require a $200 dollar tax stamp fee. There is no getting around this. 


Total cost to own this NFA item is $475.00 this program allows you to get started for $255.00

 For those interested I have a dealer demo setup on a Walther P22 pistol and a Marlin XT long gun. Try them for your self. YouTube is good but until you get some trigger time on it your just never going to know. It's a try before you buy. 

The wait times for application approval is the tough nut to get past. Typically 8 months from when the application is submitted. 

Filing an application using an NFA trust is typically a little quicker but time will soon tell. Also the ATF has added an additional 30 people to its staff to help address backlog and new applications. 

To help offset the frustration, I am offering the ability to get started for $255 dollars. Here is how it works:

 We start with a phone call. I will ask some basic questions so I can pre fill out all the paperwork on your behalf. I need a check made payable to the BATF for 200 dollars and a check for $55 dollars made out to Home on the Range LLC. 

I will send you a complete package of everything you need pre filled out so there are no mistakes. I also include instructions on how to finalize what you need to do. I also include return mailers so all you have to do initially is drop the information back in the mail to me. I take care of the final review and submission to the BATF. Once submitted you will receive a copy of your BATF check with the serial number of the device and a number you can call for status updates

 Once everything is submitted you just make 4 monthly payments to Home on the Range LLC for $55 dollars. 

One the transfer is approved you come in and pick your item up. 

All firearms in the picture are in stock. Feel to PM me with any questions or to get started

 Location is Mantua OH 44255

 Just to keep things real, packets will only be sent out once the BATF and first $55 dollar installment payment is received.

Why break your back shoveling when you can simply walk behind a snow blower and get the job done in a fraction of the time.
This great running SPIRIT snow blower features a 5hp Tecumseh motor with 6 forward speeds and 2 reverse speeds. It has serrated augers that bite into those hard drifts the city plow leaves in front of your driveway. It usually starts on the first pull but you don't even have to do that if you don't want to because it also has an electric starter.
I haven't had a problem with this snow blower it runs and functions great. I got a larger one."

Buttstock is 6 position collapsible or retractable, that brings the length of pull anywhere from 11 1/2 inches all the way to a fully extended 15 inches, measured from the trigger face to the end of the buttplate. Pistol grip is serrated type, with spring loaded steel floor plate that allows quite a bit of storage inside it. Forend area is serrated side on the lower, and serrated ported upper or gas tube cover that includes a 9 slot Picatinny optics or light rail. Replacement pricing on these stocks in many areas is upwards of $200. We’re offering the Tapco type 56 SKS stock and forend assembly in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 89.00. >>> Collapsible or folding stocks: these are not an issue in most jurisdictions. In some states, however, what we call ""any two evil features"" laws come into effect. It is against the law, for instance, to install a collapsible or folding stock onto a rifle or shotgun that has a detachable magazine in California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. Say, for instance, Mr. Dwight Owens of Bakersfield owns a federal status C&R Chinese SKS Rifle manufactured in 1956. Dwight decides to convert it to accept a detachable magazine, harmless enough. Then he decides to put a collapsible Tapco stock on the rifle as well. Dwight will be in violation of California law and can be charged with a felony.

NO NYC. Our # XMCMT010405, Choate Machine Tool 9 Shot Magazine Extension for Remington 12 gauge Pump or Auto Models 870 1100 1187 Only NIB with Clamp Blue Steel / This listing is for One Magazine Tube Extension Kit with clamp; buyers, however, may take any number of additional kits we have available at the same per-kit price, and with no additional shipping charges. Shoppers also need to understand that any Remingtons manufactured since about 1985 do not have detent balls on their barrel lugs, and their interior main magazine tube must have its dimples removed in order for the shells to pass that point in the main tube. This is easily done with a dremel tool and there are plenty of You Tube videos out there showing it being done. Where a standard Remington model 870 Pump or 1100 or 1187 semi-auto 12 gauge holds 4 each 2 3/4 inch shells in its factory magazine tube, attaching one of these ups that capacity to 9 in the pipe, yielding a 9+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. For 3 inch shells, make that 8+1; and on 3 1/2 inch shells,7 + 1. The +1 means one in the chamber. With steel shot, then, the equivalent firepower on 3 1/2 inch shells is similar to 900 rounds of .22 caliber projectiles with a fully loaded shotgun; and about 500 round equivalent of #4 Buck, about .22 caliber, with lead loads. Our Mississippi neighbors, who can legally deer hunt with Buckshot, love these. Manufacturer is our old friends in Arkansas, Choate Machine Tool. Choate’s manufacturing experience outdates their competitors by at least a decade; these folks have been around a long time. Construction is all blue steel tube and swivel clamp, with black polymer tube end. The folks from Bald Knob even include a high visibility orange replacement shell follower and extended steel spring. This apparatus will only fit Remington models 870, 1100, and 1187 that are chambered for 12 gauge shells whose barrels measure 26 inches or longer. On a 26 inch Remington, the extension is about 3/8 inch longer beyond the barrel’s muzzle, as the photos show, so some finish wear to the end of the tube will eventually result from muzzle blast, but no damage. Some of our photos show it along side an 870 Super Mag’s barrel that is not included, of course. Replacement pricing on similar, and no better, equipment from Tac-Star approaches $125 for a set like this. We’re offering the Choate CMT-01-04-05 set in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 79.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. Civilian residents of New York State are legally enjoined from loading more than 7 rounds into any magazine.

The fine print: The previous owner was an idiot and shaved down the back strap. I didn't pay any attention when I took this on a trade. It is unnoticeable when the rubber sleeve is on the grip and the handgun fires perfectly. If you don't mind the ugly look, this will be a fantastic deal for you.

On the plus side, if you want a G30 with a smaller grip, I guess this would be about perfect.

527,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2979527,For Sale:  Mossberg 9 Shot Magazine Extension 12 ga model 835 Only CMT020424 Choate Machine Tool with Clamp & follower Blue Steel 9 Shot for 24 inch or Longer Barrels,"Henderson, Tennessee, United States",$ 69,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 27, 2014",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our # XMCMT020424

NO NYC.  Choate Machine Tool 9 Shot Magazine Extension for Mossberg 12 gauge Pump or Auto Models 835 Only NIB with Clamp Blue Steel / This listing is for One Magazine Tube Extension Kit with clamp; buyers, however, may take any number of additional kits we have on hand at the same per-kit price, and with no additional shipping charges. When the Mossberg Model 835 pump gun made its debut in our little store some 25 years ago, we noticed immediately the differences between it and the venerable Model 500. The biggest thing to us was, that it had a magazine cap a lot like a Remington 870, where the 500 did not. That configuration naturally called for a tube extension on the 24 inch barreled model 835s that our Turkey Hunters and Duck Hunters, and even Mississippi Deer Hunters all learned to respect and then to love. Where a standard model 835 Pump Mossberg holds 4 each 2 3/4 inch shells in its factory magazine tube, attaching one of these ups that capacity to 8 in the pipe, yielding an 8+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. For 3 inch shells, make that 7+1; and on 3 1/2 inch shells, 6 + 1. The +1 means one in the chamber. With steel shot, then, the equivalent firepower on 3 1/2 inch shells is similar to 900 rounds of .22 caliber projectiles with a fully loaded shotgun; and about 500 round equivalent of #4 Buck, about .22 caliber, with lead loads. Our Mississippi neighbors, who can legally deer hunt with Buckshot, love these. Manufacturer is our old friends in Arkansas, Choate Machine Tool. Choate’s manufacturing experience outdates their competitors by at least a decade; these folks have been around a long time. Construction is all blue steel tube and swivel clamp, with black polymer tube end. The folks from Bald Knob even include a high visibility orange replacement shell follower and extended steel spring. This apparatus will only fit Mossberg Models 835. Threads will match on some variants of the 590, but since the 590’s barrels are never 24 inches, this setup wouldn’t match the barrel length. It will not work on a 935; will certainly not work on a 500; will not work on a Remington; will not work on the door handle of a 1937 Dodge School bus. It will only work on a Mossberg 835 shotgun with 24 inch or longer barre. Some of our photos show it along side an 835 barrel that is not included, of course. Replacement pricing on similar, and no better, equipment from Tac-Star approaches $100 for a set like this. We’re offering the Choate CMT-02-04-24 set in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Selling because I recently purchased an autoloader. Holds 7+1, has had approx 150 shells through it, still in great shape! Comes with factory aluminum heat shield, aluminum tri rail still in package, original stock and factory pistol grip as well as two aftermarket ATI stocks. One folds over the top and has a shell carrier attached while the other is a 6 position side folder with scorpion recoil reducing butt pad. The stocks retail from about $65 for the top folder to about $85 for the side folder. Both will also fit remmington 870 models and are included with trade. Might eventually sell if I don't get the right trade offer. But prefer to trade for something of similar value ($300-350 range) TN ID and written (signed) bill of sale required . Also have an uncle mikes breacher vest which holds 52 shells securely. Has removable Velcro tabs to mark slugs/buck or lethal/non lethal. Check it out other details on amazon where they retail for $150. Mine is in brand new never worn condition.

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.

most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns"

NO NYC. Choate Machine Tool 8 Shot Magazine Extension for Benelli Nova 12 gauge Pump Franchi 612 912 Extrema Fabarms with 20 inch or longer barrels, NIB with Clamp Blue Steel / This listing is for One Magazine Tube Extension Kit with clamp; buyers, however, may take any number of additional kits we have on hand at the same per-kit price, and with no additional shipping charges. Where a standard Benelli Nova Pump, Fab Arms, or Franchi model 612 or 912 or Extrema holds 4 each 2 3/4 inch shells in its factory magazine tube, attaching one of these ups that capacity to 7 in the pipe, yielding a 7+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. For 3 inch shells, make that 6+1; and on 3 1/2 inch shells, 5 + 1. The +1 means one in the chamber. With steel shot, then, the equivalent firepower on 3 1/2 inch shells is similar to 900 rounds of .22 caliber projectiles with a fully loaded shotgun; and about 500 round equivalent of #4 Buck, about .22 caliber, with lead loads. Our Mississippi neighbors, who can legally deer hunt with Buckshot, love these. Manufacturer is our old friends in Arkansas, Choate Machine Tool. Choate’s manufacturing experience outdates their competitors by at least a decade; these folks have been around a long time. Construction is all blue steel tube and swivel clamp, with black polymer tube end. The folks from Bald Knob even include a high visibility orange replacement shell follower and extended steel spring. This apparatus will only fit the following models, all in 12 gauge: Benelli Nova Pump, Fab Arms shotguns; Franchi models 612, 912, and Extrema. The shotgun’s barrel must be at least 20 inches long for this to work. If the barrel is 18 1/2 inches, the tube will protrude past the muzzle and it will look funny.

This is more accurate out of the box than most AR's without any need of an accu-wedge or other device to tighten the tolerances.  It has a laser-etched American flag on the mag well, and a rail on the gas block and along the upper reciever.  It is aluminum, NOT polymer.

I've added a quad rail with laser markings on all rails (T, B, R, L), rail covers on the sides, flip-up BUIS front and rear, a brand new camo Sight Mark red dot reflex sight with lens cover, and a Sig Sauer vertical foregrip with light and trigger on the foregrip to toggle on/off (plus a “safety” so it won't turn on accidentally) and battery container in the handle.  

It comes with a sling and one factory 30-round magazine, M-16 bayonet with leather sheath (not pictured), paperwork, transferable lifetime warranty, hard case, and a “Support Our Troops” ribbon magnet.  I'm also including 1,000 rounds of ammo (900 rounds of Federal armor piercing 5.56 ammo, 100 rounds of WPA .223), a used digital Camo single mag pouch with velcro flap (MOLLE compatible, or you can wear on your belt), a 15-40 spotting scope with tripod, and a .223 bore snake (brand new, just opened the package to check it out).  All told, this package has approximately $1900 in it.

If you prefer, I can substitute a UTG Leepers red/green dot scope with flip up covers for the Sight Mark reflex sight, or a new-in-package CT combination laser/light combo with pressure switches for the Sig VFG and light.  If you want these as well as what's on the rifle, I can include them for extra.

If you want just the rifle with VFG, sight, etc, I'll sell it for $975.  $1500 for the entire package with ammo, spotting scope, etc.  No offers, this is already several hundred dollars below what you'd pay for this package individually.  Plus you don't have to pay taxes, FFL fees, or file any paperwork.  I prefer you have a CCW, but you must be legal to own this rifle if you don't have one.  E-mails asking if this is still available or what my lowest price is will be summarily deleted without response.  Feel free to ask any other questions.

I'm from south of Milwaukee, but up in Fond du Lac this afternoon with my daughter visiting in-laws.  I will be available to meet up any time later this afternoon or early evening.  I can arrange to meet you between FDL and Milwaukee off the freeway somewhere if you live in that area.

This listing is for ONE Simunition® Conversion barrel. It does not include any other parts except the barrel. Photos show two of the few Simunition® conversion barrel kits that we got surplus from a Wisconsin agency trade. Manufacturer is SNC of Le Gardeur, Quebec. Importer is SNC Technologies of Avon, CT. The purpose of these kits is for Law Enforcement and Military training using Simunition® FX and CQT ammunition only. The barrel will not accept standard 9mm small arms ammunition; if it did, anyone stupid enough to chamber it would be in danger of injury because even though these barrels are steel, they are not designed to withstand standard cartridge pressures, and their chamber hood right side area is ported. They are only for training, and only for Simunition® cartridges. Each kit is in its original factory box with factory instructional papers. All these are in excellent to near mint condition; from our inspection, they have been fired fewer than 50 rounds apiece. The MCSD 5906 Adjustable Sight Slide showing in some of our photos is not included; we have it and its mates and their entire apparatuses for sale on another listing. This is Simunition® FX kit number 5302080, S&W 590X Series. The barrel will fit any 5900 series double stacked metal frame Smith & Wesson Pistol with standard 4 inch barrel size, including models 59, 459, 559, 659, 5903, 5904, 5906, 5943, 5946, 5976, and 5986, as well as the Value Series models 911 and 915. They will not fit any other pistol. Replacement pricing is over $200 for one of these kits. We’re offering the kits in the photos, however, each for only $ 139.00.

The Smith & Wesson Model 60, the world's first stainless steel revolver, was a success from its introduction in 1965. Praised by both law enforcement and sportsmen, the Model 60 was a stainless steel version of the Chiefs Special®; and began the era of stainless steel handgun production. The Model 60 is the perfect choice for those seeking a small frame, all-steel revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance.

The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads.  Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

The offer read that it expired 5-31. He did a bit of research and decided this was a great deal so he went on line by clicking on the email and clicked the ""BUY"" button under the advertised Bushmaster. It came up at a cost of over $700.  He called and was told by the people at Bud's that they had sold out of the Bushmasters and they had to pay more for the replacements so now the guns were $700 plus.  ----but the $50 rebate was still available. 

To my mind since the offer showed to be good til the end of May that Bud's should have to honor their email. I personally am tired of gouging, bait and switch, and false advertising.  I think I can find other companies to deal with. There are lots of good reputable dealers out there and I would urge you all to deal with them and let  the money grubbers die on the vine.

NO New York City. Our # XMCMT020424, Choate Machine Tool 9 Shot Magazine Extension for Mossberg 12 gauge Pump or Auto Models 835 Only NIB with Clamp Blue Steel / This listing is for One Barrel and One Magazine Tube Extension Kit with clamp; Buyers, however, may take any number of additional kits we have on hand at the same per-kit price, and with no additional shipping charges. When the Mossberg Model 835 pump gun made its debut in our little store some 25 years ago, we noticed immediately the differences between it and the venerable Model 500. The biggest thing to us was, that it had a magazine cap a lot like a Remington 870, where the 500 did not. That configuration naturally called for a tube extension with a 24 inch barreled model 835, a configuration that our Tennessippi Turkey and Buckshot wielding Deer Hunters all learned to respect and then to love. This setup includes a Mossberg Factory 24 inch Blue Steel Barrel for the model 835, with factory Williams sights and 16 ports that help deaden both downrange noise and felt recoil. Mossberg factory number is 90800. This barrel has a uniform .727 diameter smooth bore, and the factory advertises it as a Slugster. Folk had best not try slugs in other 835 barrels, only this variant. Our Mississippi neighbors, who can legally deer hunt with Buckshot, love the Barrel and the Choate extension kit we are furnishing with it. Manufacturer on the extension kit is our old friends in Arkansas, Choate Machine Tool. Choate’s manufacturing experience outdates their competitors by at least a decade; these folks have been around a long time. Construction is all matte blue steel tube and swivel clamp, with black polymer tube end. The folks from Bald Knob even include a high visibility orange replacement shell follower and extended steel spring. Where a standard model 835 Pump Mossberg holds 4 each 2 3/4 inch shells in its factory magazine tube, attaching one of these ups that capacity to 8 in the pipe, yielding an 8+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. For 3 inch shells, make that 7+1; and on 3 1/2 inch shells, 6 + 1. The +1 means one in the chamber. With steel shot, then, the equivalent firepower on 3 1/2 inch shells is similar to 900 rounds of .22 caliber projectiles with a fully loaded shotgun; and about 500 round equivalent of #4 Buck, about .22 caliber, with lead loads. This apparatus will only fit Mossberg Models 835. Threads will match on some variants of the 590, but since the 590’s barrels are never 24 inches, this setup wouldn’t match the barrel length. It will not work on a 935; will certainly not work on a 500; will not work on a Remington; will not work on the door handle of a 1937 Dodge Blue Bird School bus. It will only work on a Mossberg 835 shotgun with 24 inch or longer barrel. Replacement pricing on this package is upwards of $400 in our neighborhood, and nobody keeps them but us. We’re offering the Mossberg 90800 Barrel and Choate 835 kit in the photos, or their identical mates, all for only $ 239.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

Excellent Mechanical condition, shiny bore, 6.5 in bbl., adj. rear sight, serrated ramp front sight, loads and functions just like an Original Colt SAA. Bbl. marked right side- HERTERS 44 CALIBRE, left side reads- HERTER'S WASECA MINN. USA MADE IN WESTERN GERMANY.  Original deep blueing in overall fantastic condition, plastic grips,grooved trigger. Would make a great Cowboy action shooter, Hunting revolver or just a nice show piece. Unbelievably well made for the money. Asking price for one day only is $350 obo, more pictures available for seriously interested. Need the cash so come get it."

The Kel-Tec P-11 is the smallest and lightest 9mm ever made. Thanks to its
locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical
accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially suited
for plainclothes police officers or as a secondary weapon for military
personnel. All machined components are also made on modern high speed
computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test
procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and
workmanship. Available with a 10 round magazine capacity and choice of 
parkerized, hard chrome or blue finishes.
