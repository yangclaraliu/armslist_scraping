Thinning out the herd a bit to purchase other guns

1.  CZ 55 American .308. This rifle is in great condition.  The single set trigger is amazing.  Very accurate.  Included are the CZ steel 1"" scope rings.

I purchased this rifle last year and have less than 20 rounds through it. I have decided that I want to go with a heavy barrel.  

Interested in trading for a Savage 10 fcp in 223 or a Sig 226 in 9mm. 

I also have 10mm and .357 sig ammo I'd like to sell 30 per box/50 or could put in a trade.


Thanks
Jim"

****LOWER PRICE **** Offered for your consideration is one (1) . Using the Remington Society serial number dating information, this No. 8, serial number 23262, was manufactured in 1911, and returned to Remington for repair in November of 1934, (return code of RC3) stamped on the head of the barrel shroud.

       The Remington No.8 was originally introduced as the Remington Auto Loading Rifle in 1906. It was designed by John Moses Browning, uses the same long-stroke recoil operating system as his newly designed shotgun, the A5. It has a 22‚Äù jacketed barrel and a five-round fixed box magazine, and was produced in the following calibers: 25 Remington, 30 Remington, 32 Remington. Four additional chamberings for the Model 8 were added later in this order of introduction. They were: 35 Remington; 30 Remington,(also referred to as the 30-30 Remington), 32 Remington and finally the 25 Remington (referred to as the 25-35 Remington). 

The No.8 Remington was the first mass-produced semi-automatic rifle chambered for a round more powerful than the most popular deer cartridge of the day, the .30-30 Win. 
Many hunters continue to use the Remington No.8 rifles in the field today, 108 years after the original patent was issued to John M. Browning. 

Mainly because these rifles have stood the test of time for 108 years of use in the field, at times under horrible conditions, these rifles continue to hold a special place in the hearts of many hunters, authors, and artists. Adventures using them are still remembered in often told tales around a campfire in a deer camp, in the written material of well known authors, and in many forms of artwork, both old and new.

This rifle has been made more reliable than current Century builds. I purchased this rifle new and made the improvements to it but never fired it. I now own another VZ-58's that I shoot so this safe-queen can be yours. 

Many retailers are out of stock on this rifle, But if you order one online with added shipping/taxes and your local FFL fees, you would still only have just a VZ2008  to spend more money/time to make reliable as the one I'm offering you.

Century Arms ignores the following two reliability issues which I have already addressed on this rifle. Primary is the ‚ÄúVZ gremlin‚Äù or ‚Äúghost trigger‚Äù timing issue which Czechpoint resolved with their bolt-carrier redesign.  Only Czechpoint guns have this patented bolt-carrier so I've installed that on this rifle.

The second issue is an outright trigger failure on just VZ2008 Century rifles. The symptoms are a hard trigger pull or complete lack of trigger engagement as this video shows:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7lIVzE8O-s

This problem is caused by a bent sear-pin and solved by stoning & polishing the striker where it engages the sear. I've also already had that done on this rifle.

Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail"

Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail"

This gun was part of a police department trade-in last year and SIG processed it through their Certified Pre-Owned service for resale.  I bought this from a dealer the day they received it from a distributor and it has not been fired.  New night sights, new springs, all from the SIG factory.  This particular P229 was either never used by the PD or was only fired a handful of times; it could easily pass for NIB.  There are no external marks on this gun AT ALL and the barrel shows virtually no smiley.  Again, I don't think this gun was ever issued by the PD that traded it in.

6) It does have handling marks.

Both are for sale in a post here

Be careful of the people selling the aimpoint micro H-1, and T-1 in Columbia SC for $400. I contacted them about the T-1 and they  turned around and offered me a deal on an H1, when I was clear about wanting the T1. It seemed strange, but I decided to cautiously proceed. I offered the asking price of 400, and we discussed a paypal transaction. I took the time to reset my paypal, and we agreed that he would contact me from the Post Office, and I would execute the payment at the same time as they shipped the item.  I never heard  from him again, and despite multiple followups, have heard nothing. I was browsing AL and found an H-1 that I contacted. After sendiing the email out, I looked a little closer and found it was in the same location as the previous flubbed attempt at a scam. I can't, in good faith, let anyone less cautious get scammed by these unethical pigs on these sites, where us honest Americans are here to revel in our celebration of the 2nd amendment. U should be ashamed of yourself, bcz this dirty thing you are doing is in a community that has morals and values that far exceed anything u believe in.

It is the model 30 and comes with 3 factory ten round clips, the original Glock padded hardshell carrying case and the OEM cleaning rod.  The gun has been shot very little and is always kept in the case and inside a gun safe, it has not been used as a carrying firearm. It has Glock MH3 sights. I am interested in either selling or a possible trade for the right guitar. I would consider a Martin, Taylor or Gibson (not Epiphone) acoustic guitar. I prefer acoustic/electric but this is not absolutely necessary. It would also be really nice if the guitar comes with an original hardshell case. I am not too worried about the guitar being in mint condition because, as a collector, I understand they get marks when played so please don't hesitate to ask if I am interested just because your guitar isn't in perfect shape...as long as there is no damage to keep it from playing and sounding right, cosmetic issues don't bother me too much...I actually prefer vintage guitars. A USA made guitar is also a huge plus but if it is a high quality foreign model I will still gladly consider it. Please just send a detailed description telling me exactly what you have and I will be more than happy to consider all offers (pictures always help as well). This is a super nice Glock that I honestly feel will make someone very happy. The items I mentioned are exactly what comes with it - nothing less and nothing more.  If I sell it, I can only accept cash...I am willing to consider a reasonable cash offer as well.  Thank you very much for checking out my listing!"

529,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2807529,For Sale:  Dillon Precision .40S&W Carbide Pistol Dies/Conversion kit for RL550B Press,"Douglasville, GA, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 85,"Listed On: Friday, March 21, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am getting away from reloading .40S&W since I have sold all of my .40S&W Pistols.  This consists of 3 Dies(Size/De-Prime, Bullet Seat, Crimp) in the set.  This also includes the Shell Place and powder funnel for the Dillon Precision RL550B Press.  This is a great price for the set if you are looking to get them and not pay over $100 to get the set.  This price does include Shipping.  Below is the information on the Dies and Conversion kit from Dillon.  This includes a Dillon .40S&W Case Gage in the cost.

 Sizing/Depriming Die 
Our sizing/depriming dies feature a unique ""floating decap assembly"" with a snap spring that throws the spent primer off the pin and eliminates the problem of primer ""draw back"" that often occurs when decapping military brass. The primary feature of Dillon's size die design the long, tapered carbide ring with a radiused opening remains unchanged. 
That radiused opening, and its importance to progressive reloading, is one of the reasons why our seat and crimp dies are better. We found a way of manufacturing these dies that has enabled us to make the lead-in radius even bigger! The bigger radius makes progressive loading with our equipment even smoother but that's still only a part of the story. 
Bullet Seating Die 
Our new quick-disassembly seat die allows the user to disassemble and clean the seat die without losing adjustment. In this manner, bullet lube and shavings can be quickly removed from the die, thereby guaranteeing a constant seating depth. We've incorporated a ""flip-flop"" seating stem and a clip that enables you to remove the die insert and change the seating stem from round nose to semi-wadcutter without unscrewing a seating stem out of the die body. We've always included both types of seating stems, but the new double-ended design makes it a simple matter to remove a pin, reverse the seating stem, make any minor seating depth adjustments that may be necessary and go on loading in a fraction of the time it used to take. 
Crimp Die 
We've made it easy for you to remove the die insert for cleaning without having to change the critical crimp adjustment. Once your crimp die is set for the proper amount of crimp, you'll never have to change it. This is especially good news for all of you who load lead bullets! Before, you had to unscrew the die from the toolhead and disassemble the die in order to remove any bullet lube or lead residue. Then, you had to start from square one to re-adjust the crimp. Those days are over. All you have to do now is pop a clip and the die insert drops into your hand for cleaning. 

NOTE: All Dillon Pistol Die sets include our sizer/ decap die, seat die and a separate crimp die. (Taper crimp for autos; accu-crimp for revolvers.)

The BAR is the king of calibers . . . handling popular big game cartidges up to belted magnums. Did I say including the likes of 338 Win. Mag. and the WSMs? Yes indeed.
    Receiver. The Safari model uses a one-piece ordnance steel receiver that is richly blued with scroll engraving and is drilled and tapped for scope mounts. Stalker, ShortTracT and LongTracT models have an aircraft-grade aluminum alloy receiver, drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The bolt release lever is incorporated into the receiver.
    Stock and Forearm. The fluted stock design incorporates a full pistol grip with an undercut and is contoured for use with open sights or a scope. The forearm is full and hand-filling. LongTrac and ShortTrac stocks are shim adjustable for cast on/off and drop. Sling swivel studs are installed in the stock and forearm.
    Safety. Crossbolt design with enlarged head.
    Trigger. Short, smooth, single-stage pull. The trigger assembly can be easily removed for maintenance and cleaning. Enlarged trigger guard.
    Magazine. Detachable box magazine with a unique hinged floorplate.
    Action. The BAR is a gas-operated autoloader with an extra strong, multiple-lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel. Every cartridge that is loaded into the chamber of the BAR is surrounded by a recessed bolt face, which is encircled by the barrel and then surrounded by the receiver. Three complete rings of steel surround the cartridge. A seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength to handle magnum loads. The strong and very rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration. The buffering system reduces wear and stress on the rifle's mechanism.
    Barrel. Individually machined from hammer-forged, heat-treated billets of steel.
    Safety Lock. All Browning firearms are shipped with a free trigger lock, padlock or chamber lock, depending on model, to assist in the safe storage of firearms."

Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail."

 ****LOWER PRICE**** Offered for your consideration is one (1) Remington No.8 in .30 Remington caliber. Using the Remington Society serial number dating information, this No. 8, serial number 61735, was manufactured in 1930, and returned to Remington for repair in February of 1942, (return code of LL3) stamped on the head of the barrel shroud. 

The receiver has been drilled and tapped for a side mount scope mount. Also a Williams peep sight has been mounted to the rear of the receiver.

The Remington No.8 was originally introduced as the Remington Auto Loading Rifle in 1906. It was designed by John Moses Browning, uses the same long-stroke recoil operating system as his newly designed shotgun, the A5. It has a 22‚Äù jacketed barrel and a five-round fixed box magazine, and was produced in the following calibers: 25 Remington, 30 Remington, 32 Remington. Four additional chamberings for the Model 8 were added later in this order of introduction. They were: 35 Remington; 30 Remington,(also referred to as the 30-30 Remington), 32 Remington and finally the 25 Remington (referred to as the 25-35 Remington). 

The No.8 Remington was the first mass-produced semi-automatic rifle chambered for a round more powerful than the most popular deer cartridge of the day, the .30-30 Win. 
Many hunters continue to use the Remington No.8 rifles in the field today, 108 years after the original patent was issued to John M. Browning. 

Mainly because these rifles have stood the test of time for 108 years of use in the field, at times under horrible conditions, these rifles continue to hold a special place in the hearts of many hunters, authors, and artists. Adventures using them are still remembered in often told tales around a campfire in a deer camp, in the written material of well known authors, and in many forms of artwork, both old and new.

This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and .22 Magnum rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason.

Ejects out the bottom and has ambi controls for the safety, so it's lefty friendly.  It has the optional muzzle brake which takes recoil extremely well.  These are rare guns common in old early 90s Sci-Fi flicks like Total Recall, The Crow, Timecop, ect, so they're very collectable plus they make awesome shooters.  100 round mags make them the ultimate undead dispatching weapon.

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail."

The forte of the Series 70, of course, is the lack of a firing pin block or firing pin safety, and the crisp single action trigger pull that only comes without the trigger having to depress a plunger. Factory specs are as follows. The pistol is the classic 5 inch barrel all-steel Colt Series 70 Government, catalog #O1970A1CS .45 ACP. It's entirely blue steel, 8 1/2 inches overall length, classic spur hammer, aluminum combat trigger, flat black combat sights, with classic Double Diamond Rosewood Colt grips. Both grip safety and thumb safety are standard configuration. Serrated trigger is standard, and it has two factory 7 shot magazines. Finish, as the photos show, is matte blue vertical surfaces with classic Colt bright blue side features. The pistol speaks for itself. Each one comes in its original blue box with its padlock, extra magazine, and instruction manual."

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip (Not included for CO, NY, CA, NJ, HA sales). The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.
Includes only 2-10 rd magazines.

Here are some of the new upgrades: 

 * It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 

 * It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 

 * The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it. 

 * The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant. 

 * It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail."

It's a dead-reliable utility vehicle, not for the faint of heart. If you need something to haul small trailers around, to take down some medium-rough hunting trails, to pull roots up, knock things (small trees?) over, or to just throw parts or crap in to move around - this thing is for you. You can drive it like a normal car (i daily drove this car for months before getting a new one) but it's loud, has floorboard rust, and does not use keys. (there is a switch for the ECU/Fuel pump, and a push button ignition wired in. think redneck race car.) It's been painted many colors over the years, and is partially bedlined. No heat, no A/C, no radio. It does have a good roof rack, a tow hitch in the rear bumper (could use some bracing but works for lighter loads), and a good clutch/good brakes. The car is lifted on suspension from a larger VW (passat VR6 wagon) and has larger-than-stock tires on it and trimmed fenders.

All in all, I could scrap/part out this thing and get ~$500, so that's what I'm asking. I'm willing to negotiate, but not too much. Just looking to pass the torch here for someone who needs an excellent farm/shop/hunting/beater vehicle. I'll take rifles, shotguns, optics, and .22lr/shorts in trade (or ammo bundled with a rifle/shotgun.)
