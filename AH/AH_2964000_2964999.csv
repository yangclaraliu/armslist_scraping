This particular gun is in good condition overall. Please understand it is not in mint condition. There are some scratches, handling marks and some rubs. The timing, lock-up and bore all are great. Original viper grips are in very good condition. This makes for a great gun to take out, shoot and enjoy, without being so worried about getting it damaged. Besides you always have the option of sending this back to Colt for a nice refinishing. After refinishing by Colt, this gun would bring BIG money (that is if you could bring yourself to sell it). If I dont find the right trade, I might just send it back to Colt for refinishing myself. Overall, a good example of a very RARE and desirable colt."

The unique part about this lower is that it is truly ambidextrous. The way this is accomplished is through using the magazine release to activate the bolt catch, if you have questions about this either look at their website or contact me and I will send pictures.

I also used a geissele trigger group and a foliage green magpul ubr stock and Miad grip. 

For the upper I used the top of the line vltor mur-1a which has been consistently among the top names in upper assemblies. For the bolt carrier group I chose the m16 jp rifles stainless steel BCG. You can literally just run water over it to clean it. And for the barrel I chose a Noveske N4 light barrel. This barrel is produced to the same quality of a m249 saw barrel that the military uses and is made to last for over 30000 rounds.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

Description:

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines. 

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

1998 Silverado short box with 3rd door. The truck runs and drives, 4x4 is strong and the heat works well. There are a few things wrong with the truck. The trans will, on occasion, hesitate while going from park or reverse into drive. I just put it in 1st until it starts rolling then into drive, shifts perfect while driving! The odometer stopped at 140,000 a few years back, I estimate the miles below 175,000. There are other cosmetic issues but those are the big ones. I put new Bridgestone Duellers on it a few years back. It also has a Pioneer CD player with usb iPod controller, Y pipe dual exhaust, and a Husky tool box in back.

I got this to try out the ergonomics and function on them. Ordered it several weeks ago and during the meantime I found my grail gun, a SW 686-4 .357 Magnum that I spent nearly $800 on. Wife says I don't get to keep both so the Beretta is for sale.

 This gun is amazing. The fit and finish is excellent and the design is pure Beretta awesomeness. It came in an expensive plastic case with padding and the gun's logo on both sides. Beretta quality is second to none, I trust my life with a 92A1 every time I carry it. 

 It comes with everything shown in the pictures. 20 round magazine, lock, case and I didn't even take any tags off of it. Included is 1100 rounds of Federal .22LR. I understand .22LR is impossible to find right now so it made sense to include a significant amount of ammo from my supply so that you can enjoy this gun. My two remaining .22LR guns don't see much action anymore anyways. Price is very firm at $450 and I will not sell the ammo without the gun. If you don't need the .22LR I will accept $400 cash. Private sale FTF only no tax and no shipping/paperwork. It has NOT been fired it is brand new.

 I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one. I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying. Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five. If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

TACOPS® M9 Assault Medical Backpack

The M9 Assault Medical Backpack from TSSi was specifically designed to better fulfill the needs of the operational medic involved in vehicle or aircraft operations.

The M9 was designed and created with the guidance of a Physician's Assistant (PA), who also served as a Special Operations 18D medic, to provide a backpack with a very thin profile that carries the necessary medical support items for operational medics. Pack only. Contents not included. Also comes fully stocked and field ready! Click here to see the field ready version.

The MSA Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) delivers advanced ballistic, fragmentation, and impact head protection, with unsurpassed comfort for long-term use.

An innovative suspension system of movable comfort pads provides customized sizing and superior comfort. The sized pads conform to the shape of your head to distribute the helmet's weight evenly and comfortable. Simply adjust and move the absorbent pads for a flexible, personalized fit.

This was manufactured by B.F.I. Windham ME. In my opinion this is when they were the best AR-15 platform on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

This is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable!

BUSHMASTER HISTORY: In the beginning, Bushmaster Firearms International made their name as a well known maker of quality AR-15 type rifles owned by Richard Dyke. In 2006 he sold the company to Cerberus Capital Management, which in turn owned Freedom Group, which became Bushmaster's parent company that also owned other firearms manufacturer's including Remington and Marlin. Bushmaster production continued in Windham, Maine until March of 2011 when it was moved to Ilion, New York, to consolidate operations with other Freedom Group manufacturing.
