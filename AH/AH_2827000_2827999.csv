We are now manufacturing rotary tumblers for home reloaders and commercial companies alike. Here are the specs for our offerings 

We start out with an all steel frame welded together by hand right here in America. marathon county WI to be exact utilizing the best and as many made in America products as we can we assemble our tumblers in house. 

What about capacity? 

This is where YOU the customer has to do a little leg work.  We want to provide the most efficient tumblers we can not only with low energy motors and water sensible cleaning but we want to provide a product that fits you. Normally we use a tank constructed by hand from American made pvc. For our commercial guys these tanks are 8"" in diameter and approximately 22"" long giving you the flexibly to run 500 pcs of 9mm to 1500 cases of 5.56 brass. If you are just a hobbyist we also have you in mind we can customize a tank that best fits you for both production and space. These are not made in China machines that will break after a week and anyone that's used or seen a cement mixer for using stainless steel media knows they are loud and inefficient.  

We can make tanks from 6"" x 10"" to 8""x24"" one thing to consider is weight. Utilizing about 4 gallons of water and approximately 30 pounds of pellet pins a full large tank can be as much at 80# not a problem for some but not everyone needs that kind of capacity. 

So what all do I get? 

Tumblers will ship fully assembled ready to use. All you'll need to do is fill your tank with brass and media a little dawn some lemi shine top it off with warm tap water and away you go. 

What about shipping? 

These bad boys are not light weighting in at approximately 75# or a hair over we would like to ship these as best we can for the most cost effective rates if you are located in Wi we would be more than happy to have you by the shop to pick yours up or we can deliver for fuel cost. Nationwide we will acquire a shipping quote before an order is finalized. 

How about price? 

Pricing is going to be $450 for our large tumbler and smaller tumblers will be slightly less. All tumblers are custom built by hand so no worries about ""out of stock on that model but we have this one right here for a little more."" That's not how we believe customers should be treated. 

If interested we would love to hear from you. 

We accept money orders, checks, PayPal and major credit cards processed via intuit go payments. 

Stand by for pictures coming soon

We are now manufacturing rotary tumblers for home reloaders and commercial companies alike. Here are the specs for our offerings 

We start out with an all steel frame welded together by hand right here in America. marathon county WI to be exact utilizing the best and as many made in America products as we can we assemble our tumblers in house. 

What about capacity? 

This is where YOU the customer has to do a little leg work.  We want to provide the most efficient tumblers we can not only with low energy motors and water sensible cleaning but we want to provide a product that fits you. Normally we use a tank constructed by hand from American made pvc. For our commercial guys these tanks are 8"" in diameter and approximately 22"" long giving you the flexibly to run 500 pcs of 9mm to 1500 cases of 5.56 brass. If you are just a hobbyist we also have you in mind we can customize a tank that best fits you for both production and space. These are not made in China machines that will break after a week and anyone that's used or seen a cement mixer for using stainless steel media knows they are loud and inefficient.  

We can make tanks from 6"" x 10"" to 8""x24"" one thing to consider is weight. Utilizing about 4 gallons of water and approximately 30 pounds of pellet pins a full large tank can be as much at 80# not a problem for some but not everyone needs that kind of capacity. 

So what all do I get? 

Tumblers will ship fully assembled ready to use. All you'll need to do is fill your tank with brass and media a little dawn some lemi shine top it off with warm tap water and away you go. 

What about shipping? 

These bad boys are not light weighting in at approximately 75# or a hair over we would like to ship these as best we can for the most cost effective rates if you are located in Wi we would be more than happy to have you by the shop to pick yours up or we can deliver for fuel cost. Nationwide we will acquire a shipping quote before an order is finalized. 

How about price? 

Pricing is going to be $450 for our large tumbler and smaller tumblers will be slightly less. All tumblers are custom built by hand so no worries about ""out of stock on that model but we have this one right here for a little more."" That's not how we believe customers should be treated. 

If interested we would love to hear from you. 

We accept money orders, checks, PayPal and major credit cards processed via intuit go payments. 

Stand by for pictures coming soon

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

There is thinning at the front of the slide on both sides and on the top of the front sight. The sides of the slide show minor handling marks. The top of the slide has marks just behind the front sight (where we believe the original sight was installed) and mars in the finish both in front of and behind the ejection port opening.

There are two internals of the machines, but only one face. The story that I got was that my grandfather owned a ice cream parlor on the eastern side of the state in the 30's through the 50's. This was one of the many things that came from this ice cream parlor. I remember getting candy bars from it when I was younger, but my grandfather past away, and it sat on the wall in his kitchen now for a couple years. It hasn't been used in about 2 years, and now seems very stiff. Neither machine is in perfect working condition, but both are complete, and with a little WD40 I am sure would work again. The only thing that it will need is a lock, my family had lost the key, so I had to drill the lock. If you have any questions feel free to email me.

Belonging to the Custom II family, the Kimber Stainless II provides the classic look of stainless steel with cutting edge technology Stainless Steel for Increased Resistance to the Elements

Kimber is known for their tradition of excellence and high quality firearms, and the Stainless II simply serves to reinforce Kimber’s superiority.

The Stainless II .45 ACP blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements. Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II with night sights, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless II is one of the best choices for daily carry."

Belonging to the Custom II family, the Kimber Stainless II provides the classic look of stainless steel with cutting edge technology Stainless Steel for Increased Resistance to the Elements

Kimber is known for their tradition of excellence and high quality firearms, and the Stainless II simply serves to reinforce Kimber’s superiority.

The Stainless II .45 ACP blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements. Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II with night sights, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless II is one of the best choices for daily carry."

Soft Lead SWC-HC (850fps/M.E. 253 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 23,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 18, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=110

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)
3. Ruger SP101, 3 inch barrel - 930 fps (303 ft. lbs.)
4. S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel - 979 fps (336 ft. lbs.)"

Ratings (out of five stars): 

Accuracy: * * * * * What you’d expect from Sig. And for around $500, that’s pretty damned good. 

Ergonomics (Handling): * * * * I really liked the way it feels. Its a touch top heavy thanks to the metal slide and polymer grip, but it works. And if you don’t like it there are always replacement grips available. 

Ergonomics (Firing): * * * *  The touch of the trigger is damn near perfect, but as expected for a P226 trigger. 

Reliability: * * * * * I don’t have any data on this from personal experience other than the rounds I put through this, but French police tested the crap out of this thing and 400,000 rounds later it still worked perfectly. 

Customization: * * * * The only people really making aftermarket parts are Sig Sauer themselves, but they’re turning out a ton of stuff. New triggers, new grips… You want it, you got it."

Belonging to the Custom II family, the Kimber Stainless II provides the classic look of stainless steel with cutting edge technology Stainless Steel for Increased Resistance to the Elements

Kimber is known for their tradition of excellence and high quality firearms, and the Stainless II simply serves to reinforce Kimber’s superiority.

The Stainless II .45 ACP blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements. Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II with night sights, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Stainless II is one of the best choices for daily carry."

Some of you may remember the ""DIY SPR Kit"" I was selling. I put it together on 15MAR14.

**The rifle has officially been fired. There were 35 rounds of PMC 62gr 5.56 run through it and the scope has been zeroed. Nice soft shooting rifle with only a light push to the rear. I was able to shoot the tacks that were holding the targets up. :)

There is no rattle between the upper and lower. It is a very tight lockup.

It's built on a Matrix Aerospace lower with a Palmetto State Armory upper and FN machine gun steel barrel (1:9 twist), a full auto BCG and a Blackhawk LPK, which includes an Ergo grip. This grip is much more comfortable than the standard grip and features a hollow interior for small parts/battery storage. I put a 2x red dot scope on the flat top rail. No rear iron sight. I've only run about 200 rounds through this before deciding my safe was too full.

This is not an entry-level AR -- Matrix Aerospace lowers are used in Ruger AR lines, and the Palmetto State Armory receivers get rave reviews for their quality. My other AR also has a PSA upper and has run 100%! The red dot is a ""TAC Vector Condor."" It's cheap -- very similar to the TruGlo 2x -- but it's worked well and held its zero just fine. I have it set up now for absolute co-witness, but if you want a riser, I have one I can part with for a little bit extra. This AR comes with 5 magazines -- two C-Product GI mags and three Magpul PMags (2 still in the package). 

ARs are cheap now, and this one is priced accordingly -- not as cheap as an Oracle or M&P Sport, but much less than an AR using these quality parts. I am not interested in trades. Thanks for looking."

Fire Field 2.5-10x40 Riflescope Product Info...
Firefield 2.5-10x40 Red Laser Rifle Scope FF13011 is a pinnacle of accurate versatility, equally well equipped for taking down multiple targets at close range and landing precision shots from three hundred yards away. The wide magnification range is the key to this Fire Field riflescope's versatility. The lowest magnification setting, 2.5x, is great for an initial scan of your environment using the wide field of view. Ramp up the rifle scope to its maximum 10x setting for more precision shots, a task made easier by using the scope's green/red illuminated mil-dot reticle, which helps you gauge the distance between yourself and the target. The Fire Field 2.5-10x40mm Scope gives you even more long-range precision with the inclusion of a bullet drop compensation turret, which can operate at ranges from 100 to 500 yards. Firefield has integrated a 5mW red laser into Fire-Field Bullet Drop Turret Riflescopes, giving you improved close-range accuracy and target designation capabilities.The Fire-Field Mil-Dot Laser Rifle Scope is outfitted with high quality hardware and several features that set it apart from the pack of hunting riflescopes. For starters, the Firefield laser sighthas been outfitted with multi-coated optics, offering superior light transmission in any lighting environment, from twilight to high noon. Nitrogen filled, the FireField 2.5-10x40mm Laser Sight Riflescope is both waterproof and fogproof, adding durability to the scope and allowing you to use it in the rain, snow, or in humid environments. These components are packed into a lightweight and shockproof frame, then outfitted with reliable windage and elevation knobs. The adjustment turrets even have separate caps for improved portability of the scope. For a powerful rifle scope with an illuminated reticle and versatility at its heart, choose the Firefield 2.5-10x40 Illuminated Reticle Riflescope."

Experts agree that the single most important step toward ensuring your personal safety is making the decision to refuse to be a victim. That means that you must have an overall personal safety strategy in place before you need it. Crime prevention information from this class can help you make yourself a less attractive target and keep you safe at home, work or in public settings. 

Improve your personal safety strategies with NRA's Refuse To Be A Victim® Program. 

In our four-hour class (a shorter overview class is also available) called Refuse To Be A Victim®, you can learn the personal safety tips and techniques you need to avoid dangerous situations and avoid becoming a victim. An overview of some of the material we cover is… Home Security
 Personal Security
 Automobile security
 Workplace Security
 Technological security 

The NRA's Refuse To Be A Victim program was developed by the women of the NRA in 1993 in response to women nationwide who requested crime prevention and personal safety information. This course was originally presented only to women by women who were NRA Certified Instructors. However, in 1997, the NRA Board of Directors elected to open this course to men as well, due to the program's relevance to all people. 

If you want to learn to be safe, but do not want to learn about guns, this course is for you. If you want to add safety information to your knowledge base to compliment your pistol safety, this class is also a benefit to you. We can also customize this class to fit audiences from young to old and varying abilities.

1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

This vintage warhorse has always performed 100% and shoots great -- not one failure the entire time I've had it. Some SIG fans prefer the German-made guns because they're lighter, slimmer and have ""better balance."" I've owned both German and US-made and don't notice a difference when shooting, but it is true the German made slide is slimmer and lighter.

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

My Dad had this bad boy sitting around for literally as long as I can remember (I'm about to turn 33), and never touched it to restore it.  I think he soured on finishing it once someone absconded with his motor years ago after he sent it with them for a rebuild.  I'd consider most any firearms trades for it, I saw a much worse condition frame/shell go for $330 on ebay, plus freight, so I do know this thing isn't scrap.  That one also had no motor, no seat, and was missing all the gears and the chain for the rear... a lot more than just the motor.  There is a restored one with side delivery car on ebay for over $3k, so restore this and have something pretty special and neat!  An advertising button for these things sold for $300 on ebay.
