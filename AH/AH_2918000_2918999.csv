This was a PSD build that I built just a few weeks ago because I was tired of waiting for my SBR stamp. Then, of course, my NFA stamp showed up Saturday. I've only shot this three range trips and it has run flawlessly. It doesn't really like cheap steel-cased Wolf /Tula ammo but it runs everything else like a German sewing machine. 

It's a great little truck gun / SHTF gun because it is a LEGAL pistol and can fit in a backpack. Also, unlike a registered SBR it can be taken across state lines without issue."

I am selling this one for $40.00 and will ship it to you for free via USPS Priority Mail.  Cash, money order, bank check, or personal check.  Item will only ship once personal check clears."

I collect and restore M1 Garands for a hobby, so I know what they are, what makes them correct, and what they are worth. 

The Garand you are looking at is the one at the bottom of the three. The rifle has the correct 1.5"" DAS and circled P on the stock. Everything down to the gas plug and springs are right on this beauty. The only thing questionable is the top forward most handguard, but to fix that will cost you some time on eBay and about $40. I wasn't too particular about that since there are no markings of any kind on hanguards to identify them as SA. 

This M1 Garand is also unique in the fact that it is a 5.7 million serial number block. The 5.7m range isn't a common find and only about 6,000 were ever produced due to HRA making a stink about SA using their serial block. My value on the rifle is $1700 OBO. If you know anything about M1 Garands, you'll know that I'm on the lower end in price, especially if you're a CMP forum member."

It holds 4+1 has an amazingly light trigger which makes release extremely smooth.

This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc.

Note our below real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

3050 fps - Kimber 8400 Montana, 24 inch barrel
2970 fps - Winchester All Terrain (circa 1995), 22 inch barrel

Get yours before they get around to banning it! The design of the sear engagement is similar to high quality match grade triggers and the third mode makes the reset of the trigger seem to be automatic so all you have to do is press as fast as you can. By using NP3 for abrasion resistance, low coefficient of friction, and hardness, the life span of these triggers is greatly increased. One trigger was tested over ten thousand rounds and then measured to see the change in the engagement surfaces. After the ten thousand rounds, the trigger had minimal to no significant change in engagement surfaces and was deemed ready for more endurance testing. The extremely high quality of these parts combined with the unbeatable advantageous of NP3 make for a revolutionary trigger. This is another example of high quality metal parts using NP3 to offer the best product available. Go To their website to learn more http://tacfirecon.com/

I checked with local law enforcement, and was told this is legal to own and sell in private sale in OH. Many other states have similar laws, but we'll have to check on your end. I will not sell/ship to CA, NY or MA because I know there are restrictions there. Concealed carry is a whole different set of laws that I would strongly recommend understanding in your state.

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for 
people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™,
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter
exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs."

New radiator, brand new head, new water pump, new seals, for everything of course, new thermostat, all new belts ETC. Basically they guy I bought it off of got me good. There is NO HONDA CANCER at all still has ac PS heat cruise control, only thing is there's a rust spot in the hood which I was going to put a cf hood on if I kept it and there's no radio or exhaust from the headers back. They took those things along with the battery center caps to the rims and air intake when it was stolen, just got it back a few days ago, put a brand new battery in it this morning make sure everything worked ok starting fine(idles high but that's because there is no exhaust and no o2 sensor) put stock air intake back in with a brand new air filter. All it needs is some TLC with the paint because the guy who owned it before me didn't know what he was doing and he let the paint run in a few areas, and it has a 2 scratches from when it was stolen. Its possible the runs could even be wet sanded off and just clear coated again. I bought the car almost 3 years ago from a guy in Athens and it test drive fine, then I got on the highway and that's when it over heated and I ended up replacing the entire top half of the motor. Its all new except the block. I paid $3500 for it, after i fixed it it got stolen and I just got it back a few days ago. Paid $150 to get it out of the impound lot, $75 for the battery(connections lol) the top end rebuild coast me about $500 because I did all the work myself along with my buddy who is a Wyotech mechanic graduate. So I have about $4200 already. O and the teggy had black housed halo projector headlights as well and needs the driver window and rear window re-tinted. And is has GSR cloth interior. Shooting straight no BS here. Only rust spot on this car is a weld in the driver door that didn't get a chance to seal before it was taken but it can be grind-ed out and re welded and sealed.

I paid $550 Put ~110 rounds though it at a fire an maneuver range,  love the gun. but I already own 1911's so the pistol is a bit redundant. and I personaly dont like 13rnd mag's when the FN has 15rnd.

So It is for sale for the same amount that was paid for it.

This pistol had no jamming issues, ran smooth and perfect for all 100 rounds,  has no scratches, or bluing fading..

If it does not sell I dont care, but I tend to ""Beat the crap"" out of fire arms, and well.  Lime my other listings I sell what I dont want to destroy.  And sence these are a bit hard to get ahold of . Im just going to sell it to some one who will appreciate it.

A bit of a warning on the gun.
Magazines are fricken expensive.
Some owners have reported that they have loading issues when ""limp wristing"" the gun I have not seen this issue on this pistol.


That is all,  If you want it then come get it if not dont contact me.."

""The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock.

Wood is in great shape, bolt is shiny and works like butter, rifling and bore are shiny and sharp. 

The rings and mounts are included. 

Price is FIRM. Will grudgingly entertain trades for OTHER GUNS ONLY. Really, really interested in a straight trade for the exact same rifle in .308, as I have lots of .308 but no .270. Don't you try to rip me off buddy, I see you there. Don't even try it. I'll know.
