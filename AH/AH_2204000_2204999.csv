Barnes TAC-XPD ammunition is optimized for carry and home defense use. It is designed to deliver top performance when it matters the most. The TAC-XP's all-copper construction and very large, deep hollow-point cavity expand, penetrate and perform more consistently than any personal defense product on the market. Performance through bare gel, light and heavy clothing, car doors, plywood and automotive windshield glass is unmatched by the competition. TAC-XP bullets are 100% copper, making them safe for the environment. These lighter all copper bullets also result in less felt recoil in comparison to lead core bullets allowing the shooter to recover quickly without sacrificing terminal performance. Barnes specially engineered each load using low flash powders to produce almost no muzzle flash, ideal for low-light situations. Distinctive Techni-Crom plated shells feed smoothly from the magazine for reliability shooters can depend on every time.


Two boxes of 20 rounds of Winchester SXT (Supreme eXpansion Talon) , loaded with the 147 Grain Winchester SXT bullet. This line of ammunition replaced the Black Talon line after Winchester removed it from commercial sale in 1993. The SXT line is very much based off the Black Talon bullet except it has 8 petals instead of the original 6, also the black Lubalox coating is now clear. Though not as desirable as the Black Talons the SXT is just as difficult to find in full boxes.

The NITRO is 62.5in/158cm tall and is 10.5in/26cm wide. Perfect for riders who have wide feet and are over 180lbs (ideally). It is a standard camber type, all mountain board with still enough flex for popping. Not a park board, but it has a lot of stability which makes it great for practicing at faster speeds and carving. I am 5'7"" and currently 217lbs and it rode very well for me. I now consider myself an advanced rider and this carried me very well through my beginner and intermediate phases.

The Burton bindings are Size Large and will fit size 10 and up boots. I wore size 13 boots in them and I still had room for adjustments. These are good all around with a decent response and good cushion.

This gear is generously used but still in good working order. The only serious fault with the board is some slight chipping at the tail (stay away from rocks!) However, the edges are still good and all I really recommend is a good hot waxing. I consider this perfect for someone who is just starting out or trying to downsize from a slightly larger board, someone who regularly rents gear and is looking for a cheaper alternative or maybe someone looking for a back up set.

The board itself was $300 and the bindings were little over $100 brand new.

I bought three of these and really only needed two of them. I previously sold one here, and I have one that has been assembled but is still unused. I have the original packaging and included paperwork.

These are spring-loaded reactive targets, rated from 9mm all the way to 30.06. The actual target portion is 18"" tall, and about 1/4"" thick. VERY sturdy, they weigh about 25 pounds. I've put several hundred rounds into one, including 9mm, .40, .45, .223 and 7.62x54 and aside from the chipping paint there are only minimal signs of wear. A quick blast with a rattle can of orange after a shooting session and it's ready to go for the next time.

These also come with three ground spikes to secure them in place. If for some reason the target ever wears out, you can easily replace it with another piece of steel. I'm thinking of having some custom shapes made for mine, maybe a tombstone or a more traditional body shape.

Taking a road trip for Thanksgiving and I could use the gas money. I'll also consider trades for AR magazines, quality USGI or Pmags only."

Hate to see it go but I'm getting a new vehicle this weekend so it would help out with a down payment if I can sell it.

Its a 1982 but with very low miles for its age, with a little over 14000 miles.  I have kept it well maintained with an oil change last week, a new front tire two weeks ago with the rear tire at 80-90% condition, new spark plugs and numerous other small things.  Has a leather fork bag and a sissy bar that is not on it but will come with it if you want it.  Clear title.

  This was a contemporary and competitor to the Honda Goldwing, and as a result is very smooth and quiet with neutral handling and basically maintenance free shaft drive.  Do some research on these and you'll see that they are one of the bikes that will litterally go 100,000 miles with nothing more than oil changes.
Only thing I can say against it is that it is not perfect cosmetically, but it is almost 32 years old, and since it runs so well this hasnt been a concern to me.

Im looking to sell it for $1200 obo, but I'm interested in partial trades for a pocket sized 9mm, mainly a Beretta Nano, Ruger LC9, or a Kahr CM9.

Looking for FTF with or without bill of sale (your choice) and must have valid CHL or drivers license and be 18 or older. I prefer CHL and reserve the right to deny any sale as I see fit.

The rifles are as follows:

Arsenal SLR-106FR in 5.56/.223 in excellent condition. I have only fired approximately four mags through it and the previous owner had only fired ~300 rounds through it. Very clean and comes with two black 30 round circle 10 mags, two smoked clear 30 round circle 10 mags, one 30 round promag, and one Arsenal 5 round mag. I also have the original box (though it is torn up a bit from moving), paperwork, and oil bottle that came with the rifle. I am asking $1200 for everything and can include a Plano All Weather 42"" Case with the foam cutout for the rifle and mags for $1250.

Russian SVT-40 in 7.62x54R with battlefield pickup bayonet. It's a 1941 Tula in great shape with strong rifling. Numbers match except for the 10 round magazine, which is common and functions well with this rifle. SVT stock with no cracks and stainless gas system installed but I will include the stock gas system parts as well. $1200 OBO for this one.

Remington 870 Tactical with standard bead sight.Great HD shotgun in great shape. Has side saddle for six extra shells and some nice stipple work on the stock. $400 firm.

RAA Saiga 12 converted with nice parts. Has machined trigger guard, six position stock, and Arsenal pistol grip. This thing has ran flawless for me since I got it a few years ago. This is one of the few I've had that runs bird shot and heavy loads on the heavy gas port setting with no problems. Comes with two 10 round AGP mags and still has the thread protector on the barrel. I'm asking $1100.

French MAS 49/56 converted to .308/7.62x51 NATO (not 7.5 French, please do not try to correct me). It does not want to cycle correctly and I believe the chamber needs to be cleaned up by a gunsmith. It will chamber a round if you let the bolt slam home but has trouble extracting them. It does not rip cases but it seems like the cases are getting hung up in the chamber. You could most likely get this fixed for cheap and have a nice running rifle fairly easily, but I don't have time to fool with it. Comes with a 10 round detachable mag, sling, grenade sight, and grenade stock pad. Reduced to $450 for a quick sale.

Legion/Arsenal SGL-31 in excellent shape with very nice red russian furniture and night sights (yes, tritium night sights that are about two years old, very bright). Comes with two 40 round circle 10 magazines, three 30 round circle 10 mags, two 30 round circle 21 mag, one 30 round circle 25 mag, and three tapco 30 rounders for a total of two 40 rounders and nine 30 round mags. Also comes with over 1k rounds of surplus CORROSIVE 5.45x39 ammunition in a 50 cal ammo can (just use windex/urine after shooting to neutralize the salts from the primers). Asking $1600 for everything.

Finally, a PSA/ATI AR-15 that was unfired by me and in great shape. ATI Omni poly lower, PSA LPK, PSA carbine upper, PSA BCG and CH. Comes with a chopped AR carry handle rear sight that works great. Looking for $700 for this one and I can throw in one NIW 30 round PMAG.

If interested in any of these shoot me a text at REDACTED and I can send you more pics or info. Don't call me, just text and I will get back as soon as I can. First 'I'll take it' gets it and I won't hold these for anyone. I'm not looking for any trades at this time.

The walnut and the metal are both extremely good for the age and the rifle cycles just as it should.  I have put 100 rounds of Colt high velocity ammo through it.

I shoot mostly low power CB and Aguila ammo which is too short for this rifle to cycle properly so it isn't getting used.

The Pro Series is stainless steel with a matte finish and has a black synthetic grip. It has an adjustable rear sight and an interchangeable front sight, something the other models don’t have. Also, it has a recessed precision crown, which means the muzzle has been cut flat to allow propellant gases to escape evenly in turn improving accuracy. It has a large exposed hammer and a short four-inch barrel. And, it is the least expensive model with a suggested retail price of $969.

The wood finish is incredible. The action is as smooth as silk.

I am including the installed Choate 8-9 shot (total) magazine extension (was $60), camo sling (was $25), soft case (was $45), Mossberg gun lock, and the original magazine spring and end cap. The extension is easy to remove and return to original for hunting. These guns are about $360 new so do the math before offering - it is a fair price for a very good shotgun in near perfect condition and the included accessories.

For the right deal, I can include a very nice Winchester Model 190 .22 semi-auto rifle (worth $150 +/-). It shoots .22L and .22 LR and the magazine (tube) holds about 15 rounds.

More Firepower & Fewer Mag Changes

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion.

Differences between an Express 870 and a Police Magnum 870:

The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market. It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality. All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences. It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models. Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.Synopses of the variances are provided below.


870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.   
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.   
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.   
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.   
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.   
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.   
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.   
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.   
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.   
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

3X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.
The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

This 338 Win. Mag. load is designed for those who want the deepest possible penetration out of an expanding bullet fired from a 338 Win. Mag.  The 250gr. TSX by far out-penetrates the typical 250gr. premium type partition bullet. This 250gr. TSX load penetrates deeply enough to use on 2,000lb buffalo, shot at bad/extreme angles.

Both my 338’s have custom 22 inch barrel as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

2657 fps — Win. Mod. 70 with a 22-inch Krieger barrel
2677 fps — Rem. 700 with a 22-inch PAC-NOR barrel"

The Mini Thirty is chambered for the Russian 7.62x39mm cartridge, used in the SKS and AK-47, as many states prohibit hunting of deer with calibers smaller than 6 mm (.243 in). The 7.62x39 mm has similar ballistics to the well-known .30-30 Winchester. It operates on a fixed piston, semi self cleaning gas system. It has exactly four  small dings in the stock from being stored improperly and none of them actually crack the finish. No flaws in the metal at all.
 189 series . This one was made in 2000, and purchased new from a licensed gun dealer in 2001. It's purpose was to be a backup or extra rifle to an M14  with familer control levers. It was used as such for about two weeks right after Hurricane Katrina. Easily killed a toaster at roughly 80yds. Less than two hundred rounds total. I found a 5000 rd torture test on the net, easily. Numerous LEO Agencies have arsenal Ruger Mini 14s ( it's near twin) with upwards of 30,000 rds recorded.  It comes  with the following items. One Ruger five rd magazine, three chrome 30rd magazines, the Ruger rings for the built in scope mount, a new Black Hawk tactical sling, and one battered plastic hard case. Priced at $650.00 and located in SW ( Amite, Lincoln, Pike Co area) Mississippi."

One is a Desantis Sof-Tuck suede tuckable holster  (really nice, you can tuck your shit in by the holster clip) that I wore once (I settled on a pocket holster) and will throw in a leather general holster that I wore quite a bit for free.  Two holsters for Bersa Thunder .380/Walther PPK that I used once as well (I sold my Bersa-dumb decision).  One of the holsters is an ankle holsters the other is a regular OWB holster.  For the Rossi .357, I never used either holster (sold this gun too).  Both are IWB.  One is leather, other one is Nylon (I think).  Name your price (I take Paypal), pay for shipping, it is yours."
