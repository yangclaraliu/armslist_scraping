Trijicon 1x38 Sealed Reflex Sight (SRS) is a potent red dot sight by Trijicon that will redefine the way you think about reflex sights. Featuring image open field geometry and a distinctive body design, these Trijicon Red Dot Sights provide an extremely wide field of view with no ""tube effect"", thanks to their shorter case length and 28mm aperture. Built for close-quarters tactical maneuvers, the Reflex Sight has only a 1x magnification and a 1.75 MOA LED red dot for precise shooting without any target cover, and its rounded, low profile body won't snag or limit the mounting space on your rifle. The Trijicon SRS Red Dot Sight has ten different brightness settings for its LED illuminated reticle which can operate for at least three years (even on the highest setting) using the reflex sight's dual power sources. A powerful solar cell acts as a primary power source for the Trijicon SRS Red Dot Reflex Gun Sight, but as the day gets darker, the AA battery picks up the slack for nighttime operations. For supreme optical clarity, Trijicon has equipped the SRS with a multi-layer broadband anti-reflective coating, and the 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum housing is incredibly durable and waterproof to 165 feet. A distinctive, dependable, and durable red dot sight for any tactical operation, choose the Trijicon SRS 1.75 MOA Tactical Reflex Sight.

Due to health reasons not able to go. It was built on a brand new barreled action from Weatherby. Accurate Innovations stocked it with a hand crafted piece of Super Fancy Walnut and added a custom contrasting grip cap and fore end. They also installed there custom free float all steel chassis system and gave it 8 coats of hand rubbed oil finish. Rifle has amazing figure and fiddle running the full length of the Blank. The Blank alone was 800 before any work. AI sent it to Colt Firearms where one of there Master Engravers did the Beautiful Flur De Lure wrap around checkering with thumb strap. Its amazing and flawless. She also engraved the floor plate. Ive shot the rifle just 28 times since new and its deadly at 600 yards on 1/4 steel plates it cuts a hole right thru them with no problem. Comes with a one of only 200 made NRA limited edition sling that were only sold at the 2013 Dallas Safari Club Show and a Weatherby 3by9 Supreme Scope. 4300 invested. Thanks for looking.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

I have been a bit offline for a while due to my daughter's illness, I was away because I was called that my daughter was seriously sick and she was being rushed to the hospital. After several tests were performed on her, we got to know that she is suffering from breast cancer and she has to go through chemo treatment and surgical operation. I am sorry for the slow Response. I want to inform you that my assistant has sent out the payment to your contact address you gave me and it will be delivered to you 3-4 days but there is something I must bring to your notice, I discovered that some how my assistant have over paid you. The payment that was meant for another transaction was sent to you and the one meant for you was sent to another but the payment is on your name.I am very mad at her right now!

However I want to believe I won't have any problem with this and if I can trust you with my money. I don't even know you.I have never met you and don't know if I can trust you with the money.Please once you receive the payment, I will like you to take it to your bank and deposit it.Deduct your money for the item and help me send the remainder so to treat my daughter..We will be needing it for the treatment.Please safe my daughter's life.I hope this arrangement would work out..I will arrange how the item is sent and received  by an FFL address..This is just for you to ensure that I am possessing the item legitimately..This will however be after you receive funds and we have everything sorted out. I am a bit indisposed right now and so mad at my assistant!!! 

Your urgent response will be appreciated so that my mind will be at ease.

A Glock 20 10mm factory barrel actually will function in a G21/G21SF slide and maintain good accuracy. This has been clearly proven in live-fire testing, the results of which are available in multiple cases, for example, Post #79 of the Glock Talk thread titled ""Glock 21 conversion to Glock 20?"" posted in the General Glocking Forum (Update: the thread has been retired). The O.D. of a G21 and G20 barrel are identical and the barrel lugs are compatible. The same holds true for an aftermarket G20 replacement barrel in the G21 slide (aftermarket G20 barrels from Bar-Sto, KKM Precision, StormLake, Lone Wolf, EFK Fire Dragon and others). While a G20 barrel is a good fit in the critical dimensions, the 10mm barrel chamber hood is narrower than the 45ACP barrel hood by slightly more than .050 inch. The dimensions of a 45-10mm conversion barrel are identical to a G20 10mm factory or aftermarket replacement barrel except that the barrel hood of the conversion barrel is made .050"" wider to better fit the 45ACP pistol breechface."

Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

UPDATE: This is from a customer who bought a pair of these for his brother who is a U.S. Navy SEAL currently deployed:

-My brother informed me that your gloves held up in combat without any glitches. I guess you can say combat proven. Thanks again."

481,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2725481,For Sale/Trade:  Build your own BILLET AR-15: 80 percent lower receiver,"Springfield, Springfield, Missouri",$ 99,"Listed On: Friday, October 31, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a BILLET 80% Lower receiver. According to the ATF and the laws- This is not a firearm. This is an aluminum paperweight. With the correct tools and knowledge, you can complete this lower and make it into a lower receiver for an AR-15 style of rifle or pistol, completely legal. These are already de-burred and tumbled and ready to go! Requires machining out the trigger pocket and drilling the safety selector, trigger & hammer pin holes. Features the no roll pin design.


One advantage to completing this is being able to legally leave it blank or install your own marking on it. 

This is NOT your typical forged lower. This is billet- meaning it starts as a single block of aluminum and material is removed until it is in it's current state.  If you want to save money, there is a good seller on here that has $50 forged lowers. Many of the very top brands utilize billet lowers, like: Nemo, Noveske, Black Rain, Mega, etc. I just like the unique look and feel of the billet, and I just equate it to your top brands. That may not be accurate, just my thoughts. 

No bill of sale necessary, yes these can be shipped as they are just blocks of aluminum currently.

$110 for one and the price goes down if you want multiple. This is the cheapest you will find a billet 80 that is completely in spec like this one.

Here is a video on completing this into a lower as well as several photos:

From Kel-Tec:

The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

I bought this new about 8 years ago, with plans of using it to deer hunt with it, but never did. At the same time I also purchased a Simmons Scope that is made for use on a shotgun that I'm including with the barrel. If I remember correctly, I think the scope cost about $ 80.00 to $ 100.00, When we moved I took both the barrel and the scope out of the original boxes and put them in a hard shell gun case to protect them.

Absolutely the most accurate rifle I've ever fired. Only reason I'm letting her go is because its a little too heavy for my wife to carry. (Bare rifle weighs 8.25 lbs) 24"" stainless barrel. I will trade for cash and a basic (lighter weight) 308 or a 300 wsm and cash. Might consider other trades, but will need some cash either way. No shotguns or pistols. Will sell for $900 cash firm or I can leave the Burris Extreme Tactical 30mm rings and Leupold VX-R 3-9x50 scope for $1400. I have the box and paperwork for the scope, but not the rifle."

It runs Windows 8 and has 4GB of Ram with a Solid State Drive making it more durable when being transported. Being a laptop with a touchscreen is really cool and pretty handy.

This is a custom build and includes the following:

Upper:
-Daniel Defense 16"" Government Mid-Length 5.56 barrel, 1-7 Twist
-Daniel Defense Front Sight base
-DPMS Flat Rail Upper receiver w/ forward assist
-UTG Detachable Rear Ironsight handle
-Tufforce Mid-length Modular handguard
-BCM Charging Handle Mod4 by Bravo Company
-Phantom 5C2 Compensator/Flash Suppressor
-Magpul Angled Foregrip
-Leitner-Wise Enhanced Bolt Carrier group (unfired)

I fired about 200 rounds through it with a different Bolt Carrier Group, and then switched it out for the Leitner-Wise listed above. This is a highly rated enhanced BCG that is completely unfired and good to go. The rear sight handle is detachable and can easily be replaced with any standard Picatinny optics. The foregrip comes with attachable rail pieces to make it a quad rail, or even mount them diagonally as desired (I chose keep the rails minimal).

Put this kit on your Ruger carbine and make something cool...an AR training rifle. Feels just like shooting an AR, but for much cheaper. I purchased the kit brand new from Brownells for 170 + shipping. I used it for maybe 3 or 4 months, but I need some cash now, so I'm breaking down my rifle and selling the parts. You get everything the original kit came with PLUS the rubber gap filler that eliminates gap between the kit and the grip that you choose to put on.

I prefer to do this locally but if you want it shipped, I'll do it. I WILL NOT PAY FOR SHIPPING. My price doesn't include shipping either, so that will be up to you.

This kit has a little wear on the inside from being mounted on my rifle, but shows NO wear on the outside...It's pretty much a brand new kit. Please don't lowball me with insulting offers when I'm offering a fair price."

Excellent condition Winchester 44  lever gun with Burris 1 3/4 X 5 Fullfield  Scope with over under rings... scope and rifle bought new at the same time.
Other than the occasional oiling this rifle has not seen daylight in at least ten years and has only been in the woods one time and has under 20 rounds down the pipe.
Other than what looks like a small factory defect in the stock {looks like a tiny rub mark in the finish} this rifle is perfect zero scratches zero rust.
