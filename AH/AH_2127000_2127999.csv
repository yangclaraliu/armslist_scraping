Imported from Italy by legacy (chiappa). I've put about 100 rounds through it. Absolute pleasure to shoot. Great for plinking and very accurate as well. Holds 6 rounds of .22lr. Some wear from ""soft"" carrying case. Still a great piece. Cost just over $175 in February i believe. Will include the original box and papers and 100 rounds of winchester super x. 

Second is a Tristar 20ga auto. Up to a 3"" mag shell. Will hold 5+1 with 2 3/4 shells. Less than 50 rounds through it. I'll try to get pics up later today. Comes with 3 chokes, mag restricter for hunting, 100 rounds of ammo, bandoleer, and soft case. It has a vent rib barrel and uses the beretta and benelli chokes. Has a couple of scuffs on the walnut furniture but nothing major. This is super light and is a great shooter. Great for hunting, skeet, target or whatever. Cost was around $500 when I got it. 

Looking to do both in a trade. I'm mostly interested in a 357 revolver or working towards a 1911. Might be interested in others. I have both of these for sale separately in other listings. May throw in a little rg14 .22lr revolver (tacklebox gun) for the right deal.

 At 15 Million Volts the VTS-880 mini stun gun really pack a punch! Just test firing this unit into the air is often enough to stop an attacker. As the bright electric current pulsates between the test prongs and creates an intimidating electric sound, an attacker with any sense at all will be stopped in his tracks. If the sight and the sound doesn't stop him, a jolt from this stun gun most certainly will bring an attacker down in just 2 seconds! When an attacker is touched by the stun gun it will disrupt the message the brain sends to the voluntary muscles. Simply touching an attacker will deliver a high voltage shock causing loss of balance and muscle control, confusion, and disoriantation bringing him to his knees and making him incapable of further aggresive activity. Full recovery takes about five to ten minutes and there is no permanent harm.

The slide feels like its riding on ball bearings and the trigger is nice and light and crisp! I have owned several 1911's and this has the best ""out of the box"" trigger of any that I have owned! It's definetly a Classic! There is a link below for a good description of it. I got it in trade and I keep trying but I'm just not a 1911 guy. Less than 200 rounds through it! Comes with case, paperwork, Custom 1911 tool, 2-7 round mags & 2-10 round mags.Not a scratch on this Beautiful pistol!!! Might be interested in trades. Thanks! If this ad is up its still available! MSRP was $1250 I'm asking $850.00

I tested this from 22lr to 357 mag and it works flawlessly. Every bullet tracks along the 45 degree backstop and gets trapped in the box below. The problem is I miscalculated the weight and will not be able to get it into my basement as planned, it weighs 418 pounds. The opening of the impact zone is 2 feet wide x 2 1/2 feet tall. If you have land up north this would be perfect for you. I have over 20 years fabrication experience so I assure you this is solid and professionally made. This is a steal at $150.00, it cost me way more in metal not to mention 12 hours of fab work. Please email any questions you may have."

I bought this used at the beginning of the year and haven't shot it. 
Prior owner told me it had 22rds through it. He said its hard to initially break the fired brass free once fired. I've seen several complaints about this online so it seems to be a common issue with them not a defect in the upper. I haven't shot it to say if he was weak or if its truly a bear to break them free. 


I will include 18rds of American Eagle ammo with it the original owner gave me with it. Along with bipod and hammer Bohica recommended for the uppers.

After a recent range trip, I've found two loves to take the place of my two pistols. Here's what I have to offer: 

1 - A Sig Mosquito, 22LR, reverse two-tone, which I paid $400 for at Gander Mtn roughly 1 year ago. Still in excellent condition (cleaned thoroughly after every outing), I probably have 1500-2000 rounds through the gun. It comes with everything - the other recoil spring, front sights, lockout key, all paperwork, original box, and 1 year remaining from the 2 year Gander Mtn firearms plan. I also have a second magazine - Sig branded - which was a $40 purchase.

2 - A 1970 Polish P64. Bluing is just slightly worn at the muzzle, and just a bit on the trigger guard. Else, the bluing is in excellent condition - even on the barrel. I purchased the gun for $250, with the expectation to make it my CCW, but due to weight, I'm not pursuing that any longer. I added a set of wooden Marschall grips and the 22lb. recoil spring, and it became a nice shooter. You get everything - the gun, original grip, Marschall grip, and original recoil spring. If wanted, you can also have the Barsony IWB holster I picked up.

I'm looking for two pistols, or cash. I want a Browning Buckmark, Stainless, 6"" barrel with the comfy URX grip. I almost purchased one instead of the Mosquito and while I love the Mosquito, I want the range gun with fully adjustable sights. They were exactly the same price when I made my purchase, so I figured a 1 for 1 trade would be fair. For the P64, I would love to find a CZ-82. Wow, did that gun fit me! They both seem to sell for the same price, so I figure a 1 to 1 trade would also be fair - Sans the grips. I'll let them go for another $50 on trade value. I'll also throw in the 13 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense rounds I have.

Cash Value, I'd like at least $325 for the Mosquito, and $350 for the P64. I would take the cash from the sell of either one to a local gun shop for a down payment on the exact Buckmark I've been looking for. 

Thanks for reading, and I'm hoping to get some traction! I'll upload pictures as soon as I take them, or will be happy to text them upon request. PM's find me on my phone. Simple bill of sale, and I will look at 2 ID's. The usual stuff. If you make me ship, it will be at your expense."

4- Colt SAA 1st gen .38 wcf, just had a $1,ooo refinish job.  I know that kills the collector vale but still a beautiful gun.  I'll put a $1,500 value on it.

Here are some prices. Much of what is posted on this site came from Walmart.  I have been lucky enough to be there at the right time and able to get what I need to keep going to the range. I do not sell any of my ammo, I shoot it.
Here are some prices that I can back up with receipts. Some quite recent.

These are just the ones I can find receipts for that I bought over the last 5 months!
The prices have gone up from last year, but not all that much!
It takes a lot of patience and persistence to get this ammo at Walmart. I sometimes check in everyday on the way to work or on my way home. If I am lucky, I average a successful purchase every 3-6 weeks. That's' all it takes to keep me shooting, and set a box aside for when I don't find any.
Keep buying from these clowns at their mega inflated prices and they'll keep packing it in your rear.
By the way,to all you scalpers who will send me nasty emails for exposing you. I will post your email addresses and comments. So you might think twice and keep your comments to yourselves."

F.A. MFG. Co. Single Action Army Artillery Model revolver, serial #116900, 45 Colt, 5 1/2"" artillery length barrel with a mostly bright, very good plus bore which shows strong rifling and some sparse minor pitting. This is a rather nice revolver. The barrel retains perhaps 30% original blue in the protected areas, the balance faded to a pleasing smooth brown patina with the areas around the front sight still showing original feathering from the factory polish. The outer edge of the ejector housing is primarily a pewter and brown patina with the protected flutes showing nearly all their original blue. The frame is primarily a pleasing smoky mottled faded case-hardened patina retaining perhaps 30% original colors, most vivid in the pinched area at the front of the frame and beneath the recoil shields, the trigger guard and grip frame are primarily a pewter and softer brown patina with some minor sparse pinprick pitting. The hammer retains only traces of original colors and is mostly a deep mottled gray patina. The cylinder has flaked primarily to a pewter and brown with generous traces of original blue in the flutes. The one-piece walnut grip rates about very good showing perhaps an old light cleaning and with chips at the front and rear edges of the right side panel. Originally configured as a cavalry model delivered to the US Government Inspector at the Colt factory on Dec 14, 1885 and what is today commonly known as a “Late Military Model”. The frame is David F. Clark inspected from the 1884 contract and shows a very good ""US"" on the left side of the frame. The gun was returned to the Colt factory for refurbishing and returned to the Springfield Armory on August 3, 1903. A light cartouche of Rinaldo A. Carr and 1903 date can be seen faintly on the right panel, there is none on the left as-is correct for a 1903 inspected gun. Consistent with the Colt refurbished cavalry single action revolvers, it has a mix of serial numbered components. The trigger guard is numbered 116486, the back strap is 116488; the cylinder is unnumbered and is ""RAC"" marked on its rear edge showing replacement during the 1903 refurbish. The barrel shows small ""P"" and ""A"" inspectors markings and is numbered 2232 beneath the ejector rod housing; it retains its original barrel roll-marking."

Curious to see what kind of offers I can get. Trust me this is a rare have and I guarantee you will not see many more or if any up for grabs. 85% of the AR community don't even know it exist.

This is a 7+1 .32acp Semi-Automatic w/Matte Black Finish & Flip Up Barrel

1) Barrel... Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for accuracy.
2) Slide... Machined out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.
3) Sights... Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.
4) Frame-mounted Safety... Manual, conveniently thumb operated.
5) Contoured Tang. Top of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate the shooter’s hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.
6) Frame… Made of special aluminum alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.
7) Trigger Pull. Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action.
Snag Proof Design. Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS.
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta firearms. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities.
PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stove piping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.
EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what this double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equaling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package.

D. Nimschke.  It is almost identical to serial number 114, which is accepted as the first Nimschke engraved Single Action.  We have enclosed a picture of #114 for comparison.  This gun is in excellent original condition, retaining 20% original nickel, beautiful floral engraving, and one piece checkered ivory grips.  This is a stunning piece, used but well cared for, with excellent crisp markings and lots of character.  The bore and the mechanics are fine, and nothing needs to be fixed or replaced.  L. D. Nimschke was considered one of the best, if not the best, of all New York engravers and his work is legendary.  At this time period, almost all Colt engraving was done in New York, and it wasn’t until 1880 that Colt hired their first notable full time engraver, Cuno Helfricht, who’s mentor was L. D. Nimschke."

602,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2127602,For Sale:  1968 Llama .380 Especial - 99%,"Santa Fe, New Mexico, United States",$ 400,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 18, 2013",Handguns,Llama                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"These photos don't do the pistol justice. This Llama is collectors quality. If you are looking for a run of the mill pocket .380, this is not your gun. You can get a plastic Ruger or Kel Tec cheaper. 

However, if a 5/8 scale 1911 is to your liking, this might be the one. In 1968, the Llama .380 was a virtual clone of the Colt 1911, and used the same recoil system. Later guns used a blowback system which was cheaper to make since there was less fitting of parts. They were not as reliable as this ""miniature Colt"". The later blowback guns also have more felt recoil than this one.

This particular one is not marked with Stoeger or any other importer's marks, since it was made before the Gun Control Act of 1968. It is not messed with, and has been extremely reliable. I have shot two boxes of ammo through it in the past five years with zero malfunctions. The grips are checkered walnut, and much more attractive in person than my junky photos. It even has a grip safety like a 1911 and CAN be safely carried cocked and locked in Condition One.

If you have read this far, you are probably a collector, and will know that the Especial was Llama's top of the line small pistol, with extra care taken in the polish, bluing, and grips. The breech area is still shiny and retains its original polish. The actual barrel portion retains almost all of its bluing. There is zero holster or pocket wear showing on it.

It does not have the factory cardboard box. However, I have it in a fitted plastic box that I put together for safety and protection of the gun. When you see it, you will understand how nice these guns really were.

If you want to have a look at it, email me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call you right away. I used to put my phone number in these ads, but I got inundated with text messages from foreign scammers. So email is best until Armslist can figure out how to get rid of those guys.

Thanks for reading my (as usual) long winded ad. This is very a nice pistol and you will like it. Doby Pilgrim,  Santa Fe"

The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds."

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

I have for sale my beautiful Cimarron FULL SIZE 1911 A1 in shiny nickel finish with Rosewood grips. Included in the price are 195 rounds of 45 ACP HollowPoints and FMJs. This weapon is clean, beautiful, well oiled, and well maintained. ( I am in the Marines and I am obsessive about taking care of my firearms). The action is tight and smooth. This trusty sidearm is an exact replica of the 1911 A1 and the original patent date is stamped on the slide. It is a full size (government) model. This pistol is accurate and dependable. The only reason I am selling it is because I purchased a different weapon for my CCW. I do not need two pistols laying around, and being that I'm a college student I'm just going to try and get some money out of it. I have around 100 rounds (Two boxes) of FMJ through this weapon and it has been cleaned after every use. I shot a box of twenty (20) hollow points just to see how they would feed and the weapon did great. I have the original box for the weapon.

In the attached photos: the rifle for sale has the darker blue/black finish, the other rifle is just for comparison with a typical Garand finish.

I’ve gone to gun shows since I grew up in the 60’s but I am not an expert on Garands. Like most all Garands this one has been rebuilt, but apparently in Great Britain, due to the British proof marks, black British-style finish, and several British-style repairs to the handguard.

This rifle is a CAI import, they do not seem to have a good reputation on the internet. CAI seems to be accused of using bad, even rewelded receivers. However, my rifle has an excellent condition, original Springfield Armory receiver which dates to early February, 1944. The barrel is marked SA 2-44 and must be the original barrel, unfortunately it is pitted and has muzzle wear. If you are fanatical about barrel condition or want the rifle for target shooting this is probably not your best choice in a Garand. (At least it is the original barrel.)

The stock is very nice, with a clear circle-P marking and the remains of the outline of a cartouche box. The inside of the stock is marked “OR” apparently, and possibly the numbers 3312.

These parts are SA: hammer, trigger housing, bolt, receiver, barrel.

Trigger guard: WRA 46025.

Op rod HRA 6535382.

It seems there are several possible uses for this rifle:
•	Keep and value the rifle as-is, representing a “British arsenal commercial rework” variation of the Garand rifle.
•	Keep and value the rifle as-is for casual shooting, as a historical relic, an investment (future imports may be banned) and even now as a reliable, hard-hitting weapon.
•	Take the rifle apart and apportion the parts as they best help your collection.
•	Keep the ammo, see below, sell or trade the rifle in the future.

Now about the ammo:

This package includes 1000 rounds of clean, shiny military surplus ammo with sealed primers. Of the 1000 rounds, 720 are Greek 30-06 ball; the remaining 280 rounds are black tip FN A/P.

Of these 1000 rounds, 840 rounds are already loaded into 8-round Garand clips, 280 rounds into each of 3 vintage ammo cans. (105 loaded 8-round clips=840 rounds.)

One can is fully loaded with Fabrique Nationale black tip A/P ammo on clips, here is a possible retail value for this one can of ammo: 280 rounds @ $1.50 each, 35 clips @ $3 each, $20 for vintage ammo can, total $545.

To approximate the retail price the Greek ball, 720 rounds @ $1 each, 2 more ammo cans @ $20 each, 70 more clips @ $3 each, total $970."

PRICE: $1750 or consider trades involving your military Luger, P38, P1, preban Polytech milled AK style rifle or preban Norinco 56S or side-folder 56S-2.

I will start by describing the rifle, then the ammo.

In the attached photos: the rifle for sale has the darker blue/black finish, the other rifle is just for comparison with a typical Garand finish.

I’ve gone to gun shows since I grew up in the 60’s but I am not an expert on Garands. Like most all Garands this one has been rebuilt, but apparently in Great Britain, due to the British proof marks, black British-style finish, and several British-style repairs to the handguard.

This rifle is a CAI import, they do not seem to have a good reputation on the internet. CAI seems to be accused of using bad, even rewelded receivers. However, my rifle has an excellent condition, original Springfield Armory receiver which dates to early February, 1944. The barrel is marked SA 2-44 and must be the original barrel, unfortunately it is pitted and has muzzle wear. If you are fanatical about barrel condition or want the rifle for target shooting this is probably not your best choice in a Garand. (At least it is the original barrel.)

The stock is very nice, with a clear circle-P marking and the remains of the outline of a cartouche box. The inside of the stock is marked “OR” apparently, and possibly the numbers 3312.

These parts are SA: hammer, trigger housing, bolt, receiver, barrel.
Trigger guard: WRA 46025.
Op rod HRA 6535382.

It seems there are several possible uses for this rifle:
•	Keep and value the rifle as-is, representing a “British arsenal commercial rework” variation of the Garand rifle.
•	Keep and value the rifle as-is for casual shooting, as a historical relic, an investment (future imports may be banned) and even now as a reliable, hard-hitting weapon.
•	Take the rifle apart and apportion the parts as they best help your collection.
•	Keep the ammo, see below, sell or trade the rifle in the future.

Now about the ammo:
This package includes 1000 rounds of clean, shiny military surplus ammo with sealed primers. Of the 1000 rounds, 720 are Greek 30-06 ball; the remaining 280 rounds are black tip FN A/P.
Of these 1000 rounds, 840 rounds are already loaded into 8-round Garand clips, 280 rounds into each of 3 vintage ammo cans. (105 loaded 8-round clips=840 rounds.)
One can is fully loaded with Fabrique Nationale black tip A/P ammo on clips, here is a possible retail value for this one can of ammo: 280 rounds @ $1.50 each, 35 clips @ $3 each, $20 for vintage ammo can, total $545.

To approximate the retail price the Greek ball, 720 rounds @ $1 each, 2 more ammo cans @ $20 each, 70 more clips @ $3 each, total $970.

FOR SALE OR TRADE: $1750 for the rifle and ammo as described."

This is a brand-new offering from American Tactical Imports, a Turkish company that has gained a good rep for its affordable copies of well-regarded rifles. Their 1911’s have also established a strong position in a crowded market, but this double-stack .380 ACP represents a new direction for them: it’s a near-exact copy of the Beretta 84 Cheetah, even accepting the same magazines.

The aluminum alloy-framed MS380 accepts 12+1 rounds of .380 and launches them from a locked breech through a 3.9” barrel. Its mass empty is 660g. or almost 24 oz. - This is no lightweight pocket gun, but it’s no steel-framed 1911 either."

You've been asking for a couple heavy 45 AUTO RIM standard pressure loads, so by popular demand, here they are. Both of these loads utilize high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the ballistic equivalent of +P 45 ACP loads, yet they operate at standard 45 ACP pressures. These loads are safe to use in ANY 45 ACP revolver that is in normal operating condition, including ANY model 1917 Colt or S&W revolver.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch MT Gun gives velocities almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 inch and 6.5 inch barrels. This is not a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel.

Item # 31B - 200gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1033 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 950 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1046 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1063 FPS

All models come standard in 9mm with 45acp available.

The Signature Compact Model features many of the Signature Series attributes such as a proprietary thinned frame and mainspring housing that are scalloped to provide a positive grip without the abrasion some people feel from checkering. The grips are a new pattern of G10 that are thinned to make concealed carry even easier, and feature a relieved area on the side to allow easy access to the magazine release. Add to that the soft shooting 9mm caliber and you have an ideal carry gun.

The barrel / bushing combination make for an easy take-down without the use of any special tools.

Just like all newly manufactured Nighthawk Custom handguns, the new Signature Series Compact features our ultra hi-cut frame that allow shooters with very large hands to get that pinky finger to rest firmly on the frame while shooting. It also allows a more natural point when you extend your arm since your hand goes up into the frame much further.
