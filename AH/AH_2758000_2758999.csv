Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.

LONG VERSION:
College student looking for a handgun.  Not for carry but just want a piece to keep in a drawer.  

Looking for a nice quality weapon, preferably from the more well-established manufacturers (Glock, Ruger, Taurus, Sig, H&K, etc.).  Would prefer semi-automatic over a revolver but depending on what you are selling I will consider either (I am considering price before weapon).  Would like to stay in the $200 range (yes, I know that is ridiculously low considering what I am asking for, but I have seen people selling their guns for even less than that on here); willing to negotiate within reason but will not go above $300.  

Non-FFL, in-person sale only.  If you are not willing to sell face-to-face for cash then do not bother to contact me.  I am located near the USC campus in downtown Los Angeles.  I understand there is a lot of gang activity in this area so if necessary proof of USC student status will be provided upon request so you know you are not providing a gun to a gang member.

Just FYI, trade value on a used Gen 3 Glock for me is $400-$450 and $500 for a Gen 4. If you're trying to get me to give you $500 for a beat up gen 3 when I can buy a new on for $569.00 you're wasting your time and mine

I'll take a glock plus cash, or you can make up the difference in ammo or accessories. (Sights, holsters, lights, mags.)

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail.

It is no small thing for a company with Fabrique Nationale’s reputation for quality manufacture to license another entity to manufacture one of their products, but in the case of Precision Small Parts (PSP), now known as Precision Small Arms (PSA), quality of manufacture is not an issue. This gun simply exudes quality. Even the low-end Traditional model is beautifully finished both inside and out. You hold it in your hand and it “feels” right. You work the action and you know immediately it is a well made weapon.
Since I’m praising the gun so highly, I don’t think the PSA company will take it amiss if I quote from their brochure: “Le Bébé is a single action, semi-automatic, self-loading, blow-back mechanism manufactured of all steel alloy components. It is striker fired and utilizes a smooth faced, single stage draw bar trigger with pull weight of 5.25 lbs. It can hold six rounds in its magazine and one chambered. Le Bébé’s barrel is 2.13 inches long, has 6 lands and grooves and is right-hand twisted with a radius of 3.54 inches. Le Bébé is 4.11 inches long, stands 2.88 inches tall and is .88 inches thick.” In addition, the PSA website states: “When utilized with modern high-velocity ammunition, this pistol can achieve the effectiveness of a .380. It should not be underestimated with regard to lethality.”*

The above stated pistol is stone mint. It is unfired and free of any rust, scuffs, dings etc.
The action is very very smooth and the finish has a very high luster, just tits. 
I am just testing the waters to see what is out there.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included back straps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

I never used it in the field it just sat in my night stand. It works perfectly comes with 3 sets of battery's and all of the different sizes for whatever handgun you may own. 

I just priced one of these at a local gun shop and they are wanting 319.00. I'd be willing to take 200 which is a solid 100 bucks less than new for an almost new laser/light for your pistol. 

I'd also entertain trades for Glock items or possibly use this light toward a Glock 19/23 magazines or items that would work with it.
