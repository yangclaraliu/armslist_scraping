The  is chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 16 inch barrel and standard A2 flash hider. One unique aspect of the Rhino Arms AR-15 is the addition of a reinforced magwell (easily seen in the pictures) which makes the rifle tough enough for extremely hard use, though i've babied it myself-- approximately 400 rounds have passed through the chamber (it runs steel cased ammo as well as it does brass). I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be. I purchased the rifle new in 2010 in stock configuration and proceeded to add the following accessories:

Stag Arms 6-position retractable stock
Blackhawk ergonomic Grip
Blackhawk quad rail
Magpul AFG2

To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence. Pick up this Red Dot Sight for maximum shooting performance!

OVERVIEW:

 Bone Collector Logo

The Remington Model 700, a rifle with no equal, and a superior performer in every way. Its accuracy and dependability have become the standard by which all other centerfire rifles are measured and continually fall short. Still the most accurate out-of-the-box rifle made, the Model 700 brings its famous action and renowned consistency to this diverse family of guns. Now they are equipped with our externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger system.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website

New in the family is the Model 700 XCR II Camo Bone Collector Edition, emblazoned with Michael Waddell's Bone Collector logo and built to master the most extreme conditions. Featuring our armor-tough new black matte TriNyte® Corrosion Control System on its stainless steel barreled action and a stock dressed in Realtree® AP™ HD™ camo.

KEY FEATURES:

Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement
Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming ""three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength
Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head
X-Mark Pro Adjustable Trigger - featuring super-tight tolerances and mirror-like surface finishes, it breaks like glass and is adjustable for trigger pull weight
Realtree AP HD camo stock

From Nikon:

The new PROSTAFF 5 2.5-10x40 features several technology upgrades that will satisfy even the most demanding hunters. A bright new optical system, remarkable hand-turn reticle adjustments with Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset turrets, and a convenient quick-focus eyepiece with a 4x zoom ratio, make adjustments while in a shooting position a breeze. The PROSTAFF 5 2.5-10x40 outfitted with the BDC reticle is an ideal fit for a variety of hunting situations and can be used with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology to take the guesswork out of compensating for bullet drop. With enough power for the longest-range shots and a wide field of view to keep you on target even when shooting through thick brush and timber, this is one scope you can truly count on in any situation. In addition all PROSTAFF 5 riflescopes are built with fully multicoated optics for maximum light transmission, even in extreme low light environments.

It is my opinion (and the opinion of many others) that this optic is worth a good bit more than they sell for. The Department of Defense has a contract for this optic and this model is in the field right now overseas (many times on 50 BMGs). It is built like a tank, is very clear and crisp, and tracks perfectly.  I previously had this optic mounted on a 308 and was shooting out to 700 yards with it (the optic would be suitable for much greater distances beyond the capability of the 308). The only reason that I removed it from the 308 is because I purchased an HDMR.

The two features that set it apart from the others are the night vision mode and the integrated quick detach/attach A.R.M.S. levers. Being skeptical of its ability to return to zero after being removed, I tested this extensively when I purchased it and at 100 yards I was never able to detect a point of impact shift. Due to the EoTech having the dot within a 65 MOA circle reticle nothing is faster on targets up close.  I have found that I am able to quickly and easily hit a 10"" plate offhand at 300 yards with the central 1 MOA dot (match ammo in a 1/2 minute capable rifle holding 4-6 inches over with a 50 yard zero). The sight is in very good condition since it has lived most of its life in a rifle case inside of a safe. It has a very light barely noticeable scrape on the side of the hood and the buttons indicate that it has been lightly used.  I have decided to put a dedicated magnified optic on this rifle due to its accuracy and have no other rifle on which it can be used.

These sights sell for $700 new. $500 is my price and I believe that it is very reasonable. If you are thinking about a lowball offer don't wast your time, I will not respond. This is a face to face sell only in the North Alabama area, I will not ship. I am not generally not interested in a trade but I have been offered items in the past that have changed my mind. Typically I respond quickly to your email but at times due to my erratic schedule it may be the following day."

This is a fairly nice example of an early production Saginaw Steering & Gear M1 Carbine produced during WWII.  It's been overhauled due to the adjustable rear sight, but its a fantastic example of a somewhat harder to find manufacturer.  I am not sure if the High-Wood, I-Cut Rock-Ola stock is original to the carbine or not.  Saginaw supposedly used some Rock-Ola I-Cut stocks in very early rifles, but this one lacks the RSG and acceptance cartouches that you would expect to see.

the inside of the barrel looks brand new. the hex on the breech plug shows some signs of use ( corners of the hex are slightly flared) it still works fine and the wrench does not slip when removing or installing the plug. you should expect normal wear from use on the exterior of the barrel. i see a few rub marks/scratches on the barrel itself. nothing major just from normal use. the forgrip looks like new. the push rod has a little of the black anodize rubbed off of it. again normal wear you would expect. 

it takes 209 shotgun primers

the stock itself sells for $39. the t-handle wrench thats included another $15. 


i got this barrel with a thompson encore i picked up last year. im not really interested in black powder so its time to get rid of it. it was used by the previous owner but it does not appear to be abused.

the barrel measures about 26 3/8""

I also have a box with cleaning supplies, bullets, powder and tools that i will give to whoever buys the barrel as a bonus. this should be considered a bonus as what you see in the pic is well worth the asking price.

Your land, your rules: there would be no litter whatsoever, including cigarette butts, plastic wrappers, cans, boxing or target fragments. Everything I bring leaves with me as well. I could even hand over my brass if you want it. I'll obey any and all rules applied to me, and would even be willing to provide cash for the right to come and shoot. I'm looking to avoid range fees, but I'm open to any and all negotiations. Distance from Dallas is no issue; I can handle a road trip for the opportunity.

40 rounds (approx) of Remington ammo 

This gun is dialed in at 100 yards and ready to go coyote and groundhog hunting. This package would cost you almost $700 after tax and shipping to put together and you still wouldn't have it zeroed or free floated.
