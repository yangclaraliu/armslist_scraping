I bought these for my daughters but because they are Airweights the kick is a bit much for them. They are matte stainless. They have crimson trace grips and both have had action jobs as well as the triggers have been contoured. They have about 50 rounds through them. They do have the locks on them but they have been disabled. I have the parts to enable them if you wanted to. They come with original box. I'm not in a hurry to get rid of these. My price is firm at $600.00 each or $1200.00 for the pair. I have over $700 in each of the pistols. I'd also entertain trades. See below. I will not ship and transfers must be made through a FFL.

The Nikko Stirling Target master is available in four variable zoom models that allow the user to adjust the magnification required to suit their needs. The main body of the scope is a 30 mm hard alloy tube that provides added strength and light transmission over one inch rifle scopes. The lenses are coated in our ETE Microlux coatings, which allow maximum light transmission to your eyes so you see the target faster, clearer and with more contrast. The Adjustments are Target style, to adjust simply pull out gently and turn to the desired setting. Push down again to lock. You can also return the dial setting to Zero with out special tools so you can be ready in the field to accurately compensate as required for both windage and elevation. Key Features: All Target master rifle scopes feature Side Parallax and focus adjustment. This is easily achieved in with the side adjustments compared to objective adjusting rifle scopes. Also located on the side is the switch for the illumination of the reticle. This looks much neater and allows quick adjustments in the field. Fast focus eyepieces allow you to adjust the scope to suit your eye strength.

I've had some good .22's, but this is a great .22. Take it over a 10/22 any day, might even take it over my old Winchester pump .22 ??? Would be a GREAT rifle for a young man just learning how to shoot or hunt, and Dad.. you won't cringe when he leans it up against something and it scapes all the way down until the loud thud of the floor stopping it, snaps you back from the daydream of you thinking he's growing up- and you think, ""Won't hurt that gun..."" 

Anyway:

*22 long and Long rifle & High Speed Shorts (means it will shoot anything in the .22 family except the magnum... but I could be wrong)
*Great squirrel gun. Already weathered and won't be afraid to drop it- Great workhorse.
*Does have a ""lock the bolt back"" mechanism. After seeing this thing fired, I know why it was hard to engage- It's never been used. (Would be easy if the gun jammed a lot) 
*15 rounder maybe more- especially if they are shorts
*Double Extractors pull the shell from both sides of the shell casing for positive ejection
*Has upper feed ramp to correctly feed the .22 shorts
*Hammer hits nice, hard, and solid. This is exactly what you want with a .22.  
*Shell deflector- that is removable, I think. But I wouldn't- Looks cool.
*Safety is at the thumb- slides forward and back- Great for those that forget the safety in critical shot situations.
*Rear sight is cracked on the side but has no effect on the sight or being sighted in, at all (being descriptive so no surprises)

Supposedly made by Steven's for Belknap.
Super Easy to Clean- One screw removes stock for easy access to all metal, moving parts. 
Gun made in KY.
Vintage.. I think an early 70's model.
Great Patina.. already has the scratches and honest wear you can't fake.
Kinda ""Stripy"" wood... good-looking, old, solid gun.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag

inserted into the pistol.

You have to check this out.

When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a combat shotgun, they bought a Benelli. That's because a combat shotgun has to function the first time, every time. The Benelli M4 does it for the U.S. military, and now can be the centerpiece of your own home defense plan. Benelli engineers developed and patented a unique auto-regulating gas-operated (ARGO) system. Dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber operate directly against the bolt assembly. It's a simple and dependable system that eliminates the complex linkage, springs and heavy parts that other semi-automatic shotguns have to depend on. The result is marine-tough reliability under the harshest environmental conditions. The M4 comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a ghost-ring fully adjustable rear sight, and fixed-blade front sight. This variation features a rugged black synthetic stock and a pistol grip and holds five rounds of ammunition.

697,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2352697,For Sale:  Sig P229R .40 - 9 mags - 3 holsters,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, November 25, 2013",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a great package for a new gun to CCW

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing."

722,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2352722,For Sale:  600 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington",$ 600,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 19, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

I do have more of this ammunition if you would like up to 800 rounds. 
For sale is 600 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

739,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2352739,For Sale:  VLTOR MUR Modular Upper Receiver w/ Bolt Assist and Deflector,"Houston, Texas, United States",$ 209,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 15, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand New! Factory Fresh! New in box!

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. 

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. 

The MUR comes in two models: one with a Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector and the second with a Shell Deflector only. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door. 

Construction:
7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved; heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment.

Compatibility: 
Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available).

Weight:
MUR-1A (with assist) weighs less than 10 oz. The MUR-1S (shell deflector only) weighs less than 8 oz.

Dimensions:
Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”.

Color/Finish:
Black matte (anti-reflection/glare) Hard coat anodized (Type-III, Class 2). Bore’s surface in coated with dry film lube, over the anodized surface.

Special Features:
Improved strength over conventional forged “flat-top” upper receivers. Stronger than any “billet” upper receiver with similar material and dimensional characteristics. Tighter manufacturing tolerances, when compared to the competition."

Price is negotiable, but the revolver appraised at $2,200.00

This revolver has been appraised by a company specializing in Civil War era pistols. The company’s information and appraisal sheet regarding this revolver is available upon request. 

A friend gave me this revolver a few days ago before moving out of state. I am heavily into modern weapons, but nothing of this nature.

Regarding the Revolver:

Make: Starr Arms 
Model: 1863 Single Action
Caliber: .44

Barrel: A flashlight was shined down the barrel to better see the barrel's condition. The appraisers were impressed. There is very little pitting for being a revolver of that age (see link for photo).

Mechanics: The revolver is in excellent working order. I was advised against shooting this revolver after telling them I was tempted to shoot it. (see link for photo)

Markings: On the right side handle, you can see where the military cartouche is located. On the right side of the revolver, it reads “Starr’s Patent Jan, 18.1856.” On the left side of the revolver, it reads “Starr.Arms.Co.New.York.” (see link for photo)

KEL-TEC CNC INDUSTRIES       22 WMR    
Kel-Tec PMR30GY PMR-30 22Win Mag 4.3"" 30+1 Zytel Grip Gray Frame/Charcoal
The PMR-30 is a lightweight, full size pistol (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates
on a unique hybrid blow back /locked-breech system. This operation system
allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts
between locked breach and blow back operation, depending on the pressure of
the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a design that holds 30
rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a
crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb
activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide
locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also
provided.  Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip,
slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced
Nylon (Zytel). The magazine is also Zytel with round count ports. Other
features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine
release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight,
Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive
coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective
heat dissipation. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single
pin.

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.
