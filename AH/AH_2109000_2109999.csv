Great shooter! I've had this for about two to three years and I've only been able to get it out to the range a few times.

I've converted it to the 922r configuration (pistol grip) with a bolt-on kit from Mississippi Auto Arms and Ace (steel) stock. Length of pull is 12"" for the stock. Fits great in your hands and extremely reliable. The 922r conversion is reversible since this is a bolt-on kit, so original polymer stock and forend will be included with the rifle (not pictured). Also includes factory cleaning rod, oil bottle, tool kit, and brushes (pictured). This rifle has some other external modifications for your enjoyment: Quad-rail forend, foregrip, rear dovetail sight rail with QD mount, QD stud for single-point tactical sling, M249 SAW grip, Bushnell Trophy 4 reticle red-dot sight with green night-vision setting, 8 thirty round polymer magazines, 1 factory 10 round magazine, rifle-bag with slots for magazines. This rifle is my baby. This rifle is clean, well-kept, and has served me very well.

THE BUY IY NOW is for the Ruger Mini 14 223 SS and the OTF knife.

The Ruger Mini 14 223 SS favorite for any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities, the Ruger Mini-14 Ranch .223 Rem/5.56mm Stainless Steel Rifle is made for unparalleled reliability in harsh conditions. The Mini-14 Ranch starts with a simple and rugged Garand-style action with breechbolt locking system for trustworthy performance in less than optimal operating conditions. The gun's heavy, hammer-forged, 18.5'' stainless steel barrel is extra rigid for exceptional accuracy. Rear adjustable aperture sight and protected, non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. The Mini-14 All Weather Ranch Rifle's black synthetic stock is checkered for a sure grip in any weather condition. Garand-type safety. Capacity: 5+1.

A gun such as the Mini-14 has been around long enough to have the bugs worked out and to have proven itself as a reliable and useful firearm. The slick little Mini-14 handles well, points like an extension of your arm, and is not picky about ammunition.


Ruger Mini-14 All Weather Ranch Rifle Specifications:

• Caliber: 223 Rem / 5.56 NATO
• Stock: Black Synthetic
• Finish: Matte Stainless
• Rear Sight: Adjustable peep
• Front Sight: Blade
• Barrel Length: 18.50""
• Overall Length: 37.50""
• Material: Stainless steel barreled action
• Length of Pull: 13.00""
• Weight: 6.75 lbs.
• Weight: 7 pounds
• Capacity: 5 rd
• Grooves: 6
• Twist: 1:9"" RH
For a rifle of this type, I find the Ranch Rifle relatively attractive. The lines are classic U.S. military, at least according to my Garand sensibilities. The synthetic stock is well done, without the all too common excessive mold lines and the soft matte stainless finish is pleasant to the eye.

With an unloaded twenty round factory magazine installed, this Mini-14 comes in right at 7 pounds. The trigger is greatly improved from the prior incarnations I've used, breaking at five pounds after a short amount of take up. It is actually a bit lighter and crisper than the previously reviewed Benelli MR1 and hugely better than the 9.25 pound trigger of my Ruger SR-556. The Mini-14 itself is lighter and better handling than either the SR-556 or the eight pound Benelli MR1. The model is aesthetically indistinguishable from the Mini-14 All-Weather and Patrol Rifle stainless variations.

The Ranch Rifle has an 18.5 inch barrel. The velocity loss from shorter barrels can be substantial. Back in 2001, the folks at Accurate Reloading started with a Sako S491 with a 22-inch barrel and chopped it down in one inch increments all the way to 10 inches. Velocities were recorded using a variety of handloads, but all with 52 grain bullets. An example using Alliant H322 produced 3318 fps with the factory 22 inch barrel. Shortened to 19 inches, the velocity dropped to 3213 fps. At 16 inches, the velocity was 3085 fps. Factory test barrels are 24 inches for the most part and with any carbine you won't get near factory published .223 velocities."

This rifle was made by Remington for the Czar of Russia prior to the Bolshevik revolution.  Most of these rifles were never delivered to the Russians but were used by the US army for training.  Many of the rifles that did actually make it to Russia had the Czar markings damaged by the communists. This rifle retains the origional Czar crest and markings. This rifle also saw action in the Soviet-Finn war prior to WW2. It was captured by the Finns and has the Finn capture mark. It also has a nicer Finn sling and sling swivels installed. The rifle is in great shape with matching numbers. This very collectible rifle drips history having traveled across the world twice. It comes with 400 rnds of ammo as well.

I purchased this revolver brand new from a local dealer the end of December 2012 for my girlfriend. She put 42 rounds through it and decided she didn't like revolvers. My preference is pistols, so it has been sitting in my gun safe ever since and I have no use for it. It's in great shape and only has the 42 rounds fired through it. It's essentially brand new!
I paid $492.76 (including tax) for the revolver brand new. I'm not looking to make a profit, I'd just like to come close to getting what I paid for it.
My asking price is $350.00 and I'll include the remaining 208 rounds of .22 Magnum/WMR.  You must have a PTP or CCW in order to purchase. I would prefer to sale to someone in Minnesota. I will accept cash or check only. If you choose to pay by check, I will not transfer the firearm until the check has cleared.  We can go to an FFL south of the river and you will be responsible for the transfer fee. I believe it's around $20 to $30.
If interested, please call me at REDACTED.

Ohio purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person at our location. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer.

If you’re not a local resident, and can’t make the drive to our location, we can ship the firearm to a local FFL dealer in your area.  The receiving FFL dealer will complete the background check, and transfer the firearm to you.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.  We do not accept returns on firearms, because once the firearm is sold, it is considered a used item, and we can no longer sell it as new.

We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade, because we cannot examine the firearm before buying it.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

I also put a $20.00 (plus shipping) black Houge slip on grip on here. The grip feels good, but I never fired the gun. Never got to the range with it. Now I need the money. Has a Lifetime warranty to you, the new owner. Hipoint honors the warranty to whomever owns the gun...forever. No receipt ever required. If you break it, melt it, run over it, they will fix it...forever. This is not a cheap Titan or Jennings/Bryco or other pot metal gun. It is reliable. They always fire, they are accurate and the 9mm isn't bad looking. The .40 cal looks like a tarantula but the 9mm is pretty good looking. They are not a Colt, but they will never fail to fire.
It has ghost ring sites and 3 dot sites, both from the factory and easily interchangable. Price is firm"

Yep, this is the impossible to get stainless steel S&W 4"" model 617. It has the awesome 10 shot cylinder in 22 Long Rifle caliber.
This is the revolver that is built like a tank and will be working perfectly in 100+ years.  The 10 shot capability is a game changer which puts the capacity of a semi-auto in the beauty and reliability of a K-frame revolver. The 4"" barrel is what you want as well, as the 6"" barrel is too heavy and does not balance as well either. 
I purchased this from Antique & Modern Firearms last month for my son's birthday, but it just is too big for his 9 year old hands. Original price tag of $769 is in the box with all correct papers. The test casing has a factory date of June 2013 - you want either as new of a date as possible, or as old of a date as possibe due to 2010/2011 having questionable quality control on what S&W shipped out there for a couple years. This one is dead nuts perfect!  It has only been handled for 5 minutes, and it is 100% brand new and in the box. Has never been shot (outside of the factory tests), gun was cleaned by myself but that's it!
You have the chance here to actually get your hands on one, and below what I payed for it, plus I will be eating the sales tax too. My price is firm, if you look around you will see most are $800 on ArmsList. My price is fair, and if it does not sell then it will go in the safe for 4 - 5 years till it fits my son. 
No disappointments here folks, this is the real deal - the pinnacle of the American made 22LR revolver. Will end up being your great-grandson's pistol!!!
I will have to meet in Lexington as my job will not allow me the time to travel right now. Click on the ""contact seller"" link above to ask any questions and I will be happy to get right back with you. Thanks and God bless."

As many of you know, North Carolina became the latest state to legalize the use of suppressors when hunting. Effective October 1st, hunting with suppressors will be legal. What many of you might not know is that it is extremely difficult if not impossible to get your Chief Law Enforcement Officer to sign off on your paperwork. A Gun Trust is a great way to legally purchase and own NFA Firearms and its also a great estate planning tool to keep your firearms in your family. Unfortunately, the President just signed an executive order that has the capabilities to close this option for you and your family. Currently the ATF is considering this change and has 90 days to make a decision. This means that the clock is ticking. If you ever thought about getting a Gun Trust, or if you are wondering how a Gun Trust can benefit you, give me a call at my office or send me an email. You can also check out my website CarolinaGunTrust.com. Thanks and God Bless,

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, Springfield Armory® created what’s become one of the most popular polymer pistols on the market.

The angle and depth of each contour in the XDM grip has been calculated for maximized control and usability, and the new trigger has the shortest travel of any polymer pistol currently available along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.
Springfield XDM Features
Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.

(M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. 
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter’s hand position. 
(M)elonite: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. 
(M)agazine X-Tensions™: With an interchangeable Mag X-Tension™, you can personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs.

This is very rare gun because of its low serial number (5 digit) and fat trigger (NJ State Police Trigger).

 It is a beautiful piece of German engineering, no warranty card or box and (1) 13 rd mag. Everything is in near mint condition! 

 The compact HK P7M13 can be drawn, cocked, and fired accurately, faster than any other pistol. With an overall length and width close to many .380 pocket pistols, the full-power 9mm has a full-length four-inch barrel enclosed in its low profile steel slide. The unique HK cocking lever allows it to be carried safely with a round in the chamber, yet it is ready to fire by the intentional squeezing of the fingers around the grip.

 Releasing the cocking lever decocks the P7M13 immediately and renders it completely safe. The gas system retards the movement of the recoiling slide during firing and eliminates the need for a conventional locking mechanism or heavy slide. 

 The low profile slide contributes to the balanced center of gravity and compact size of the pistol. Made of high-grade steel, the low profile slide keeps the recoiling mass as small as possible. Combined with the optimal grip angle of 110°, the result is a compact, accurate, and low recoil pistol well suited to civilian and law enforcement users. 

 Features:

• Polygonal rifling for increased barrel life • Fluted chamber aids in extraction

• All steel construction • Extractor also doubles as a loaded chamber indicator

• Fixed barrel ensures accuracy • Trigger guard heat shield

• Ambidextrous magazine release • Cocking lever control means complete ambidextrous function.
