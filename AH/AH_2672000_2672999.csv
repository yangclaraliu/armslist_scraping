 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1800 with scope or $1600 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Lower: Aero precision Lower, Anderson Manufacturing LPK, Magpul furniture. This LPK I think will be my new go to, as I always used Daniel Defense before, but man this trigger is CRISP. Mil spec buffer and Magpul 6 position stock to finish the lower out.

Upper: PSA upper with Premium hp/mp barrels. has a FSB with a few scratches from previous owner installing the hand guard. It is a 16 inch barrel, and has been checked for headspace. It has a Yankee hill Free float hand guard in it, which is super lightweight. 

Extras: Includes a folding Bipod, A nice Leapers red/green scope, a UTG scope mount which raises the scope over the front sight block. this scope was on another build and has been set to be dead nuts. Also included is a Galco sling with HK style attachments. I will include a Pmag (window w/dust cover) so that this baby just needs ammo to roll.

I would like to see $1000 from this build. I would entertain trades for this, but PLEASE make them gun related. I'm not interested in quads,boats,tires,bows,fishing items. Guns only please. I expect that your gun will be close in value to mine, or cash included. In the Grand Rapids area"

I purchased this from a coworker two years ago and have only put a couple hundered rounds through it.  This rifle is surprisingly heavy for a 22lr but not bad heavy at all.  It truly feels like a quality rifle as soon as you pick it up.  

This is the original model of GSG rifles based on the H&K  MP5.  This rifle is the original GSG5 model which was produced before the HK lawsuit for copying their MP5.  The new models are model GSG 5-22.  Anyway this has the railed forend, faux suppressor, optic mount, two 25 round mags with a mag coupler, an AIM Sports reflex sight, telescopic stock, vertical grip and sling mounts.  

I had to send the rifle back to ATI this summer because a rivet had failed on the BCG and the.rifle.would not function correctly. The BCG was replaced under warranty and the rifle is as good as new.  The rifle fires and cycles without issue and it has always been very reliable accept for the one mechanical failure in the BCG.  I have not found it to be picky about what ammo it needs to run well as it eats up everything I have thrown at it."

All bolts are rust free and appear to be free of any pitting (didn't clean the Cosmo off). 
None are counterbored and all still have strong rifling

Out of all these, if I had to pick issues it would be some of the wood. The metal on all is in good shape. One stock actually looks like it may not have been refinished as you can see where they carved into the stock kind of like trench art. 

Earliest year is 1938, latest is 1942.

All have bayonet, tools, and oiler

Again have good metal and good looking bolts. They will all need to be cleaned of the cosmoline including the bolts. 

The wood were scratched by the bayonet but nothing major. Some have better wood than others as well. All will be great shooters.

Beretta JXF5F45 PX4 Storm SD 45 ACP 4.6"" 9+1 DE Poly Grip/Frame Blk Slide

The PX4 Storm SD (Special Duty) was developed to meet the very demanding
requirements of the original 45 caliber JCP (Joint Combat Pistol)
specifications issued by SOCOM. It utilizes state-of-the-art materials and
finishes for superior weather resistance capable of withstanding the
toughest weather and military conditions. The manual lever safety and slide
stop lever are both ambidextrous while the magazine release button is
reversible. The SD features a distinctive dark earth-colored 
fiberglass-reinforced polymer frame with a Mil Std-1913 Picatinny rail and
matching interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit. The Px4 SD features
locked breech action with a rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil
and muzzle rise. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance,
as well as ease of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle
crown to protect the rifling, and the extended barrel is suitable for
threading. The PX4 Storm SD comes with three magazines, a 9-round flush fit
and two 10-round extended, all with a special PVD corrosion-resistant, high
lubricity finish. They fit neatly in the Px4 SD's heavy-duty custom-fitted
waterproof case finished in matching dark earth.

This is not a 25 year old Sig like most people are trying to sell on Armslist; it was manufactured 2 years ago. The best part about a 229 chambered in .40 S&W is the ability to easily switch to .357 SIG or 9mm by simply purchasing a drop-in barrel. The handgun will come in the original box with all manuals, two 12-round magazines and safety lock. Currently, it is wearing the original-style P229 grips (as shown in first picture) which I will also include. Price is $795. No trades. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask any questions!

Bought it brand new from fleet in December. I really like how the glock 19 feels in my hand compared to other guns but it just isn't for me. Thinking of trying a springfield next. I am open to trades but don't bother unless it's a damn near brand new springfield XD9 service (and maybe some cash).

Don't email me asking if ill lower price, I am firm on price.

Jennings j22 .22 auto. This has been a pocket gun and shows some pocket wear but functions flawlessly. 2 mags are included and of course a hogue handall grip is installed.

Then finally I have a pair of Hipoint C9 9mm pistols. One is brand new in the box and one is like new no box. Both have Hogue handall grips installed. Both come with up to 4 magazines. 2 10 round and 2 8 round mags each.

I have ammo for all and cash money to sweeten the deal.

Keep in mind the guns cost me over $500 total AND the extra mags and grips alone cost me $280 plus tax. And then there's the ammo... 
Please don't low ball me and waste your time. I am not looking to get back what I put into them I am however looking to get what I want for them.

Again, NOT 4 SALE!!! NO!

This full profile wad cutter hard cast 44 magnum load was designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for self defense against humans. This load is specifically designed to permanently and quickly disable humans. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living tissue. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and when penetration is straight, it is generally very deep—deep enough to obtain full penetration on the largest human from any angle. The hard cast nose will not deform at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant (flat, with a sharp shoulder) along with bullet path and terminal damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer Jim Cirillo used full profile wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his human targets with certainty. See our item 20D. (38 SPL) The light weight bullet at moderate velocity aids in low recoil for fast follow-up shots.

Unlike our other Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads, this one utilizes a hard cast bullet, which will not mushroom and the resulting penetration is very deep. Expect at least 24 inches of straight-line penetration in mammalian tissue, thus allowing this load to also serve well on small to medium sized game such as deer, black bear and even elk. This hard cast construction keeps your bore from being substantially lead fouled even after hundreds of rounds.

We’ve utilized a flash suppressed powder to the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Note our real world velocities taken from stock over-the-counter firearms. We prefer to establish advertised velocities from real-world firearms and not from extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities. You know what you are getting in the real world, where it matters, with Buffalo Bore ammunition.

I accidentally layed the barrel on the action slide assembly and some color leached off onto the barrel. Not the prettiest job as some color is rubbing off the action assembly onto the mag tube. Safety is missing the red ""dot"" but does NOT affect function of the safety 

This is not a pretty gun but it works fine. I placed second in a local 3gun match with this gun last year.
