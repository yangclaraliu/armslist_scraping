The Personal Protection In the Home course teaches defensive / tactical shooting skills which cannot be taught on a typical ""box"" range.

This intermediate level course enables experienced shooters to move to cover, shoot from behind barricades, develop and employ advanced Flash-Sight-Picture skills, and much more.

We cover mindset, legal issues, decision-making under pressure, and planning for the worst.

This course is designed around the use of the defensive pistol where standard marksmanship skills will not work, and will better enable you to survive a felonious attack whether in or outside of your home.

Topical areas include: 
1. Defensive Shooting / Rapid Engagement 
2. Defensive Handgun Skills 3. Firearms and the Law: Possession, Ownership, and the Use of Deadly Force
 4. Strategies for Preventing a Home Invasion 
5. Responding to a Violent Confrontation 
6. Handgun Considerations for Personal Defense 
7. Three hours of Range Shooting 

Students receive the NRA Guide to Personal Protection in the Home handbook (a $20 value included in the price) and intensive lessons of defensive shooting, issues of self-defense, and other strategies for protecting the home and family.

You will also receive feedback on your shooting exercises, and methods to take your skill sets to the next level.

You will earn a National Rifle Association (NRA) certificate upon successful completion of this course.

Our next PPITH Course is scheduled for February 15th, 2014. Seats are limited and this course normally fills up quickly, so reserve your seat now. For more information visit www.PatriotTAC.com, and be sure to like us on Facebook! 

* Proof of shooting experience can be one of the following: NRA or PatriotTAC Pistol Shooting Course Certificate, NRA FIRST Steps Course Certificate, NRA, USPSA, IDPA, or other pistol competitive shooting qualification card, military DD 214 with pistol qualification, or pass a Pre-Course Shooting Skills Assessment the morning of the class."

I'm not even putting a price on this rifle, so it's MAKE OFFER only. Before you decided to low ball offer me, start adding up the costs of each part and figure you're own total, and then realize that the total cost of parts doesn't even include the labor of hand fitting each piece as well as blueprinting and truing the action, as well as the original $550 spent on the rifle originally. It started life as police tactical rifle, and has grown to what it is now. The rifle is very accurate and you won't be disappointed.

The only trade I would consider is a REAL M1A plus cash. Anything else is cash only.

It saddens me that some of you may not have the foresight to see what is destined to happen within the bounds of this country. The very things you thought were impossible in this land are having the foot stones laid out in the very interest of their completion. If you know not what I speak of, you need to pay attention promptly and thoroughly, though sadly it may be too late.

Do not comply.

Do not submit.

Circumvent physically & circumvent legally.

Do not hand your rights away on a platter. For more will surely be removed with no due consent.

While not registering may be a potential ""crime"" upon an individual, registering is absolutely sure to be a crime upon humanity, which time in of itself will prove to hold true.

Do not register.



Be aware of history, and be vigilante as to the parallel path we as a country are straddling on. This line we are walking is slow and steady, but it's destination is determined and firm. Freedoms are never lost in the light of day with consent to their removal by those who have realized the loss of such freedoms. Rather, freedoms are lost through the mask of night by the unworthy will of those who wish to unrighteously conquer a people at no due expense to themselves, but rather an unlawful gain of authority over those very same people robbed within the night's cover.

You see registry is simply nothing more than an investment made by these previously described, thieving, Barons of the night. The investment is made on their behalf to amass a gain, which is that of authority. The investment you all must make is in your retainment of self-authority, which is that of the opposite to these Baron's investments. Do not let them realize a profit, for they will use that profit against you in the form of establishing an authoritarian monopoly. When your ""funds"" of freedom have been bought out and competition neutralized, you will have no resources left to compete with the business plan and otherwise free reign of these same Barons who stole from you to begin with.

The paddle is Sigtac, I have been told that it's a re-branding of iTac but I haven't tried to mount it on Israeli accessories. There will also be a generic hard case and a 40 caliber bore snake. I'd be willing to travel into Madison/sun prairie. If you hail from Milwaukee I do politely ask that you meet me at the Cabela's parking lot at the 41/45 split. If you are offering me a trade please indicate whether you intend for this to be straight up or the exact dollar amount you're offering."

I paid $1608.00 and I have less than 400 rounds through it.  Certificate of Authenticity from SA, factory target (10 rounds at 50 yards - 1.975 inch group), four magazines, all receipts and no original box.  I have a bullseye box with a Simmons 10-45 power scope in it and I can toss that in for 100 extra dollars.  The gun lives in that box in a climate controlled closet and I never shoot it.

I don't NEED to sell the gun and I am considering the below trades ONLY.  I can ship through Bob's Gunshop in Norfolk; buyer needs to pay in full prior to shipping.  Local FTF preferred but I will discuss travel for the right offer."

It’s got the tough Moly Resin finish on it right now. Nothing was wrong with the factory finish. Previous owner just wanted a better finish than the factory. Which I totally agreed. Moly resin is really hard, durable, long lasting, self-lubricating, and has that always like-new-look finish to it. You must be 18 years old or older to buy/trade this gun.

The Bulgarian SLR-95s were imported back in the mid-90′s for just a few years. There are not too many of them in the U.S. The Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 is one of the best AK-47s in the world."

These are not really a concealed carry holster. They are designed for vehicle driving or ATV's. Also great when horse back riding. If you google ""Tanker Holsters or M3"" you can see the original intent. I ride ATV's and SXS and found these to be great for these. I wet form the leather for the particular handgun, hand stitch and dye the leather. Takes a few days tio complete. The drawback is I need the pistol to fit the holster in."

The only thing I can guess is that the factory cut the rear sight dovetail wrong, and somehow managed to fix it and well, their fix came out(pictures show what I'm talking about), but the rear sight still sits very tight and doesn't move. Just isn't the prettiest to look at. Doesn't affect the function of the slide or the sight at all, and the gun is still accurate and shoots great.

This gun started out as a Sar 3 that was over-stamped with an 8, fitted with a thumbhole stock and had the threaded barrel covered with a sleeve to avoid the old Federal AWB ban.This was originally an exact clone of an HK91 and it remains as close as you can get in CA to a true HK91. This one has a true threaded barrel not seen on later Sar 8 imports. 

The gun comes with the original thumbhole stock, one rebuild kit (for a few more days only), an original box and manual. The standard HK stock and pistol grip are not included. The box is for a Sar 8 but doesn't match the serial number on this rifle. The gun clearly has been shot very little.

It is an unfired, one owner gun that has been stored in a climate controlled vault.  It comes with all original packaging including owner's manual, factory magazines and factory cleaning equipment.

Also, this is a COLT LE6920 CARBINE.  Colt is no longer producing this gun. This is the Desirable LE model with the restricted roll markings, not the NEW SP or M4.

Here is some additional information:

The Colt LE6920 is roll marked ""For Law Enforcement/Military/Government/Export use only""(legal to own by civilians) on ejection side and ""Law Enforcement Carbine"" on the other. This specially designed law enforcement/military weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt 6920 Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

****UPDATE**** I'll throw in an extra NIB magazine if my asking price is met!!!! 

The pistol was purchased a few months ago. It has had approximately 200-300 rounds shot through it. 

With the exception of some very minor wear on the rear sight (see photo) due to sight removal and reinstallation, the pistol looks brand new. The wear was re-blued so it is barely even noticeable and if not for that, I would call its condition MINT or LNIB. This pistol functions flawlessly and is a very accurate pistol. It has the newer 1/10 barrel. 

It comes with all accessories, two 17 round magazines, back straps, manual, box, lock, etc just as if new. 

I am asking $575 OBO. Will trade up or down for steel framed CZ with cash as necessary. 

This item is located in Winston-Salem. I am willing to drive halfway to help facilitate the transaction but not more than a hour or so. 

All laws will be followed. I will require you to sign a bill of sale, identify yourself with NCDL and a NORTH CAROLINA CHP or PPP. I will provide positive identification as well."
