The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Made in Italy (Recent production - I guess 2012 or 2013). Three new Beretta 12-round magazines are included. Comes with all manuals, box, etc. as from factory.

 The Model 96A1 represents Beretta's latest evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol, the most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history. Combining the best elements of the 92FS and the 90-Two, these pistols feature a removable front sight that allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight. The frame has an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The single-piece captive recoil spring assembly simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss. An internal recoil buffer increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition. The trigger guard is rounded to conform with current pistol gripping practices. 

 Three 12-round magazines are included. 

 Would like local deal, but may ship at actual cost through my FFL.

 Price is $650 firm - which is what I have paid including shipping and FFL fees in February of 2013. Not in rush to sell! Will keep it, but may trade on very good condition Beretta 96 INOX. No 96Ds please."

Well here you go. Finish is already messed up so don't worry about having to do it yourself! It's really not as bad as it looks in the pictures.

Dan Wesson Model 15. Finish is decent on the left side and looks like dianne feinstein on the right side. There is no rust, the finish is just coming off. Shoots great and the cylinder locks up tight. It's missing part of the ejector rod, but it really isn't an issue. The cylinder is a little squirrelly when open because of this. I just hold it and give it a shake if the shells don't fall out. All of this doesn't affect it shooting at all.

Bore is in good condition. No rust or pitting at all.

These things easily sell for double this price, but due to the listed issues I'm letting it go for this price. Not really interested in trades as I'm selling this to fund another project.

Would make a great gun to toss in the truck or boat, or you could put a little love into it and make it pretty again.

It was purchased new from the Beretta web site. I shot exactly 50 rounds through this barrel. I since have sold the pistol and bought the 92fs because I like metal pistols better, tho the px4 was great with no problems and was basically new when I sold it. If you would like to know what I think of the extended barrel with the short time I had with it, I'd say it deff made a difference in accuracy. Witch is the reason why I bought it, not for threading. It made its biggest difference from 25 feet to 35 feet, witch is where it really outshined the stock barrel. You do not have to buy this barrel for threading, Its fine the way it is for better accuracy, tho if you want to thread it by all means go for it, its yours if you buy it. 

I since have cleaned it to perfection and its sitting in a bag of oil with grease to eliminate any rusting. If you ever though about buying this from the beretta site but didn't want to drop $170.00 Then this would be probably be a great time to buy it. I'm only looking to get $100.00 back. The extra 20.00 would be to help with paypal, and shipping fees. Besides it really is basically new. Thank you for reading. sorry for the bad picture. if you want more just request and you will receive. $120 OBO"

I have for sale a rare Ruger model Speed Six Stainless .357 magnum. These are some of the best revolvers Ruger has ever made and are no longer in production. This gun is probably 90-95% which is awesome for a gun that has been dated from 1982 (151 xxxxx) if you are familiar with Rugers and especially the Speed Six series, then you know the value and worth of this handgun. I am willing to do trading for this gun. Send me some ideas and i'll definitely consider. I'm asking a fair price in order to fund another project and i will throw in a box of .357 shells to sweetin the  deal. Thanks for your time and interest."

It was purchased new from the Beretta web site. I shot exactly 50 rounds through this barrel. I since have sold the pistol and bought the 92fs because I like metal pistols better, tho the px4 was great with no problems and was basically new when I sold it. If you would like to know what I think of the extended barrel with the short time I had with it, I'd say it deff made a difference in accuracy. Witch is the reason why I bought it, not for threading. It made its biggest difference from 25 feet to 35 feet, witch is where it really outshined the stock barrel. You do not have to buy this barrel for threading, Its fine the way it is for better accuracy, tho if you want to thread it by all means go for it, its yours if you buy it. 

I since have cleaned it to perfection and its sitting in a bag of oil with grease to eliminate any rusting. If you ever though about buying this from the beretta site but didn't want to drop $170.00 Then this would be probably be a great time to buy it. I'm only looking to get $100.00 back. The extra 20.00 would be to help with ebay, paypal, and shipping fees. Besides it really is basically new.

THE RL550B CONVERSION KITS CAN BE MIXED AND MATCHED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CALIBERS. THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO THE CONVERSION KIT, 1) PLATE 2) LOCATOR PINS {THAT HOLD THE SHELL IN THE PLATE} 3) POWDER FUNNEL.

This is a gorgeous, brand new Wilson Combat Patriot Pro! The design by Trey Tenery of Victory Gun is a retro-mod update of a classic .45 ACP. This is a full capacity 8+1 with 4"" barrel. It features beautiful high polish bluing with additional high polished flats on the frame, slide, and small parts. The beautiful exhibition grade cocobolo wood grips with pewter medallions are stunning. The short solid trigger harkens to the early Colt 1911 pistols. The barrel is flush cut with steep reverse crown, countersunk slide stop pin, Ed Brown Bobtail with hand-stippled bottom of grip and hand stippled front strap of grip. The top of the rear strap is 30LPI checkering. The rear sight is a U notch serrated battle sight with green fiber optic front sight. Even the slide stop release lever has been hand checkered for additional grip! This is an absolute beauty, y’all, and it would be a fantastic addition to anybody’s collection of high-end 1911s.

(1) .40 S&W caliber Springfield XD Subcompact (used)
(2) 9 round magazines
(1) 12 round magazine
(1) CrossBreed Supertuck Deluxe holster (black kydex/broken in)
(1) Blackhawk Serpa CQC holster (black)
(1) Original box for firearm

The weapon has approximately 500 rounds through it. I am the original purchaser and have loved the gun. Springfield makes a very durable, accurate, and fun weapon. 

It is very clean and well taken care of. There are no functional issues with the gun. Cosmetically the gun has a few signs of wear, but nothing major. I have carried it for a few years now. I am selling the gun as a personal fundraiser for another project. 

This is a package deal that will start the new pistol's owner off right. You have two holsters for easy carry of the gun. The CrossBreed will need to be broken in again to mold to the new owner's hip, but that will take no time. The BlackHawk holster is good to go and can be adjusted. The only thing missing from the package is the small piece which extends the grip for the 12 round magazine. Not sure where that went. It can be purchased for just a few bucks online. The magazine still works without that piece, but it looks and feels a little odd. The 9 round magazines are good to go and seat fine. 

I will take cash only, no trades. The buyer will need to meet me at an FFL in Raleigh to complete the transfer. This is non-negotiable. The cost of the transfer is included in the price. I will communicate with the buyer and decide which FFL to use, taking into account whatever is most convenient."

A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber.

Before we all get the typical,""How ridiculous!"" responses fired up, keep in mind that this is not Wal-Mart priced Federal or Thunderbolt bulk ammo.  This is RWS Target Rifle Ammo, for which the average price is $8 from any retailer I could find.  There were one or two places with lower prices, but they were of course out of stock.  The results of my search are below.  The cheapest is at Midway, where you can backorder for $7.99/box, or $73/brick (don't forget to add UPS shipping to that price as well as the wait time, which is indefinite).

If you just like to pop off some shots, perhaps this is not for you.  If accuracy is your thing, maybe it is.  It is definitely an expensive load, as 22LR goes.  I am not a profiteer or a hoarder.  Read the reviews, do your research, and use your own judgement.

Simply put, I ordered two bricks, paid the shipping, and we are basically splitting the total; I am selling one brick to offset the cost of shipping on mine (technically, I calculate that I would be making $6 more than a direct split).

Springfield Armory has just introduced a new 1911 designed for people interested in shooting competitively.  It is called – The RO, Range Officer. The RO is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at an affordable price.  One of the goals was to create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which competition fits them best.  It is built with the same quality as the Trophy Match, and TRP models, but Springfield has removed the ""extras” that result in a higher price.  It’s everything you need in a competition model, at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs."

Up for sale is a very good condition Sig MK25 9mm. Lately concealed carry has become a priority for me; the MK25 is not exactly the most compact weapon. I am located in Dallas, TX and am open to a fair and reasonable offer. Some key points of my MK25 are listed below, I will upload pictures in the next 48 hours...It is 3:21 in the morning and to be honest I'm heading to bed. 

PLEASE ONLY SERIOUS INQUIRIES/BUYERS; If we agree to a price we will meet at a Dallas gun range and I will let you test fire the MK25 (ammo will be on me). This way you know this is not a scam and I know I am in a safe environment. 

While I prefer face to face, if you are out of state, please contact me and we will figure something out. 

1- Exactly 436 Rounds fired 
2- Mec Gar Mags
3- The firearm is heavily cleaned, maintained, and lubricated with Froglube (We were taught over lubrication is better than under)
4- MK25 is in VERY good condition
5- Does NOT have the UID Sticker
6- I will include a BARSTO threaded barrel with the purchase at no cost...this is almost a $400 barrel; as I would have no use for it anymore (HOWEVER YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE IT TO A GUNSMITH FOR PROPER FITTING!)

I am looking for a 12G with a 18-20 inch barrel is a must as is at least a 5+1 capacity. I would consider a tactical stock setup but a standard stock is what I would prefer, no solo pistol grips.

I got it for carry use but I picked up an XDS so I wont be using it.

Has been carried and has seem some use but is in overall good shape and in excellent mechanical condition.  Say what you will about Taurus but these are known to run well and has the same capacity as a Glock 30 but with a shorter overall length and height.  This one will come with its box and two 10 round mags.

Not interested in trading for other firearms right now, looking to sell only. The only trade I would be interested in is a new Playstation 4.

I have for sell a like new Gen 4 Glock 19 w/ TFO Night Sights.  Very very low round count.  This is a newer model Gen 4 that comes with the beaver tail grips as well as the interchangeable backstraps.  Has original box, paperwork, etc and 2 spare mags  I'll also include a good box of home defense hollow points.  Asking $625 OBO (If that seems high...don't forget the night sights...those run upwards of $100 plus installation and the ammo).  The only reason I'm looking to sell it is I have my eye on a HK USPc 9mm...I swear it has my name on it lol

I also have a Blackhawk Omega VI Drop Leg Holster that fits the Glock that I can toss in.  They run about $80 but I would part with it for $50 OBO

I also have a 5.11 Wingman Patrol Bag.  It's an awesome bag that straps into your passenger seat for easy access to gear...or makes a great range bag.  They retail for approximately $90...but I could toss it in for $50 if interested.

Contact me by replying to this ad or texting REDACTED.  No calls please, I work odd hours...but if we get close to a deal then we can make phone contact.  Please don't be scared to make me an offer...worst I can say is no.  Looking mainly for cash only...cause I'm wanting to put the cash towards that USPc.  But would consider certain trades...HK (especially a USPc), Walther, certain 1911's, or certain AR's/AR Parts"

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights."

I have up for trade a Sig p232, This is a very nice .380, comes with 3 sig factory mags, and 2 boxes of hollow point, one box in the hornady zombie rounds, and a box of the Corbon DPX, solid copper hollow points. I like the gun but it does not fit my big hands so looking for something different. Please see my list below for trades. Send me an email, it goes directly to my cell phone, I will get back to you rather quickly.  Thank you for looking."
