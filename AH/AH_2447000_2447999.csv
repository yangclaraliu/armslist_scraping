I have a Brand New Berger Bullets Reloading Manual. 829 pages

$15

Price is firm 



 "" It is with great pride and pleasure that I announce the completion of the Berger Bullets Reloading Manual. This 829 page manual has become real and is now available. Our team worked very hard to create a thorough manual which gives the shooter everything they come to expect from a reloading manual, along with several extra items we hope the shooters will find interesting and useful.

One of these additional features is The Story of Walt Berger. Walt was born at the end of the Golden Twenties and the beginning of the Great Depression. His story is about overcoming great odds and seeing things through to success when almost everyone around him was convinced he would fail.

There are technical articles on subjects such as Powder – Lot to Lot Variation Discussed. Noted Editor John Barsness tackles this subject with skill and experience. He provides the shooter with a much greater understanding of why loading manuals do not list the same loads from manual to manual, yet are more consistent than shooters might think.

Other technical sections written by Ballistician Bryan Litz discuss G1 vs. G7 Ballistic Coefficients, Form Factor: A Useful Analysis Tool and The Effects of Cartridge Overall Length (COAL) and Cartridge Base to Ogive (CBTO) will expand the shooter’s understanding of these subjects and how they can be used to improve the shooting experience.

There is also a section for the new rifle shooter, which describes ten different ways that a rifle can be used to enjoy the shooting sports. Each section is written by an expert in their discipline. These include a section on Short Range Benchrest by Walt Berger, High Power – Across the Course by Sherri Jo Gallagher, Palma, Long Range & Fullbore by Nancy Tompkins and Precision Hunting by John Burns. Each one is meant to give the shooter a taste of these activities so that they can consider exploring them further.

There are several other sections that are included to provide the shooter with an expanded knowledge of the shooting sports. This includes everything from Handloading Basics for the new and novice shooter to an article on Basic Statistics for Handloading for the more advanced shooter who is looking to raise their ability to understand their results and influence them effectively.

At the end of the day, this is a reloading manual. We spent a considerable amount of time putting together loads for seventy-one different cartridges. The majority of powders used to develop the loads for each cartridge were selected due to the fact that they result in 90% or higher fill ratio. It is generally believed that powders which have a fill ratio over 90% will perform best in a given case, since the powder will not be moving around as much in the case.

One of the reasons it took so long to complete this manual is because we wanted to include as much good information as we could provide. It is my opinion that we have succeeded in this effort and I am proud that we are ready to provide a quality loading manual which will help rifle shooters at all levels. """

I need something for a brush gun and would like something with either a fixed 4x or low powered variable such as a 1-4x, 2-7x, etc. This scope needs to be pretty short, no longer than 12"". 

The other rifle is for all around hunting so I'm looking for a more powerful variable like a 3-9x or 4-12x. The only limitation on this scope is objective diameter, I don't want anything larger than 44mm, ideal size would be 40mm or a little smaller."

318,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2447318,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Tactical 357 Mag Low Flash-Short Barrel - 125 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1225 fps - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Saturday, December 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=276

For those wanting the deep-for-weight penetration of the all copper (lead free) Barnes XPB 125gr. bullet in a “tactical” loading, here it is. We use low flash powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire, as nearly all self defense shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about.

Our tactical 357 mag. ammo generates less felt recoil and blast (flash and noise) than our Heavy 357 mag. loads and as such is a better choice for those carrying light weight short barreled revolvers. This is still a full powered 357 mag. load, but allows for faster follow-up shots and greater shooting comfort.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal real world stock guns. The established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings are essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing ammo from laboratory test barrels.

1642 fps - Marlin 1894, 18 inch barrel
1333 fps - S&W mod. 27, 5 inch barrel
1383 fps - S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
1295 fps - S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1235 fps - S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
Yes the more modern 4-inch S&W Mt. gun did shoot faster velocities than the older 5-inch model 27 and this is due to different internal barrel dynamics of the newer gun.

This ammunition is safe for use in ANY/ALL 357 magnum firearms."

Best shooting mosin I've ever came across.  The Finnish M39's are considered one the most accurate rifles of WWII, perhaps only second to the Swiss K31.  The rifle is a 'B' barrel dated 1942 and built on a Russian hex receiver. This specific rifle was imported by I.O. Inc and fitted with a side scope rail to accept POSP/PSO style scopes and other scopes/rails designed for the SVD.  This allows you to mount the popular Russian side mount scopes that come calibrated specifically for the 7.62x54r ballistics.  It also comes with a bent bolt handle that was professionally welded from the original handle.  If you are looking for the best example of a modern Mosin Nagant sniper that you will be able to take out and shoot at very long ranges then you won't find a better rifle than this one.    

No optics are included with the rifle, but they are easily found on eBay, Kalinka or Eastwave.  Alternatively, you can also use the LPS TIP2 Romanian scopes designed for the PSL rifles that can be found for less than $100 online.

From Sig...
The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This is an M96/38 from the very desirable Oberndorfer facility.  Has the 24 inch barrel instead of the nice, but more unwieldy 29 inch barrels in the M96's.  Following parts are numbers matching: Butt plate, receiver, all bolt and safety parts, front barrel band.  Rear barrel band is not matching, not unusual but I mention it for accuracy sake.  Has a cleaning rod and a sling as you see pictured.

If you know Swedish Mausers, you know how accurate they are, I regularly shoot less than a 3 inch group at 200 yards...with the iron sights no less.  And, candidly, the rifle is more accurate than my aging eyes are...

Barrel condition based on the stock disk, is a ""0"" meaning it was considered as new on the way past the Swedish armorers, a notoriously fussy and quality minded group.  Nominal bore size is 6.51, just what you'd like for this caliber.  In short, nothing not to like about this classic.  And I'm not like the guy asking $500 each for his Swedes, they might be worth that but this isn't the place to go for full retail, now is it???

I live in the northwest burbs of Milwaukee, willing to drive some, not forever, to help this happen.

Cash sale, face to face, not interested in any trades at this time.  If you want to purchase and have it shipped I'll need a usps money order, shipping adds $25 to the price, I need a copy of your ffl's license to ship to, etc., etc., etc."

This LCP has had exactly three mags of .380 run through it. Comes with box, silly gun lock, and all the papers. Also has a spare, smaller maga floor plate for even more concealability. 

Price is $250, and though I might be open to a partial trade, I am really looking for cash to recoup some of the money I spent on that revolver for her.

I am in Santa Fe, so contact me through Armslist with your phone number and we can meet pretty much any time. I don't put my number in these ads anymore because of the Nigerian scam texts that come through when I did.

It's the upgraded model with the combat hammer and wider beaver tail safety and fancy RIA logo on the slide. Both the slide and frame are steel, which gives it the traditional American feel in a smaller package - but yet allows this compact pistol to stay on target time and time again. I'm truly amazed at how accurate this pistol is for the shorter barrel length. 

Also included is the original case and one of the most comfortable and secure holsters I've ever owned - the Blackhawk Serpa locking paddle holster. Pistol stays put, and locked into the holster until you press the release button. 

This is one sweet deal so don't miss out!!"

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

What sets the XDM apart from the regular XD models is the following:

(M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger: The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

They have always made high quality firearms, and started out making parts for Beretta. I listed this in the EAA category, because that ks who imports Tanfoglios now, and Armslist doesn't provide a Tanfoglio category. 

The GT27 is an original design by them from the 1960s. Importation was stopped byt the 1968 Gun Control Act, because it was simply too small to be imported. We lost a bunch of great little guns because of that provision. Unlike many gunmakers, Tanfoglio was smart. They got a US company tk make the frames in their tooling, and then imported the rest of the parts. This made it legal in the US. 

This particular gun is one of the early high quality run that was made in the 1970s. It can be carried safely fully loaded with a round in the chamber, unlike most striker fired pocket pistols. It has been dead reliable, and is very accurate in part because it has a fixed barrel. Like many of my pocket pistols, it is fully capable of hitting spent shotgun shells at 10-20 yards. I regularly do this with many of them, including this one. I have three of these because I liked them so well that I got one for my wife. I should have asked her, because it turned out she wanted a revolver so that is what she now has. I have NEVER had a jam or misfire with it. The .25 ACP cartridge was designed by Jihn Browning to be mkre reliable than a .22 in thks size pistol. Everyone agrees that he was successful. The power is certainly not on par with a ,45 Auto, but nobody I know wants to get shot with a .25 either, lol.

This would make a great concealed carry gun, or just use it like I use my others as a fun little plinking gun or one for the tackle box. Lol, it will fit in a spinner bait tray!

I would rate this particular one as excellent condition. It is in perfect working condition with all original parts (no missing parts). The serial numbers on the frame, cylinder, barrel, and rear sight all match. The serial number prefix on this one is ""AY"", which according to my research, corresponds to a manufacture year of 1982.

I have up for sale a like new Charter arms Lavender Lady 38 spl Hammerless model. This is the model that has ""The Lavender Lady"" engraved into the barrel rather than anodized on like some of them do. This is also the Hammerless model which isnt as easy to come by compared to the hammer models that run 399.99+ in stores. This little 5 shot is perfect for conceal carry for a man or woman. The color actually grows on you and has a great sheen to it. Haha. It has had less than 75 rounds through it and has zero issues. The grip is fantastic and pockets very nice for being this kind of gun. The kick is very light considering its weight and the punch it is delivering. I would keep this but I already have a conceal and my gal just isnt in to revolvers. So, I will pass this great gun on to someone who will use it for more than just a safe queen! Included for the asking price are the original case, paperwork, lock, and the pistol itself. I can also possibly include ammo on my end for the right trade. I need to meet in or very close to norman if possible due to my current time constraints, but Im not unreasonable. For any questions or for more pictures please shoot me an email or text me at REDACTED and we can try and make a deal."

From the LWRC website:
The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.
