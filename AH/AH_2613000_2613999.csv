This is a great rifle and personal favorite of the local long range 308 crowd.

Features a M700 stainless steel barreled action with a 24 inch R5 mil-spec barrel, the same barrel used in the M-24 sniper rifles. Varmint barrel with 11.25 inch twist rate with five lands and grooves and eleven degree target crown. Stock has aluminum bedding in block in standard VS configuration.

""Offering this Model 700 for ten years is a testimony to the popularity and acceptance by shooters wanting to own an exceptionally accurate rifle at a reasonable price,"" states Category Manager, Dave Regula. At the core of the 700 with 5-R Rifling is the machined stainless steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 24-inch stainless steel, heavy barrel featuring 5-R Tactical Rifling -- the same hammer-forged barrel used on the M-24 sniper rifles.

 The 5-R Rifling barrel features five lands with a right hand twist which allows for less bearing surface on the bullet for slightly increased velocity.

As a result of less bullet drag, copper fouling in the bore is reduced ensuring long-term accuracy and consistency. The barrel is offered with a 110 target-style crown and a 1 in 11.25-inch twist.

The rock-solid barreled action is full-length, aluminum bedded into a well-designed H-S Precision stock for enhanced stability and shot-to-shot consistency. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to ""break-like-glass"" and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.

This rifle has been threaded for a suppressor or muzzle break and has a thread protector.  Does Not come with the scope or rings, but does come with the stainless 20MOA scope rail. Trigger has been tuned. This is the most accurate rifle I've ever fired. It will shoot any ammo I've fed it, into little bitty groups.  Will sell for $950 or would take cash plus a lighter weight 308. This one is heavier than my wife can handle.

Possibly a 270 or 30-06 plus cash.
7 mag, 270 wsm or 300 wsm also might be an option. Just let me know what you have."

I know a lot of you guys are into photography as well as shooting sports, so I thought I'd cross post this here.

If you are into Canon photography, I'm sure you know about the legendary 80-200 2.8L. This is the best lens I have owned, however, I simply don't use it as much as I would like. I haven't picked up my DSLR in over 8 months, so this has got to go.

I'd rate it a 9/10 overall. There is slight wear on the body consistent with age. Additionally, there is a slight cleaning mark on the front optic that is barely visible. In fact, you probably wouldn't notice it, but I am all about full disclosure. As you know, marks such as this IN NO WAY affect the photo quality of the lens. I tried to get a picture, but I could not get the mark to photograph.

I have owned the newer 70-200 2.8L IS, and the 80-200 outperforms that lens in photo quality hands down. Attached are a few pictures of the lens and extras, as well as an image shot with it."

The .224 diameter bullet and comparatively small casing are what allows both the FN P90 and the Five-seveN® pistol to hold so many rounds. The standard magazine capacity for this pistol is 20 rounds, with higher and lower capacity magazines being offered. The 5.7mm cartridge was designed to perform optimally out of a shorter barrel and generates velocities so high that several loadings are available that are classified as armor piercing. For these reasons the 5.7mm cartridge faithfully serves the US Secret Service in protecting some of our nations most influential people. While the Five-seveN® is available in several different configurations the model that you are bidding on has adjustable sights that can be adjusted for both windage and elevation.

Due to a shortage of the British Webleys during WW1, Smith and Wesson was awarded  contracts to manufacture these for both the British and Canadian governments. They were chambered for the British .455 rimmed revolver round wihich had a 260 grain lead bullet and were finished with a high gloss commercial bluing. This excellent example appears to be an unissued one which was later returned to the US and rechambered for our .45 acp round. This was accomplished by milling the frame slightly so the .45 acp could be loaded onto full moonclips being that it had a rimless type casing. This one is in excellent condition with a nice bore, positive lockup and precise timing. Still retains the lanyard ring and sports later style wood grips. Included are three full moonclips and 20 rounds of .454 cal. ammo loaded close to the original chambering with a 255 grain lead bullet. 750.00 or best reasonable offer. FTF transaction only. Must be 21 and have a Florida ID or FFL to purchase. C&R is okay for this one. Only trade considered would be for a Fender Deluxe Reverb amplifier (either a vintage in good condition or a '65 reissue in excellet condition).

I have a  set of RCBS carbide dies for 40/10mm. Dies are in like new condition with the exception of some slight discoloration on the top outside of the resizing die. Internals are in new condition. This discoloration will probably remove with 0000 steel or brass wool, however it in no way affects functionality. I got these in a package sale, so I cannot confirm they have not been used, however they look brand new.

 The S&G 833 is made up of proprietary alloys in the padlock body and shackle that give it extreme resistance to physical attacks.  The body also has ceramic inserts which greatly reduce the ability to attack the padlock with a grinder.  Its raised shoulders make attacking the shackle very hard when properly installed.  It features a quick change breakdown function using the change key.  It is the only lock that is meant to resist physical attack from even prolonged liquid nitrogen attacks.  When the change key is inserted and turned, the body comes apart in two pieces allowing for access to the cylinder for replacement as needed. Below are the technical details (exact measurements given in mm):
4 11/16"" (118mm) tall body

I am looking to get 900 for the gun or 1,100 with the RMR. The RMR is 7 moa. The amber dot is about the size of the front dot of the sight. It works great as a co witness. The handgun has a stippled grip to aid in grip management. the only downfall is the back-strap is permanently mounted and no longer interchangeable. Also comes with holster mag pouch and training barrel. This is a great shooting handgun that has been cleaned after every use. 900.00 for handgun with both slides 1,100 with the RMR.

Picked it up on a whim when I was out hunting for a Ruger LCR and decided I really want to snag a LCR.

Test fired it Saturday and it works great with Remington Golden Bullet!  I have two others for G17's so I really have no need for this one.

willing to let it go for less than what I paid for it...or I'd take a Ruger LCR on trade.  These go for about $300 after tax and they are a direct slide and magazine swap on the G19 and G23.  This version WILL NOT work on the Gen 4 Glocks.  I repeat, does not work with the Gen 4!  I don't ""need"" to sell it, so the price is firm.

The box was cracked during shipping, but these come lovingly packed in foam, so the product is fine.  Comes with one mag, loader, cleaning rod, and oil.

Cash money unless you have a LCR to trade.  If it has a XS Big Dot front sight upgrade I might be willing to include some cash.

Scrap lead (not from batteries) always gets my attention as does reloading supplies for 9mm, 38spl, 223, and 308."

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

If you're not familiar with this model, it is the beefed-up LEO/MIL version of the Mossberg 500 series. Where the standard 500 has a polymer trigger guard and safety, this one is all metal. It also has a heavy duty barrel to withstand severe duty usage. 

That in itself is a great shotgun - but then Adaptive Tactical makes their Sidewinder Venom kit for this gun. It converts the regular feed tube to a welded box magazine that accepts quick change rotary drums, 10 rounds at a time. Put it all together, and you have one of the most amazing shotguns that has been seen since the days of the original Street Sweeper.

Adaptive Tactical's adjustable M4-style stock and fore grip complete the gun. I also added a Midwest Industries heavy duty QD swivel to the stock for single point carry.

This gun is in new condition, and the conversion was performed by a professional gunsmith. It has (3) 10-round drum magazines; two of them are still in their factory packaging. The drums by themselves sell for over $100 each when you can find them. Includes the factory Mossberg box if you want it as well as the parts changed out in the conversion.

$700 FIRM takes it home.

I'm not looking for trades; selling only to complete a project. If you can find it cheaper somewhere else (because you will not), go buy it. Dealer cost on the components alone is more than my price. Lowball offers will simply be ignored. This is NOT a cheap Maverick 88 that has been converted; it is Mossberg's top of the line in the 500 series.

Can meet in Georgetown area, will sell ONLY to KY resident - NO EXCEPTIONS. Valid KY driver's license required; valid KY CCDW license preferred. Due to ""no-show"" buyers, I won't travel outside the Georgetown area. Bill of sale given at time of purchase."

in Russia and remanufactured by Arsenal, Inc. in the United States, the new SGL21 rifle has everything that
collectors and shooter have been looking for. Hand-select premium components, custom-shop-like attention to
details by Legion Ltd, and Arsenal, Inc.’s highest standards of workmanship, give this rifle its superior quality.
Arsenal, Inc. remanufactures the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with
features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles. Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Arsenal,
Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer. The end result is the highest quality SGL21 rifle with the most
desired features which have not been available before. Every unit is laser sighted and test fired.
To make this rifle the perfect Russian AK available in the market, Arsenal, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to
ensure all the components and features are true to its original configuration.
The receiver of SGL21 rifle has the proper markings on both sides without any extra commercial markings,
including the legendary Izhmash Factory logo, the upward pointing arrow in triangle. The markings on both sides of
the receiver are done with the correct font type and size and placed in their proper locations. The receiver of
SGL21 features proper magazine dimples on both sides and original “X” and “Y” shaped reinforcement stampings.
On the right side, it has correctly positioned notches for the safety lever, marked with letters “S” and “F” and no
additional openings at the bottom forward portion of the receiver.
The components and features on the new SGL21 rifle resemble true Russian AK rifle, including the safety lever with
correct shape and properly positioned dimple, the correct trigger guard with magazine catch and the correct bullet
guide enabling SGL21 to accept any standard AK magazine, the 1000 meter rear sight leaf, the highest quality
Arsenal, Inc. double stage fire control group (hammer, trigger and disconnector), original Arsenal, Inc. mil-spec
polymer furniture, including the handguards, pistol grip, and the original Warsaw pact length buttstock, the retainer
for lower handguard, the correct gas tube, original gas block with the correct vent holes, a guide hole for the cleaning
rod and accessory lug, correct AK-74 type front sight block with 24x1.5mm right-hand threads and bayonet lug.

The quality comes from the true custom RUSSIAN STYLE Kalashnikov! and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience. All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes.

EXCELLENT CONDITON in original wooded crate,"Southern Maryland, Maryland, United States",$ 599,"Listed On: Monday, February 10, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am soon to retire and relocating and selling all my gun collection that I have accumulated over the years, this ammo is among the last and best of my 50+ year collection and it is truly museum/collector grade in light of the exceptionally well preserved condition of the ammunition, original shipping crate, packaging, manufacturer, and historical context. The 10 cardboard boxes of 25 rds each have Oriental characters printed on them. I bought this ammo in 1987 in a factory sealed spam can of 450 rds and fired 15 rds for a function check; every round fired properly, like it was made yesterday. I then put the crate in my climatically controlled vault and it has sat there untouched since 1987 until I took it out today to take these pics. This original wooden shipping crate contains 250 rds in unopend sealed boxes (except the one box I opened to photograph)and 185 rds on stripper clips, for a total of 435 rds. This is cleanest, finest ammo for its age I have ever seen. If you are interested in this ammo, you are probably a collector and know more about it than I do, but you can see the headstamp in one of the pics and I think it was made in 1951 by the Chinese, probably for use against us in Korea. There are plenty of 6.5 Jap Arisaka rifles out there but very little ammo for them, my price for this ammo is less than any other I have found and this is the real deal ammo in the original factory crate and packaging. I would prefer to sell this locally so I don't have to go thru the hassle and expense of shipping it.  Will meet buyer between Waldorf and Upper Marlboro for a FTF cash and carry deal during daylight hours in a public setting. Buyer must not be prohibited from lawfully possessing ammunition. thanks for looking and pls email with any questions.  I am also selling from my collection a M1903A3 Springfield made by Remington in Excellent condition."

This quad has been kept in a heated garage it’s whole life since showroom floor. VERY VERY low hours!! Plastic is perfect. Everything works just like it did when new. Don’t have time to ride anymore. You won’t find a nicer one ANYWHERE. Went ahead and put new brakes, maxis razor tires all the way around it. The older tires had great tread but had slow leak from sitting. Anyway, all fluids changed, shifts flawlessly, tight as can be(no play in the front steering at all), Starts first try even in this cold weather. All lights work. Has REVERSE which makes it real nice. NEW battery too. I’m ASKING $2,800 OBO! I am willing to negotiate some. I will take cash plus things that go bang. Have the ORIGINAL TITLE also! So with all that being said, this quad needs NOTHING! Gas tank is even filled to the top. So TEXT me a offer and maybe we can make a deal. I need it gone. Need room in my garage for a project I’ve started. Again, you will not find a cleaner, better running quad unless you buy a new one. TEXT REDACTED with offers. Thank you."
