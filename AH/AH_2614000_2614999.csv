41,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2614041,For Sale:  Ionbond Premium Firearm Coatings,"Denton, North Carolina, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, January 26, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Ionbond Diamond Black Firearm Coating

The ionbond Diamond Black DLC coating is an extremely tough, slick, corrosion resistant finish that is a great choice for any firearm. This is a metal finish that is applied through a Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) process. If you've seen  gold TiN coated drill bits, you've seen PVD. The coating process involves the depositing of diamond-like carbon coatings via a vacuum and an electrical charge. The result is a DLC (Diamond Like Carbon) coating that will provide years of protection against wear while retaining a nice appearance. Ionbond’s unique application process makes it a finish that does not chip, crack or peel as it is a micron level coating. Diamond Black is generally 2 to 5 microns thin. This is not a conventional coating that adds thickness to the material; this is a micron level coating, which is an excellent choice for custom fit guns. There is no distortion of details or build up in the corners, which means consistent performance every time. Diamond Black provides the ultimate protection against holster wear, corrosion, bearing surfaces, and rough handling.

Finishing Options

Diamond Black can be applied in several final finishes.

Matte
An extremely non-reflective look. Great for hunting guns, M&P, and tactical weapons.

Satin
This finish has a matte look, but with a fair amount of ""sheen"". The most versatile application.

High polish
Much like hot caustic bluing, the Diamond Black coating reflects the finish on the metal below. Polishing to any grit is possible in order to duplicate the finish on factory guns. A high polished finish produces a highly reflective ""show"" type appearance and is a good choice for fine firearms.

Colors
While the Diamond Black DLC is only offered in black, Ionbond can produce various coatings of different hardness levels and in several colors. Gold, Silver, and Dark Earth are offered by special order only.

Functional, Durable Firearm Coatings
Whether your weapon is used for hunting, plinking, target, competition, self defense or professionally, Ionbond's Diamond Black coating provides reliability and performance. These are the critical components for shooting success.

CLUB Custom Guns is the East Coast Agent  for Ionbond coatings. We are currently coating for several custom builders of 1911 style pistols, AR type rifles, barrel manufacturers, gunsmiths and individuals from all across the country. Dealer inquiries welcome.

Rifle is complete and fully functional with no refinishing, repairs, or sporterizing. Rifling is strong, lands and grooves are crisp and sharp, bore has no pitting or rust that I can see with a bore light; this rifle appears to have been fired very little. The blueing/finish on the barrel and receiver is in amazing condition, nice uniform blue with no significant flaws. The stock is great shape and is free of significant damage; no gouges, no repairs; easily the nicest Arisaka I have ever seen. The safety turns, engages, and disengages properly, the trigger and bolt are smooth and correct in operation, the sights are intact and fully functional, this rifle is complete and proper in every way and all it needs is a new owner. I bought this rifle in 1987, wiped it down and fired 15 rds thru it for a functions check, everything works as it should. I then cleaned the rifle and put it in my climatically controlled vault where it has sat largely untouched since. I will meet buyer in Prince Georges County, MD for a FTF cash and carry deal during daylight hours in a public setting. Buyer must not be prohibited from lawfully possessing firearms and must be a MD resident or active duty Military stationed in MD. thanks for looking and pls email with any questions.

Something these little Taurus pistols have been praised for is the tip-up barrel design. To load the PT-22, then, simply load the magazine with cartridges, fully insert the magazine into the butt of the gun until it catches, pop up the barrel, insert a cartridge, and snap the barrel back down into the closed position. There is no need to rack the slide, which is a benefit to those who, because of arthritis or other hand weakness, are unable to operate conventional auto pistols.

This gun has less than 50 rounds through it and will be sold with 4 additional (total of 5) 8 round magazines.

Warranty: Lifetime by Taurus (in writing)"

There is now Hawes button, so that's why this is listed under Sig Sauer.

This is a really cool and old 22 caliber pistol with both the original and matching Long Rifle and the Magnum cylinders.

I got this from a very old gentleman who was cleaning out his estate and he said he got a very long time ago.  Given the cool stag horn looking grips, it is exactly the same style of another gun I got from a 50's cowboy show re-enactor.  The holster pictured came with the gun when I got it and it too screams old school ... and it's in great shape too.    I'm told these were made in the 60's and 70's but have no way to know.  It appears like a Colt clone ... functionally.  In any case, this one is ready to ride the range again.

The pistol set is real cool and in great shape for its age.  There is holster wear, of course, but I've serviced it and see no issues.  You are welcome to judge for yourself.

The markings indicate made in LA, California ... which is almost funny.  Reminds me of that salsa commercial because I'm not sure they allow guns in California anymore.  These unique markings are hard to explain (German gun made in CA?) but that's what makes this one special and even more collectable.

If you can help me figure out more about Hawes, or pinpoint the manufacture date ... help is welcome.

FTF preferred.  Paperwork, ID, and cash required.  I am willing to ship via FFL from my guy for $30 firm and only ship after payment clears.

If you've never handled or shot a Kahr, you're really doing yourself a disservice as these are made in the USA and have one of the most buttery smooth triggers on the market.  Zero grit and it's a DAO, but smooth as glass the entire travel.  The trigger serves as it's safety, along with your properly placed trigger finger.  Polygonal rifling makes this a superior shooter with increased accuracy, a rare find in carry/pocket pistols. 

Selling because I have my three common carry pistols dialed in already.

This is the 'GI' style.
I bought it new from cabelas a little over a year ago.
Since buying it, I have polished the sear/hammer interface (no grinding/modification) to have an even smoother pull.
I've added a Wilson Combat Custom Mag well (http://www.midwayusa.com/Product/138050/wilson-combat-custom-magazine-well-1911-stainless-steel)
and sprayed it with brownell's oven cured gun-kote in dark earth (www.brownells.com/gunsmith-tools-supplies/metal-prep-coloring/paint-finishes/bake-on-non-aerosol-paints/gun-kote-oven-cure-gun-finish-prod41610.aspx).

I've also touched up the finish with a ceramic based spray paint that is recommended by the US Army for field based camo patterning and it looks quite nice.

This is a nice shooting 1911.  Will spit out anything you put in it.
I really enjoy it but I have another from one of those high priced companies and it's gonna stay so this one should find a new home.

$450 bucks.
Certainly willing to consider trades of like value in firearms or silver.
Thanks for looking.

EDIT:  the pics look like there are shiny scratches - those are not scratches, just artifact from the flash.  
There is an area of wear on the distal barrel which can be seen in the pics."

i am selling my personal CUSTOM MADE, Desert eagle Tiger Stripe 50AE. When I say custom you might say looks like another

titanium tiger I have seen before. Ok so The tigers sell for like $2100 and there are not many around. But what makes this gun

special ONE OF A KIND is. Listed below



1.) The gun has the origianl Tiger Pattern that the first desert eagle had, they are not made with this pattern, and new ones never have been.

2.) the gun has a custom installed tiger stripe muzzle break matching the same pattern ( you can't get this done even from the factory)

3.) The gun has a modified safety latch it doesn't rub and there are NO MARKS, on the gun like "" ALL OTHER DESERT EAGLES ""

4.) The gun has front & back titanium gold plated sights, you can't buy them for any price CUSTOM

5.) The gun has a Titanium Gold magazine you can't buy them have to get them special plated

6.) The gun comes with VERY hard to find wooden grips, look for them you won't find them

7.) The gun has internal titanium plated parts, firing pin etc.. You can't buy these parts anywhere

8.) The comes with 350grain ammo and quite a bit of it,  also speer 300 & 325 grain ammo

9.) The gun has all  the factory stuff,  case & paperwork



* I just wanted you to understand this gun isn't for everyone, $4500.00 seems like quite a bit, but not for a ONE OF A KIND GUN.



You can not buy this gun you have to make it, I have done all the work for you. The gun has only be fired like 10 times:

I bought this for my wife who at the time wasn't much of a shooter.  I wanted her to have everything necessary to identify a bad guy and confidently put rounds where she was aiming and this allowed that.
It also makes the recoil less of an issue for new/weak shooters by adding weight and allowing you to place your support hand as you would a carbine.

The first pic is as we had it.  The pistol is not included and the c-more scope stays w/ me.  You can buy the light/laser (which is a very workable clone of the expensive US version) for an extra $25.
