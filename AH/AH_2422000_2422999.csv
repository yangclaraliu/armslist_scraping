225,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2422225,For Sale/Trade:  800 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup, Washington, United States",$ 700,"Listed On: Saturday, December 7, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

For sale/trade is 800 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Current retail price on this is between $1.25/round and $1.50/round - I am only asking $1.00 per round for cash offers.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Dan Wesson Classic Bobtail Commander 1911 in .45ACP

Like new - less than 50 rounds down the pipe.

Clean, well maintained.  Factory stock with exception of Wilson Combat Shok-Buff installed.

Comes with the following:
(2) Dan Wesson (factory) mags
(3) 3 Wilson Combat 8 round, blue steel flush fit ($35 per)
(5) Wilson Combat ShokBuffs (plus 1 installed with less than 50 rounds on it) ($5)
(1) Galco FLETCH 1911 Commander OWB holster - very minor wear ($90)
(1) Gould&Goodrich double mag pouch (belt loop version) - nearly new ($40)

Strong preference for a package deal. Getting out of .45 altogether.

Don't lowball me, I'm not anxious to sell and we both know what this tack-driver is worth. You're getting a pistol worth $1500 and $300 worth of kit with it. That being said, make a reasonable offer.

Not interested in any trades.

NC CCP + NCDL or meet at local FFL - Raleigh/Durham, Wilson, Greenville, Boone, Greensboro, Winston-Salem.

Thanks,
Nate

This is an amazing pistol, hand built and loaded with all the bells and whistles.  Dead nuts accurate with a very tight lockup and match barrel and trigger.  Do your own research, you don't have to take my word for it.

Rifle has been glass bedded, extremely accurate, capable of 1/2"" groups at 100 yards. Has been hunted with only 2 years in Wyoming for Mulies and Antelope. With my recipe hand loads will take deer/antelope out to 400+ yards without compensating, cross hairs center, squeeze the trigger.

I know this gun so well, and I hope whoever buys it realizes  what these are as for their heritage and long history right along with the Winchester lever 94 carbine. This gun was used  in place of the 94 carbine in 30-30 because of the longer reach and power in comparison. It was carried by the Royal Mounties the Yukon dredgers, Oil men and game getters of the 30-s and 40's Alaskan wilderness, a good bear gun as well, elk, and moose along with deer. She's like one of the few that made a big impression as she was not just a new type semi-auto fire she had knock down reliable action which men of that time depended on for survival from the wilds, but not so easy to get in her time, as they were highly prized, expensive and even sometimes fought over. A Mountain mans gun for the late and fading roughneck life of the great northwest. its like 90+nra. I will consider trades but no junk or funky pistol trash plus cash. lets try, I love to barter, I'm just picky about this piece as it brought me a Boon and Crocket elk in 2002 and Its a special piece, and only a few left around in 300 Savage cal. not a magnum, but 300.

1990 tracker easy project.
This would be the perfect father son/daughter project. VERY easy to work on.

Was getting ready to take test drive to check for leaks. Stopped to adjust clutch linkage and I when I pressed pedal again something around the throwout bearing came loose. IM DONE.

This is a rust free tracker. A VERY small dent on passenger fender. Peeling clear coat in a couple small places. Otherwise excellent body to be almost 25 years old.

Top is in perfect shape, just dirty.
Previous owner replaced it a couple years ago and then parked for mechanical reasons. Bestop brand. CD player and speakers.

The seats are from a sidekick and don't match but otherwise ok.

5 speed 4x4 always shifted and worked perfect till problem mentioned above.

I have put a lot of time and money in this tracker. The engine in it now has several new parts with about 2 miles on them if that. 
All parts and gaskets listed are quality parts. Beck arnley, melling, fel pro, gates, and a couple things oem, etc. NO EBAY GARBAGE

New reman cylinder head and new head bolts.
New melling oil pump,
Gates Water pump, and Timing set including tensioner and idler pulley.
Timing cover, Crank bolt, manifold gasket, head gasket, oil pan and valve cover gasket. All new vacuum lines. NGK wires, plugs, cap, rotor, radiator and heater core hoses. Runs pretty smooth, still needs some tweaking at idle but not bad.

Not installed parts:
Almost brand new tires ( maybe 100 miles)
Front rotors ( Beck arnley)
Brake pads and shoes plus hardware.
Doesn't really need the brakes but I was planning ahead

PLUS another 8v tracker motor from an 89-90 model. This motor was purchased as a running engine but I never heard it run. However I bought it from someone I know and trust.
It has been rebuilt at sometime as it has a ""heat tab"" used by machine shops and engine rebuilders. 
Pretty clean motor.

ALL THIS FOR $1500
$1500
$1500
NO Less.
We can crank it and listen to it run but it won't go in gear. I have already pulled the motor twice and I'm just too pissed to work on it any more. If it doesn't sell for asking price I'll keep it or consider parting out.
Don't not contact me if you don't have cash  or a damn interesting trade plus $500.

No games. This is a hell of a deal and I have way more invested in it.
Time to cut my losses.

You come to me.

Thought I would use it on my hunting trips and wildlife viewing in our national park but it just stays at home.  Purchased retail at $1300.00 and used a couple of times in the yard.  Never taken beyond the patio.  I'm already taking a $450 hit for taking it out of the box and placing it on a tripod a couple of times, so please don't ask me to sell for less.

They belong to a widowed friend of the family. They were in her husband's things when he died. From what I understand, the case dates back to at least the 1950s. Not sure about the cleaning stand, but he had it for at least 25 years.

The pine case is 43"" long on the inside and 5 3/4"" wide at the widest point. It is 2"" deep. It is made of 5/16"" solid pine boards with brass corners and a leather handle. I believe he had an old Winchester carbine in it. It is a very nice case with lots of character.

The cleaning vise is made of solid pine board with 3/8"" felt padding. Very attractive and well made. I would buy it from her to use, but I already have a cleaning vise.

Would look great in a man cave, on display, or you could use them.

In a 53-46 vote, the Senate narrowly passed a measure that will stop the United States from entering into the 

United Nations Arms Trade Treaty.



Which 46 Senators Voted to Destroy Us?

We came four votes away from the U.S. Senate giving our  Constitutional rights over to the United Nations. 

The Statement of Purpose from the Bill reads:   ""To uphold Second Amendment rights and prevent the 

United States from entering into the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty."" 



The U.N. Small Arms Treaty, which has been championed by the Obama Administration, would have 

effectively placed a global ban on the import and export of small firearms. The ban would have affected 

all private gun owners in the U.S. and had language that would have implemented an international gun 

registry on all private guns and ammo. 



Astonishingly, 46 out of our 100 United States Senators were willing to give away our Constitutional rights 

to a foreign power and to allow the creation of an UN police force to come into this country to assist in the 

collection of weapons from US, you and me! 



Here are the 46 senators who voted to give your rights to the U.N.

I purchased this shotgun brand new and added the upgrades to it myself. This shotgun is a Remington 870 clone at the fraction of the price, and all parts are interchangeable with the 870, outside of the barrels. This is a economically priced shotgun, but do not mistake it for being a cheap shotgun. This is built like a tank, all solid metal... And in all honesty feels more sturdy than both my 870 and Mossberg 500. Read the reviews out there, and you'll see what people think about this firearm. I've only put about 20 rounds through it... all cycled flawlessly. She then went next to my bed as a home defense shotgun, one I trusted to do the job. She was cleaned and lubricated after purchase... And cleaned and lubricated again after firing her. Great condition, looks as if new. 

I would prefer to sell it outright, I need some money to finish up a Beretta build I'm working on. I'll listen to best offers. Contact me and I will get back to you as soon as possible! Thank you and have a Merry Christmas!

485,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2422485,For Sale:  Carry Gun Package / Sig P238 .380 & Accessories w/ Laser & Night Sights. Great Deal,"Minneapolis, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 500,"Listed On: Sunday, December 8, 2013",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"As the title says, I'm selling a Sig Sauer P238 pistol.  This firearm was manufactured on January 27th, 2012, and I've remained the sole owner since purchasing it in May 2012. 
I'm meticulous about my firearms, which includes tracking all ammo usage.  This firearm has had 817 rounds through it.  Of that, all were successful except two bad primers from an old box of S&B ammo.  

You can see in one of the pictures that I circled things.  That's because I stripped the firearm and gave it a special touch. I polished the feed ramp, extractor, grip screws, mag release, and backside end of the slide stop lever.  I also added Rosewood Hogue grips to provide an improved contrast to compliment the nitron finish.  This gun is not picky with ammo either. I personally rotate between Hornady Critical Defense & Speer Gold Dot. It eat's up every type of .380 ammo (flat nose, round, jhp, etc).
Like I said before, I take care of all my firearms and this Sig is no exception.  

I have been using this pistol in rotation with two others as a carry pistol in my EDC. I carry it in a Desantis pocket holster which has helped preserve the finish to retain the almost brand new look.

I'm including a few items that make what I'm selling a package. (i.e., you don't need to buy anything else except ammo).  
______
*P238 Nitron Finish w/ Night Sights
*Extra 6rd magazine. Three (3) total Magazines.  (Two-6rds, One-7rds).  All of them Factory Sig Brand.
*Hogue Rosewood grips. (also includes black factory grips).
*238-TGL P238 Trigger guard laser w/ instructions, allen key, & battery.
*Desantis pocket Holster
*Sig Sauer Factory Holster
*Owners Manual
*Cable lock
*My personal touch.  

You might laugh when I say that that last item.  ""His personal touch""? Yessir, my personal touch... 
I feel disclosure and maintenance are the most important duties of anyone selling something used.  I want to make sure the buyer is aware that they are buying a firearm that has been maintained by a person who pays fine attention to all details. 

My price for this package is 500 dollars even. I would like to be upfront in saying that I am not interested in trade offers or negotiations.  This package is priced below what the value actually is. If you are interested, please send me an email

REVOLVER RHINO - 2"" barrel, Black finish

Defense revolver, offers great conceal ability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a center line of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire. The versions of 2"" Rhino with Double Action only (item codes ending with ""D"" instead of ""DS"") do not have an external hammer. All 2"" barrel Rhino revolvers are supplied with a beautiful leather holster included."

Hey everyone,
This listing is for a SCCY CPX-2 Bi-Tone 9mm. It has had less than 50 rounds down the pipe and has given me zero issues. It will come with the gun itself, and two magazines with the pinky extensions on them. Only selling because I already have a compact 9mm or I would keep her. Great shooting little gun. Barely bigger than my PF9 and holds more rounds! Also, for the right offer I can include ammo or a case for it. Please shoot any offer to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Will need to meet in or very close to norman due to my time constraints."
