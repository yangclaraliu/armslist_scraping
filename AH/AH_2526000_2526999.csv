I told Tony I'd never get rid of it but just seeing what else is out there.  Build list as follows:

> Tromix converted absolutely flawless Saiga 12 gauge shotgun.  Tony opens up the gas ports, moves forward the fire control group, welds on his Tromix trigger guard and grip hanger, welds on a receiver back plate to accept high end stocks and remachines tang to correct angle, welds up old holes in receiver etc.
>SRTrigger (short reset trigger)
> bolt hold open lever
> aluminum tri/quad rail.  Has removable top rail with peep hole to see factory iron sights
> far rear side mount rail for full upper rail to mount optics, red dot, etc and still have see through factory irons
> stubby foregrip with storage
> Red Jacket Firearms Mojo muzzle brake (one of the best for recoil reduction and muzzle rise)
> Carolina Shooter Supply aluminum push button folding stock adapter
> Carolina Shooter Supply raptor aluminum stock with height adjustable cheek rest and cheek pad, with added 1"" recoil pad
> hk style removable iron sights, with 4 size holes (not pictured on this listing, but can send pics with them installed)
> Hogue and factory grips
> bonus extra tri rail I have laying around
> I'll have to add it up but I think there's a total of 11+ magazines.  Five or more 5 rd mags, At least six 10 rd mags and one 20 rd drum
> has optional welded on galil style charging handle, I had Tony weld this on at an angle as to not scrape your hand like a meat slicer (only Tromix like this to my knowledge)
> Carolina Shooter Supply reliability kit with upgraded gas puck and 6 position gas plug.  With a simple twist of this plug you can reliably shoot anything..I mean ANYTHING.  It shoots low brass, high brass, birdshot, buckshot, slugs, WHATEVER!!! It shoots Winchester universal all day, EPIC fun and cheaper than Hell.

I'm sure I'm missing something but this is by far the most fun and one of the coolest looking firearm made, if I might be so bold as to state.  This thing is built to perform.  It can empty the 20 rd drum in less than 3 seconds.  THE BUILD LIST FOR A SIMILAR TROMIX Saiga 12 is 2-3 YEARS.

As far as price goes, I'm open to offers from smart, non Lowballing, American loving individuals, who are preferably republican.  I know there's somebody out there who knows what this is and actual can manage his money and pay for what they want.  Lowball cash offers will be totally ignored, if you want a bone stock Saiga then buy one.  There's not one Tromix under $1995 that I'm aware of.  Look it up, the only true Tromix on AL I saw was in Arkansas and he's asking $2450.  If your offer isn't over 2 grand don't bother contacting me.  I'm not hurting for cash, I don't need to get rid of it by any means.  I'm testing the cash and trade market.  Period. 

As far as trades go, I'm VERY picky on my guns.  I recently traded all my dead weight guns and have acquired most of the guns I wanted.  I don't want ANY shotguns besides a new black ksg.  I don't want ANY rifles at all besides maybe a ps90, unless you're wanting over $1300 for it on trade.  Period end of story.

If you're out of state, forget it.  emails only responded to when they're worth a crap.  Tons of detailed pics available on request.  
**Anybody who wants to text or email and argue over prices and what gun is better or worth more than others can kick rocks.  I have an opinion, same as everybody.  Sometimes they differ, it's as simple as that.

This was a long post so I don't have to say these same things 100 times to everybody that contacts me."

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

These usually have very bad holster wear but this is one of the best one's I've seen.  Slide has some scuffs and scratches but minimal holster wear, grips look new.  Shoots just as well as the other Sig's that Ive had but is a bit thinner due to the single stack mags.  The P225 is the precursor to the P239 and is pretty similar in dimensions.

Comes with two 8 round magazines which have good strong springs and a duty holster.

It is a three serial number gun(5XX). My gunsmith cut the barrel and welded the HKParts 3-lug on. He then Blind pinned the barrel extension on. The welded pin locks the extension onto the gun so it isn't an NFA item. To convert it to SBR it would have to have the pin removed of course after the tax stamp is approved. I was going to keep it and go Form 1 but I don't have the heart to engrave this rifle with the SBR info. The rifle has had a few hundred rounds (200-300) run through it. It isn't pristine but is in good shape for a 31 year old rifle. It has some scratches on the A3 stock arms where they usually scratch. I added the MP5 hand guard and ""S & F"" clipped and pinned plastic trigger housing (for the MP5 look), it also comes with the original slim hand guard, tactical aluminum hand guard made for Picatinny rails and a ""S,E,F"" trigger housing. It has the Trijicon glowing front sight. It has one German magazine and 3 Korean magazines from HkParts(third gen mags). I did replace the ""H"" recoil button in the stock, the old one was dried and cracked rubber. I am ONLY interested in a 14.5"" 416 upper or an MR762(depending on what comes with the MR762 on the trade).

It is from 1967, the last year 100% of the guns were milled.  It was built at factory 26.    The stock is dinged up pretty good from being dragged through the jungle during it's service life, though there are no actual cracks or chips.  I added a chunk of rubber to extend the stock, it's screwed over top of the factory buttplate using the original screws, so you can switch it back if you like.  The writing on the stock translates to ""Ugly stick"" in Chinese, that is not original but should come off easy enough with a little paint thinner if you wish.  Where this rifle really shines is internally. All the insides are immaculate, the inside of the barrel looks like it just came off the factory floor and she shoots very smoothly. I've got somewhere in the ballpark of 30 or 40 strippers clips I'll include. The bandoleer in the picture does not come with it.  I have about 300 rounds of Tulammo 7.62x39 that I'm also including.

1. A custom, extended, rounded, magazine release for those who find the standard release a little too short and difficult to push...this is of my own design...I make many of these for fellow ""Glock"" shooters who want a ""slightly"" extended mag release.
2. A Hi-Viz front sight with the ""green"" fiber-optic insert. I have these great sights on all my Glocks...this is a great product I highly recommend to all my shooting friends...really stands-out in sunlight, very durable and attractive.
Included with the pistol are 3-factory magazines, the original case, cleaning tools, magazine loader and all paperwork.
I can deliver to the NE side of Abq. or we can meet in-between there and Tajique where I live. Also, can ship to your FFL for an additional $20.00
If FTF, cash only please

It comes in the box with all paperwork, accessories, etc. Right now it has a scope mounted using the factory rings but I'm keeping the scope. It does come with 2 full and one partial box of ammo. Using this ammo (Winchester Power-Max Bonded 140gr) I shot a .455"" 3-shot group the first time I ever shot the rifle (from the bench when I sighted it in). I have the trigger adjusted down to around 3lbs or so and it breaks clean with no take-up or creep.

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, V5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper reamed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

I have the rolling loaded ammo and casings for sale or trade.

The reloaded ammo was reloaded by me using a Hornady automatic powder dispenser and a Lee single stage press.  You can see the load data on most of the rounds.  There were some that would not chamber in my Interarms Whitworth rifle and I had intended to pull them down. They chambered fine in my Ruger Safari model so I'm not sure what the issue was. All shoot very well.  

Finally got time to go through everything and here is the breakdown:

29 fired casing, 4 of which are nickel plated
5 rounds loaded with 300 grain Horn. Interlock, 64 grains Tac, Wolf LR Mag primer
3 rounds, 200 grain Sierra SP, 73 gr Tac, Wolf LRM primers
5 rounds, 235 grain Sierra SP, 70 gr Tac, Wolf LRM primers
15 rounds, 300 gr H Interlock DGX, 2 rounds Interlock DGS, 74.6 gr Big Game, Wolf LRM primer
5 rounds, 300 gr Interlock DGX, 60 gr Tac, Wolf LRM primer
32 rounds mixed loaded rounds. These are rounds that wouldn't chamber in the Whitworth rifle I was shooting. They fit fine in the Ruger 77 Safari I had but never shot (just too pretty).  I was planning on pulling these down and trying to resize them for the Whitworth. I couldn't figure out what the issue with these were. Some fit some didn't. They are all loaded like those listed.

Please let me know if you have any questions. 

The factory ammo is old stock and consists of Remington 270 soft points (8) and Federal 300 grain Cape Shok nosler partition (14).

375 wasn't my cup of tea so I sold both rifles and stepped up to the 458 Lott."

That said, they are BOTH in very nice shape...not all bashed up and dented or rusty like some of these I see on Ebay and Gunbroker for a hundred bucks each....the one box is original OD green in nice shape (a couple small spots and a ding but very nice) and HAS NO HANDLE.
The other is nice and complete BUT was painted safety green back in the 1960's. The handle is complete and latches. A bit of paint remover and some fresh OD paint and you would have a really nice box to display your cleaning rods, oilers, grease cans and stuff in.

Buy them both, clean up the handle on the light green one and put it on the OD box and it'll be so close to totally original it'll be tough to tell....then sell the other box and pay for them both (gets you yours for free!). The handles are attached with bet tabs so that swap would take you about two minutes!!

Hey! These are not easy to find, especially in this shape, or at this price (unless you want to spend a couple hundred bucks for a complete kit!) so if you have ever wanted to put one of these kits together.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."

All of today's standard 45 colt loads are very anemic. Often featuring a 250 gr. Bullet at around 700 fps.

We knew that we could develop a couple standard pressure 45 colt loads that would feature a 255gr. Gas checked soft cast bullet at around 1,000 fps or a 200gr. Jacketed Hollow Point at around 1,100fps. We wanted loads that were substantially more powerful than today's weenie loads, but that could be fired in ANY 45 colt firearm.

Both of these 45 colt loads are designed to be a heavy loading, yet be within standard (SAAMI) pressure. As such, both of these 45 colt loads are safe and recommended to be used IN ANY post-war 45 colt that is in normal working condition. ANY post-war means ANY post-war, so please take my word for it without phoning or emailing me ""just to make sure"". I love hearing from and appreciate customers, I really do, but there is no sense using up your or my time answering questions that have already been answered.

These loads are indeed heavy 45 colt loadings. You can fire them in any post-war firearm that is in normal working condition chambered for 45 colt without reservation. These loads will turn your Colt SAA or clone into a powerful carry gun. The cast load (item 3E) is gas checked and will not substantially lead your barrel.
