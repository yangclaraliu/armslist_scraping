You will be responsible for picking up and transporting the safe. I have no problem helping you load it though. If you're interested, just let me know and hopefully we can work something out."

Hey everyone, 
I have a new and not used Duralast Gold 65-DLG Battery. This was a replacement battery from a truck that was wrecked and destroyed the original battery. So, this one was swapped and sat on the shelf. The manufacture date is 6/13 and it had the plastic cap on it until I took it off to check the battery level and trickle charge it a little. These retail at $145+ tax and core charge at local stores. This came off of a Dodge Ram, but it will fit tons of other vehicles. Just type it into their site to check if it is compatible. This should still be a new battery as it was stored inside and on a wooden shelf. I am looking for best cash offer or possible trade for ammunition (22LR, 7.62x39, 45 auto), and even possible trade for lower priced firearms. Just make me an offer via text or respond on here. Would need to meet in Norman as well. 
Thanks all and have a great weekend!"

Top of box indicates 1 ounce No. 5 chilled shot. Front indicates long range short shot string and states ""Progressive Burning Smokeless Powder. STAYNLESS."" 
Shells are high brass and in excellent condition for their age. 
Box exhibits slight bulging and some fading. Flaps are intact and all of the writing on the box is clearly legible. 
An inside flap advertises the Winchester model 12, model 97 and model 21. With these three guns in production, the date of this box would fit between 1930 and 1957. It is probably closer to the 1930 end of the spectrum and probably pre WWII. Nice gun room display or for the ammo box collector.

16 rounds of 2 1/4'' 20 Gauge Remington Shur Shot shot shells. 
Headstamp reads: ""REM-UMC"" at top and ""SHURSHOT"" at bottom. 
Side reads: ""USE IN 20 GAUGE ONLY"" and ""SHURSHOT KLEANBORE"".
These corrugated shells are paper pie-crimp shot shells with top covers and low brass. 
Original box is in good plus shape with intact flaps. Minimal fraying at edges.

Payment: 
Local buyers - cash FTF.  Will drive a reasonable distance to meet.

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard

It is an original Series 1 gun so no Schwartz safety like the current versions. I am the original owner and would estimate that the gun has had maybe 400 rds fired through it. 

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim. The only change from factory is that i replaced the gray plastic mainspring housing with a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have the factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included.

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured.

Depending on the deal offered i have a set of blue and black Carbon Creation carbon fiber flat bottomed grips for a magwell and an extended 10rd ProMag magazine and a Galco black leather OWB holster that can be worked in.

I dont have any particular trades in mind but trying to find a nice carry gun for my fiance.  I know that these series 1's are sought after and know what it is worth. Any trade offers +/- cash should include the cash figure

The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact compact and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit.

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement.

Hard Cast Wadcutter (1,300 fps) - 20 Round Box","Azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Monday, March 10, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=283

This full profile wad cutter hard cast 44 magnum load was designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for self defense against humans. This load is specifically designed to permanently and quickly disable humans. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living tissue. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and when penetration is straight, it is generally very deep—deep enough to obtain full penetration on the largest human from any angle. The hard cast nose will not deform at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant (flat, with a sharp shoulder) along with bullet path and terminal damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer Jim Cirillo used full profile wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his human targets with certainty. See our item 20D. (38 SPL) The light weight bullet at moderate velocity aids in low recoil for fast follow-up shots.

Unlike our other Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads, this one utilizes a hard cast bullet, which will not mushroom and the resulting penetration is very deep. Expect at least 24 inches of straight-line penetration in mammalian tissue, thus allowing this load to also serve well on small to medium sized game such as deer, black bear and even elk. This hard cast construction keeps your bore from being substantially lead fouled even after hundreds of rounds.

We’ve utilized a flash suppressed powder to the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Note our real world velocities taken from stock over-the-counter firearms. We prefer to establish advertised velocities from real-world firearms and not from extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities. You know what you are getting in the real world, where it matters, with Buffalo Bore ammunition.

Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are genuine CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, factory magazines for the CZ52 pistols that are abundant throughout the Country and throughout the world. Manufacturer is the CZ parent factory that makes all CZ’s firearms, in Strakonice, Czech Republic. These were not imported through CZ USA. Construction is entirely blue steel, from the bottom of the CZ mfg marked floor plate to the stepped cartridge follower. Body sides are ported for round count, as the photos show. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of 7.62x25 ammunition, a caliber we know and respect as the 32 Tokarev caliber. These magazines come to us well preserved and packed in grease, all brand new and unissued. Each magazine comes to us wrapped in its individual plastic bag, sealed in lots of 10 and shipped in cases of 250 magazines. These magazines fit only CZ52 Pistols chambered in 7.62x25 caliber. They will not fit the Yugoslavian Zastava M57 Pistols; will not fit the Polish Radom TT-30; will not fit .32 ACP caliber CZ pistols; will not fit the trunk key hole on a 1959 Edsel. They will only fit CZ52 pistols like the one we had last year showing, or partially showing, in some of our photos. All magazines for these fine pistols are in short supply; especially factory CZ mags like these. We only have a small lot of these, fewer than 1000 on hand at press time, and this is a one-time deal. Our friends in New York charge over $50 apiece for these magazines, and they’re sold out. Our single magazine price is $39 per.

trigger system. The interlocking design of the trigger mechanism's parts
allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools, so

standard 75. Not only does this simply maintenance, the trigger parts
themselves are made of different materials, enhancing durability, operation
life and reliability.

This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. For a person, law enforcement or civilian alike, to entrust his or her life to an extra magazine puts a strong responsibility on us. For as long as we have been in business, the best magazines are factory magazines for semi-auto firearms. We only trust One name in aftermarket magazines: Mec-Gar. They free-fall like they're supposed to; they lock the breech open on the last shot like they're supposed to; we've never had One stick a spring or follower. They are, in short, vastly less likely to mis-perform than any other aftermarket magazines. Mec Gar manufactures the factory magazines for many brands, including Browning, Beretta, Rock Island, and Kel-Tec. That is the reason, for example, that the cheap little Kel-Tecs are so reliable. Here are representatives of the Mec Gar 16 round blue steel magazine for the tried and true CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols made in Czechoslovakia. We have several specimens of their parent pistol, genuine Czech-made CZ-75 and CZ-85 pistols, up for sale on all Big 3 electronic venues whose initials are GA, AA, and GB. They will also fit, we are quite sure, the EAA Italian Made Clones and their ancestors the TA-90 Excams. Also, they will fit the Israeli Baby Eagles marketed by Magnum Research. They will fit Bernardelli P01 and P18 Pistols, with some protrusion. Mec Gar magazines, write the factory technicians, are constructed from certified carbon steel and feature a heat treated housing and a hi-impact polymer or certified carbon steel follower and floorplate. To further complement this package, the surface is as slickly blued as a Colt Python, as the photos show. Our single mag price is $39 per.

It's brand NEW never used. I accidentally ordered the wrong knife. I meant to order the Propel Auto. Since then i have ordered the correct one. I'm asking $100 FIRM. After my cost and shipping, I'm taking a small hit. I'm just trying to get some of my money back. I live in NW OKC. Feel free to text me at REDACTED, thank you.



Here's some more info:

 Propel AO


An all-purpose tactical knife needs to feel familiar and capable, like a well-worn tool, yet still offer quick action and hold up to long-term use. Drawing on critical feedback from military and law enforcement personnel plus its decades of knife design experience, Gerber set out to design a full-size, assisted-opening knife that’s as easy to handle and carry as it is durable and capable. The Gerber Propel AO knife is this knife. It’s a full-size tactical knife with a slim handle profile that fits comfortably in your pocket and hand.

Built to Last
A tactical knife is sure to see a variety of uses, so Gerber uses 420 high-carbon steel to give you a dependable edge. Add a G-10 composite handle and you’ve got an incredibly durable knife. Additionally, the Propel AO features a safer deployment than that of most AO knives. In deploying the blade of a typical Assisted Open knife, users simply apply pressure to the ambidextrous thumb stud. However, in the case of the Propel AO, instead of applying pressure upwards and parallel to the knife’s case, the blade will deploy when engaged at about 45 degrees to the side. This, along with the knife’s narrow aperture of blade access, ensures the blade doesn’t deploy accidentally while being pulled with speed from the pocket. Once the blade is engaged it can be locked into place during use. The tanto-style blade’s black oxide coating adds a stealth element, while its partial serration adds all-purpose utility for working through stubborn materials like nylon rope and thick plastic.

Adjustable Clip
Personal preference dictates how you carry your knife, so Gerber designed the Propel AO with a three-way adjustable clip to customize the knife’s orientation in your pocket or on your belt. You can set it for tip-up or tip-down storage and left-hand or right-hand bias

Comfortable, Discreet Carry
To deserve daily use status, a utilitarian knife like the Propel AO needs to feel good in your hand and in your pocket. The composite G-10 handle’s textured surface optimizes grip security in all conditions and maintains a slim profile that complements the knife’s balanced feel, while the reliable plunge lock and safety switch secure the blade where you want it, be it open or stowed in your pocket. But most importantly, you get a full-size tactical knife that carries discreetly and comfortably, on the job and off.

Also included in sale is 235 factory loaded rounds, and 110 once fired brass cases (if the buyer wants them, if not I'll toss them in my brass pile). 

This firearm is in excellent shape, well taken care of and lightly used. All required to switch from .22TCM to 9mm or vice-versa is to swap the extractor, barrel, and recoil spring (takes approximately 5 minutes). The .22TCM  is a blazing fast cartridge at over 2,000fps. I ruined a buddy's pistol spinner target using this handgun (1/8"" steel plate, and it nearly punched through the back). Light recoil, high capacity (17+1 in either caliber), and large muzzle blasts in low light make this firearm tons of fun. Selling because I bought it for my girlfriend for a home defense weapon in 9mm, and the grip is too big for her hands. I can't justify keeping it around just for me, so I'm making room in the safe for something she'll be able to use. 

Average price of new gun is $650. Price of ammo at $30/50rds is +\-$150)

Will sell entire package for $700. No lowballs.

This gun is the result of a collaboration between Ruger and famous gun writer Wiley Clapp in an attempt to make a GP100 more suited for self defense and carry use. It has a 3"" barrel with Novak rear and fiber optic front sights. The finish is a stainless matte with a hybrid rubber and engraved wood grip. 

It's one of the most comfortable large revolvers to carry and shoot. If you know the GP100 then you know that this gun will never quit. You can feed tens of thousands rounds through it without so much as a cleaning. It will never get out of time or break. This version also happens to be a very handsome gun. 

These are completely sold out at every broker. If you're lucky you'll find a blue one at a gun show but the stainless ones are extremely difficult to find. This gun has only been to the range one time. I fired about 80 rounds through it to break it in and now I'm selling it. It's a great gun but I don't see myself carrying it very often so I'd rather sell it. 

The price is negotiable and I'm open to any reasonable offer.

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870 – the new Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day. Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged. KEY FEATURES: *Action design based on the venerable Model 870 – ultra-smooth and reliable *Rugged ArmorLokt coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces *SuperCell recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% *Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics *Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably *Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels *28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes *Sling swivel studs built-in *Includes Modified Rem Choke

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as Sig’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle.

The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. This railed P226 is chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide and is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This Sig Sauer pistol features an aluminum alloy frame with black hard anodized finish and black polymer grips. The frame has an integral accessory, making it quick and easy to securely mount tactical lights and laser sights. The slide is black Nitron finished Stainless Steel with aggressive cocking serrations. The controls and internal components have an anti-corrosive coating for increased longevity in harsh environments. The trigger has a pull weight of 4.4 pounds in single action mode and 10 pounds in double action mode. This model features SigLite night sights for accurate shot placement in low light and even darkness. Three 15 round magazines are included, and this pistol ships in a padded hard case.

It's chambered in 22lr. It comes with 250 rounds of ammo. This is a really nice little cowboy action pistol (single action). I've had a lot of fun shooting it (just looking for something different). These are excellent guns to teach kids how to shoot while instilling ideas on gun safety. Comes with a custom hand tooled gunbelt. The belt is specially made for .22 revolvers & holds 36 rounds of ammo on belt. It’s genuine hand-made leather & not some cheap knock off. I'm only interested in trading. I also have a H&R .32 caliber revolver (model 732) I could throw in for the right trade (will email pictures on request).
