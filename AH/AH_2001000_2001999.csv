This is an encore pro hunter with the (best of the best) custom match grade .358 wssm stainless steel barrel. It has a stainless steel matching scope base. The stock is a Thompson Center weather shield stainless steel thumb hole stock with recoil reduction & swing hammer for scoped guns.
 The caliber is a .358 wssm (winchester super short mag) which is built by necking up a .25wssm pistol caliber making it a (indiana deer legal pistol cartridge). It shoots a nosler 225 grain ballistic tip bullet. This gun is a wildcat round which is not manufactured by ammunition companies & you will need to get dies & reload or I can recommend a gunsmith where you can purchase these rounds. This is a pistol caliber for deer hunting in indiana which has taken advantage of a loophole in the regulations & basically allows you to hunt with a high powered rifle. It is capable of 300+ yards in the hands of about any shooter & 400, or 500 with an veteran marksman behind it!  This is a very accurate round and is absolutely devastating round on deer! I have fired about 100 rounds through this gun and its in like new condition! I also have about 30 unfired rounds & the once fired brass from every shot i have fired(about 100) available for sale extra. I should also mention these rounds are a couple bucks per round so this gun is not really a fun, price friendly target gun, its made to sight in & go hunting.
 If you are looking for one of these before this deer season this is your chance! The waiting list to have one of these barrels built will have you waiting until after the first of the year. These are expensive guns & I am asking a fair price so I am not willing to trade or negotiate! If you are a serious buyer feel free to contact me. Please do not contact me unless you are a serious buyer! This gun price is not over inflated because it's probably the only one here, or super cheap because I need the money! It's about going price. All I am doing is saving the wait on a custom barrel & asking a fair price for a gun that will be available (this deer season)!

This rifle has numerous features all designed to produce accuracy. It features a rear lugged receiver which locks it securely to the McMillan M3A tactical
Overall condition of this package is excellent, near new. There are only a very few minor handling marks and I'd grade the rifle at 96% overall.

This was the top-of-the-line Springfield rifle but has been out of production for a few years.

D. Nimschke.  It is almost identical to serial number 114, which is accepted as the first Nimschke engraved Single Action.  We have enclosed a picture of #114 for comparison.  This gun is in excellent original condition, retaining 20% original nickel, beautiful floral engraving, and one piece checkered ivory grips.  This is a stunning piece, used but well cared for, with excellent crisp markings and lots of character.  The bore and the mechanics are fine, and nothing needs to be fixed or replaced.  L. D. Nimschke was considered one of the best, if not the best, of all New York engravers and his work is legendary.  At this time period, almost all Colt engraving was done in New York, and it wasn’t until 1880 that Colt hired their first notable full time engraver, Cuno Helfricht, who’s mentor was L. D. Nimschke."

It is in new condition and has never been fired. It comes with original box and paperwork. The ""slugster"" was an idea thought up by mossberg to build a shotgun that would perform best with buckshot. What they did was chamber the shotgun for 12 gauge, then backbore the barrel to 10 gauge diameter. This allowed the buckshot (that normally holds a tighter pattern than birdshot) to expand into a larger pattern on target - thus becoming more effective!  Pretty neat piece and I don't believe they are made any longer  - either way, you won't find one better than this since its new. $275 cash obo Thanks"

245,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2001245,For Sale:  Moving Special: Genuine Buddy 150cc scooter with accessories,"SE Portland, Portland, Oregon","$ 1,350","Listed On: Thursday, August 15, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Buddy Scooter is fun, quick, easy to ride, maneuverable, and reliable. My 2008 Genuine Buddy International Italia Green has been ridden only 2,800 miles and it gets 80-90 mpg. The Buddy is fully automatic and starts up with the press of a button. A new battery was put in earlier this year. The Stebel Intimidator 139 decibel air-horn is among the loudest on any scooter. It gets attention. There is an emergency kick-start. Storage is available under the seat. Mechanically, this scooter is in next to new condition. I'm moving to New York soon to take care of family so I'm making a great moving-away offer.

Accessories: My scooter comes with a mid-size windshield and a black wire Prima basket. The front head light now has a high performance bulb in it. You can see the difference even in the daylight. On the seat is a deluxe sheepskin seat cover handmade by Alaska Leathers. Sheepskin is comfortable to sit on and it reduces the vibrations. Sheepskin also keeps the seating cooler in summer and warmer in winter.

Separately: I'm selling for very low prices; brand new (still in their boxes) two high-end Vee Rubber Winter Tires which are ideal for the Portland metro's wet weather, a Scorpion Exo 400 full face medium helmet (it's DOT & SNELL approved), and two high-security OnGuard Mastiff chains with locks.

Here is a review of the Genuine Buddy 150cc:

This was the first year for the new body style. Has the large aggressive looking fog lights in the grill which are almost as big as the headlights. As mentioned above, this mustang has never had an aftermarket part put on it or been raced. Strangely enough it has one of the best sounding exhausts I've ever heard on a mustang. The engine is in excellent condition and has been serviced every 3 months / 3 thousand miles (usually every three months though because I haven't driven it all that much). I'm keeping it at my warehouse in Lexington near the Fatz cafe so just send me an email and I can easily meet you to let you see it.

In 1974 The Russian Army replaced the 7.62x39 with this caliber. The round is lighter to carry and has less recoil than a 7.62x39 but it has a high velocity. There is an abundance of cheap surplus ammo in this caliber. You can find ammo for around 11 cents a round. Since there is less recoil it's easier to stay on target with a follow up shot as there is less muzzle jump. This Saiga rifle can fire in quick succession due to the energy that escapes from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder.

337,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2001337,For Sale:  Noveske Afghan NSR AR-15 5.56 Stainless,"Hawaii, Hawaii, United States","$ 1,425","Listed On: Thursday, August 15, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a brand new in box Noveske Afghan AR-15 semi automatic rifle chambered for 5.56mm NATO. Noveske is one of the premier manufacturers of AR-15 pattern rifles and this is a perfect example. This rifle features a 14.5"" Stainless Steel barrel with a 1:7"" twist rate and Polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling is an innovative alternative to conventional rifling, boasting increased velocity and accuracy, and significantly easier cleaning. The smooth bore profile provides an improved gas seal, decreases deformation of bullet jackets, and has no sharply angled grooves to hold deposits of fouling. An AAC flash hider is pinned to the barrel making this rifle legal without a SBR stamp. Noveske's Stainless Steel barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is a proprietary Noveske chambering. The steel used is a type of 416R and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske's proprietary 7 PT button. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. The barrel has a bead blasted finish for a matte appearance. A mid-length gas system is used, decreasing heat related wear to critical internal componentry, and reducing felt recoil to the operator. For use in any precision application, Noveske recommends a Stainless Steel barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability.

The upper receiver is a forged Vltor MUR modular design, including an anti-rotation interface with the handguard. The MUR is a rigid Mil Spec design with a flat top Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. The walls of the receiver are thicker, making it a stronger, more accurate, and more reliable platform. The MUR is precision milled from forged 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum which has been stress relieved, heat treated, and cryogenically treated. It features extended feed ramps for flawless cycling. The Vltor MUR is likely the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. The bolt is is shot peened and Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure flawlessness, and the bolt carrier has a properly staked gas key.

This rifle comes with an exciting new 11"" NSR KeyMod handguard. The NSR handguard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating forend option to the AR-15/M16 family of weapons. The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of current and future accessories and components. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as an intermediary, thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard. This handguard features a full length top mounted Picatinny rail and KeyMod slots at 90 degree intervals. We also have KeyMod Picatinny rail segments available for purchase. The width of the NSR handguard before accessories have been installed is only 1.48"". Front and rear Troy BUIS are installed, making this rifle ready to operate.

The lower receiver is a mil spec Noveske Gen II expertly milled from 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum. It has a mil spec black hard coat anodized finish for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. The magazine well is aggressively flared for quick, easy reloads. An ALG Combat Trigger is installed, boasting a smoother, sharper trigger pull by extensive polishing and a Nickel Boron HardLube coating. The geometry of the sear and trigger assembly has not been altered, and thus reliability is not affected. The trigger and hammer are 8620 alloy steel that has been quenched, tempered, and carbuerized, offering very high surface hardness, and the pins are upgraded tempered 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a Nickel-Teflon coating. Pull weight is typically about 6 pounds, making it compliant with U.S. military specifications. A Mil Spec receiver extensions is installed with a Noveske QD plate and Vltor iMod Carbine stock mounted. A popular Magpul MOE pistol grip is equipped and one 30 round PMAG magazine is included.

 Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode. Compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s AR – 10  and you will not be disappointed.BESY PRICE ANY WHERE $1350

To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by elite fighting forces, L-3 EOTech has developed the EOTECH 553 Holo Weapon Sight, 65 MOA Ring/1 MOA Dot Reticle, Black, NV Compatible, CR123 Battery (553.A65BLK), modeled after the ever popular, battle proven HWS design.

The SU-231/PEQ (Model 553) base consists of 2 ARMS throw levers and is only adaptable to rails that properly accept the ARMS design.

When used in Close Quarters Battle (CQB) environments, this revolutionary weapon optic delivers amazing speed and accuracy gains, uncompromising use of peripheral vision, leaves no muzzle-side optical signature and is packaged in a compact, durable unit. Now deployed with elite Special Forces and SWAT teams the world over, the HWS delivers vastly improved shooting performance for all levels of operators.

This model HWS comes with a standard reticle - 65 MOA ring with alignment ticks and a 1 MOA aiming dot. The large, open ring is the key to the lightning quick eye recognition and unmatched target acquisition speed. Alternately, the 1 MOA can be used for precision aiming at distances as far as 500 yards where it only covers 5"" of the target scene. The reticle demonstrates its versatility for a host of close quarter and long range engagement scenarios.

The versatility of this sight is remarkable, as it can be used in conjunction with a night vision monocular. This sight effectively produces an accurate and versatile night vision rifle scope. A special night vision setting allows the operator to immediately drop the brightness intensity of the holographic sight reticle to eliminate any ""halo"" effect and saturation of the night vision device. When the appropriate rail extension and quick release mechanisms are employed, this combination allows your weapon to go from broad daylight to no-light environments quickly, easily, and without losing zero.

This is an extremely durable and reliable weapon sight. It is waterproof (66 feet submersion rating) and fogproof, with a repeatable 1 MOA after re-mounting. The window material is a 3/16"" thick shatterproof laminate with anti-glare and scratch resistant coatings, and the housing features a non-reflective black hard coat finish.

Engineered for small to medium caliber weapon platforms, the 553 is an excellent choice for use in CQB or urban battle environments. Because it is also accurate for longer range sighting, it should be noted that the Eotech holosight technology leaves no muzzle-side optical signature. Whatever your tactical needs are, you can rely on the EoTech 553.

The CW9 offers the same patented features seen in higher-priced Kahr Arms pistols in an ultra-thin package. CW pistols have a stainless steel slide with a matte stainless finish that gives the pistol a rectangular slide profile and is finished with single-line slide markings. The double-action-only CW9 is a lock breech, passive striker block design with a Browning-style recoil lug. Despite the CW9's durable construction, it weighs only 16.8 ounces. A thin, textured polymer grip fits your hand comfortably while the drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and the pinned polymer blade front sight create a precise and accurate sighting profile.

Description
M720V
The variable-output M720V RAID WeaponLight produces brilliant 150-lumen white light or 240 milliwatts of infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply push and twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between white light or IR illumination—or select the ""disable"" setting to prevent accidental discharges. In either spectrum mode, the M720V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications with sufficient peripheral illumination for situational awareness. The highly efficient LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. It comes with a pressure-activated SR07-M720V tape switch (with a 7"" cable) that can be positioned where you choose. If your remote switch becomes damaged or disconnected, rotate your RAID WeaponLight's white-light selector switch to "";flashlight"" mode and activate it directly via its integral pushbutton dome switch. (This same pushbutton switch provides low navigational white light when ""flashlight"" mode is not selected.) This selector switch also lets you choose three different white-light output settings: high, medium, or strobe. The IR selector switch, located on opposite side, offers high-, medium-, and low-output settings when IR mode is selected on head.

Description
M720V
The variable-output M720V RAID WeaponLight produces brilliant 150-lumen white light or 240 milliwatts of infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply push and twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between white light or IR illumination—or select the ""disable"" setting to prevent accidental discharges. In either spectrum mode, the M720V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications with sufficient peripheral illumination for situational awareness. The highly efficient LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. It comes with a pressure-activated SR07-M720V tape switch (with a 7"" cable) that can be positioned where you choose. If your remote switch becomes damaged or disconnected, rotate your RAID WeaponLight's white-light selector switch to "";flashlight"" mode and activate it directly via its integral pushbutton dome switch. (This same pushbutton switch provides low navigational white light when ""flashlight"" mode is not selected.) This selector switch also lets you choose three different white-light output settings: high, medium, or strobe. The IR selector switch, located on opposite side, offers high-, medium-, and low-output settings when IR mode is selected on head. The M720V attaches solidly to your Picatinny rail via our Swing-Lever™ clamp, which self-adjusts to out-of-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from recoil or impact. Built to withstand the rigors of combat, the M720V is constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission. It's also O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Available in black or desert sand.

A 4.25"" bushing barrel allows field strip anywhere, and keeps the weight down when compared to pistols of comparable size with tapered cone barrels. Already loaded with options, we find that most customers want it just the way it is.

When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds.

The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.

Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.

Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Perma Kote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. All you add is practice.

This tactical optic is perfect for agencies that want the best in CQB speed and versatility, without the need for night vision compatibility.

This EOTech Holographic Weapon Sight (HWS) is the 1st electro-optic sighting system to apply holographic technology to small and medium-sized weapon platforms. When used in Close Quarters Battle (CQB) environments, this revolutionary weapon optic delivers amazing speed and accuracy gains, uncompromising use of peripheral vision, leaves no muzzle-side optical signature and is packaged in a compact, durable unit.

Now deployed with elite Special Forces and SWAT teams the world over, the EOTech Holosight deliver vastly improved shooting performance for all levels of operators.

The standard reticle is a 65 MOA ring with alignment ticks and a 1 MOA aiming dot. The large, open ring is the key to the lightning quick eye recognition and unmatched target acquisition speed. Alternately, the 1 MOA can be used for precision aiming at distances as far as 500 yards where it only covers 5"" of the target scene. The reticle demonstrates its versatility for a host of close quarter and long range engagement scenarios. There is no compromise between speed and precision accuracy.

This model Holographic Weapon Sight mounts to any universal Picatinny mounting rail (supports standard Weaver dovetail) with an integral mounting platform for adaptation to user preferred eye relief.

The EOTech Holo Sight can interface to any standard issue M16 or M4 variant in either a fixed carry handle or flattop receiver, and with no modifications to the weapon. The M16 and M4 mounting platforms provide for the functionally critical aspect of co-witnessing the iron sights within the HWS's Heads Up Display while maintaining the operator's critical check weld position.

The 512 Holographic Weapon Sight has been designed and tested to provide consistent, reliable performance, even in the most hostile operating environments. This HWS is waterproof (submersible to 10 feet depth), fogproof, shockproof, and withstands extreme temperature variations.

   This is a rare chance, especially at this price, if you snooze it will be gone .

This is an 1800's Remington Rolling Block rifle in .50 caliber (""50/70""). It has no markings on it that I see, but I am not an expert historian on these by any means.

I have been advised by the previous owner  (passed down to him) that at least a portion of this rifle was carried by his Grandfather who served in the Confederacy in ""A Company"" during the Civil War .

I had some hot head a few months ago going on about the Rolling block not being made during the Civil War and that is true (except for 20,000 very early versions given to Union Troops) and I was not saying that anyway, so let me explain.

A local collector explained to me, after I gave him measurements on the original  bore (.58) and current .50 cal bushing, that it appears to be an early Civil War musket,stock and barrel that was LATER (as in after the Civil War) converted to the superior rolling block mechanism design while still retaining the stock (and barrel,sites etc) that he carved his Confederate Company name and a Christian cross into while serving. 

I do have a letter from the Grandson saying this was carried by the Grandfather that goes with the rifle you are welcome to also.

I am not trying to get the full value I was told it should bring to the right collector as I need a deposit for a Jeep . The Jeep is under priced so doing the same on the rifle.

At his point I am just going to focus on the fact that this is a complete and tight (Grandson said he had fired it a long time ago and it was very impressive) .50Cal (50/70)Remington Rolling block with a very nice patina that  fortunately has not been  cleaned up by an amateur.

This is a cash price (no shipping etc) and I will deal with someone near the Matthews, NC area. Sorry but I will not be travelling long distances to meet and will not be accepting anything other than cash so thank you in advance for your understanding.

Serious buyers only and I do have additional detailed pictures on request."

Now in the fifth generational version which offers less weight in a slightly shorter and quieter package, the AWC ThunderTrap suppressor design enhances the accuracy and manages to cause the retention of the gases for a long period of time, causing the sound emitted to be a soft hiss rather than a pop. The actual gas exit delay time is nothing short of fantastic making observers unsure about hearing any supersonic projectile flight signature (sonic crack).  

The ThunderTrap also functions as a significant recoil reducer, allowing the user to maintain excellent target contact visibility. The added weight to the barrel also serves to improve the grouping due to changing barrel vibrations.   The one thing that may catch your attention is that the sonic crack seems to be non-existent to the shooter or observers who are in a location behind the bullet as the precursor wave seems to mask the sound of the projectile in flight. The AWC ThunderTrap will outlive many barrels – it’s a once and done purchase.

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."

Come get this CZ 75 P-07 .40 Caliber in the box with everything shown.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

Comes with $200+ in accessories. I've done absolutely no permanent mods to the rifle in sorts of shortening the barrel or removing the bayonet or grenade launcher/sight. It can be put into either a tactical or original setup in minutes.

The extras include:
Tapco 6 pos. stock with rails and bayonet cutout from manufacturer
Railed dust cover for rear mounted optics
I have a like new BSA or sight mark red dot, will include whichever one you prefer
Tapco 20 round mag
Promag 30 round mag
Ammo included on the right deal


Mostly looking to trade, will consider cash offers but keep in mind the value of the extras as I'm not willing to split up the package. Email me for more info or pictures."

Description
SOCOM556-RC
The SureFire SOCOM556-RC Fast-Attach suppressor is the worlds most advanced 5.56 mm rifle suppressor. Selected for the M4 and Mk18 carbines by US Special Operations Command after placing first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted, it also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding.

Compact and lightweight, the SOCOM556-RC suppressor adds only 4 inches (approximately) to the overall length of your rifle. Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-RC produces minimal, consistent point-of-impact shift compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.

The SOCOM556-RC features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability. SureFire's patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.

A new indexing system means this suppressor mounts to a current-model SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous versions, and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area.

The SOCOM556-RC is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach ock ring and Cerakote ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.

All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm

SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.

All SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits they reduce the weapons sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operators position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.
