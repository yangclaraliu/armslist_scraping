It has a 28 inches ported barrel as well as a 24 inch non-ported turkey barrel. The 24 inch barrel was special ordered from Mossberg without the ports to be legal for tactical optics class multigun and has red and green ""adjustable"" rifle sights. It also has a nordic component magazine tube and choate charging handle. The trigger, action, and loading port have not been touched. The 930 comes with the original magazine cap, modified choke, full choke, and turkey choke. 

The 930 has approximately 1000 rounds of birdshot. Mostly 1 ounce and 1 1/8 ounce loads. The finish on the 24 inch barrel does not have a good finish. I tried to capture the finish as best I could in the pictures. I've had no problems with the gun at all. It functions smooth and fires every time. This is the best bang for the buck to get into multigun.

No trades at this time. I hate to sell this, but I've upgraded and I need to pay for other projects. I have well over $700 in this mossberg."

The vz. 24 rifle is a bolt-action carbine designed and produced in Czechoslovakia from 1924 to 1942. It was developed from the famous Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, featuring a 600 mm (23.6"") barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the 150 mm (5.9"") -longer Gewehr 98. The carbine followed a similar trend in weapon design at the time, that a short rifle gave away little in ballistic efficiency at combat ranges, but was easier to handle on account of its shorter length.

The same characteristics that made the VZ -24 make this a great platform for a sporting rifle.  East to point and follow game, yet very accurate and powerful.

This rifle shoots the standard Mauser 8x57 cartridge.

The bore on this rifle is fantastic with visibly crisp rifling, and a custom target crown on the barrel for improved accuracy.  The Bishop stock is the highest quality offered with a very comfortable cheek piece. (The stock alone probably cost more than the asking price.)  This is part of a larger collection of C&R rifles I am selling.

See more photos here http://www.flickr.com/photos/18186251@N00/sets/REDACTED7093285/

This rifle is over 50 years old and can be sold face to face in Los Angeles, or shipped to a C&R holder.  Face to Face cash sale preferred.  No trades and price is firm."

My Smith M&P 15-22 is a little finicky and I don't like how bulk/standard velocity ammo cycles through it. After trying several different brands/types of ammo I've figured out that she likes high velocity ammo only, primarily CCI MiniMags. 

Looking to trade the following for 700rds of CCI MiniMags:

Approx. 200rds. of Federal Standard Velocity (box is opened)
Approx. 950rds. of Remington Golden Bullets (1 box is opened w/ approx 425rds in it)
Approx. 130rds. of Remington Thunderbolts (1 box is opened w/ approx 30rds in it)

Total of 1280rds of quality bulk .22LR ammo.

Given the current prices of 525pks of Remington Golden Bullets ($40-50), I put the cash value of this ammo at around $95-100 and trade value around $110-115.

I am not looking to get rich or gouge, however, I am looking to get approximately 700rds ($10-13 per sleeve of 100) of CCI MiniMags in trade. I am also not interested in breaking up the lot either. Open to trades for equally-valued quantities of other caliber ammunition. Also open to trade for M&P .40 full size, Sig 220 .45acp and Sig 229 .40 magazines.

My disclaimer: I stand by my word. I describe item condition honestly, I properly own all items I sell, I only make legal deals with qualified individuals, and I keep appointments. If you are a flake, don’t waste my time. If you don’t keep your word, the deal is null and void. Unless I specifically say I will reserve an item, it is open to the first paying individual. If you say you will buy it and then don’t get around to sending payment quickly, don’t be surprised if someone buys the item out from under you. When you pay, I ship ASAP. If you are unhappy with an item bought from me, I will probably refund your money, less my shipping costs, when you return the item to me promptly and in same condition. It is very important to me that both parties are satisfied with the transaction."

This is a pistol that you're not likely to come across again, especially one in this condition. This is a 1st generation Walther P99 9mm with Meprolight night sights. It is 100% German manufactured and proofmarked, was imported by Interarms, and has a date code on the frame of ""KI"", which is 1998 manufacture. The slide has a factory finish called ""QPQ"", which stands for ""Quench/Polish/Quench"". It is basically a hard, highly corrosion-resistant Tenifer finish (similar to Glock) that is not phosphated over, which gives it an appearance similar to a matte-finish hard chrome. Not many Walthers were made with this finish and if you do some research, you'll see that it's quite desirable among Walther enthusiasts. I purchased this pistol secondhand in 2005, added the night sights, and function-tested it with a couple hundred rounds of various FMJ and hollowpoints. It was extremely accurate and 100% reliable, just as all of my other P99 pistols were. I thoroughly cleaned the pistol, lubed it, and stored it. As you can see, it is in exceptional condition and is very close to new. The pistol comes with (2) 16rd factory mags, the original case, factory test target, original sights, extra back straps, and owner's manual. FYI, the 16rd Walther P99 mags are very difficult to find and were what the pistol was originally designed for...however at some point and for some reason, Walther changed the standard mags to 15rds.  I have some additional 16rd Walther factory mags in like-new condition that I can sell with the pistol for $40 each. 

I can text or email additional high-quality photos if you're interested. Just let me know."

The trailer has an upgraded 6000lb axle, trailer brakes installed and wired, and upgraded tires and rims to handle the increased load. This makes the trailer capable of hauling over 3500lbs of whatever you want as opposed to a typical 6x12 enclosed trailer that can only haul about 2000lbs.

 Additionally, the trailer has new tires on it that have less than 2000 miles on them, and a spare that also has less than 2000 miles. I recently took the trailer to a repair shop and goer everything serviced, oiled and fixed that was wrong with it, so besides from some stains on the floor of the trailer, it's as good as new and all doors open smoothly and the pulleys work great.

 As you can see from the pictures, it can use a bath, but all the discoloration on the roof will come off with cleaning, I climbed up on a ladder and cleaned a small portion on the left side just to make sure. 

 The only damage to the trailer is on the inside front left, where some cargo punched a small hole in the wood as you can see in the pictures. It did not penetrate the exterior and does not affect the weatherproofing whatsoever. 

 Make me an offer, but please make it reasonable, this trailer is in amazing condition and better than any 6x12 single axle that you can buy new. I don't need to sell it and am not desperate, so won't respond to lowball offers. 

I am open to guns + cash offers or multiple guns + cash or just straight cash. I value the trailer at 3000 on trade value, 2700 on sale, but I am willing to negotiate a little.

 No need to reply and ask if it's still available, if ad is up, it's still available. 

 Text me at REDACTED or email me back here with any offers or if you want to see more pictures, I have a lot more."

This AR15 was built professionally per my specifications, and includes only high quality components. The Bobro mount is the perfect TR24 mount, and allows for the perfect height over bore for the TR24 to clear the fixed front sight. This mount makes Burris and like mounts look like trash. The Trijicon optic with mount alone cost over $1000.

This Trijicon optic is dual illuminated via tritium and fiber, just like an ACOG.  However, it is 1-4x adustable on the fly.  The reticle is a RED chevron, but for some reason the phone made it look amber.  It is RED.

This gun has only been fired enough to sight in the TR24 (Maybe 100 rounds or so), and has sat in the safe and gun case for its entire life. It is basically brand new. I love this AR, but don't shoot it enough, and need the money.

Remington Police Magnums come with a parkerized finish on an 18"" barrel (as opposed to a Blued finish on an Express); feature a stronger sear spring and magazine spring; better extractor and ejector, and much more.

Shotgun has rifle sights and has been gone over completely by in-house Remington LE Certified Armorer. This shotgun goes for $650 new in the box if your are Law Enforcement.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.

Synopses of the variances are provided below.
870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty Remington Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a Bead Blast Bluing finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.

Specs from Smith and Wesson:

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

It was built with a Special Weapons receiver and a 15.5"" HK barrel. After I bought it I had Investment Grade Firearms pin on an AAC blackout suppressor mount to bring the barrel to length to avoid SBR issues. The wide shelf on the receiver was also reworked and a new SEF grip was fit to the receiver. New stock and handguard were also added. Other than the rear sight not being refinished the rifle looks new. It also has the desirable paddle mag release too. Rifle has been great and it runs flawlessly with my sear and M4-2000 suppressor. Only marks on it is from cases hitting the receiver behind the ejection port. The rifle has had less than 500 rounds through it. Rifle will ship with one 40 round mag. I will have to collect sales tax from Arkansas buyers.
