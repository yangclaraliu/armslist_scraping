The bad news (and why I am willing to part with this at a low price)..
This rifle is having failure to eject issues, specifically stovepiping.  I was about to take this into a gunsmith to have it fixed, but shopping for an engagement ring and the cash would help.  That being said I do not need to sell, so don't expect to pull off a low-ball offer.  May consider partial trades, but they will have to be in my favor.  Thanks for looking!"

Unfired by me, or anybody else except from the factory. I just got this gun out of layaway a week ago. With night sights, checkered mainspring housing, ambidextrous safety, adjustable match trigger, etc., hardcase, and everything that came with the gun from the factory (i.e., holster, magazine holder, warranty papers, cleaning brush, ALS keys, and owner’s manual). Gun has factory wood grips, but I installed a brand new set of VZ G10 Operator II grips ( on it right now – pictured). I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60), and a box of 50rds FMJ ammo along with the gun. I like the gun, but it is too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice. Must be 21 years old or older to buy/trade this gun, and must also be a Kentucky resident and have at least a valid KY driver’s license. Local KY sale/trade only. No shipping, or out of state sale, don’t ask. Thanks for looking.

I kind of feel like a dummy selling this so soon, but after 35 years on this planet, I just learned I'm going to be a father so off she goes! As the title says, I am selling my almost brand new Sig Sauer X5 Competition All stainless full german 9mm race gun. It has never been competed with. I bought it as an amateur pistol afficianado. I have run exactly 250 rounds through her. It's not even begun to be broken in. It is as new and perfect in every way. No marks. This is the most recent release literally made in germany 8 months ago. With proofing. It comes with an EXTRA Factory Sig Sauer german 18 round race magazine (with the factory aluminum silver basepad factory made). This is significant because they only come with one mag standard and rip off from sig or not, That is an extra $100 you dont have to pay and have 2 Factory X5 mags from day one! Comes with both mags for the price! Also, Fully adjustable sights, Ambi safeties, factory X5 Magwell and extended mag release. EXTREMELY ACCURATE! Comes with Sig Extreme Grease, Rear sight tool, Factory test target and manual of course. $1550 for everything.

This is premium .32 ACP..  It boasts ballistics that beat out EVERY .32 out there (even the specialized +P carry rounds) and most .380 rounds.   

This is not considered +P, but was manufactured for European .32 pistols (where .32 has always been taken seriously.) This will cycle your PPK's and all of the other Euro pistols that need a little more punch to work right.   I've received zero complaints about problems with American made .32 firearms..  but it's worth remembering that American made .32 ammo often has less than half the velocity of this.  (This shoots around 1200 FPS)

It IS legal for you to buy, and own. It IS legal for me to sell and ship. There is no .32 ammo at any price that will outperform this ballistically. We have sold, and shot a lot of this. No misfires, Very consistent, and clean. I can refer you to my GB profile for up to date feedback. 

I've got a couple cases of this.. Pricing is based on quantity.

Local Pick up is ok, and I'll give you a -little- better price for that, as you'll be saving me shipping.

I've gotten great reviews on this ammo.. sold over a case, and no complaints of misfires, and the penetration is impressive for a .32 

Here are some key points on this ammo: 
•Mild steel core is able to penetrate doors, and soft body armor at close range 
•This ammo was banned in the 80's and is extremely rare. 
•This ammo was produced just before the ban; As new as it comes. 
•Brass cases 
•Non-Corrosive. 
•just like the Czech 9mm and 7.62 x 25 AP ammo

The PPS-43C was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. These are extremely reliable.

It is a true factory double action only with factory spurless hammer (no, that is not a bubba job). It is a matte stainless six shot revolver in 38 special and will also shoot 38+P. It has the frame mounted firing pin, 4"" barrel, and fixed sights. Comes with the hard to find Uncle Mike's finger groove grips. Action is typical S&W tight and smooth. No box or papers. I am told that this was a special contract gun for the Brinks Armored Car Company. This is one of the safest and most reliable guns you can have for home defense. Goes bang every time and no danger of accidental discharge in single action.

This is a very accurate, good shooting set-up. It's only been shot enough to zero the scope, 20 rounds max. It has a small blemish on the brass deflector from shipment, which i can forward a pic of to you if you're interested. Only selling to get into some other types of shooting. Prefer trades, will take trades plus cash. Will also except cash offers. Not trying to trade up. As you can see, not including labor, I spent close to 2k just on parts, I'd take a couple hundred off to be fair as this is a pre owned set up. I also have mags and ammo that can go w/ this, so no low ball offers please.

Extensive CNC machining converts the solid block into an 8.3 ounces precision receiver that does not have rougher surface finish and casting imperfections that a cast receiver would frequently include. All dimensions of the receiver are held to close tolerances for reliable consistency. This replacement receiver for serious target shooters, varmint shooters, as well as plinkers can enjoy the advantages of a machined receiver with a solid Picatinny mount. Additionally  you clean from the chamber to the muzzle with a 1/4"" hole in the rear of the receiver that allows you to put a cleaning rod in the rear of the receiver, then attach the brush and swab the barrel from the chamber to the muzzle without having to remove the barrel (and lose your zero each time). The cleaning access hole is cosmetically covered with a snap in and out plug that blends with the rear of the receiver when installed and that is completely hidden when the receiver is in the stock. Tactical Innovations' FINNED 8"" MATTE BLUE THREADED BARREL WITH THREAD PROTECTOR is a perfect drop-in retrofit for Ruger® Charger™ pistols or for any other 10/22® receiver based custom pistol build.

It has the Beretta ATI stock and a new 40mm Illuminated (red and green crosshairs) scope.
The gun looks and feels like an 800.00 carbine. This Hipoint was voted a better carbine than the Ruger equivalent. It has a lifetime warrenty to the new owner, forever. Hipoint says they will fix any gun that they manufacture, which includes this carbine, for any reason.. forever.  No matter how many owners it has had, the warrenty stands.  No box is required, no receipt is required...period. They ask no questions, that is their policy. If you melt it, they will fix it. If you run over it, they will fix it. Their customer service IS the best.
It is 100% reliable..never has had a failure or error of any kind and it looks and feels like a million bucks. It shoulders better than any weapon I have...it's just a natural fit when you bring it up. Muzzle brake is also installed. It has two magazines and is designed to shoot ""9mm luger (9x19)""   or    ""9mm +p""     or     ""9mm NATO (hi-power round)"". I'm just seeing what trades are out there. I prefer to trade versus selling. I need a carry pistol...a good one. I would also trade for a Ruger single six revolver with extra mag cylinder. Would trade for a Golden boy in great condition.

An optional 13-ounce, mercury-filled recoil reducer tames the kick of heavy ammunition. The P-350's fore-end is ergonomically designed to fit the hand comfortably with distinct ridges that provide a positive gripping surface with or without gloves and regardless of temperature or weather conditions. Accessory choke tubes (both flush and extended) for the P-350 are available in C, IC, M, IM, F and XFT for turkeys. The P-350 comes with a red-bar front sight that provides fast and consistent target acquisition.

The Mini-14's themselves sell for $650 all day long, the mount is $77 on Amazon, The scope is $140 on Amazon, and the magazines vary. This package is worth over $900 and I would be willing to let it go for $720 FIRM.
I can also separate the scope and rifle and can do $650, but the scope is in perfect shape. With the scope mount included, you can still use the original ironsights. This gun cycles cleanly and is very fun to shoot.

EOTech HHS-2 Holographic Hybrid Sight II is an ideal combination of state of the art EOTech tactical gear, optimized for precision accuracy in intense tactical situations at close or medium range. These EO Tech red dot sights combine the high-accuracy optics of the EOTech EXPS2-2 Red Dot Sight and the zoom-enhancing properties of the EOTech G33 Red Dot Magnifier into a single potent reflex sight. The heart of the red dot sight is the EXPS2-2, a highly compact, tactically-oriented red dot sight that features a large ring reticle with two 1-MOA aiming dots. The reflex portion of the EO Tech HHS2 Holographic Hybrid Reflex Sight w/ G33 Magnifier features true two-eyes-open aiming, allowing you to get a full picture of the battlefield while maintaining precision accuracy, and its 7mm raised base allows you to use iron sights even with the red dot sight equipped. EOTech has equipped the EXPS2-2 red dot sight with easy to adjust side illumination buttons, and its transversely mounted 123 lithium battery will rarely need replacement. The EO-Tech Holographic EXPS2-2 Hybrid Magnified Red Dot Sight is also highly versatile, capable of mounting to your weapon with the integrated locking quick detach lever.

The EO-Tech HHS-II Holographic Hybrid Magnified Reflex Sight evolves beyond the original red dot sight when you attach the included G33 magnifier. Shorter and lighter than its previous incarnation (the EOTech G23), the EOTech G33 3.25x Red Dot Magnifier is a powerful optic that will boost the power of your red dot sight by 3.25x, enough to add long-range accuracy to the list of features on your reflex sight. Each of these red dot sight accessories features tool-free azimuth adjustment and a wide field of view that won't diminish the incredibly fast target acquisition capabilities of the EXPS2-2. An easy to adjust diopter allows for precise focus with the EO Tech HHS-2 Hybrid Red Dot Scope w/ G33 Magnifier, no matter the target. What's more, these EO-Tech red dot sight accessories allow you to switch between 3.25x magnification and 1x magnification at will with the included Switch to Side (STS) mount, which will flip the magnifier to the side of your weapon and out of the way with a single motion, adding even more versatility to your firearm. When you want to combine the precise tactical advantage conferred by the EOTech EXPS series with the long-range firepower of a scope, choose the EOTech HHS-II Hybrid Holographic Sight II with EXPS2-2 Sight and G33 Magnifier.

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes LWRC's patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

I have attached a link to the Springfield Armory website with the 9mm Springfield XDM, which is the newest line from Springfield, a YouTube video that shows what all comes with the firearm, and a link to the holster that I would add to it as well. I purchased the Springfield XDM brand new earlier this year from Guns Unlimited and have put less than 600 rounds through it, which in handguns is basically brand new. There are plenty of reviews and forums online discussing this firearm that will give an honest opinion. The handgun retails at $650 plus (after taxes $700), the holster (after shipping) $75. I have not even opened the gun lock, and still have the warranty forms. The reason I am selling is because I purchased the Springfield for a conceal carry firearm, but realized despite the handgun being awesome, I needed something thinner. So I then purchased the S&W Shield, which is not as nice of a handgun, but definitely more thin. (Also open to motorcycles as part of a trade! Just throwing that out there...)

 This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
 Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

I was involved in competitive three position air rifle shooting for over five years. I have medals all the way up to the state level and have participated in national NRA sanctioned competitions. I also have competed in three position small bore at the national level and have experience in high power competitions as well as IDPA style events. I am wanting to teach someone the basics one on one. I enjoy teaching and introducing people to new concepts they are excited about. I will work for free within reason and only accept tips as payments. At the moment, I prefer to only give lessons to complete beginners *only* in single shot air rifles and single shot air pistols for personal self-enrichment. I am not going to teach you how to hunt. This is strictly shooting stationary paper and silhouette targets. The first and most important thing I will teach you is safety and respect for firearms. With safety always being the number one concern, I will teach how to shoot supported as well as unsupported prone, standing, and kneeling. Just as important, I will also teach techniques such as breathing, diet, pulse rate, relaxation, focus, and trigger pull. I will provide all necessary equipment unless you have equipment you would like to use. What kind of equipment you have will determine the extent of your learning experience, however there is no equipment requirement except safety glasses. The only requirement *if* of you provide equipment is that you will have a single shot air rifle with closed aperture sights that is either single pump, Co2, or PCP. No multi pump guns. I also prefer not to teach with guns that have optics because optics often fail, but if you have purchased a solid setup, we can discuss the possibilities."

It has the original black rubber grips with almost all of the finish worn off except for the S&W at the top of each grip, as this gun was carried all the time back then.
