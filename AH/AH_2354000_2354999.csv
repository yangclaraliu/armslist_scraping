The .17 Super Magnum is the “new kid on the block” in terms of ammunition cartridges. Not your typical .17 caliber, this cartridge fires a 20 grain bullet at 3,000 FPS; making it the fastest, flattest shooting rimfire in the world. The cutting-edge Savage B.Mag was designed to deliver that blistering speed with all the accuracy of a Savage.

The Savage B.Mag features a completely new compact rimfire action with rear locking lugs as well as a cock-on-close bolt, while keeping the same thread-in barrel headspacing system as the rest of their centerfire rifles. A neat attribute of this firearm is the center-feed rotary magazine it utilizes, capable of holding up to eight rounds. Additionally, The B.Mag sports Savage’s praised Accutrigger, which is infamous for being light, crisp and easily adjusted without the use of any special tools. So if you are in the market for a lightening fast tack-driver that one can shoot all day on the cheap, look no further than the new Savage B.Mag 17 WSM."

Remington Police Magnums come with a parkerized finish on an 18"" barrel (as opposed to a Blued finish on an Express); feature a stronger sear spring and magazine spring; better extractor and ejector, and much more.

Shotgun has rifle sights and has been gone over completely by in-house Remington LE Certified Armorer. This shotgun goes for $650 new in the box if your are Law Enforcement.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.

Synopses of the variances are provided below.
870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.

Get it now, or miss out on the opportunity to own this pristine condition 'classic' Pre-Ban American manufactured AK.

If you know Ak's - you know that Arsenal makes the most expensive, and best, with the tightest tolerances - aside from ordering a custom AK from Rifle Dynamics... which can't be touched in this price range! This rifle is stamped Arsenal Las Vegas Nevada USA, is in pristine condition and currently owned by a gunsmith.

This Arsenal Pre-Ban SAM7A1R 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.

From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.

The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7A1R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, 2 30 round magazines, sling, and cleaning kit.

FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. AK scope rail. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.

SPECIFICATIONS Caliber: 7.62 x 39 mm Total Length: 927mm (36.5”) Barrel Length: 415 mm Weight without Magazine: 3.67kg (8 lbs.) Muzzle Velocity: 710 m/s Rate of Fire (practical): 40 rds/min Twist Rate: 1 in 240 mm Effective Range: 400 m Max Effective Range: 1350 meters/4430feet

There are a couple of very minute handling marks but nothing major to speak of. The P245 is no longer being produced and has been replaced by the American made P220 Compact. The P245 has a carbon steel, folded slide with a removable breech block while the P220 Compact has a milled slide without a removable breech block.

As shown it is fitted in a Choate Tool folding stock with a plumbed Ultimak Optics rail hand guard system. As includes a New USGI type Overton breech wood stock and hand guard, with oiler and sling(not photoed). 6 US made 30 round magazines, 8 Korean 30 round magazines, dust covers, pouches, and various USGI 15 round magazines. MAY include vacuum packed FMJ ammo in USGI bandolier with stripper clips with some offers.

The new barrel is a new unused and unissued USGI Winchester barrel through Riverbank Armory. Has been install properly to assure good head space and front to rear sight timing. The bore the tightest, cleanest that I have ever seen on a M1 Carbine. It was well worth the investment, makes the Winchester M1 Carbine a whole new machine it seems.


Sorry no picture of carbine in wood stock. To do so I would have to remove the sight rail which I have plumbed ( in line with the sight group and receiver). You all know what a M1 Carbine looks like with wood stocks anyway. I'll take pictures of the wood stocks for those interested. Their new, in great shape.

This is a USGI made M1 Carbine, made with forged steel and all USGI or US parts(minus the Korean mags). The upgrades are the polymer with steel reinforced stock mated with the Ultkmak aluminum optics rail. No changes or modification have been made to the carbine other then changing the stocks. The wood stocks are breech and by Overton. Changing the stocks can be done in minutes. The the Ultimak rail can be used with the wood stock. With the new USGI barrel it is very accurate. The optics rail and polymer folding stock are great enhancements to this carbine. This is not a soft steel Universal or other brand production. Loaded with modern HP ammo the .30 carbine is an excellent round in a small package

No import stamps, all new springs, all parts fit well, barrel passes head space on GO. No rust, Parkerizing is in good shape. Normal wear, no damage. NO CASH VALUE HAS BEEN DETERMINED ON THIS FIREARM AT THIS TIME.

Only reason I'm considering trading this firearm is that it isn't as condusive to left handed rifle shooting as other platforms."

Thompson Center barrel, very lite rifle, great recoil pad, Timmney designed adjustable trigger down to 3lbs I believe. Realtree camo stock design. 
This gun groups amazing with Remington Core-Lokts, I tried 165 and 180grain bullets. At 100yds with the 165 Grains I had 3/4 inch 3 shot group for the first 3 shots and for the 2nd 3 shot group I was still under an inch. I  believe If I had been using my Caldwell rest and not a table and a jacket as a rest it would have been more consistent and tighter.  It comes with the following:
Super sling: $18 Walmart
Weaver Rings: $15.00
S&W: Plastic and foam lined gun case.
Nikon Buchmaster: 4.5-14x40mm with Adjustable parallax. I was around $320 new at Cabelas + shipping. Scope is in excellent condition. Possibly a tiny brush scratch but optics are perfect! I would give the scope a 9.5 out of 10. As well as the gun. A tiny bit of paint blurring on the bolt workings and inside of action.

With listed extras this gun Was over $850 dollars. I ordered this gun new through a FFL gunsmith from a gun distributor who had them on sale brand new. I paid $450 which was over $250 off the original retail price.

I am wanting $625 obo, 
Already over a $225 dollar loss from the original purchases prices of gun and accessories. I am okay with that loss and am willing to do trade or part trade on Silver, gold,(at spot,) possibly ammo, other firearms. I would like a 10/22 preferably older models but I am flexible, also looking for AK, AR,  Mossy 500 defense or tactical, .357, .38, Taurus 1911, other 1911. I have cash and 17 morgan silver dollars and a couple other guns to add to the right trade if there is a diffence in value and I am interested. Open to other offers, run it by me. 

My only complaint about this rifle is that it only feeds reliably with 3 cartridges in it. It can hold 4+1 but the way the shells stack in the mag well it appears that they line up incorrectly with more than 3 in the gun and the bolt attempts to bypass the cartridge or occasionally double load when you have 4 or 5 in the gun. 
However, I didn't mind hunting with three cartridges and I read that maybe it will change as the spring is used and broken in or it will cycle better with different cartridges or handloads?

Rifle is well used but in good shape. Needs either a gas tube or gas block replacement ($70 max p/l) as it isn't fully ejecting. Fires the first round, sometimes 2 or 3, and then won't eject.

This Remington Sendero is perfectly dipped in Digital Camoflage along with the Nikon 3-9x50 scope that sits atop this precision tool. This is a like brand new Remington model 700 Sendero SF in 7mm Rem Ultra Mag. It has a jeweled bolt and stainless fluted heavy (bull) barrel. The action has been worked by a gunsmith (he trued the bolt face, smoothed the action, lapped the lugs). The trigger is crisp and clean. This rifle is as good as I've seen. With the right ammo combination, I have personally shot virtual one holers at 100yds and I am no specially trained shooting machine...This rifle is better than me and capable of sub 1.25 moa at 200yds without a problem. This firearm would be as comfortable hunting elk or mule deer at 500yds as it would be hunting deer or bear at 150yds 

Remington describes her as this:
The Model 700 Sendero SF provides all the elements of Remington's most advanced varmint rifles in long-range big-game calibers. The stainless-steel action and free-floating 26"" varmint-profile barrel are bedded in a aramid fiber reinforced fiberglass stock with an action-long bedding block. The fluted barrel provides maximum rigidity while shaving a half-pound in weight. The Model 700 Sendero SF is perfectly designed for measured, long range shooting."

This rifle was glass bedded for ultimate accuracy potential.  The gunsmith test fired it after it was set up...so this rifle is brand new with only one round fired.

My total investment in this rifle is just under $1700....the Manners T4A stock alone costs $750.

The price has been dropped several times....I'm pricing it to sell at $1160.00.

I'm losing a lot of money on this rifle in order to start another rifle build...my loss is your gain...and like I said before - this is a brand new rifle that has only been test fired once by a professional gunsmith in order to make sure everything works/functions after it was built up with the new stock.

For sale is 100 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. 
I do have more of this ammunition if you would like up to 800 rounds.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Receiver is hard coat anodized. Bore's surface is coated with dry film lube. Carbine length. The carrier assembly is phosphated 8620 steel with a Carpenter 158 type bolt.

I've always owned guns, just never been familiar with this platform. I had been considering buying an Ar for years, then the scare happened last year and I freaked out not knowing if I would ever be able to get one, so I set out looking to buy anything and everything Ar related. I bought all this stuff as a lot from a guy that works with my friend because I work a lot and I don't have time to go wait on stores to open so I can get ammo, mags, and guns. I knew I was probably paying too much, but given the circumstances, I bought this stuff anyways. I bought this lot of exactly as I'm selling it, except for putting approximately 200 rounds through the Delton using a friends lower and throwing in some ammo. I'm in over my head trying to pay for it with accumulating bills and Christmas approaching, so I'm selling in hopes that once I pay everything off, I can buy a complete rifle that I can afford."

An ingenious design, it really surpassed the standard Martini in that its entire action was removable as one unit for ease of servicing or exchange. Production however caused massive logistic problems and by 1894 the Ghurkas were dangerously short of viable .450 cal. breechloaders to face ever growing threats from the east. Finally the British came to the rescue with a delivery of several thousand Martini short lever rifles in late 1894 and even more long lever Martini Rifles in 1908. The over complicated Gahendra Rifle was thereafter basically shelved, the void in up-to-date arms having been met.

Some people complain about the availability of ammunition, but I can always find it around the same price of .45 ACP online (check out http://www.gunbot.ne...o/pistol/45gap/).

I have a bit of a screaming good deal for 10mil fans here. It's 500 rounds of Prvi Partisan PPU (their high end line) 180 grain jacketed hollow points in 10mm. This is fresh new production ammo. And thankfully as 10mm folks know, this isnt ""FBI Lite"" or the pointless lower power loadings of 10mm. This is full bore 13-1450fps stuff smile What's the point of having a 10 and shooting 40 power rounds thru her, right? Most 10mm in shops is $30-$40 a box IF you can find it and for BALL ammo! Mine is exactly $25 a box. $250 for all 500 rounds. Come and get it! Local pickup only. No shipping. Thanks for looking

38 Super Race Gun. STI Frame, Caspian slide, Tasco pro-point, Tapered Hybrid barrel, delrin guide rod, Ed Brown grip safety, ambi thumb safety. Frame has been slimmed and stippled. Custom serial number. 

Gun was built by Atlanta gunsmith but can't remember his name. I'm sure the gun has close to 2000 rounds through it and shoots great. VERY low felt recoil.

This was my competition gun back in the 90's and I paid close to $2000 for it. It's been all around the country shooting IPSC and steel matches. Not shooting competition anymore so I'm hoping someone else can put it to use. You could convert the gun to 9mm with just a barrel and ejector swap. 

7 mags are included as shown in pics. I don't remember the exact capacities but the longer ones are 24-27 rounds and the shorter ones are 17-19 round.

If you reload, I have plenty of 38 Super brass I will include at an additional charge.

These are a steal! Even if you dont get mine, definitely try on a new Ruger American Rimfire! I cant say good enough things about them. Almost seems unfair with their timing, really. After selling the way overpriced 77/22 bolt rifle for 20 years, they come out with this for a third of the price! And borrowed (or blatently robbed) some of the best features of Savage bolt rifle and made them better. Considering the rifles sell for $350-395 out the door, it is insane what you get for the dollar. Mine is the 22LR full size version with full LOP and 22"" gorgeously blued barrel. All of the models including mine have the following features. Heavy bolt action with Tang safety, fiber optic front and black blade rear iron sights, medium taper sporter barrel (fairly thick actually), composite stock with finger wells and fully free floated and Accu bedded action and stock, target crown, uses awesome ruger rotary or banana mags, has a nice, light fully adjustable ruger accutrigger (even lighter) and includes two swappable butt stock pieces. One with a high comb for scoped use and one straight comb for open sights.
On mine you also get a redhead soft shoulder pad sling, 4 magazines total (2-rotary 10 mags & 2 BX-25 banana mags), 2 weaver #12 scope bases installed, Warne tactical Optima Black hidden head rings (the lowest mount for a 40mm scope) & you get a brand new Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40mm scope! This is the new version with tactical thumb adjustable turrets beneath oversized knobs. The older prostaff rimfires were 32mm and had finicky small knobs. This one dials in quick and stays tight. This also has the new rimfire II reticle with 75-125 drop adjustments in the reticle. I have just dialed her in nicely. There's exactly 65 rounds rounds thru her since I got it new two weeks ago. Does great with ALL ammo! Tried around 10 rounds of 6 kinds of ammo. From CCI to SK match. The 100 yard target from my first session after boresighting it is in the main picture. Im not an amazing rifleman, but this rifle makes it easy. I have over $690 invested in her on the nose. (gun $330, weaver mounts $20, warne rings $45, sling $20, scope $150, two extra bx 25 mags $70, one extra 10rnd mag $20, tri star mag coupler $15 & Soft case $20 = $690)

It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it. I still have the mount so if you have some American optics you can use it. The drag bag I have it in was issued to me during my tour to Afghanistan and my supply guy didn't want it back. The rifle is with my father In-law in E-town because I'm overseas. I'm willing to except money, and guns or a combination of the two. Please don't come at me with a piece of crap and then flag my post as spam when I'm not interested. The picture of me and the drag bag is old but that's it. It's painted now though. The tan was standing out a little. Here's all the stuff that my father-in-law has:
(1) PSL-54C chambered in 7.62x54R
(1) PSO-1 Romanian 
(1) Mosin Negant from Tula 
(1) drag bag
(1) bushnel range finder ~900m

About the “Black Gold” Trigger: We are very proud to announce that we’ve selected the American Trigger Corporation AR Gold trigger to be installed in LaRue PredatOBRs going forward. These are a single stage trigger with take-up and a super short reset, similar in feel to a best-grade 1911 trigger, providing the optimum trigger action for a wide variety of shooting styles and disciplines. AR Gold Triggers have been used by some of the best competition shooters in the world for the last few years and dominate the top of the 3 Gun competition world. We have been testing and evaluating these triggers for well over a year, to ensure that they're up to our standard of quality. Our evaluation has shown the AR Gold to be magnificent and we're proud to include them as part of our new product line. One thing that is unusual about these triggers installed in our LaRue PredatOBRs, is they are treated with an IonBond black instead of American Trigger’s normal IonBond Gold. This is a custom color that is only available on LaRue Tactical rifles.  Retail for the standard AR Gold trigger is $280."
