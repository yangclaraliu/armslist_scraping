Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. The conventional double-action/single action models have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. Call Rick at 941-224-6895."

I also have a extra screw on mount.  It has the ability to produce either 125 lumens for 60 minutes or 225 lumens for 20 minutes with a optional high output bulb. It also has two white LED navigation lights which have their own pressure switch. The light can be turned on either by squeezing the pressure pads on the vertical grip, which are ambidextrous or if you want it to be turned on permanently you can bypass the pressure pads and keep it on indefinitely. 

It runs on three SF123 lithium batteries which can hold their charge for as long as ten years. The light is in like new condition and has never been used, it was only mounted on a my AR15 and then placed in the safe. I will include 3 new batteries with it, so you can use it right away. These lights are sold for anywhere from $450 to over $500 retail, but I am offering it for $250. 

I prefer a cash transaction in the Fuquay Varina area, but will ship it to anywhere in the US if you pay the shipping. I will accept PayPal, money order or cashiers check.

Comes with a 7 and an 8 round magazine (both plus 1 in the chamber).

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9MM for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

What, you don't believe in a free market? If people don't want to pay their prices, the pawn shop loses business, then loses profits., then goes out of business. That's their problem if they do. If a customer pays more for an item at store 1 vs going to store 2, thats their problem for not comparing prices,  which can be as easy as picking up the phone and calling both stores. If you really wanted to make a difference with your post, why not just advertise which store has better pricing and include a price comparison between both stores?

This is an early transitional model, as it was stamped Deutsche Werke Aktiengesellschaft - Berlin and has the HO insignia on the wood grips.

The gun is in great shape, with the most of the wear existing as some bluing loss at the high edges, as seen in the photos. The rest of the bluing is intact and smooth. The gun functions fine, including the grip safety that prevents the trigger from being pulled while extended. The bore is fine."

Had a deal set but the buyer bailed.

This is #53/100 of the original Colt Pony Automatic. Only 100 of these were made. These pistols were manufactured by Colt in a factory based in Washington D.C. (Washington D.C. Firearms International). This pistol is a .380 and it shoots great. These pistols are extremely rare and highly sought after by Colt collectors that know a little Colt History. There isn't a lot of information known about these pistols and their manufacture because the D.C. factory they were produced in, was destroyed in the 1968 D.C. riots.

I have contacted Colt and I have received some interesting news about these pistols. These pistols were made for Colt because Colt was considering have their .380 handguns manufactured by another company, this did not end up happening. However, 100 of these pistols were made for Colt in the 60's and 11 of them were retained by Colt Firearms, the other 89 were given back to the D.C. company.

You know you have one of these rare pistols when the serial number on it begins with CPA (Colt Pony Automatic).

551,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2663551,For Sale:  380 Auto Standard Pressure Ammo 90 gr. JHP (1025 fps/M.E. 210 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Friday, February 7, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=218

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto standard pressure loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel.  We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads.

The Troy Industries Folding Rear BattleSight is a highly durable and accurate folding BattleSight used by Special Ops and tactical shooters across the planet. It features an easy to deploy, spring free system that stays locked in place thanks to a heavy duty stainless steel cross-locking system. To lower the sight, simply push a button to release the lock. When folded, these sights are very low profile, sitting at just 0.460 inches, allowing a wider array of optics to be mounted over it. When deployed they position both apertures at the same height as the factory irons. The mounting system is easy to use and does not cant on all military and aftermarket receivers. Adjusting the sight does not require any special tools! This sight must be mounted to a same-plane rail system.
The Troy Industries Rear Folding BattleSight is manufactured from 6061 T6 hardened aircraft grade aluminum with stainless steel components and MIL-SPEC hard coat anodized in matte black.

611,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2663611,For Sale/Trade:  SUV Gun / Storage Lock Box,"Columbus, Columbus, GA, Georgia",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 25, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling a Custom built SUV Gun & Storage Lock Box. It has 3 heavy duty slide out drawers (100lb heavy duty rated rollers) that have places for padlocks on them so you can store your Guns, ammo or valuables without worry. It was custom built for a '03 Nissan Xterra so it should fit in just about any SUV. It no longer has the rubber mat pictured on top but it would be easy to add one if desired. The top 2 drawers are the same size (28""Length X 17""Wide X 7""Deep) and both have a foam rubber thin pad to keep items from being scratched and to keep them from moving while driving. The bottom drawer (28""Length X 37-1/2""Wide X 6""Deep) has 2 full pieces of 1"" thick foam (the same used in a gun case) that are uncut so you can custom cut it to fit you guns and/or accessories in the foam. Or just leave them on top. 

The entire Box size is 30""Length X 41-1/2""Wide X 17-1/2""Deep. Has stainless handles and padlocks. If you purchased one this size new from a manufacture you would pay anywhere between $800 - $2,000 so this is a good deal if you're looking for one. I have around $250 in material invested in it plus the aggravation, I mean ""pleasure"", of designing and building it. It's heavy duty and built to last using high grade pressure treated / water sealed lumber. I sold the xterra and have had it covered in storage since. 

This thing is great for Law Enforcement personal vehicles, preppers or for hunting. Well built, sturdy lockbox. Would work as well in the bed of a truck if bolted or strapped down. 

Asking $500 cash or trade for firearms/ammo. Open to reasonable offers.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

BROWNING SILVER SPORTING MICRO 12 GA. SHOTGUN
Receiver: Lightweight aluminum alloy   Barrel:  Lightweight 28"" Silver Finish
Five flush-mounted chokes
Walnut gloss finish
Adjustable comb & butt plate
Silver. A shining example of performance, quality and real value. The name Browning is synonymous with no-nonsense, high-performance autoloaders having superb finish and unmatched handling. And with an easily recognizable semi-humpbacked receiver silhouette, Browning’s Silver shotguns perfectly honor that historic legacy. Sharing the same proven Active Valve gas operation as the Gold, the Silver is one of the softest recoiling and easiest shooting guns available today, delivering up to a 50% decrease in felt recoil over the competition. The Active Valve also makes the Silver one of the most versatile and reliable shotguns around, able to fire a wide range of factory loads under the most extreme conditions. Back-Bored Barrel Technology ensures your shot patterns are tight, dense, even and consistent, and provides an additional reduction in felt recoil. See your Browning dealer and pull the trigger on a new Silver today.  
Less recoil with the Active Valve
The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system in the Silver autoloaders uses gas from fired shells to operate the action instead of contributing to recoil. When shooting light loads, most of the gases operate the action. With magnum loads, only a small amount of gas is necessary to operate the action, while the remaining gases are vented through the Active Valve and out the top of the forearm and away from the receiver for clean, reliable operation. Because the gas piston and Active Valve operate independently, less pressure is exerted on the gas piston for greater longevity and more efficient operation than other gas-operated autoloaders. Because the Active Valve expels unnecessary gases, it naturally reduces felt recoil before it ever reaches your shoulder — without the need for heavy hydraulic recoil dampers, sticky gel pads and gimmicky gel stock inserts. Superior recoil reduction from the Active Valve also equals faster, more accurate follow-up shots and all-day shooting comfort regardless of the loads used.
Load Versatility
The Active Valve-equipped gas piston automatically adjusts to reliably fire a wide range of loads. 12 gauge 3"" models fire everything from light, 1 oz., 2 3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The larger 3 1/2"" version is built to handle a similar range, from 1 1/8 oz., 2 3/4"" field loads up to hard-hitting 3 1/2"" magnums.
Trigger
Gold-colored. The trigger guard is large and has carefully rounded edges to accommodate gloved fingers. Additionally, the Silver’s trigger assembly can be removed in seconds for cleaning.
Back-Bored Barrels
Silver shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.
Magazine Capacity
2 3/4"": Four in magazine, one in chamber. 3"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. 3 1/2"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. A three-shot magazine adapter plug is included.
Choke Tubes
Silver shotguns include the interchangeable Invector-Plus™ choke tube syst

BROWNING SILVER SPORTING MICRO 12 GA. SHOTGUN
Receiver: Lightweight aluminum alloy   Barrel:  Lightweight 28"" Silver Finish
Five flush-mounted chokes
Walnut gloss finish
Adjustable comb & butt plate
Silver. A shining example of performance, quality and real value. The name Browning is synonymous with no-nonsense, high-performance autoloaders having superb finish and unmatched handling. And with an easily recognizable semi-humpbacked receiver silhouette, Browning’s Silver shotguns perfectly honor that historic legacy. Sharing the same proven Active Valve gas operation as the Gold, the Silver is one of the softest recoiling and easiest shooting guns available today, delivering up to a 50% decrease in felt recoil over the competition. The Active Valve also makes the Silver one of the most versatile and reliable shotguns around, able to fire a wide range of factory loads under the most extreme conditions. Back-Bored Barrel Technology ensures your shot patterns are tight, dense, even and consistent, and provides an additional reduction in felt recoil. See your Browning dealer and pull the trigger on a new Silver today.  
Less recoil with the Active Valve
The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system in the Silver autoloaders uses gas from fired shells to operate the action instead of contributing to recoil. When shooting light loads, most of the gases operate the action. With magnum loads, only a small amount of gas is necessary to operate the action, while the remaining gases are vented through the Active Valve and out the top of the forearm and away from the receiver for clean, reliable operation. Because the gas piston and Active Valve operate independently, less pressure is exerted on the gas piston for greater longevity and more efficient operation than other gas-operated autoloaders. Because the Active Valve expels unnecessary gases, it naturally reduces felt recoil before it ever reaches your shoulder — without the need for heavy hydraulic recoil dampers, sticky gel pads and gimmicky gel stock inserts. Superior recoil reduction from the Active Valve also equals faster, more accurate follow-up shots and all-day shooting comfort regardless of the loads used.
Load Versatility
The Active Valve-equipped gas piston automatically adjusts to reliably fire a wide range of loads. 12 gauge 3"" models fire everything from light, 1 oz., 2 3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The larger 3 1/2"" version is built to handle a similar range, from 1 1/8 oz., 2 3/4"" field loads up to hard-hitting 3 1/2"" magnums.
Trigger
Gold-colored. The trigger guard is large and has carefully rounded edges to accommodate gloved fingers. Additionally, the Silver’s trigger assembly can be removed in seconds for cleaning.
Back-Bored Barrels

Five flush-mounted chokes
Walnut gloss finish
Adjustable comb & butt plate
Silver. A shining example of performance, quality and real value. The name Browning is synonymous with no-nonsense, high-performance autoloaders having superb finish and unmatched handling. And with an easily recognizable semi-humpbacked receiver silhouette, Browning’s Silver shotguns perfectly honor that historic legacy. Sharing the same proven Active Valve gas operation as the Gold, the Silver is one of the softest recoiling and easiest shooting guns available today, delivering up to a 50% decrease in felt recoil over the competition. The Active Valve also makes the Silver one of the most versatile and reliable shotguns around, able to fire a wide range of factory loads under the most extreme conditions. Back-Bored Barrel Technology ensures your shot patterns are tight, dense, even and consistent, and provides an additional reduction in felt recoil. See your Browning dealer and pull the trigger on a new Silver today.  
Less recoil with the Active Valve
The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system in the Silver autoloaders uses gas from fired shells to operate the action instead of contributing to recoil. When shooting light loads, most of the gases operate the action. With magnum loads, only a small amount of gas is necessary to operate the action, while the remaining gases are vented through the Active Valve and out the top of the forearm and away from the receiver for clean, reliable operation. Because the gas piston and Active Valve operate independently, less pressure is exerted on the gas piston for greater longevity and more efficient operation than other gas-operated autoloaders. Because the Active Valve expels unnecessary gases, it naturally reduces felt recoil before it ever reaches your shoulder — without the need for heavy hydraulic recoil dampers, sticky gel pads and gimmicky gel stock inserts. Superior recoil reduction from the Active Valve also equals faster, more accurate follow-up shots and all-day shooting comfort regardless of the loads used.
Load Versatility
The Active Valve-equipped gas piston automatically adjusts to reliably fire a wide range of loads. 12 gauge 3"" models fire everything from light, 1 oz., 2 3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The larger 3 1/2"" version is built to handle a similar range, from 1 1/8 oz., 2 3/4"" field loads up to hard-hitting 3 1/2"" magnums.
Trigger
Gold-colored. The trigger guard is large and has carefully rounded edges to accommodate gloved fingers. Additionally, the Silver’s trigger assembly can be removed in seconds for cleaning.
Back-Bored Barrels
Silver shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.
Magazine Capacity

2) forward grip
3) diamond head flip up BUIS 
4) Trijicon 1x24 reflex ACOG 
5) premium stock with additional space for storage

Typically the rifle without these additions retails for about $1600-1700 when you can find them. Since the Rock River piston system doesn't require a buffer tube the entire stock is now available for storage. For example if you have a small Tac light you can put that where the buffer would have been, throw in a couple of extra batteries and keep them with you while keeping your AR as streamlined as possible until you need that light, or laser or whatnot. Maybe the coolest part is that the absence of the buffer lets the stock fold. The RRA folding system doesn't interfere with charging or firing the gun in either position, locks solidly and deploys quickly. It also has a 2 position gas block so that if you're in a field situation, as round count and fouling increase, you can change to HIGH to allow more gas to drive the piston. This keeps you firing when standard gas op ARs may have failed. There are a lot of cool features to this AR, and Rock River is an excellent manufacturer. Since I can't stand folks who say ""I don't need to sell, just seeing what's out there"" I'll try to be more specific. I'm interested in cash, precious metals, and other quality firearms. Sig 226 family in 9mm, lever action .22s, and other quality ARs get preference, but all will be considered. Not all of the accessories listed have to go with the rifle (except the Tri Rail of course) so let me know what you have to offer and what you want and we can try to make a deal. Mags and Ammo are a possibility if needed. Thanks for reading. Pics on request. All offers get a response."

BROWNING SILVER SPORTING MICRO 12 GA. SHOTGUN
Receiver: Lightweight aluminum alloy   Barrel:  Lightweight 28"" Silver Finish
Five flush-mounted chokes
Walnut gloss finish
Adjustable comb & butt plate
Silver. A shining example of performance, quality and real value. The name Browning is synonymous with no-nonsense, high-performance autoloaders having superb finish and unmatched handling. And with an easily recognizable semi-humpbacked receiver silhouette, Browning’s Silver shotguns perfectly honor that historic legacy. Sharing the same proven Active Valve gas operation as the Gold, the Silver is one of the softest recoiling and easiest shooting guns available today, delivering up to a 50% decrease in felt recoil over the competition. The Active Valve also makes the Silver one of the most versatile and reliable shotguns around, able to fire a wide range of factory loads under the most extreme conditions. Back-Bored Barrel Technology ensures your shot patterns are tight, dense, even and consistent, and provides an additional reduction in felt recoil. See your Browning dealer and pull the trigger on a new Silver today.  
Less recoil with the Active Valve
The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system in the Silver autoloaders uses gas from fired shells to operate the action instead of contributing to recoil. When shooting light loads, most of the gases operate the action. With magnum loads, only a small amount of gas is necessary to operate the action, while the remaining gases are vented through the Active Valve and out the top of the forearm and away from the receiver for clean, reliable operation. Because the gas piston and Active Valve operate independently, less pressure is exerted on the gas piston for greater longevity and more efficient operation than other gas-operated autoloaders. Because the Active Valve expels unnecessary gases, it naturally reduces felt recoil before it ever reaches your shoulder — without the need for heavy hydraulic recoil dampers, sticky gel pads and gimmicky gel stock inserts. Superior recoil reduction from the Active Valve also equals faster, more accurate follow-up shots and all-day shooting comfort regardless of the loads used.
Load Versatility
The Active Valve-equipped gas piston automatically adjusts to reliably fire a wide range of loads. 12 gauge 3"" models fire everything from light, 1 oz., 2 3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The larger 3 1/2"" version is built to handle a similar range, from 1 1/8 oz., 2 3/4"" field loads up to hard-hitting 3 1/2"" magnums.
Trigger
Gold-colored. The trigger guard is large and has carefully rounded edges to accommodate gloved fingers. Additionally, the Silver’s trigger assembly can be removed in seconds for cleaning.
Back-Bored Barrels
Silver shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.
Magazine Capacity
2 3/4"": Four in magazine, one in chamber. 3"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. 3 1/2"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. A three-shot magazine adapter plug is included.
Choke Tubes

The Glock 21SF Generation 3 has some minor exterior design changes as
compared to the Glock 21. The Glock 21SF incorporates three changes. The
first is the ambidextrous magazine release, the redesigned magazines will
function in both designs, but the old magazines don't have the necessary
cut out in the front of the magazines to function in the redesigned
weaon.The magazine capacity didn't change: you still get 13 rounds of
.45ACP in the mag, plus one more in your chamber. The second the size of
the grip frame, it is noticeably thinner from the backstrap to the trigger
(Short Frame) . The third is the Glock Rail.

BROWNING SILVER SPORTING MICRO 12 GA. SHOTGUN
Receiver: Lightweight aluminum alloy   Barrel:  Lightweight 28"" Silver Finish
Five flush-mounted chokes
Walnut gloss finish
Adjustable comb & butt plate
Silver. A shining example of performance, quality and real value. The name Browning is synonymous with no-nonsense, high-performance autoloaders having superb finish and unmatched handling. And with an easily recognizable semi-humpbacked receiver silhouette, Browning’s Silver shotguns perfectly honor that historic legacy. Sharing the same proven Active Valve gas operation as the Gold, the Silver is one of the softest recoiling and easiest shooting guns available today, delivering up to a 50% decrease in felt recoil over the competition. The Active Valve also makes the Silver one of the most versatile and reliable shotguns around, able to fire a wide range of factory loads under the most extreme conditions. Back-Bored Barrel Technology ensures your shot patterns are tight, dense, even and consistent, and provides an additional reduction in felt recoil. See your Browning dealer and pull the trigger on a new Silver today.  
Less recoil with the Active Valve
The self-adjusting Active Valve gas system in the Silver autoloaders uses gas from fired shells to operate the action instead of contributing to recoil. When shooting light loads, most of the gases operate the action. With magnum loads, only a small amount of gas is necessary to operate the action, while the remaining gases are vented through the Active Valve and out the top of the forearm and away from the receiver for clean, reliable operation. Because the gas piston and Active Valve operate independently, less pressure is exerted on the gas piston for greater longevity and more efficient operation than other gas-operated autoloaders. Because the Active Valve expels unnecessary gases, it naturally reduces felt recoil before it ever reaches your shoulder — without the need for heavy hydraulic recoil dampers, sticky gel pads and gimmicky gel stock inserts. Superior recoil reduction from the Active Valve also equals faster, more accurate follow-up shots and all-day shooting comfort regardless of the loads used.
Load Versatility
The Active Valve-equipped gas piston automatically adjusts to reliably fire a wide range of loads. 12 gauge 3"" models fire everything from light, 1 oz., 2 3/4"" target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The larger 3 1/2"" version is built to handle a similar range, from 1 1/8 oz., 2 3/4"" field loads up to hard-hitting 3 1/2"" magnums.
Trigger
Gold-colored. The trigger guard is large and has carefully rounded edges to accommodate gloved fingers. Additionally, the Silver’s trigger assembly can be removed in seconds for cleaning.
Back-Bored Barrels
Silver shotguns feature Back-Bored Technology.
Magazine Capacity
2 3/4"": Four in magazine, one in chamber. 3"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. 3 1/2"": Three in magazine, one in chamber. A three-shot magazine adapter plug is included.
Choke Tubes

 There is 1 minor (very minor) scratch at the end of the barrel. Just disclosing every detail.  If not for this scratch I'd consider this a 10 out of 10.  I give it a 9.8-9.9 out of 10 thus why it's listed less than what I have in it.  Other than that this gun is 100% clean.

The smallest back strap is integrated in the Glock MBS frame reducing the
trigger distance of the standard size frame by approximately .08 in. The
medium back strap adds approximately .08 in. - equaling the size of a
standard frame - and the large back strap increases trigger distance by a
total of approximately .16 in. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is
reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to
switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional
parts. Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual
recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces
the felt recoil while simultaneously increasing the life span of the
assembly. Additionally, the Gen4 has a Rough Textured Frame (RTF) surface
designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as
the interchangeable back straps.
