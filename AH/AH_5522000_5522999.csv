It comes with everything it came with from the factory- Colt case, literature, and 2 stainless 6rd Colt magazines. I also have about 150rds of .380 ACP. The second pistol is a Sig Sauer P239 in .40 S&W. It is in good working condition, but the slide has a fair amount of holster wear in the usual places. It has night sights but they have become fairly dim. Comes with 2 7rd magazines, 50rds of .40 HP, and potentially an Alien Gear IWB depending on the deal.As the title explains, I'm looking to trade for a Sig Sauer P938. Finish type isn't too important but I'm looking for a model with wood grips and it must include all factory gear. Unless you have a higher end model (Equinox, SAS) I will expect some cash on top or I would also be interested in a basic AR upper without BCG or charging handle. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred.
