I bought this weapon for $ 700, not including the extra cost of the night sights, holster and extra magazines I have a lot into it. I thought about using it as a carry weapon but decided on a Sig 1911 model so this has been sitting in my safe. I did not write down how many rounds each time I shot it, but guessing between 200 and 400 rounds. You can tell by how clean it is and the barrel its not been shot much.

From the manufacturer.  Millett 6 - 25x56 mm LRS - 1 Tactical Illuminated Reticle Riflescope is the choice for the long - range hunter, tactical operator and target shooter who demand the best. Get features that usually come at a much higher price tag! Most riflescopes are built on a 1"" or 30 mm tube, but the Millett LRS-1 Long Range Rifle scope has a 35 mm tube for added strength, brightness and clarity. Perfect on heavy, hard-hitting, large caliber rifles. Each Millett Riflescope is computer tested under recoil to assure the highest quality. The LRS-1 scope is at home big game hunting in the West, target shooting at long ranges, or as a tactical riflescope for law enforcement use. And because 35 mm rings are hard to find - and expensive - they're included here! Serious scope for serious shooters: Huge 56 mm objective for a wider field of view and brighter image; Magnification: 6-25x; Objective diameter: 56 mm; Eye relief: 3""+; Tube diameter: 35 mm; Optics: Fully multi-coated for clear, bright, glare-free images; .1 Mil click illuminated glass-etched Mil Dot bar Matte finish."

These have been just about impossible to find for over a year! I was only able to secure 5 so once these are sold I do not know when more will be available. If you want one for your next build I suggest you purchase ASAP. Free shipping for a limited time.

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The MUR comes in two models: one with a Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector and the second with a Shell Deflector only. Vltor offers the selection at the time of purchase, but does not offer a service to exchange the Bolt Assist or Shell Deflector. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart

This magazine is unique in that it holds 23 round of .40 S&W. Glock now makes a 22 round magazine but it was never made in 1994 so no pre-ban 22 rd mags exist. The benefit of this magazine extension is that it prevents over insertion in your Glock Model 22, with a grip sleeve this is also true with your model 23 and 27. You can also put 9mm in this magazine for a total of 27 rounds that drops free unlike the 33 rd non-drop free preban Model 18 magazines.

The barrel is a 28"" stamped ""Made in Belgium"" and was imported into St. Louis, MO. Although the barrel is the right type of barrel for this shotgun from around the same time period, it is not the original factory barrel to the shotgun. It is fairly common for the barrel and shotgun receiver to have different serial numbers.
The barrel has a B78029 serial number (B indicating 12ga) and I believe was manufactured somewhere between 1940-1946.
This is a beautiful shotgun, in very nice condition.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Single action/ double action, it is chambered in .38 Special, this is the classic ""cop"" revolver.

In the 70's, Taurus aquired tooling from Smith and Wesson, and this is the product of that aquisition. Based on the later S&W Model 10, and all but identical in appearance, the Taurus Model 82 was the standard issue firearm for police in Brazil, and is still in use with the Chilean uniformed police as well as the Indonesian National Police.

This gun is a great shooter. Shiny bore, good crown, and the cylinder still lines up perfect. Functions and performes as it should. Shows signs of spending time in a holster, blueing has some wear, but the gun is in very good shape for its age.

I am asking $300.00, included is 50 rounds of Blazer .38 Special.

Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Our semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Will not operate with AK 47 mags.

Comes with Five 30 rd. mags.
Bayonet, Cleaning Kit and Mag Pouch
Barrel: 16.25"" with a 1:9.5 twist
Overall: 27"" (stock folded), 35.5"" (stock extended)

About a year ago I decided to put slim grip bushings on it myself. When I tried to, I ended up striping the grip bushing threads on the frame of the pistol. Apparently this is a frequent occurance because Brownells sells a kit to re-thread oversized holes and put new bushings in. I have the kit and I am selling it with the gun ($50 value). I was going to send it to a gunsmith and have them do it and then turn around and sell it for 575 but I have not had the time. If you can re-thread it using the kit, my loss is your gain. I have read several blogs and those who have done it recommend you use some type of drill press so that you drill the new threads straight. I misplaced the 4 grip screws. They cost about .50 a piece or you might already have some spares. Other than that, the pistol works great. 

The front sight is a little loose. It was like that when I bought it new, It has never been a problem and the way springfield installs it, it will not fall off. Like I said, I've put just shy of 200 rounds without a problem. 

I have sold several guns in the past and I am always overly honest. I believe that the buyer, who might use the gun for protection, needs to know what he is getting. It is important to me that you stay happy with what you purchase. If you have any questions you can txt Michael at REDACTED. Please, If it is after 10pm, wait tell the morning (8am). Thanks"

It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.  The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. 

The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap.

The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly.

The A2 BUIS is always at the tactical ready once placed in the up position. The sight cannot be folded down without depressing the spring assisted detent release button located on the left side of the sight base. This totally eliminates the possibility of accidentally lowering the sight.

The A2 BUIS can be used as a stand-alone sight or in conjunction with one of our interface rails. The A2 BUIS can be used as a co-witness iron sight with most red dot sighting systems. Weighing in at just over two ounces, this sight features the standard military A2-style double peep aperture which allows for end user known point of impact. The sight has full windage adjustment with standard military windage knob and windage screw. No need to retrain when using this sight. One click of the windage knob provides approximately 0.48 MOA change when mounted on the M16A2E4 rifle and about 0.65 MOA on the M4 carbine. Initial zero is set by adjusting the weapons front sight post. It is low profile so that when in the down position, it will clear most optics. The mount body and sight stem are manufactured from billet 6061 T6 aluminum alloy and Type III hard coat anodized in a non-reflective black mil spec finish to provide combat durability. All steel components are black manganese phosphated per mil spec. Used by elite armed forces and law enforcement teams word wide."

It's more accurate than I am and has been incredibly reliable. 

The handguard is a 12"" Samson Evolution Modular Rail Free Float Handguard and comes with a 4"" and 2"" picatiny rail section and a QD sling swivel adapter. I'm also including a bipod stud from Samson Manufacturing that sits flush with the rail, no bulky adapter required. As a result you can leave the bipod stud in at all times without any distractions  and no extra weight.  

The barrel, bolt carrier, and piston system have a proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment which keeps the chamber clean and cool even when using dirty ammunition. The proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment to the barrel provides an extremely hard, slick surface on the steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion, extending a barrel's service life by reducing friction produced during firing. Also, the treatment converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. 

The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil.

All this combined with the Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Why should you get a Permit to Carry?
You should get one so that you can defend yourself and loved ones from the numerous ""bad guys"" out there that prey on the law abiding citizens. Most violent encounters are over within a minute and the typical police response is greater than 5 minutes. Some people believe that the only people that get a Permit to Carry are ""gun nuts"" or ""wanna be cops"" That is far from the truth. People who get their Permit to Carry are regular people that want to be able to take responsibility for their own safety and security. They are Doctors, Lawyers, blue collar workers, bankers, computer programmers, accountants, retirees and housewives.
Gun Ownership is a serious responsibility and the use of deadly force is a very serious matter and so is protecting yourself and loved ones. Do you know what Minnesota's Use of Force Laws are? Even if you do not want to get your Permit to Carry or even carry a firearm, you should still get training in the safe handling of firearms and the laws of self-defense.

If you need a gun for the shooting portion of the class I will have guns available for free. 

This class is good for the Minnesota Permit to Carry and also Florida, Arizona, Maine, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan Non resident permits.
With the Minnesota Permit to Carry you are legal to carry in up to 23 States. With the Non-Resident Permits you could get up to 35 states."

US Gov't ordered 20,000 of these precision target rifles for smallbore competition.   They then left them in the packaging until someone decided to inventory them by slashing open the package with a razor knife.   This is the signature of the kimber 82G is a thin razor-groove cut in the stock. 

The 82G is a single-shot, 1-in-16 twist, Heavy Competition barrel (25"") bolt action firearm.  It was built to the standard of being sub-MOA rifles.  The butt stock is adjustable for Length of Pull and all spacers are included.  stock is walnut and has some beautiful tiger-striping that doesn't really show in the pictures.   Sling swivel is adjustable to the shooter.  SIghts are anschutz at 1/5MOA per click.  Trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs but is fully adjustable for takeup,  pullweight and overtravel.   It breaks like glass.

If you are looking to get into smallbore competitive shooting, this is simply the least expensive way to get in without dumping 1400 bucks into the lower-end anschutz rifles. 

This rifle is UNFIRED.   It was bought as new (non-rusty) from the CMP when they still had these.  The stock HAS NO CUT IN IT.   This one was hand selected from the South Store in Anniston.  The finish and stock are flawless.   This rifle is unfired as I own several comp smallbore rifles.  I brought it home,  gave it a complete disassembly,  cleaned it thoroughly and put it back in the safe.   My photo skills don't do it justice.

Here’s some info from Larue: The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached. 

Nearly new with 250 rounds through it.

Troy ambidextrous safety selector  $55
Bravo Company charging handle $45
