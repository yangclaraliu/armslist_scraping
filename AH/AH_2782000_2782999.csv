This is not your inexpensive lower, but high quality manufacturing and product.Easily better than my personal Spike's, IMO. Don't waste your time or mine with lower offers- not interested! This isn't for everyone, but if you're going for a quality build, here's the 1st step.

There is a mild cylinder turn line from handling. The grips are flawless. I hate to have to say this, but about two inches back from the muzzle, the bore has a very tiny patch of super light rust frosting. If I oiled the bore and had not told you, you MIGHT never have seen it. I can’t see it with my reading glasses, but I am in the habit of inspecting bores with a 5 X magnifying visor and I saw it. The bore was full of dust wads when I got it (really), and I suspect they held enough moisture over the years to cause it."

The bullet was created specifically for the 300 AAC Blackout, combining the popular 220 grain, open tip design with a new, flat base. A cannelure ensures consistent loaded length and allows the brass crimp to hold the bullet firmly in place, eliminating the possibility of bullet setback. The powder load was developed to provide reliable extraction and cycling in the AR-15, while keeping the bullet subsonic. Primers are sealed to ensure ignition in all weather conditions.

The result is a round designed to load into any AR-15 magazine, feed reliably, shoot accurately, and do it quietly. Fantastic for use with a suppressor.

I also want to sell the 250 rounds of Remington UMC, 50 rounds of Winchester and 25 rounds of Hornmandy Critical Duty ammo I have for it. 
$ 595.00 for the pistol - $700.00 for the pistol and ammo, thats  $ 200.00 of the new price"

 Seal Line Cascade 56L Military Assault Dry Bag ILBE NEW
 Seal Line ILBE (Improved Load-Bearing Equipment) Sacks were designed in conjunction with the US Marine Corps to use as a water-tight liner for packs. ILBE sacks are made using a proprietary material that is exceptionally light and durable.

It's got a polished Glock barrel, minor holster wear on the back of the slide, otherwise in great shape. It shoots any brand of round without a problem. It's never misfired, jammed, or been anything less than excellent. It is cleaned regularly, whether it's been fired or in the safe. It has a Hogue grip on it, and is otherwise totally original. I have three holsters with it, two are form fit, one is a universal (and I believe completely unused, no idea where I ever came up with it.) I have ammo I'd include with it for the right price, I'll throw one box in the package from the start though. The case is a large twin layer hard plastic case with foam inserts. I also have an aftermarket magazine that is a ridiculous 31rd mag for long days at the range and an uplula mag loader.
This gun is not new, and I'm not trying to represent it as such. It does have minor wear, less than you'd imagine for a gen 2. Its spent most of its life in a safe. I can send more pictures by phone or email. I'm asking 500 for everything listed above, 100 rounds of target ammo, and maybe a half box or whatever I have for hollow points.

I have no use for it and just want to trade it for something else. It was appraised by the same jewelery store who made/sold it, Solomon Bros Fine Jewelry in Buckhead, in May of 2013 for 5,700. I realize that's a lot of money and times are tough, I'm only asking for a multi-gun trade (number of guns depends on their value). I have the appraisal saved as a pdf and can email you a copy at your request. Take this opportunity to get rid of some of the guns that you never use anymore or some of the guns that caused the Mrs. to put you on the couch. I'm open to all offers but I'm more interested in handguns. let me know what 'cha got, worst i can say is no.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single Glock 41 Gen 4 .45 ACP Full-Size Pistol. The Glock name needs no introduction, and the 41 is definitely a beast in their line. Featuring the long 5.3″ barrel, this is ready for competition and target use. This also comes with the interchangable back strap system of all Gen 4 Glocks.



I only have ONE in stock, and it is priced to sell quickly for only $635.00 (cash price).



Glock PG4130103 G41 Gen4 45 ACP 5.31″ 13+1 Fixed Sights

The G41 Gen4 is a practical-tactical .45 caliber pistol designed to maximize sight radius while improving weight distribution and balance. It is built with a G34 slide width on a G21 Gen4 frame and is 1.5 ounces lighter than the G21 Gen4. The longer barrel and slide on the G41 Gen4 help to reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil, while the longer sight radius makes it more accurate for competition or duty use. The G41 Gen4 comes with all the standard features of the Glock Generation 4 pistol group, including the modular backstrap design, Gen4 rough textured frame surface and dual recoil spring assembly.

Round count is unknown, but I have put a lot through this gun. She loves CCI mini mags, but will for the most part, eat Remington goldens and CCI tacticals reliably. I've also sanded down the lip at the feed ramp a little and polished the ramp which helped feeding quite a bit for other brands. I can tell you that it will not eat aguila 22 of any kind or federal auto match.

synthetic stimulant. It is structurally similar to pyrovalerone (4
-Methyl-β-ketone-prolintane), except that it lacks the methyl group located on the phenylmoiety of pyrovalerone. α-PVP possesses the same basic structure as α-PPP (α-
Pyrrolidinopropiophenone) and α-PBP (α-Pyrrolidinobutiophenone). Whileα-PVP contains a
propyl group, α-PPPpossesses a methyl group whereas α-PBP has an ethyl group. Of the
three, α-PVP is expected to be the most potent due to its ability to cross the blood-brain
barrier. Like pyrovalerone, α-PVP is expected to act as a noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake
inhibitor (NDRI), therefore stimulating the central nervous system (CNS) and the

I'm just seeing if anyone out there wanted to trade a Cetme 308 for an AK.  (not interested in folding stocks!!)  My cetme has been sitting around for quite some time, I had intended on fixing her up and making it super pretty but.....it lays in my safe neglected.  Plus an AK would be cheaper to shoot.  I've put about 20 rounds through her and she kept hitting the shoebox so....it works.  It comes with 3 20rnd cetme mags.  I have HK mags for it but they do require some ""fitting"" to properly work.  Apexgunparts.com has actual Cetme mags for probably the best price I've seen.  I'd like to see this boom stick go to a good home....someone who can give her the respect and love and attention that I cannnot currently give her.  (it's in good shape though....it's not rusty or beat up....just old)
Let me know what you have.  Worst I could say is fanks but no fanks!
Shoot me an e-mail if your serious, I have a few pics.

Before you buy an AR that is ""CUSTOM"" AKA I built it myself and am selling it for $500 more than I have in it, do your homework and learn what is right and wrong.

 There are 2 AR's in Charleston and 1 in Columbia (that I know of) that have mismatched barrel/feed ramps. I have personally looked at them before purchasing and said no thanks. The pic listed is what to look for before you buy.

 Before you buy make sure you meet at a range and actually run a few mags through the rifle, you will save money in the long run.

 Also learn that a 223 barrel and a 5.56/223 barrel are not equivalent."
