Looking to do a private sale for one of these guns. I am an out of state student and am unable to purchase this handgun from a dealer without an Arkansas License. (Don't worry, not a Felon) I'll offer the average retail price if the gun is new - if it's used i'll want to negotiate a bit - but not significantly lower. Will depend on the condition of the gun. I can meet up whenever in the Fayetteville/Springdale/Rogers area to purchase the gun.

Please text me at 214-578-8041 anytime if you have one of these to sell. Thanks."

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1800 with scope or $1600 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

If you would are interested or would like more information you can reach me anytime here or by text/call at REDACTED.

Aimpoint CompM4 Reflex Sight is a rugged precision red dot Sight developed mainly for military and law enforcement applications.
Aimpoint red dot sights are designed for the ”two eyes open” method of sighting, which greatly enhances situational awareness and target acquisition speed. Thanks to the parallax-free design, the dot follows the movement of the user’s eye while remaining fixed on the target, eliminating any need for center- ing. Further, the Sight allows for unlimited eye-relief and is compatible with 1st , 2nd and 3rd generation night vision devices.
The CompM4 Sight is using a AA size battery, which together with the ex- tremely low power consumption gives an unequalled battery life.
The CompM4 combines the superior accuracy and ease of use of the well- known CompM2 model with significantly longer battery life and increased ruggedness through reinforced design.
The Sight is provided with a torque knob, Quick Release (QRP2) mount. An additional Carry Handle Gooseneck Rail needs to be mounted on the M16A2 carrying handle.
The Sight has a Spacer system that gives optimal height of the line of sight (optical axis) on different weapons."

Wood is in nice shape with a few scratches but none deep.  I put the scope mount and scope on it but I'll throw in the Williams peep site too.  Great brush gun and it functions flawlessly.  If you're looking for one, you know what it is.  They're getting difficult to find.  I'm including three full boxes of Hornady 265 grain, two boxes of Remington 240 grain and a partial box of Cor-Bon 305 grain rounds with the gun along with the 7 rounds in the sleeve.  There are a total of 114 rounds.  I won't separate the ammo from the rifle and sale is cash only, no trades.  You'll need to plan to pick up in Mauston and sign a bill of sale. Pictures modified (can only post 3).  No unusual wear to bluing, scope is a POS that I had laying around and threw on for the range once, take it or leave it, don't care but it doesn't have a brand on it and scoping it is unnecessary anyway.  No safety.  When it's decocked, it's safe.  Year of make is between 1972 and 1983 best I can tell based on the SN.  Ammo is $35-45 a box and was all purchased within the past year except the couple rounds of Cor-Bon.  It's all been stored properly.  Sorry, won't have time to answer a hundred e mails about the gun.  It's in very good shape with normal wear.  If you're interested, let me know."

Comes with padded soft case, a plastic box with about 20 rounds of ammo, and a bag of brass if you want it. I have a like-new leather sling to go with if I can find it.

Letting the set go for $450 to get out of here fast. The scope alone is $300 new. This is great for a kid's first deer rifle."

Barnett Vengeance

Personifying a steely resolve and determination, the new Barnett Vengeance crossbow is aptly named. The Barnett Vengeance represents a quantum leap in crossbow evolution. It is the first crossbow to combine a lightweight CarbonLite Riser with reverse draw technology. As a result, the Vengeance exhibits significantly less vibration and noise than a traditional draw crossbow without sacrificing speed or accuracy.

In this radical new reverse draw configuration, the limb pockets are moved closer to the trigger assembly and the limbs face forward on the bow, thus shifting the center of gravity closer to the shooter’s body. This drastically reduces the weight at the front of the crossbow, which is essential for a well-balanced shot.

In addition, the Vengeance features a CarbonLite Riser assembly, which further reduces the weight without compromising strength or accuracy. The most technically advanced riser ever created for a crossbow, the CarbonLite Riser removes approximately 43 percent of weight from the front end, which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. The combination of the reverse draw design with the CarbonLite Riser allows the Vengeance to provide the steadiest and most accurate shot possible.

Decorated in a carbon fiber finish or in a high-definition camouflage, the Vengeance is available through retailers as a complete package with crossbow, quick detach quiver, three 22-inch arrows and an illuminated 3x32 multi-reticle scope.

Like all other Barnett Crossbows, the Vengeance is proudly made in the USA.

Specs:

Speed: 365 fps.

Marlin 1894 Cowboy Limited ('JM' stamped 45 Colt w/ 24 inch octagonal barrel)

Thought this had found a long-term home with me, but things can change quickly when kids are involved. I picked this up in trade and it is in very good condition (as you can probably see from all the pics) but I have not had the pleasure of shooting it yet. I do not have the box or manual. 

It does have the 6-groove Ballard rifling many prefer for lead bullets and comes with the scope base shown. The base was on the rifle when I acquired it, so I do not have the original receiver screws. The iron sights are visible through the scope base, however.

The serial number begins with ""98"", which I believe indicates a 2002 production year.

Due to the number of pictures available, I have URLs for them at the bottom. (note: the pictures and links to pictures were removed once the rifle was sold)

Price: $750 FTF (Cash or USPS Money Order)

Travel: I would much prefer to stay right around South Bend / Mishawaka / Elkhart but I can drive a small amount for the right sale/trade. If headed south, my limit will need to be Argos. To the west (NWI) I can go over to LaPorte/Michigan City (US 20 & US 35, which is just off I-94 exit 40A) To the East, I max out in Goshen.

Shipping: I am open to shipping to your FFL for actual USPS shipping costs, provided they will accept the shipment from a non-FFL. I typically ship Priority Mail (Adult Signature Required) with insurance and can get you an estimated cost once you provide your FFL's zip code.

The photos will show the barrel numbers TE=1 , MW=0 (Duff). Exactly 16 rds (2 clips) have been down the tube with no FTF's,jams, or misfires. The gas cylinder and op rod piston both gauge good and the action passes with the badger ordinance timing block. With acceptable ammo, this baby is gtg!

The buttstock has an original DAS stamp with a circle P. Note the couple of photos showing the open trigger guard. This position is where resistance begins with respect to ""lock up"". It's not match grade tight, but also not sloppy. This is the type of stock that shows some use, yet you won't hurt your buddy (too badly) for putting an accidental ding in it at the range. Made from 100% USGI parts...no aftermarket parts whatsoever.

Full disclosure: there is a repaired crack in the rear hand guard just aft of the rear hand guard clip...see photo.

This shooter should serve you well and is slightly unique having the WRA receiver.

Any questions about makers of specifically marked parts, feel free to ask.

The barrel is PROPERLY broken in. I've put a few hundred rounds through it and it shoots like a dream. I love this rifle, but I need to get something for concealed carry. I also didn't want to spend the money for a surefire weapon light so I attached my old surefire helmet light to the rail. It's just as solid as any light mount with the added benefit of having an option of red or white light with three different intensity settings. The light alone goes for a few hundred bucks.

These Hungarian AMD 65's are the most underrated AK variants out on the market today. This particular variant is special since it comes with a much shorter chrome lined 12.5 inch original hungarian barrel with a 4 inch tack welded Hungarian Muzzle break. Surprisingly it is one of the most accurate AK's i've ever owned. I've shot about 50 rounds through it flawlessly. The receiver is an import SA2000M FEG TGI receiver from Hungary. Very high quality. This is one of the last imports on this particular rifle since now they are no longer being imported. Tapco G2 trigger on it as well as a hogue grip. It has a wire stock side folder. It is light weight and heavy duty. This is the perfect AK to sbr and have some fun with. Comes with original box, original handguards and grips. Also have a 125$ midwest industries tactical rail. The best you can get for an AK. Lots of mods out there for this rifle as well. Read the reviews about this rifle before trying to make any judgement calls on it. Thanks for looking
