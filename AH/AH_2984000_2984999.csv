I don't have the exact parts list with me since I'm at work but if somebody is really interested I will gather all of the receipts and compile a parts list for you.To the best of my knowledge off of the top of my head it consists of an Arch Angel stock, a Green Mountain fluted and weighted barrel, Volquartsen trigger internals (2 Lbs i believe or at least close to it), Extended mag release, a bolt buffer, 3-5 Ruger BX-25 Mags, 1 Clear Hot Lips mag, the factory 10 round mag, a blackhawk soft case, a cheaper BSA red dot(I think it is a BSA), I can also throw in a Crimson Trace Rail master flash light for the right deal, a forward grip that has a pucsh button bi-pod, and there may be more I am just winging the description while I'm at work. I have well over $1000.00 in this rifle.  I am going to place a value of $650.00 on this weapon but I am willing to negotiate on pricing and this is more than 40% off of the parts if found discounted online pricing. full retail parts pricing would be much more than the asking price. I will consider all reasonable offers. I am also willing to take multiple firearm trades or a lower value gun and cash. Please dont be shy and make an offer the worst that can happen is we disagree on the deal. Have a great day and I look forward to dealing with you.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh and hard to find Kahr CW380 sub-compact .380 acp pistols.  These awesome little pistols feature a lightweight polymer frame, stainless steel slide, 2.58 inch barrel, and come complete with a 6-round magazine.



I only have two in stock, and have them priced to sell for just $329.00 each (cash price).

Kahr CW380 Two-Tone .380 ACP Pistol on TooeleShootingSupply.com

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr’s seven patents including the “safe cam” action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

This requires a rifle with a longer range than any .22 caliber rifle is capable of.

This rifle was purchased new about 6 months ago and has fired approximately 300 rounds. It has been cleaned every time after a shooting event.

The operators manual specifies .22 caliber long rifle cartridges only as the semi-automatic needs that recoil to operate.

The Marlin Microgroove rifling makes this a very accurate rifle.

Extensive trigger work has been done by a local gunsmith. It has a DIP Inc. M60 Adjustable Trigger Kit and a McCarbo Trigger Spring Kit. The trigger now has a light and short pull. The original factory pull was about 6.5 lbs. and ¼ inch. The pull now is about 2.5 to 3.0 lbs. and 1/8 inch.

The trigger work  (springs and adjustable trigger) cost almost as much as the rifle did when new but has added much value for the serious shooter.

This has the original box and operators manual

This is a sacrifice price as I am asking considerably less than what I have in the rifle. My loss is your gain.

Call with any questions you may have. The price is somewhat negotiable but not much.

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™, “Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

Interested in compact/semi compacts. Glock, Beretta, XDM. Open to all calibers. Your trades need to also have night sights and be as spotless as mine is.

You need to be a law abiding citizen. Also, as I do not like guns falling in the wrong hands, I do not sell/trade/do gun related business with democrats.

God bless

Our incredibly popular Training Rifle has finally made it to the 455 platform. Chambered in .22 LR, the 455 Training Rifle shares the same popular features of its predecessor – it has the same 24.8” barrel, tangent rear sight (adjustable for distance) and beechwood stock with Schnabel forend.

The biggest difference is the ability to swap the barrel and/or stock, traits that all our 455s possess. An ideal rifle for introducing youth to the shooting sports, the Training Rifle is shipped with a 5-round magazine, but a single-shot adapter and 10-round magazine are available.

The CZ 02100 455 rifles are manufactured from steel billets not tubing or plastic, the barrels are hammer forged for accuracy and long life. The trigger is adjustable for weight, and the safety is located above the rear of the bolt and provides a positive firing pin block.

The Airweight Chief was available only in nickel, for those desiring a more durable finish, until a limited run of 637 with buffed alloy frames in 1989. By 1996, Smith & Wesson felt the heat from their Brazilian nieces and nephews marketed under the Taurus name, and began regular production of the first variant, 637-1, of the .38 Chiefs Special Ariweight Stainless, with steel barrel and cylinder and specially coated alloy main frame. The reconfigured, strengthened J size frame could also withstand +P ammunition. In 2002, Smith & Wesson added the internal lock, hence the 637-2 numbered model designation. Specs are traditional double- and single-action revolver with 5 shot cylinder capacity. Hammer and trigger are MIM, metal-injected-molded case colored, .312 wide smooth combat trigger and serrated spur hammer, .241 wide by .450 long spur. Weight empty is only 15 ounces, just 10% more than the rather pricey Air Lite M&P revolvers. Grips are pliable, sure-gripping factory boot grips, new style with stippled texture on both panels. Replacement pricing on these in our area is well over $500, if a person can even find one. We're offering the 637-2 in the photo, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 439.00 Transferable to eligible civilians in all jurisdictions of these United States.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

Im not the original owner so round count is unknown. there surface wear on the barrel from being shot but the inside of the barrel has a mirror like shine to it and there is absolutely no wear on the rails. The slide to frame fit is extremely tight with no play. May have been a police pistol at one point as there does look to be some holster wear on the frame and someone engraved 051 on the inside surface of the slide. The recoil spring is very strong making the slide stiff to pull back. Very accurate pistol. Will ship to an FFL.

I called Sig customer service and they confirmed it was made in 1998, has never been sent back to the Sig, and is not a Sig CPO

This requires a rifle with a longer range than any .22 caliber rifle is capable of.

This rifle was purchased new about 6 months ago and has fired approximately 300 rounds. It has been cleaned everytime after a shooting event.

The operators manual specifies .22 caliber long rifle cartridges only as the semi-automatic needs that recoil to operate.

The Marlin Microgroove rifling makes this a very accurate rifle.

Extensive trigger work has been done by a local gunsmith. It has a DIP Inc. M60 Adjustable Trigger Kit and a McCarbo Trigger Spring Kit. The trigger now has a light and short pull. The original factory pull was about 6.5 lbs. and ¼ inch. The pull now is about 2.5 to 3.0 lbs. and 1/8 inch.

The trigger work (springs and adjustable trigger cost almost as much as the rifle did when new but has added much value for the serious shooter.

Asking price is $140 for all 11. I would consider a trade for gold or silver coins (American preferred). Would also consider a trade for a new 5.56 BCG. They can be had around $120 so I figure that is a fair price. If you are interested email me through armslist. If you are from NY or NJ, sorry no sale.

Uberti reproduction 1847 COLT WALKER . 44 caliber made in Italy. STEEL FRAME with very nice CASE HARDENING showing. Only the trigger guard and front strap is brass.  It is the Highest Quality of the Walker Reproduction Revolvers.  IT IS A BIG HANDFUL. SAME SIZE, WEIGHT AND LENGTH AS ORIGINAL.  This Uberti  is the FULL SIZE 1847 WALKER, not the smaller Dragoon models that came later for the sissyboys.
Weight 	4.5 lb (2.06 kg)
Length 	15.5 in (394.7 mm)
Caliber 	.44 ball, revolver (.454 in., dia.)
Action 	single-action  

The metal technology used by Uberti is better than the the original Colt version had. I have been a Civil War Reenactor. for 54 years. I started in high school and still participate in the 5th U.S. Artillery. I carried and fired this Walker only a couple times. It is black powder, thus it does NOT have to be registered and can be shipped to you in any state.  I have only used Hogden Pyrodex RS powder to shoot and T-17 products to clean and lube it.  These are the same products I use in my .44 Remington Army black powder revolver and my ORIGINAL Springfield civil war musket and shotgun. (Yes, I regularly shoot the originals).  I shot 12 round balls out of the Walker and found it to be accurate enough to consistently hit a 2 liter jug full of water at 50 yards and it destroyed them!  Other than that I have used it at three reenactments, with Pyrodex, cleaning it immediately afterward.  There is some very faint scratching from being in the safe but it was difficult to make it show up in the photos because it is so faint.  I bought the Walker new.  It has 3 scratches on the bottom of the handle strap (see photo) in the metal.  There were there when I bought it from the dealer several years ago.  It has nice battle scenes engraved on the cylinder, just like the 1847 originals.  The modern stamps from UBERTI are underneath the lever so that they are not normally visible.   The gun looks totally like an 1847 original unless you know to open the lever and look under it.

Power to spare! The Gamo Hunter Sport sends pellets flying at 1,200 fps with PBA ammo. This rifle is a spring-piston breakbarrel gun and comes with a 3-9x40mm scope with a glass-etched mil-dot reticle (there are no open sights) and rings. The fluted bull barrel will make this rifle the envy of your friends.The well-balanced hardwood Monte Carlo stock has a raised cheekpiece on both sides, making this rifle truly ambidextrous. A ventilated rubber buttpad helps keep the rifle snugly in your shoulder while softening the recoil. The cocking effort is relatively light and may be suitable for some younger shooters (with adult supervision). You can customize the trigger let-off to your personal tastes, because the two-stage trigger is adjustable. When you cock the rifle, an anti-beartrap mechanism automatically engages to protect your fingers.If you use Gamo Raptor pellets, you will get maximum velocity from your rifle. If you use lead pellets, your velocity will be up to 1,000 fps. Important safety information
Ambidextrous rifle with 3-9x40 scope and rings. Up to 1,200 fps with Gamo Raptors and 1,000 fps with lead pellets."
