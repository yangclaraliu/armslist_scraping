The mechanics are in perfect working order and the gun has received the Remington factory updates. The bores are mirror bright.

The Remington 3200 has a reputation for being a reliable, durable and accurate shotgun and are highly sought after by collectors and shooters alike. This is a really outstanding example!!"

It is all stanless and has a synthetic stock. 

ALSO, it has a mounted Burris Signature Select (4x - 16x) 44mm ajustable objective with an ajustable reticle focus at the rear!

It comes with ~100 rounds of ammo (.300 win mag) - most is standard hunting ammo, but there is ~16 honady match rounds.

Also, it comes with the scope caps and leather/nylon strap


amount of use:
The left side of the stock (I am right handed, so the stock on the left side would be towards the body) has a few small scratches that under normal lighting you can't really even see. Also the Butt pad (there is a rubber type thick cusion that came on the butt) shows signs of normal 'use' from rubbing on clothing, etc.. I have taken this rifle hunting with me 3 times in 3 years. Other than that, I have taken it to the range 2 times in the last 3 years. I think I have shot about 4 (20 round) boxes of ammo in total That is the entirety of this gun's use.

Use Case:
This caliber gun is great for medium (deer, even coyote) and even large game (black bear) if you know what load/weight bullets to use. (this gun has the power!)

Accuracy:
The best I have gotten is 1moa out of this setup at the range, and I have not had the trigger adjusted (everything is factory). I believe that if you got a trigger job, this would be quite an accurate rifle (but that is all dependant on the shooter, of course).

Contact me via email for more photos if you want more.

Transaction will be done via a local gun store (if you are local, we can do the deal there, if you live to far, I will ship it to a ffl dealer from the gun store that does my bill of sale)"

CALL OR TEXT @ 864 313 512TWO!!! 

specific details: the gun was my usual carry pistol for about the past year or so, so it does have a little wear in the blue towards the muzzle due to high retension in owb padle holster. despite the fact that it was my usual carry pistol, ive fired less than 200rnds down range and the pistol internals reflect that greatly. cleaned after every use and otherwise about every week or two due to regular carry. 
Im going to ask $375 for the gun and holster together, and as i said, i can add cash or ammo or whatever for the right trade!"

I'm posting this first as a trade for a Glock 19 Gen 4 in FDE or OD Green. That is the ONLY trade interest I have. If you're going to ask for cash price, look up Glock 19 Gen 4 FDE or OD Green,( not ZEV models, just regular model Night sights a plus ) and the price for the Glock,  is what I'll need.

I got this on a trade a few years ago out in Oklahoma. It was built by Ken Hallock... Author of Hallock's .45 Auto Handbook. I HAVE NO PROOF of that, but don't value it at some ridiculous price anyhow. He added a different mainspring housing, adjustable sights, trigger and hammer... Besides that I'm really not sure. I had a gunsmith in South Carolina add the Wilson Combat ambi thumb safety. I still have the original if you prefer. I will tell you that I'm not happy with the work he did on the safety and I would replace it if I was going to hang on to this thing. IT DOES WORK, I just expected perfection for what he charged me. 

It really is a nice gun and a great shooter! I keep ""trying"" to love 1911's but it's just not happening for me.

Only thing worth mentioning is that there appears to be a little residual Loctite on the receiver around the rear base holes. It is not bad and will be completely covered by the rear scope base when added. Otherwise, an extremely clean W. German Varmintmaster in the more practical 22-250.

I actually had forgotten about this one and found it in the back of the safe. I bought it a couple years back and never did anything with it. There are a couple very minor spots in the finish of the revolver. The cylinder has some finish missing in a couple different places. Overall I would rate the gun at about 90% condition. Lock up is solid, ejector works fine. Adjustable rear target sight. Checkered target grip. Solid ribbed barrel. This one is a pre 999 model, Sportsman Double Action. From the little bit of research I did these were the first models made starting in 1932. In 1938 they began using number designations. These are going for outrageous prices on Gunbroker and at shows but I'm a little more realistic and have priced it to move. I have a simple leather holster for this as well, I will include it. Please, do not waste your time sending me lowball offers.

648,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2339648,For Sale:  Sig P229R .40 - 9 mags - 3 holsters,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,200","Listed On: Friday, November 15, 2013",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them. 

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever. 

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well. 

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment. 

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing."

Combine a tough, economic, totally reliable handgun with a handy strong and economic lock box and you get a secure and quick to use effective home security pack that most anyone can afford. As we all know many firearm accidents can be avoided by safe storage and Hi-Point leads the way in the handgun market by introduction of this safety/security Home Security Pack.

Hi-Point’s Home Security Pack comes with a forty-inch 1,500 pound test rubber covered steel cable that allows the box to be temporarily or permanently attached to a sturdier object if desired. The box also has holes for permanent attachment to a flat surface.

This is a highly-effective very affordable combination of reliability, power and safety that most homeowners can afford in today’s troubled times. This neat combo offers security whether at home, work, automobile, hotel or even shipped (unloaded of course) in an aircraft (meets TSA airline firearm transportation guidelines)."

This is a Westernfield marked Model 50. It's a semi auto that is tube fed through the butt stock. It is in overall very good shape with only faint fading of the bluing. One small spot on top of the reciever where the finish has been rubbed off, pea sized and no pitting. Reciever is grooved for rimfire scope mounts. Iron sights are intact, including the hood over the front sight that has changeable flip up posts. At some point someone had a reciever sight on this rifle and they inletted the stock slightly to accomodate. They didn't do a bad job. (This model came with holes to fit the factory Mossberg sights- it just didn't come with one installed.) Trigger guard is original and not warped. old Mossbergs are getting harder and harder to find in decent shape, don't miss out."

It quickly earned a reputation as 'hell-for-stout', and has proven to be far more durable than its vintage competition.  

This is a solid, well built revolver.  This is the more popular stainless steel version (what we need in Oklahoma). The six inch barrel, adjustable rear sights and high visibility front ramp sight make it great for target shooting.  It's got the Houge type rubber grips, which were very popular in the day.  Twenty to thirty years ago, the first thing you did to your new .357 revolver was remove the factory wood grips and install custom Pachmayer or Hogue rubber grips.

I sold my original Security-six and bought a GP100 when they came out.  It was a good gun, but I sold it, and though it took me a couple of months, I bought my Security-six back.  I kept it for over 25 years, and it's now being enjoyed by my nephew, a deputy sheriff.

This is my second Security-six.  I've not used it much at all.  This gun was made in 1982.  Its not a 'safe queen', but it hasn't been abused.  It's in nice shape.

This gun will do nicely with gentle target loads in .38 special, and it will safely handle the most powerful .357 magnum round you care to shoot, and everything in between. 

At my age, I have the guns I want.  I don't deal in guns;  I buy to keep and use.  Things have changed for us, so I am letting my guns go to family, friends or the market.  There are a lot of cheaper guns on the market.  Perhaps you've learned, as I have, that its better to buy quality the first time, and you'll enjoy it from now on.

No trades, thanks.  I'll entertain offers once you've examined this gun and made your evaluation.  This gun is equal or superior to ANY.357 made today, so don't waste our time with silly low offers.  If you only want to pay for a Taurus, go get one; You won't get a Ruger for that price  --  or you won't get mine anyway.

The gun is available as long as this listing is up."

Runs flawlessly with any ammo you run. It has the much sought after Imbel receiver imported (but not screwed up) by CAI. 21'' bi-pod cut barrel, Short flash hider (have original), quad rail currently on it but comes with two additional sets of furniture (one set camo, the other original), 9 20 round steel mags. Has had recoil and gas piston springs freshened up. 

It is currently FDE and has a few MINOR flaws concerning the finish. Could get it Duracoated or ceracoated locally for $150 so I don't really consider it a problem. I like it because I don't have to worry about it being too pretty.

I would prefer multiple INTERESTING gun trades and have up to 900 rounds I can include to even it up. If your proposed trade is equivalent to my rifles value, you WILL have to add cash.

If you want a cash price-
FAL-$1200
FAL + 900 rounds- $1700
