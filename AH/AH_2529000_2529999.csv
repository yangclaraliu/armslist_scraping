I am trying to drum up some cash for something else, I would take $750 for the entire package. I would like to trade for a cheaper gun and some cash. $400ish in gun and $350ish in cash +/-.

Some people seem to think that $750 is over priced for this gun which is strange to me because retail on all this stuff would be north of 1K. So let me break it down for some perspective; the gun/gear/papers is $550, the 5 extra mags are $25 each =$125, and the 300 rounds are $75. Add it up and you get $750 and one hell of a deal. I don't want to mess around trying to sell all this stuff separately. Everything is priced well below normal retail prices especially when you consider transfer fess and shipping. I hope this helps shed some light on where I am getting my prices, I feel like this is a good deal, maybe not the deal of the century, but plenty fair (everything is like new). I do know a shop in Englewood that is doing transfers for $20 dollars total."

 Emerson-Neely Timberline SPECWAR 

Emerson's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for his SPECWAR model. This model featured a one-side chisel-ground tanto blade almost 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick. Its handle was made from fiberglass-reinforced nylon molded around a near-full tang. Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath. The knife was originally a custom piece designed for Naval Special Warfare Group One, and this factory version was soon entered in the trials for the Navy SEALs knife in 1995. Although it was not chosen by the Navy, the Emerson-Neely SPECWAR knife won Blade Magazine's 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award at the magazine's Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City from May 24 to August 15,1995"

These parts have been sitting so long, I don't recall what specific model they were for. I can tell you one of the bolt carriers has the zigzag cuts in it I think making it a British L1 Al or an Indian Ishapore. You can also see the two installed selectors are the large type. But included is a smaller one as well. I think the installed selectors are Inch, but I think the extra one is a FAL type D. Regarding sights, the two installed are the flip up style, but the 3rd included one is fixed (not flip). The plastics suggest it is a UK model. It has the retractable cocking handle. Included are (I think) both metric and inch bolt hold open devices.

The one with butt stock attached has UE 58 and A6487 on the selector side of the lower receiver.
The other one UE 57 A 2019 with AD on the opposite side.

The carrier with the zigzag cuts matches its bolt UE A 11972

I am pretty sure they are both Inch models when it is all said and done. As for the two BCG's, I would think they both are 7.62 NATO but I could be wrong.
Does not include receiver, barrel or magazine, otherwise I believe it is complete but please look for yourself.

As for asking price, I was hoping for a functional trade but feel free to make a reasonable cash offer as well; I can't remember how much I have into this parts collection. I was thinking on building this, but I don't have the time right now. If I don't get a reasonable price or trade I'll just hang onto it.

What you see in the pictures is what you'll get. Shipping will be about $25 feel free to ask questions. I am also willing to provide more pictures if necessary. Also, if you are in the Jacksonville FL area I'd be happy to show you the parts sometime."

The brass has not been processed beyond the cleaning phase. Some may be [slightly] tarnished, which I try to sort out, but the majority is beautiful.

85%+ of this brass is LC headstamps, but cannot guarantee that you get any at all. Every one of the LC brass that I have inspected still have the crimped primers still in place. There are simply too many for me to hand sort them all. All brass is bought as ""once-fired"", although I cannot guarantee that it is. If any appear to have been reloaded, I remove them.

500 casings - $55 Shipped or $45 FTF

1,000 casings - $95 Shipped or $80 FTF

If you want ALL LC headstamps, email me and request it. I have to add a very small amount extra to make up for the time that it takes to sort them all out.

Comes with factory stocks and the custom ivory stocks shown in the pictures, which I had made for it. I am the second owner. The first owner put less than 100 rounds through the gun. I've put less than 300 through it. It is phenomenally accurate. I personally shot 1"" groups at 25 yards with this gun with a couple different loads. I carried it a bit, mostly in a Maxpedition go bag, but it saw a leather holster a few times. As such, it has some scattered light marks in the finish from carry, but is still a very nice gun. Most of the carry marks have to have the light hit them just right to see them. I took pictures of some of them to show them with lighting angles that highlight the marks, and can email those pics on request. I have owned Wilsons, Nighthawks, and a few other premium 1911s and this one is as nice as any of those at a fraction of the price. The trigger on this gun is stock and is amazing. The ivory looks much nicer in person than in the pics. It is creamy with nice grain and should age really nicely. I tried to capture that in the pics, but it is difficult to get the lighting just right for ivory, particularly newer ivory (bought these last year, so they haven't had much time to mellow).

I'll sell it one of two ways - with the ivories as shown for $1450 FIRM face to face in Hickory, NC or without them for $1300 FIRM face to face in Hickory, NC.  The ivories were custom made for this gun and fitted to it. They cost me over $250, so buying it with the ivories is the better of the two deals.  Not really interested in trades.

Buyer must have a NC CHP or pistol purchase permit, but I won't require anything the law doesn't.

About 85%+ of this brass is LC headstamps, but cannot guarantee that you get any at all. All of the LC headstamps that I have inspected still have the original crimped primer still in place. There are simply too many for me to hand sort them all. All brass is bought as ""once-fired"", although I cannot guarantee that it is. If any appear to have been reloaded, I remove them.

I will not meet for face to face or local sale. Why? Illinois gun laws blow. I'd have to call the police, run your FOID information. I'm looking to make a simple legal sale. So I will ship the firearms to an FFL local to you. So if you are local or out of state, I will gladly ship the firearms to your FFl and you can do your transfer/paperwork with them.

If you have any questions ABOUT the weapons feel free to ask, I can supply more pictures etc. I will not discuss breaking them up anymore. Thank you.

Price is pretty firm, I do not need more firearms, just paying off bills.

This weapon system has the rarest and most sought after lower receiver ever made.

(1) The receiver is super low-number (Forged GI Alloy) 1982-SENDRA CORP, with small pins (like the original M16) including the front & rear take down pins!  With none of Colt's civilian model non-sense, like internal receiver blocks, or purposely modified pivot pin holes, to preclude the use of GI internals, and upper receivers.  The SENDRA CORP receiver was manufactured to the same exact tolerances of the US Government GI rifles, and all GI components are a guaranteed drop-in fit (except the FA sear) and can be legally matched with all GI uppers, (with or without forward assist) including barrels with flash suppressors and bayonet lugs.  Ready for all your registered drop-ins, with no machine work.  NO other receivers can make this claim.

(2)  The barrel is genuine GI, USMC HBAR, government contract issue, with chromed chamber, bayonet lug, and flash suppressor. You won't find a straighter shooting, longer lasting, more accurate barrel than this (until you get into some ultra $$$ National Match custom machined stuff).  Harmonically, the best, off the shelf GI barrel, ever produced, and favorite of the USMC for extended firefight functionality and accuracy.
(3)  The upper receiver is GI forged aluminum alloy, with forward assist.

(4)  The butt stock is GI with trap-door and internal cleaning kit compartment, GI buffer tube with the correct spring and buffer to match the barrel and upper. With sling swivels.

(5)  Matching camouflaged scope, rings, and piccatiny rail base mount.


This gun has a custom made hard wood case, with brass handles, latches, and a locking hasp.  It was finished in automotive grade clearcoat, and is lined in soft camo patterned velvet, to protect the contents---rifle, drum mag, stick mags, bi-pod, forward grip, and scope.  The whole gun was hydrographically camouflaged in MOSSY OAK  ""OBSESSION"" pattern camo.  It's nearly invisible in the woods.  Add your Ghillie suit, and you're ""Ghost Recon"".

Accessories included in the case:  
(1)  125 Rd. drum magazine (Quality all steel construction / 100% reliable)
(1)  20 Rd. Genuine COLT, all metal, straight magazine.
(3)  30 Rd. GI issue curved magazines.
(1)  Canvas GI issue sling.
(1)  Forward vertical pistol grip
(1)  Steel GI issue steel Bi-Pod (with Nylon case)

I have decided that I don't want to get into a new caliber (30-06) and all of the expenses that entails.

The serial no. (56233XX) puts the manufacture date sometime in 1955. Receiver is H&R, barrel and action are Springfield Armory. The rifle will come with everything it shipped with from the CMP; CMP rifle case, the certificate of authenticity, one enbloc clip, and the owners manual. The stock isn't the prettiest but after all it is a service grade rifle. I haven't fired the rifle yet but hand cycling the action reveals it to be very smooth. Both muzzle wear and throat erosion have been graded as 1 by the CMP armorer

Price is firm at $800. The only trade I'm interested in is a DPMS AP4 in .308/7.62x51Nato and I would add cash to make up the difference. For a straight sale I'm willing to travel from Gig Harbor to Kingston. For a partial trade for the above mentioned DPMS AP4 I'm willing to travel farther (up to Marysville and down to Centralia). I'll want to see a WA DL and a WA CPL or WAC membership card, or an active duty military ID and will show mine in return."

This gun has been modified but unlike most ""tactical"" AK's listed for sale this has been done with all high quality modifications.  This is not a cheap AK with cheap ad-ons trying to be passed off as something it is not.

I will list below all modifications with their lowest available approximate retail price (that I could find with google).  I am the second owner of this gun and it has approximately 1500 rounds through it between both owners, (around 400 rounds since modifications completed). 

Selling as a package.  Only thing I will consider removing from the gun is the Eotech and magnifier and will take $700 off the price if you wish to purchase without the optics.

As a side note in order to remain 922r compliant you will need to use US made magazines or 2 of the 3 parts of your magazine must be US made or you must change out 2 additional compliance parts to US made if you wish to use imported magazines and remain 922r compliant.

Do your research on this gun and the modifications if interested and you will find that the SLR-96 is often argued as one of the highest quality AK's ever imported and that all modifications are top of the line.  Gun is in great shape.  

If you are in the market for a high end, top quality modified/""tactical"" AK then this is the gun for you.  It is ready to go and you won't have to order the parts separately and pay for shipping and/or tax on most of them (which is not included in the prices listed below) and wait for weeks for the cerakote.

Price is firm.  I am not giving it away and will keep it if no serious interest.   I do not need the money and do not ""need"" to sell but if I sell I will use the money to fund other guns.  Otherwise, I will keep it as it is a great gun and fun to shoot.

SLR-96:  $1200
Not many SLR-96's for sale but compare with SA-93 and SLR-95 (SLR-96 is the rarest of the 3).

Cerakote finish:  $200
