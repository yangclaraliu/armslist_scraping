The picture just about says it all. Great Christmas gift. You can shoot this gun all afternoon and use $10 in ammo. This is a fairly heavy rifle, so I'd not recommend it for a small juvenile but a stout teen could handle it. Excellent condition, beautiful high quality equipment.

Break the barrel and insert a pellet, bring the barrel back up and fire away - using the included Nikon scope i have hit bullseyes at 25 yards with it; not every time mind you, but it's good practice for any rifleman. One pump per shot. This model has adjustable trigger.

Included is two tins of .22 caliber pellets; one full new tin of 500 and 285 more. The pellets are all Crosman Premier Hollow Point hunting pellets - i've heard you can get match ammo that is more accurate. Also included is the Nikon scope special made for air rifles and the original iron sights.

New these are like $289 with another $150 for the scope. So it's almost $500 including the ammo new - I really need to get $300 back on this. It looks new all over except for one little mark on the underside of the stock. It's a really nice wood stock.

Make a kid happy this Christmas. I'll ship it to you - it's already boxed and ready to go!

Had to debate on whether to list it or not. Remington Model 7400 in 270 Win. Caliber, hand tooled leather strap, and topped with a Nikon ProStaff 3-9 X 40 scope. Remington code dates show this gun to have been manufactured in January, 1985. This is one of the nicest 7400's I have ever seen. It has a couple of small handling marks and has been fired is all that keeps it from being mint. (No, I do not have the original box. Wish I did.) The man I got it from said it had been shot no more than 10 times. I believe that to be correct as the bluing on the end of the muzzle is still completely intact. The only reason I am considering letting this one go is that it is just too nice (at least for me) to carry to the woods. Also have 68 rounds of ammo that I would let go for the right deal. It is mostly Remington CoreLok and Winchester Soft Point. Really looking to trade for a cheaper rifle to deer hunt with plus boot, either cash or a 2 gun trade. One must be another deer rifle unless I am overwhelmed with an offer. My cash price would be $650.00. I am very firm on that price. I know that is more than these usually sell for, but this one is exceptional. Rifles considered would be anything from a 243 caliber up to (some) 7mm Mag. Not interested in 300 win Mags and larger caliber. Would really love to trade for a less expensive rifle and a hand gun, but other offers will be considered. Located near Geraldine, Al. Willing to meet halfway (reasonable distance) for the right deal."

A well-cared for piece, this has been my shooter and home defense gun as the front face of the cylinder has embedded carbon/lead staining (I can lighten it by about 50% with careful application of Hoppe's #9 solvent). Since Illinois FINALLY became a CCW state, I plan to get a couple of carry guns which I can also keep for the home. Of course, this model has the pinned barrel and recessed cylinder, along with target hammer and trigger. I usually wear large in gloves, but the pristine target grips (and they are pristine!) make it tougher to get to the trigger; after all this is a N frame revolver! Anyhow, I got a Pachmayr grip set on the thing and it is much easier to shoot. If you have XL hands, I say use the target grips or the Pachmayr. I do not have to sell this item, and though I think I priced it fairly, I am perfectly ok with keeping it. Locks up really tight (first rate tolerances on cylinder) and a really smooth SA/DA action. You can shoot .357 rounds all day long with a gun this big and heavy.  I need the cash, so no trades.  Thanks."

Very little wear on the gun except in the area where the shells get pushed into the magazine tube. Gun has been modified to allow the magazine to hold 4 shells and 1 in the chamber. Originally, the gun was designed to hold 2 shells in mag tube and 1 in the chamber, hence the sportsman because it is designed for bird hunting. If you decide to use for bird hunting, you will need to use a plug in the mag tube. This modification has been done tastefully and you will never be able to tell it has been done.

Rifle will come with a USGI web sling and hard case, and 192 rounds of surplus M2 ball ammunition in enblock clips with 4 bandoleers all in a 30 cal ammo can.  That's 192 rounds of M2 Ball 30-06 ammo, 26 enblock clips, and 4 bandoleers. This is everything you need to start shooting this beautiful rifle!

This is a cash only deal and buyer must be a Wisconsin resident, show WI DL or CCW and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  I am not looking for trades at this time.

This is the rifle Obama banned from re importation so prices will continue to go up on these historic rifles!

The P229 SPORT is built on a stainless steel frame with a stainless steel slide featuring extended controls, adjustable sights, a match grade barrel, and Hogue black rubber grip. The magazine release is reversible for the left thumb to release the magazine. Specifications: Caliber: .357 SIG Overall Length: 8.6 inches Overall Height: 5.7 inches Overall Width: 1.5 inches Barrel Length: 4.8 inches Weight w/o Mag: 40.6 oz Mag Weight: 3.0 oz Sight Radius: 6.9 inches Mag Capacity: 10 Finish: Stainless Steel Sigarms has integrated customized features to give competition shooters a real competitive edge. These include extended controls for quicker, easier operation, adjustable target sights and vented compensators. Heavier, target-type barrels give these pistols greater stability and accuracy. Vented compensators subdue muzzle jump. Each pistol is built on a durable, trouble-free stainless steel frame and comes with its own test target. But there's more... each SIG SAUER sport pistol is actually hand assembled by a dedicated technician at the SIG SAUER facilities in Germany. Each pistol is then hand fitted and hand tuned to ensure smooth operation and the kind of superior accuracy you would expect from a SIG target grade pistol. SIG SAUER Sport Pistols are rigorously tested beyond normal limits and, if need be, is adjusted to ensure the very highest levels of performance, and a proof target is included with each pistol. All SIG SAUER sport pistols are manufactured with a heavy contour target type barrel and a precision machined stainless steel frame. This adds significant weight and rigidity and their increased mass reduces felt recoil and improves control. The P229S feature a vented compensator. These units employ a muzzle brake with an expansion chamber to soften recoil and help prevent muzzle rise, thus improving on-target accuracy for second and subsequent shots. The P226 Sport is equipped with a weighted frame extension and extended barrel. SIG SAUER sport pistols are equipped with soft rubberized grips for added comfort. Both frames and slides are precision machined from solid blocks of stainless steel. If you always wanted a ""SIG"" with just a little bit more... this is your gun."

There are some key features that made the M107 different from the M82A1. First off, the obvious differences are the Spiked Bipod Feet and the Detachable Mono-Pod in the Buttstock. The less obvious features is the Extra Heavy Duty Corrosion Resistant Parkerization of the M107, and the little known Lower Receiver Cut-Out on the Forward Alignment Cross Brace. This cut out is for the XM109 25mm Upper Receiver. ALSO there are features of the M107 SASR that have since been integrated into the current M82A1. First is the Placement of the Bolt Charging Handle, The Two-Piece Hinging Sear and new Sear Spring, the Higher-Grade Steel for the Cocking Lever, Push-Button Locking Receiver Take-Down Pins, Polymer Buffer, the Higher-Grade Steel for the Bolt Assembly and Four-Position Bipod Legs."

I took this in on a trade and am not sure if I want to do the ""AR thing'' anymore.
I'm not desperate to get rid of it, and haven't shot it.
If you look at the specs, they're sub MOA guns due to the Wilson Arms barrel and the 2 stage trigger is great. These have the. 223 Wylde chamber to handle 5.56 and. 223.
It had BUIS..maybe Midwest Industries.
I do not have the original stock or pistol grip.
It does have a short RRA quad rail and Tango Down foregrip. 

I do have some magazine repair kits and about 150 rounds available for the right deal.

I can send better pics on request. 

It has exactly 300 rounds downrange according to the previous owner and the BCG condition would match that assertion.

There are some key features that made the M107 different from the M82A1. First off, the obvious differences are the Spiked Bipod Feet and the Detachable Mono-Pod in the Buttstock. The less obvious features is the Extra Heavy Duty Corrosion Resistant Parkerization of the M107, and the little known Lower Receiver Cut-Out on the Forward Alignment Cross Brace. This cut out is for the XM109 25mm Upper Receiver. ALSO there are features of the M107 SASR that have since been integrated into the current M82A1. First is the Placement of the Bolt Charging Handle, The Two-Piece Hinging Sear and new Sear Spring, the Higher-Grade Steel for the Cocking Lever, Push-Button Locking Receiver Take-Down Pins, Polymer Buffer, the Higher-Grade Steel for the Bolt Assembly and Four-Position Bipod Legs."

Box of 50 Count
1822 Remington Special The .22 Winchester Rim Fire (WRF) is all but obsolete. It was designed for the Winchester Model 1890 pump action rifle and was later adapted to Remington and Stevens rifles as well as Colt Revolvers. Winchester .22 WRF loads used a flat point bullet. Remington manufactured the cartridge, loaded it with a round nose bullet, and called it the .22 Remington Special. The two are actually the same cartridge and are completely interchangable. I mention it here because Winchester .22 WRF ammo will fit in a .22 Magnum chamber, but not the reverse. The WRF fires a 45 grain, copper-plated, lead semi-wadcutter style bullet at a velocity of 1,320 fps and 175 ft. lbs. of energy at the muzzle of a 22"" rifle barrel. The sectional density (SD) of the 45 grain WRF bullet is .128. It hits with noticeably more authority than the .22 LR. Winchester also offered a 40 grain hollow point bullet. Because its case is slightly larger in diameter than a .22 LR case (as is the .22 Magnum), the WRF will not go into LR chambers. Like the .22 Magnum, the WRF uses standard .224"" bullets (like most centerfire .22's), not .220"" bullets like the Long Rifle."

Press is the newer style with the EZ-ject system, I bought it new in 2010. Have only loaded around 3,000 rounds with the press since I've owned it, so it's not quite broken in yet. I've gone through the press and polished everything to make sure it all runs smooth, especially the primer system. Once I got it dialed in I put some blue Loctite on the settings so they wouldn't move. The last 1,000 rounds of .38 special I loaded have been flawless, no primer feed jams etc. 

Here is a list of everything I have and what the current pricing would be if you bought it new. All the prices are from MidwayUSA:
Press and all included parts that came with (primer tubes, powder measure, manuals, completed case bin etc)- $429
Case Feeder- $328
2 Case feeder plates: small pistol and large pistol- $30 each
10 pack of LNL bushings- $40
4 Shell plates (9mm., 38 special/.357 magnum, 45 ACP, 45 Colt) -$37 each
InlineFabrication Ergo Roller Handle (thing is awesome)- $55
InlineFabrication Low Primer Warning system (makes audible beep when primers are low)- $55
Have spare parts also- packs of new retainer springs etc. 
Total=$1,115

I'm asking $700 for the package. I'm finishing up college and trying to pay off some tuition and keep up with bills so I'm selling the press. All you would need besides everything here is a die set for the caliber you want to load for and the actual components (bullets,powder and primers). 

Here are some good YouTube videos that go over the press and its features/functioning:

Item 4B (300gr. JFN) is designed for super deep penetration at revolver speeds, but will mushroom and penetrate less deeply at rifle speeds. At handgun speeds you can expect a solid 3 feet of penetration in muscle and bone and at rifle speeds expect roughly 2 feet of penetration in muscle and bone. At handgun velocities, this bullet will act just like item 4A in living tissue. The greater velocities generated by the longer barrel of the rifle will cause the bullet to mushroom and that large mushroom will make a much bigger diameter hole in tissue, but that frontal area on the mushroomed bullet will cut down the depth of penetration.
You’ll note my below velocities form over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.
1.       Ruger Super Blackhawk with 6 inch barrel--------1330 fps
2.       Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch barrel-----------------------1334 fps
3.       1894 Marlin with 18.5 inch barrel---------------------1770 fps
Item 4B is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is NOT suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."

The Simmons scope attached is expressly calibrated for shotguns.  This tactical shotgun has a long picatinny rail on the top rear portion of the receiver.  The nice thing about this model is that it can take various sized chokes - of which a rifled slug choke is included.  Just unscrew the flash suppressor and then screw in various chokes.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I have two of these shotguns.  After I purchased the first one, it fired so well and handled so well, I wound up with a 2nd one.  But I never got around to using the 2nd one.  So rather than it just sit in the case for all eternity, I'm putting it up for sale.  Again - this is a new rifle, scope and case - everything is 100% condition.

I am offering extremely hard to come across Anschutz 1422 Sporting Rifle in 22 LR caliber, made back in 1970 in West Germany.This is NOT Import marked rifle.

This rifle is built on the Anschutz Model 54 Match Action. This action is the heart of the famous Anschutz target rifles that have been used to capture more of the world's shooting competitions than all other brands combined.

The 54 action is CNC machined from a solid steel block. The bolt lug recesses are machined eccentrically for optimum bedding. The bolt's eccentric face is recessed, there are dual rear locking lugs, dual claw extractors, and a fixed ejector. The inline firing pin is very light, has a short travel, and allegedly gives the Match 54 action the world's fastest lock time. The bolt and cam are lapped for smooth operation. The bolt handle is long and easily clears a scope, and the bolt knob is smooth and round for comfortable operation by adult hands. This bolt is easily disassembled for cleaning without tools. The bolt release lever is at the left rear of the receiver. The safety is a wing type at the rear of the bolt. This safety encloses the firing pin and when set it pulls the firing pin back from the bolt face and locks it in place. The detachable, steel box magazine feeds cartridges reliably and precisely into the chamber. This magazine can be disassembled for cleaning. The magazine only protrudes about 1/4"" below the bottom of rifle, just enough to get a good grip on if necessary. The magazine catch is a small lever at the rear of the magazine well. Pressing it forward allows the magazine to drop freely from the action. The top of the receiver is both drilled and tapped for scope bases and machined with 11mm scope rails for tip-off scope rings. Probably the best feature of the Model 54 action is its superb trigger. The single stage trigger is adjustable for weight of pull, sear engagement, and over travel. Pull weight adjustment range is 2 to 4.4 pounds. This trigger is factory set for a 1200 gram (2.6 pound) release. The well shaped trigger guard is machined (not stamped) from steel.

A premium action can take a rifle only so far; it must be attached to a premium quality barrel. In the case of the Anschutz 1422, this is an 8-groove Olympic Match Anschutz target grade barrel. This barrel is precision chambered, button rifled and lapped to Olympic competition specifications. The muzzle is finished with a target crown. The barreled action is finished in a deep, polished blue.

The stock into which this barreled action is inletted is crafted from European walnut with the grain structure properly aligned for strength and stability. There are panels of hand cut checkering on both sides of the pistol grip and forearm. The Monte Carlo stock's cheekpiece rolls over the comb. The pistol grip has a Wundhammer palm swell and a rosewood grip cap with a white diamond inlay. The forearm ends with a Schnable tip. There are white line spacers at pistol grip cap and buttplate. Stock has a black buttplate made from a hard, grooved, polymer.

The Anschutz 1422 Sporting Rifle is excellent rifle in all respects. It is a synthesis of sophisticated engineering, precise manufacturing, top quality materials, and superior workmanship.

Its admittedly high price will, unfortunately, keeps it beyond the reach of most shooters. But for those who demand the best, this Anschutz 1422 Sporting Rifle deserves serious consideration. The condition of the deep polished blue finish is Mint. Stock has compression mark on right side, just behind the bolt handle. There are handling marks throughout. The stock rates in about Fine overall condition. The condition of bore is Excellent. Mechanically is Perfect. Overall this is Excellent Rifle. Absolutely no rust or pitting.

This great Rifle has Redfield Scope, made back in 1970s in the U.S.A. The Scope is in excellent condition.
