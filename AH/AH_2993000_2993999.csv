I've only had this scope for a few weeks, and it's been to the range once mounted on my AR-15/.223 with American Rifle Co rings that do not leave ring marks. Had about 50 shots fired under it. I don't dislike the scope, but it's just not what I'm looking for. It comes with everything that comes new with the scope. NOT INTERESTED IN TRADES. I have more scopes than I need already."

16 inch barrel 1/9 twist chambered in 5.56 nato
Accessories include:
carbine length Midwest industries rail 
Midwest industries rear flip up sight
Polished trigger, hammer, and disconnect (cant recall brand, have factory parts also)
6 MAGS (three steel usgi and three Pmags)
720 rounds of Prvi 5.56 62 grain brass cased ammo

These items cannot be split up and must be sold as a package. I paid a grand even for the gun at academy sports last year. Ive put 280 rounds through the gun. 
PRICING BREAKDOWN:
rifle was 1000 new with only one mag and the hard case, since its now used Ill say the rifle is worth 750.
The quad rail was 130 new, so used value is 75.00
The rear sight was 105 new, so used value is 50.00
The trigger set was 85.00 new, so used value is 40.00
So the gun and items on it come to a used price of 915 dollars.
I paid 425.00 for a 1000 rd case of the 5.56 ammo. I paid too much for it during the scare and to keep things fair im going to say the ammo is worth .35 cents a round. Ive looked up the prices online and most places are still trying to charge well over 40 cents per round. 720 rounds at 35 cents per round comes out to 252 dollars. Total added up for everything comes to 1,167 dollars. I am asking 1150. PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME EMAILS, I DO NOT CHECK THEM!!! Any interested parties should call or text 828-455-three one six eight. Im located in Maiden NC, and will be happy to drive out to meet anywhere within reason. Thanks for looking! All local laws apply!"

CX4 Storm: A Tactical Carbine with Pistol-Like Controls

The CX4 is a semiauto pistol-caliber carbine designed to give you the familiar controls of your favorite Beretta combat handgun. It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.

Accepts Beretta Full-Size Pistol Magazines

The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.

cx4-1Extremely Versatile, Easy to Use

This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.

Easy Accessorization

The CX4 jsut begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization. Please visit our accessories page for a full list of CX4 accessories.

Side By Side Shotgun.

This shotgun is a store-brand version of the Stevens/Savage 5100, and indeed stamped 5100 on the receiver. This was the predecessor to the Model 311, and a contemporary to the Fox Model B, both of which are identical, or very nearly so, to the 5100.

20ga, 2 ¾” Chambers. Fixed chokes, IC on the right (.628-.618=.010 constriction), Mod on the left (.627-.606=.021 constriction). Barrels are 28” in length.

Stock and forend are the later (and more desirable) Tenite (synthetic) version.

Gun is well used, but definitely not abused, and is solid throughout, ready for years of use. This gun is an American made workhorse. I believe this gun was carried a lot, and shot very little, as there is very little mechanical wear present. Bores are both as good as the day they left the factory, no pitting, rust, marks, ect. The gun locks up like a bank vault.

Double triggers, automatic safety, solid rib, splinter style forend, pistol grip stock.

Gun has been completely disassembled, ultrasonically cleaned, re-oiled and regreased, and reassembled, and is ready to rock and roll. 

Transfer will ONLY be facilitated by a FFL dealer here in NY for a FTF transfer, per the NY Safe Act.  I will not sell to a NYS resident without going through a FFL, period.  I am happy to ship this anywhere in the country to your FFL on your dime, payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales."

Even the armourer markings are still visible in pictures.There is one small mark in the stock to the right of the bolt release lever.. This mark was on the rifle when I purchased it and I believe it came from Springfield that way. If you look closely you can see that the finish is unmarred and was likely applied over the mark at the factory. The rifle ships in the original box with all of the factory paperwork and an accessory catalog. Also included are three new 15 round magazines and the original 20 round magazine which will ship separately . This is a registered Pre Ban rifle and transfers through a FFL only. It is not for sale in ""ban states"" and it is the purchaser's responsibility to ensure this rifle is legal for them to own. If you don't know ask your FFL before you contact.

It’s survived the woods of Virginia, the desert in Nevada, the swamp in Louisiana, the weeds in Texas, and even the jungle in Guatemala. It’s been through rain, thunder, and dust storms, even a blizzard. I’m not sure it’ll work as a SAPI plate, but I can say nothing else short of deflecting bullets has killed it. It was never meant to be the fastest, lightest, or prettiest thing in the world, but when a lot of the other guys’ widescreen hotrods started  crapping out as soon as it got hot or cold or wet or dry, this little beast has ALWAYS worked. It has gotten a few scratches, but everything works and even all the port covers are intact in spite of all the backpacks, Blackhawks, and Hum-Vees it’s been bounced around in.

Listing includes one each mil-spec, fully-rugged Panasonic Toughbook CF-29 notebook computer with 1.6 GHz Intel processor, upgraded 1.25 Gb RAM (256Kb onboard), upgraded 160 Gb hard drive (130 Gb free for manuals, movies, or MP3’s), upgraded DVD/CD-RW ROM drive, upgraded back-lit rubberized keyboard (has survived several MRE coffee baths, and original tactile keyboard included), and built-in Wi-Fi. Running Windows XP Professional, with Microsoft Plus! for XP, Microsoft Security Essentials, and full Microsoft Office 2007.

Also includes nearly $100 in new Canon ink cartridges (some black and color). Prints as fast as or faster than regular full-size printers, quality is excellent, and will even print black from the color cartridge (great when you do more black than color). Has some exterior rub marks from being hauled around, but otherwise works and acts like new. I don't have the manual or CD for it anymore, but you can download all that from Canon directly or I have the zip file.

Also included is a nice set of Insight portable USB speakers for watching DVD’s or listening to MP3/internet radio. They fold up and come with their own fitted case and they sound way better than most laptop speakers.

This set-up has been awesome for travelling, but would work great when you don't have a lot of room, like a small apartment or dorm room too. I’m asking $175 (including the extra cartridges and speakers, priced way higher everywhere else online). I'm only selling it because I've changed jobs and won't be travelling so much anymore.

I have fired only .40 through it because I had a lot of it to shoot up, and wanted to break the trigger in. The 357 barrel is brand new.

The Underwood ammo and .40 SD ammo are also listed separately, if they sell, I will adjust the package price.

It's new, old stock. That means it was manufactured in the mid 90's but has been used very little. A safe queen. As the pictures show, it looks brand new. I have fired about 150 rounds through it. As great as this pistol is, I want to replace it with something I can use for conceal carry. This is one of Sig's most reliable weapons. It's been used for decades by law enforcement and military. It has a steel frame and is as easy to field strip as a Glock. Very field expedient. Just lock it to the rear, flip the take down lever and release the slide. That simple. The steel frame makes for very little recoil for a 45.  I want $620.00 for the weapon, 3-8 round mags, 2-10 round mags and carry case. Also comes with original owners manual. The 10 round mags alone are worth $40 each, so this is a great deal. Buyer must be willing to come near by for FTF transaction. Contact me with any questions (334) 3one8-9one98"
