WHAT THAT MEANS: I will trade used price against used price,or new price against new price.THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS A R8 357, GETS EXTRA CONSIDERATION DUE TO RARITY. I am not giving you new price for your gun against used price for mine. Sorry for all the normal people to have to read this, but I am sure you have dealt with the MORONS I am talking about.

This scope came on a Savage 6.5 Creedmoor that I purchased online in December 2015. Now that hunting season is over I am upgrading to a Vortex PST to take advantage of the distance capabilities of my rifle. The scope is free from scratches and is in like new condition. It has the Active Target BDC reticle which can be used along with Nikon's Spot-On ballistics app/software to know the exact distances each aiming point will strike for any rifle/cartridge out there. For reference, I included a pic of the reticle focused on an 8"" drain pipe at 200m. At 100m the largest circle is 3"" (3 MOA), at 200m it is 6"", etc. I am also including the set of rings with it as the scope I purchased uses larger rings. This scope treated me very well in low light and I'd keep it if I had another rifle to mount it on. They retail for $249 w/o mounts. Thank you for looking and let me know if you're interested.

If you would like to meet half way or at least a little out of your way, that would be appreciated but not expected but could affect my willing to pay price. Just make me an offer and we'll go from there. Because this gun is off roster, it cannot be shipped to an FFL and a face to face meeting at an FFL has to be done between you the seller and me the buyer. This means the seller (you) has to go there once and the buyer (me) will have to go twice. This is California Law, no exceptions.  I will be paying by cash or Cashiers Check, whichever you the seller prefer."
