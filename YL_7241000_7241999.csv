Cash Price is $469.99. Here are the Manufacturers Details on it: Springfield Armory®, the same company that brought Point & Shoot Ergonomics™ to the market in 2001 is proud to announce the latest evolution of the polymer pistol – The XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact in 9mm and .40SW. Put an XD® Mod.2® in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone®: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone®, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose. The GripZone® doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone® advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand. If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact.

The 4” Service Model is a slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity.

Plus, you can choose between two attractive finishes – all black, or bi-tone. Like all XD®s, the Mod.2® Service Model is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod. 2® Service Model a safe and easy to use pistol. And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2® apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2® Service Model on target for round after round.

Lost interest in it And would rather put my time into a step down cuddy fishing boat. Merc 140 3.0 engine and alpha one gen one outdrive. Engine runs amazing and was freshly tuned up. Replaced the starter, mechanical fuel pump and some misc lines on it. Outdrive was just rebuilt! And yet to be installed. Replaced some wiring in it along with switches and fuses and a new ignition switch and keys. New strap and winch. Was on the water last year from previous owner but sat after that. All it needs to my knowledge is a new gimbal bearing( old one is removed) tires are getting a little old. Needs a new hose for the blower, and possibly a engine coupler. Transom will probably need yo be rebuilt in the next couple of years but its good for now. Just feeling offers. If it doesn't go anywhere I'll just keep it and replace the last couple of things. Title on the boat. No title for the trailer.  Will trade for a ar10 and cash or multiple rifles"
