Restrictions apply on high capacity magazines in some jurisdictions, so please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are Lorcin factory magazines for their model L9 pistols. Manufacturer was Lorcin Engineering of Mira Loma, California. Construction is blue steel body, steel springs, aluminum alloy cartridge follower, and black anodized alloy finger rest type floor plate. Each magazine will hold 13 rounds of 9mm ammunition. These were manufactured during the infamous period that began in 1994 and ended in 2004, when 13 shot magazines could not be sold on the civilian market. Since Lorcin was literally gunning for overseas markets, these had to be marked Export Only. That is a moot issue since 2004 in most jurisdictions of the United States. These magazines will only work in a Lorcin model L9 pistol that accepts double stacked magazines. They will not work in an L9C Compact; Will Not work in a Hi-Point; Will Not work on a John Deere 47H Manure Spreader. They will only work on a Lorcin Industries model L9 pistol. Lorcin, of course, is long gone out of business, so when these are gone, there won’t be any more. These magazines have been stored for several years. They have never been loaded or issued; they do, however, show contact wear on their edges from being stored in bulk. We found them in an old Atlantic Warehouse. Our single magazine price is $29 per. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23.00 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 13 round magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement only. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are excellent quality Asian made magazines for the Lorcin model L380 pistols. Manufacturer is Taiwanese, probably HFC / Keymore. Construction is blue steel body and steel springs, with black polymer cartridge follower and matching finger rest type floor plate. Each magazine will hold 7 rounds of .380 ACP caliber ammunition. These magazines will only work in a Lorcin model L380 pistol that accepts single stacked magazines. If you take your Lorcin with its magazine removed and stick a ruler up into the magazine well inside the grip frame, it should measure 3 1/2 inches from the edge of the grip frame; the back strap of this magazine’s body measures 3.55 inches long. Your Lorcin’s magazine release should be positioned low on the left side of the grip frame like the one in the photo. These will not work in a Bryco 38 or a Jennings model 48; Will Not work in a Hi-Point; Will Not work on a John Deere 1947 series H Manure Spreader. They will only work in a Lorcin Industries model L380 pistol. Lorcin, of course, is long gone out of business, so we were lucky to even get these. We found them in an old Atlantic Warehouse. Our Single Mag Price onesy twosy price is $33.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at $23 each. Own 3 for only $ 69.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

 First is a built AR 15. The main things are full mil spec 16 inch medium contour barrel with diamond fluting and 1/7 twist rate carbine gas system. ALG trigger free floated diamond head VRS-T rail.YHM upper Spikes lower. Magpul MS3 sling. BCM Gunfighter edition Mod 4 charging handle. Springco Blue Spring. ST-T2 buffer. Troy Claymore muzzle brake. All that results in a very soft and very very fast firing reliable rifle. I frog lubbed the BCG and charging handle so it runs very very smooth. Price is $2000. Text me for a full on parts list and some details and pictures.

Second is a Magpul Edition 870. Comes with everything from the factory. Magpul furniture, risers, LoP spacers. Adjustable  XS ghost ring sights. Top mounted picitanny rail for optics. Full on cerakoted black. Added a Mesa Tactical 6 shot side saddle mounted properly to the reciever. Brand new they are about 720 + tax = 820 + the side saddle = 900. I'm asking 750. Mine is practically brand new. Would trade a 1100 Tactical but thats probably about it. Maybe a nice 1911.

Ex Sniper Mosin Nagant. Full matching numbers very good bore good rifling. Bayonet included. Smooth bolt. Also has a high front post. I've only fired a few rounds through it but cleaned it every time I went out with it. $180

Stripped Spikes Tactical non color filed Honey Badger lower. New never used. Bought it and put it in the safe. $100

I also got a free float YHM XL-Specter length free float quad rail. Used it on a previous rifle for a few months. Took it off and its sat in storage every since. Includes delta ring, barrel nut, cap,and timing screws. $80

Last thing a pair of Oakley Flak Jacket XLJ's. Matte black frames and transition lenses. I bought these somewhere around a year ago from the SI website. I don't think they are selling the transition lenses anymore (or at least right now). Frame has a little play in them but still pretty good off. Includes a hard shell Oakley case and cleaning cloth and an extra pair of nose pieces. They make very very good shooting glasses. Pretty much the only thing I've used them for. Can wear them in sunshine, rain, or snow. From dawn till dusk. $140

Call or text me at REDACTED for more info. I'll gladly send pictures or answer any questions. Apparently the pictures my phone takes are too big to post on armslist."

With the 18 1/2"" barrel you can maneuver around the doors and hallway of your home. Protect Yourself. Don't expect anyone else to protect your home, property or family in a break-in situation, as the response time for assistance takes too long. I very recently had about $1000 worth of stuff stolen by my garage. I figured I would just call the insurance company and they would take care of my loss.  NOPE, The theft deductible is 1% of the value of your home. So if you have a $150,000 home, the 1st $1500 comes out of your pocket, so I got nothing back for my loss. I will tell you that if someone breaks into my home, I will shoot to kill....not shoot to wound. I don't want them coming back later. A shotgun shell is less than 50 cents and that is now my new insurance policy against theft.
STEVENS SAVAGE ARMS MODEL 320 12G PUMP SHOTGUN WITH PISTOL GRIP, GHOST RING SIGHTS- NEW IN UNOPENED BOX $240.00. The pictures I have attached are only stock pictures. The box is sealed and whoever buys it will be the first to open the box since manufacturing and it will look just like the ones in the pictures. Walmart sells a version of this shotgun with the inexpensive bead sights for $207.00 + tax ($226.49) with background check. The Ghost Ring Sights model runs an additional $35.00 + over the bead sight model and is favored. This model is not carried by Walmart as they only sell the cheaper model. Be legal to buy a shotgun and have your FL drivers license with you. I will fill out a bill of sale.

The Savage Stevens 320 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun features a carbon steel barrel and a synthetic stock, both with a matte black finish. The shotgun is designed with a pistol grip, a rotary bolt, dual slide bars and a Ghost Ring Sight. Tube magazine. 5-round capacity.

Just got back from having a recall fixed.
This is an all steel (except grips, Mag baseplate and Mag follower) pistol in .45 ACP.
Pistol was made in Italy in 1994 and imported by EAA.
Overall the pistol shows almost no wear, the one exception being marks on the rear site, most likely from a rushed adjustment.
This is for the pistol and one (1) magazine.
Sale Price is $350. Trades are possible, but no hunting rifles or “Valuable antiques”.

All the blued metal on this thing is also in excellent condition. The barrel is a stepped configuration, 22 inches long, with a very good to excellent bore in 7x57mm. There is a Canjar adjustable trigger installed and, I'm guessing here, it's set at about 3 lbs. The scope setup on this rifle is unique and I will do my best to describe it. The base and rings are Bausch & Lomb with the windage and elevation built in. The scope is also Bausch & Lomb Model Balvar 5 variable power 2.5 to 5 with fine tapered cross hairs, nice and clear, no fog. There is no windage or elevation adjustment on the scope, that is done on the base, weird huh. The bolt cocks on opening and has a commercial safety. Since this is such a beautiful rifle and probably one of a kind I will have to price it accordingly so dig deep go for it."

I have two items for trade:

Glock 26 Gen 3 in great shape with a low round count of 75. My 26 will come with everything it did new and a Pierce Pinky Ext to give one mag a plus 2 ability. I am looking to trade for a few items and depending on what you have I have kydex gear for a 26 / ammo / mags / Lee Hand Reloading Setup ready for 9mm / cash. I would be interested in the following,
Mossberg MVP Patrol
Entry Level AR-15
AK-47 Variant
Ruger Mini 14 
Ruger Mini 30
Glock 19 Gen 3 or Gen 4

Kahr CW380 Recent Production Model in great shape with zero issues. This Kahr has roughly 150 rounds through it and fires true and accurate for such a small package. My Kahr has been sent to Kahr to have the feed ramp polished and all rounds including hollow points run like butter. This CW380 is my wife's and she has went back to the S&W442 so I am looking to trade it for a Glock 42 due to me having larger hands. My CW380 will come with everything it did new along with a Kydex IWB Tuckable Holster. Depending on trade I do have extra magazines / ammo / kydex mag carriers for the CW as well. If you haven't looked at the CW380/P380 you should if looking for a small pocket pistol around the size of a LCP but much better quality and trigger in my personal opinion.

Email only please, as I can't get to this forum as often as I'd like to check for PM's. However, I get emails on my phone.

The HellFighter® WeaponLight for crew-served weapons and heavy guns packs power and versatility into a tough, compact package that weighs only 10 pounds and measures a mere eight inches in length. It features a blinding 3,000-lumen beam with enough reach to illuminate targets hundreds of yards away and enough surround beam to make it perfect for patrol or search-and-rescue operations. 

Built to withstand intense recoil and combat conditions, the HellFighter's water-resistant body is constructed from high-strength aerospace aluminum with a Mil-Spec Type III hard anodizing finish. A 5mm multi-coated Pyrex® window protects its lamp assembly, and the window itself is protected from dust, mud, and heavy particle impact by either a swing-open amber filter for cutting through smoke or dust, a swing-open infrared for use with night vision devices (NVDs), or a swing-open opaque cover. 

The HellFighter's rugged high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp is powered by one or two military BA-5590 batteries or from a 12-volt auto battery, and is virtually immune to failure from recoil, vibration, or impact since it has no filament to break or burn out."

This is a 20 inch barrel model with 7+1 capacity, heat shield, shell side saddle on the receiver, red dot scope and rail, and pro mag tri rail forend and adjustable AR style stock. Barrel and magazine tube have been duracoated black, heat shield and receiver red.

Works well, but I'm interested in trying something different. I'm interested in trading it for a different HD/Tactical style shotgun. Primarily looking for a Benelli Nova Tactical or a Winchester SXP Extreme Defender, but would consider other similar weapons. I already have a nice field gun so I am not interested in hunting shotguns.
Would consider less expensive model shotguns as well+cash, such as a base model Winchester SXP, any of the ASI shotguns on the market now, the IAC Hawk Remington 870 clones, and others.

While I'm primarily interested in another shotgun but I would also consider a mid or full sized 9mm of some sort or a .38 special snub revolver. Not interested in rifles at this time.

Would prefer to trade but I'll also sell for $350 firm if you're not wanting to trade.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.
