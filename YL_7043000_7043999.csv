Minor cosmetic dinks and use and no can't on sights at all. Everything is straight and works well. The tail of the bcg has a little wear but has stopped and fixed itself. It has the century trigger meaning it won't mushroom or peen your tail like the tapco triggers.With only 300rds through it the rifling still looks new and is a pleasure to shoot. Only reason why I'm selling is because I need more money to upgrade my other aks and this one got the short stick.If you're serious about this inquiry please email me with your number. I'm not looking at any trades unless it's an ak with the mods I want on it. So basically if you want to trade me your ak with mine (which is probably never going to happen), if you do then I'm your man.This is calibered with the glorious 7.62x39 round. Mag comes with it of course. NO mods were done to this rifle."

I AM NOT DRIVING MORE THAN 50 MILES TO HAVE YOU DECIDE TO CANCEL LAST MINUTE. WILL IGNORE ALL MESSAGES THAT LOOK LIKE THEY'VE BEEN WRITTEN BY A TWELVE YEAR OLD. IF YOU'RE AN ADULT, YOU SHOULD KNOW PUNCTUATION AND SPELLING.I am not the first owner, but the weapon appears to be in mint condition, as shown in the second photo, the spring still has factory paint on it, the buffer looks fresh and the rails have next to zero wear on them. Serial number dating puts this gun as an '09 manufacture, however again, it seems to have been shot less than 100 rounds.comes with everything shown: Gun, two magazines, a cable lock, the manual, the factory fired shell, and hard case.

This is a true Victorian elephant gun that likely saw use in South Africa. It is particularly scarce to find these big guns rifled, as this example is, as most Ivory hunters preferred smooth bores due to their decreased kick and quicker reloading abilities. The barrel measures 26 1/2"" long and nearly 1 1/2"" wide at the breech. A large brass bead serves as a front sight while the rear is a 13/16"" wide fixed leaf. The barrel is secured with two large iron wedges. The lock features simple boarder engraving and is inscribed ""REDMAN / LONDON"". The blued barrel has thinned to a dark gray patina with traces of original finish in protected areas while the case colored lock has faded to silver with mottled traces of color remaining. The stock features a checkered wrist with large carved cheekpiece and full length forearm. The wood is in outstanding condition retaining it's original untouched finish and showing absolutely no cracks, chips, or repairs whatsoever. Original brass buttplate, triggerguard, lock screw escutcheon, ramrod pipes, and large nosecap have turned a mellow patina. Original iron ramrod. The action is crisp and functions flawlessly. The nipple is a perfect original. The bore is very good showing deep, sharp rifling front to back with scattered blackpowder frosting."
