Ready for anything. Kimber Tactical pistols have the performance-enhancing features demanded by law enforcement professionals. Available in a range of configurations, they cover everything from tactical response to concealed carry.
Meprolight night sights are standard. Front strap and trigger guard checkering are standard. Extended ambidextrous thumb safety are standard. Kimber Tactical pistols are no-compromise, purpose-built pistols that leave nothing out, and Kimber quality brings it all together in five different platforms. Three full-size versions exceed all traditional and tactical law enforcement requirements. Compact models cover everything else. Like all Kimber pistols, each has rounded and blended edges to prevent snagging, along with match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. No other pistol design equals the 1911 for true tactical performance.

Built from the ground up and quite light weight. 95oz or so, less than 6lbs as pictured. 14.5"" barrel pinned and welded to non NFA 16.1"" barrel length. Maybe 1k rounds of high quality brass ammo through it, entire rifle is in very good shape. Functions flawlessly. All high end parts, comes with nice red dot. I am going to miss it. Also comes with 8 USGI aluminium 30 round mag kits with upgraded yellow Magpul followers. 
Front to back: 
VG6 Precision Epsilon 556 hybrid flash hider, muzzle brake/compensator. This is an awesome hybrid muzzle device. Good medium between flash hiding and recoil/muzzle climb mitigation. Not terribly blasty, but keeps the muzzle flat. Has A2 suppressor mount capability. Pinned and welded to the barrel to bring overall barrel length to 14.5""
Faxon 14.5"" Gunner profile 5.56 barrel. 4150 CMV steel magnetic particle inspected barrel. 1:8 twist to stabilize everything from 40 grain varmint to 77 grain SMK. Soft shooting mid length gas, but still 100% reliable. Gunner profile is a superior profile to pencil, government, or socom. Has good diameter and mass towards the chamber for managing heat, but narrows out after the gas block to save weight. 1.2lb barrel. Quite light, but still capable of gunnin. Pinned and welded with muzzle device to be non NFA 16.1"" length. 
SLR Rifleworks ION Lite 11"" MLok handguard rail. Super light at 10 oz. Very nice high end rail with antirotation mounting, QD sling mounts at front and back, and MLok rails along the lengths. Small section of ladder pic rail covers over the top for thumb over bore. 
Arisaka Defense Mlok vertical fore grip. Very nice lightweight aluminum medium length VFG. Fantastic fit and finish. Willing to keep this if you want to knock some price off the rifle and or don't like the look of it. 
Magpul MBUS Pro front back up iron sight. High quality front back up iron sight. Industry standard. 
USA made billet upper with mil-spec forward assist and dust cover
Primary Arms Advanced Micro Dot Red Dot sight. Basically an Aimpoint T1/T2,H1/H2 clone. One of the best budget red dots out there without going full aimpoint pricing. Very durable, with over 5 years of battery life! Precise 2 MOA dot, 12 brightness settings and night vision compatible, takes Aimpoint T1/T2, H1/H2 mounts. Currently has a PA lightweight skeletonized mount and a Tango Down cover. I have astigmatism and this dot still manages to be quite crisp. 5 star rating with 300 reviews on the Primary Arms website. Google search this red dot, it is a solid optic. 
USA made NiB BCG, 9310 MPI bolt, shot peened. M16 FA style mil spec heat treated and tolernaced.
Aero Precision forged lower. Comes with under grip set screw to tighten the fit in between upper and lower receiver. Cool feature. 
Knights Armament Company USMC marked rear back up irons sight. Was bought brand new in packaging, but this is the real deal. Marine issued back up irons sights with adjustments out to 600 meters. 
Strike Industries extended charging handle. Normally I'm not a fan of Strike Industries but this is is actually a solid product of theirs. Similar to the BCM gunfighter charging handle but with a smoother less porous finish. 
Griffin Armament A3 grip. Similar to the A2 grip in profile, but with a steeper angle. Mildly aggresive grip, not too grippy but just right. 
USA made buffer tube assembly.
Magpul SL-K compact carbine stock. Lightweight. 
Magpul Mlok QD sling socket installed on stock. 
 
I built this rifle from the ground up, each part was selected to come together as a lightweight but capable carbine. Not too long, but not so short as to lose terminal ballistic performance. Not too heavy, but not too light so as to feel like a toy. Quality components all around. Flawless function for about 1k rounds of quality brass ammo. Comes with red dot and back up irons, so it is ready to go! Also have a few USGI aluminum magazine kits willing to throw in. 
$900 OBO
