It's a custom rifle that was purchased new from another individual. It was pre-built, I just bought it. It's a complete Anderson lower. The upper is a forging made of 7075 T6, hard coat anodized. The BCG was identified by my FFL as a Daniel Defense full auto. Barrel is 16"" 4150 Chrome MolyVanadium with a 1 in 9 twist rate. Feed ramp is M4, and the rifle has a flat top upper. 10"" free-floating keymod handguard. Also included is a generic grip-pod, 2 polymer magazines, a set of FieldSport flip-up iron sights and a Vortex Strikefire II red/green dot with 4 MOA dot. The case is a pluck and pull Plano all-weather case. Has 5 latches to keep it secured closed, it's waterproof and is said to float (I'm not sure how much weight can be in the case before it loses buoyancy). This case is TSA approved.  I usually use one-piece cleaning rods, but I have an extra unopened Hoppes cleaning set for 22 caliber firearms. These rifles usually sell for around $650. Case was $70, grip-pod was $25 the mags are $25 for the pair, BUIS were about $30, and the Strikefire II is $180.  That brings the total to about $980 here. Id like to see $750 for the lot, price is negotiable, but I won't dip too low on it. It's a good rifle with a good setup. I've put about 550 rounds though it with zero failures of any sort. As far as accuracy goes, it's a red dot, so accuracy will suffer over range. 100 yards, it can shoot about 7"", 50 yards, about 2.5-3"".  I'm by no means an expert with an AR with a red dot, I'm more into bolt guns. I'm sure someone more experienced with the platform can get better results."

This is not your standard Saiga 12 that you have to pay a gunsmith to hammer your receiver and install a bunch of parts to make it look like this. This model came like this from factory. SAW-type Russian pistol grip, Stock, the Picatinny Quad Rail System, were all installed from factory. This thing is a beast and have been sitting in my safe for a while now. Making some run for new toys and since I never use this one, I'm letting it go to someone that will use it. $1350 CASH. Face to Face in the Orlando, FL area or I can ship to an FFL (buyer covers shipping charges). Thanks for your time and God Bless.P.S. One just sold on Gunbroker for almost $1000 over my asking price. Just search 719328985 on their site and you’ll see the auction. Way more than my asking price. So, understand how much these are going for, if you can find them."

He defaulted so now it's available. It came with the original box and one magazine. I'm firmly asking $700.00 for this pistol. $700.00 is a fair price because that's near what these guns go for new without the modifications which can cost upwards of an additional $300.00. I'm in no hurry to sell so I won't entertain low ball offers.I'm willing to travel a reasonable distance to sell/trade, but I am NOT willing to ship. Arizona residents who are United States citizens only and buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale which will include the buyer's drivers license number and/or a CCW number if available."

It started out as a basic 18"" Home Defense model Nova and evolved into an amazing hybrid. It has the following items performed or added:- 18.5"" Carlson's barrel with screw-in choke- Extra tall LPA front sight professionally installed by the Revolver Armorer- Forcing cone extended by Rob Roberts Gun Works- Carlson's 0.650"" extended turkey choke- Trigger lightened and polished by Rob Roberts Gun Works- Nordic low-drag follower- Wolff OEM-length magazine tube spring (1 year old)- Nordic +2 magazine tube extension with spring (for Home Defense use outside of turkey season)- Picatinny rail- Limbsaver Airtech recoil pad- Stippled handgrip and forestock- Mossy Oak Graphics wrap in Obsession camouflage patternI painstakingly experimented with 6 chokes and 8 different loads to accomplish this gun's pattern, which yields 188 pellets in a 12"" circle at 40 yards, using 3.5"" Winchester Long Beard XR #6 shot shells. Despite the overhyped claims of manufacturers and anonymous internet turkey slayers that you'll never meet, achieving such a pattern is not instantaneous or cheap. It's even more challenging with an 18.5"" barrel. And no, you don't lose velocity with an 18.5"" barrel. That is a misnomer created by people with little experience and incorrectly assuming shot shell ballistics mimic bullet ballisitics. I've shot the same exact brand and size shot shells using the same exact receiver and 2 different barrels (this 18.5"" barrel and a 26"" barrel) through my chronograph. If there was a difference in velocity, it was hidden in the averaging spread of 3 shells in each barrel. Shotguns use fast powders that have combusted and finished expanding gases in the first 16"" of travel.At 20 yards, this gun puts 90% of the pellets in a 5"" pattern, with a ragged 2"" gaping hole in the center (no halo)At 30 yards, it puts 90% of the pellets in a 10"" pattern, with almost 50% of them in the center 6""At 40 yards, it evenly spreads 90% of the pellets in a 16"" circleI have target pics of this gun in each of these distances if you're interested. To be honest, however, I personally wouldn't shoot #6 size shot beyond 30 yards with any gun. The only birds I've ever witnessed having to be tracked were extended ranges using #6 shot It's my personal opinion that the smaller mass of the pellets just can't maintain enough velocity to ensure instantly effective penatration out that far.When it's not turkey season, I install the open choke tube and +2 mag tube extension for Home Defense use. The adjustable LPA rear ghost sight's POA has been adjusted for 2.75"" 00 Buck.This is NOT a $399, off-the-shelf Benelli Nova. There are plenty of those at the gun shops. If you're looking for a low-cost Nova, you can get them for $350 to $300 on sale or used. If you are looking for low-budget shotgun, this is not the gun for you. I've invested almost $1500 into ensuring this gun is accurate, patterns great, and feels precise while ensuring reliability and confidence. The only blemishes that I can point out are a couple of gouges in the graphic wrap where it got hung up on thick brush.If you are interested, I can meet yout at a local indoor shooting range that has 22 yard lanes and you can witness me fire it and present the pattern on paper. Sorry, but you cannot fire it unless you sign a bill of sale, put $600 in my hand and bring your own ammo. You're already getting twice the gun Bass Pro offers for half the price, not to mention proof of performance. Free gun rental is not in the offer.  I'm almost giving this gun away at a price point that is a no-brainer for someone who knows what they want and know what this is. The price of $600 is EXTREMELY FIRM. If you feel the need to negotiate, we can start at $750 and I'll let you talk me down to $600. For purchase, you'll need a Virginia state driver's license.I will not be responding to emails to questions that can be answered by Google. Thanks and God bless."

Has the trapezoid (triangular) front and rear sights, which you’ll love. Only selling because it has the same grip angle as the Glock, which is different from every other pistol I own, and just not willing to change the way I draw and aim for just one gun. Two range trips, 100 rounds fired each time and cleaned after each trip. Just can’t get used to the grip angle.
Trap sights draw your eye and are very quick to pick up, plus this has a softer recoil than most 9mm pistols. (Yes, I really like this gun, except for the grip angle!)
