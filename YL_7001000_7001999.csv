I am located close to the Food Lion at 3416 Poole Road in Raleigh, but can get to Knightdale and Cabelas in Garner pretty easy as well. Thank you and have a good day. I do have other hard to find guns that are not listed. For example I have many colt guns such as an unfired and uncarried nickel 1976 Colt Detective in 38 special and a 1980 collector grade blue Detective Special in 38 Special. Snake guns such as unfired enhanced drilled tapped 4 inch Colt King Cobra , unfired 4 inch drilled tapped Colt Anaconda (extremely rare year of 2000) , stainless 4 inch Python (shot 6 times), 4 inch Blue Colt Python, 6 inch nickel python, and 4 inch nickel Python (shot 6 times, amazing looking).Have a nice unfired factory engraved Smith and Wesson model 29-10 with factory wooden display box and a Walther PPK/s with 2 mags and matching box (smith and wesson).Have a rare unfired Remington R1 1911 Pearl Harbor edition, only 300 ever made, still has factory preserve oil on it.I may accept trades toward other guns and/ or ammo if at a really good deal. Trades would need to be in my favor or something rare that I am looking for. Multiple gun trades are welcome (low or high end guns). I prefer pistols though.If you live out of state, purchase will have to be through squaretrade or venmo to protect us both. If you have to send payment any other way, it has to go through gunbroker. We will have to do the transfer through an ffl and you will be responsible for the transfer. All state laws will be followed."

To be honest I really wanted to ""not like"" these but they are actually pretty damn great. As a former pro staff of a competitors products I was really impressed. Enough with the reviews, I will throw in a 16 gig HD card so you can record everything and also suggest you buy a batery back up for it, burns through the lion AA in an hour running everything. My other 3-14 will run on a battery pack for 2 days straight shooting prairie dogs. Add their app to your smart device and program, adjust or just let others watch what you see and shoot at. I would go to ATN web page and read up and watch some videos to help you make up your mind. You are able to store 6 different types of loads and use on 6 different weapons platforms, one shot zero, recoil activated 1080P video, still shots and audio.

428,http://www.armslist.com/posts/7001428,For Sale:  OKLAHOMA PRIVATE LAND ELK HUNTS FOR 2017-2018,"KIOWA COUNTY OKLAHOMA, Dallas, Texas",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, June 26, 2017",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"We are offering hunters the chance to harvest free-ranging elk on our ranch.
Hunts include meals and lodging.
The elk found on our ranch are free ranging descendants of those released in the Wichita Wildlife Refuge in the early 1900's by proclamation of Teddy Roosevelt. These are the same elk that hunters wait a lifetime to draw a tag for in the refuge which is only 11 miles as the crow flies from our ranch.
There's no need to drive all the way to New Mexico or Colorado as we are nestled in the Wichita Mountains in Kiowa county Oklahoma which is only 200 miles from Fort Worth, an easy 4 - 4.5 hour drive and only 2 hours from Oklahoma City.
I have a well concealed 2 person ladder stand and an established ground blind set up for a 30-50 yard shot, or you can pick a spot of your own choosing. Rifle shots can range anywhere from 30 yards out to 400 yards and beyond.
This is a fair chase hunt for free ranging animals - not a high fenced canned hunt. Therefore you must rely on your cunning and abilities to bag one of these amazing animals. This is real hunting and as such there is no guarantee that you will fill your tag but we ensure feed is available to them year-round and there are several bulls, cows and calves making regular visits.
All game regulations will be adhered to and a contract must be signed and notarized.
Those who have a lifetime license are not required to purchase an elk tag, however annual license holders and nonresidents must purchase an elk tag.
According to the Oklahoma wildlife regulations, legal bulls in our special southwest zone must have at least 5 points on at least one side and an antlerless elk is defined as any elk with no visible antlers, regardless of sex.
The hunt dates in our Special Southwest Zone are as follows:
Archery:
October 07 - October 11 2017 and
December 09 - December 13 2017
Legal bulls and antlerless elk may be harvested
Your choice of dates $3,000
 
Gun:
October 12 - October 15 2017 and
December 14 - December 17 2017
Legal bulls and antlerless elk may be harvested
Your choice of dates $3,000
 
Special antlerless elk season dates:
November 18 - December 03 2017 and
January 01 2018 - January 31 2018
Any method legal to take deer is legal during this special season
4 day hunts $1600
Additional days may be purchased at $400 per day
 
Text me for available dates.
We are family friendly so feel free to bring your spouse or children. Non-hunters accompanied by hunters will be charged $75 per day

Hunts include meals and lodging.
The elk found on our ranch are free ranging descendants of those released in the Wichita Wildlife Refuge in the early 1900's by proclamation of Teddy Roosevelt. These are the same elk that hunters wait a lifetime to draw a tag for in the refuge which is only 11 miles as the crow flies from our ranch.
There's no need to drive all the way to New Mexico or Colorado as we are nestled in the Wichita Mountains in Kiowa county Oklahoma which is only 200 miles from Fort Worth, an easy 4 - 4.5 hour drive and only 2 hours from Oklahoma City.
I have a well concealed 2 person ladder stand and an established ground blind set up for a 30-50 yard shot, or you can pick a spot of your own choosing. Rifle shots can range anywhere from 30 yards out to 400 yards and beyond.
This is a fair chase hunt for free ranging animals - not a high fenced canned hunt. Therefore you must rely on your cunning and abilities to bag one of these amazing animals. This is real hunting and as such there is no guarantee that you will fill your tag but we ensure feed is available to them year-round and there are several bulls, cows and calves making regular visits.
All game regulations will be adhered to and a contract must be signed and notarized.
Those who have a lifetime license are not required to purchase an elk tag, however annual license holders and nonresidents must purchase an elk tag.

It was built by a reputable member and seller over on the FAL Files. I put 300 rounds exactly of South African surplus 7.62x51 through it, and the previous owner put around 200 rounds of Austrian Hirtenberger surplus 7.62x51 though it, so this rifle has had around 500 rounds through it built as is. I've had it for about four years, and the guy I bought it from had been sitting on the kit since 2002-ish before building it in 2010-ish and selling it to me in 2013-ish.I am asking $1300 for the rifle and six Belgian FAL mags (these are the ones I've found after moving, I MIGHT have more and if I find them I'll update this listing but I'm like 90% I only had six). I also have 700 rounds of surplus South African 7.62x51 I'll sell with the rifle for an additional $250 or seperately for $280.

Barrel length is 5 inches and includes the muzzle compensator rise reducer, and is optics ready with a picatinny rail mount that does not block use of the iron sights.  It has 5 included magazines - 4 that holds 35 rounds and a 5th that holds 22 rounds.  This gun has the original factory case and manual.  It is in excellent working condition.  It has been treated so internals and feed ramp are teflon bonded and this will not jam even with 9mm talons.  This is a solid and dependable pistol as it has been reegineered from the ground up to be reliable.  This is the best example of this pistol ever owned and in the best condition.  It will make a fantastic addition to your collection.  I will listen to interesting trade offers, but about the only things am looking for is a Walther .22 Uzi pistol in trade.  Permit or a  CCW required.
