•FN pistol for $900.
Pistol is really nice with very little round count through it.  I have maybe shot 100 rds..  The pistol is light with a good solid, grooved grip.  Very fun to shoot.  And with the extended clips the pistol IS and looks bad a$$.  Pistol comes w/ one standard 15 rd. mag and three extended 30 rd. mags.  Four total.
 
•FN PS90 rifle for $1,000.
The rifle has had around 100 rds. through it.  It is a really cool design that may seem awkward at first, but once you shoulder the weapon the bull pup design fits nicely in your hands.  Built in iron sights, but also comes with NcStar scope.  Barrel has two rings near the muzzle.  I believe this is a newer gen model, not sure, but regardless of the generation this is a rarely used safe queen that is good to go.  Rifle comes with four 50 round mags (two mags are by American Tactical and the other two mags appear to have no name on them).I also have ammo to go with these guns or if you’re interested separately.600+ rounds of blue tip for $375and 500+ rounds of green tip for $310
- If you just want all of the ammo then it is $685
- If you want the pistol, mags, and all ammo - I’ll take $1,500 Cash
- If you want the rifle, mags, and all ammo - I’ll take $1,685 Cash
- If you want both guns, all mags, and all ammo - I’ll take $2,500
First come first served.  I need these guns gone (but I am not opposed to keeping these fine weapons) and I will not come down in price anymore.

Winchester designed their SXP Waterfowl Pump-Action Shotgun with the waterfowl hunter in mind. The entire gun is dipped in Realtree Max-5 camo, a pattern with a blend of cattails, reeds, cane, and grasses, that disappears into most any waterfowl habitat. The SXP pump shotgun utilizes a rotary bolt with an inertia-assisted action to provide super fast follow-up shots on missed birds or for shooting multiple targets. 4 massive lugs on the bolt provide incredible strength with a solid lockup. The dual steel slide bars eliminate twisting and binding when cycling the action. The field proven SXP pump shotgun fires all factory 2-3/4"", 3"", and 3-1/2"" length shotshells, with steel, tungsten, bismuth, and lead loads. The durable synthetic stock has texturing on the forend and pistol grip for a non-slip grip in any weather. The SXP Hybrid Waterfowl Pump-Action Shotgun comes with an Inflex Technology recoil pad which helps direct and channel recoil impulse, moving the comb down and away from your cheek; while a hard heel insert on the pad makes shouldering the buttstock snag free. The SXP Waterfowl comes with a Truglo fiber optic front sight that's quick to pick up in any light. The bore is hard chrome plated and back-bored for improved patterns, and uses the interchangeable Invector-Plus choke tube system. Includes 3 chokes: F, M, IC.SXP rotary boltInertia-assisted actionDual steel slide barsDurable synthetic stockInflex Technology recoil padDipped in Realtree MAX-5 camoBack-bored and chrome plated boreUses Invector-Plus choke tubesTruglo fiber optic sight3-1/2"" chamber"

- Anderson Lower- Aero Precision upper- Tapco Lower Parts Kit- Anderson Bolt Carrier group- Magpul stock on a mil-spec buffer tube- BCM Gun Fighter Mod 4 charging handle- BCM 16"" M4 profile barrel- BCM low profile gas block- 3 prong flash hider- No name 15"" quad rail- Magpul grip- Metal vertical Grip- Sling adpater back plateThe rifle also comes with the following- Two 30 round magpul gen 2 PMAGS- One 30 round polymer Mag of another brand- Plano gunguard case- Single point sling- 70 rounds of green tip- I also have more ammo that will go with it but I do not know the exact round count.  Probably another 50 - 100.  THE BAD:
The only negative thing I can say about the gun is the coating.  I put a spray on duracoat and it just didn't go well.  It had rubbed off in some areas and there are runs on other parts.  That being said if you plan on having it coated or just don't care what your gun looks like then it's not an issue.  Either way I'm going to set the price low. 
 
I know the coating and the fact this is a custom rifle can turn people off so I will let it all go for $600.  Will not split up.  I fired 90 rounds through this rifle just today including a mag dump.  The rifle shoots flawlessly."

Gun has only a few minor surface scratches from being tossed in range bag and rubbing against other magazines, ear pro, etc. Night sights are quite bright (camera red eye light interfered with capturing this, but I included the pic to show it did indeed have night sights).Comes with 2-10 round magazines (10 and 14 round mags are available from Sig and aftermarket) and a hidden hybrid holster. Gun was never carried.Has the coveted Sig E2 slim grips with sandpaper texture that are very comfortable.This gun has been fired 300-400 rounds between us. I enjoy the way it shoots, but it has been unused in safe for too long and I'd rather make room for something else. This model is compatable with most P226 accessories, and is essentially a 226 in .45ACP. The grip and feel difference between this and a 226 are barely noticeable. Please let me know if you have any questions.$700 to GA resident with CCW permit"

came from the factory with the correct Civil War Era proof marks,
This is a Signature Series rifle made in the 1980s, through the Colt Black-powder Arms Company. This is a black-powder percussion rifle.
IRC, the very first of the ""Colt"" SM1861's were hand-made by an N-SSA lad circa 1988-1989ish. That fell apart, but a short while later, circas 1995 Colt reoffered the SM1861. The original vision was for a limited edition (1995 to 1998 ) rather than a true mass production run.
Colt advertised them as a Colt product, made in the U.S.A

I used this gun when teaching firearms classes and as a daily carry. I have picked up a G19 G4 and I will let this one go to a new home. It has some slide finish wear from holster and range bag. It has Truglo Tritium Fiber Optic sights. The trigger guard has been professionally rounded, undercut and smoothed for easier carry. The Trigger pull has been reduced to about 4.5 lbs. All parts are Original Glock Parts. I shot this gun in the GSSF a few times.  It has a factory Glock extended magazine release and slide release also. It will come with two factory magazines and Glock case. I will also include a Fobus paddle holster. This is a nice shooting gun and is in very good shape. I dont usually sell any of my guns but this guy deserves a good home I would consider trading for a G17 G4 or G34 G4 plus some cash. No lowball offers. Price is firm. It has too much in upgrades to be sold for less. The sights alone are $95. It has been taken very good care of and since I have 4 G19's this one would be good for a beginner or experienced shooter that wants an advanced pistol."

It is NOT a Tec-DC9. This is the real deal. This particular gun has a low serial number (4-digit 84xx)!!!! and milled sights. Later Tec-9's and the Tec-DC9's had stamped sights. She is in excellent condition with only a few light handling marks. Threaded barrel for whatever you want to screw on it haha.. Has not been shot very much. This comes with a 36 round mag that is in excellent condition as well. The milled sights signifies that this was manufactured before 1986, so it's over 30 years old. Intratec is out of business, so these will never be made again. This is a great collector's item that is fun as hell at the range. Comment and send me a message if interested. I will give you my phone number and we can discuss the transaction there. She is beautiful and these mini threaded versions with the milled sights are rare. $499 obo"
