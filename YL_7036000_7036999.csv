The outcome is a firearm with superior suppression capability and enhanced reliability with both supersonic and subsonic loads A two-position gas block makes the transition from subsonic to supersonic as fast as flipping the lever. Changing between 300BLK and 5.56 NATO is as simple as swapping barrels and magazines in a matter of minutes. Converting to 7.62x39mm simply requires barrel, magazine, as well as an additional bolt change. Each SIG MCX features an aluminum KeyMod handguard, AR-style lower controls and utilizes polymer magazines. A revolutionary recoil system does not require a buffer tube, allowing for side-folding stocks. A picatinny top rail allows for the mounting of lights or optics. The aluminum forend allows for rail sections to be added where they are needed, permitting the attachment of accessories. The lower receiver offers familiar AR-style controls. Completely ambidextrous controls include the safety, magazine release and charging handle."

It shoots All Brands ammo without any issues in fact it seems to really love the wolf steel cased Russian Surplus 45 ammo. Only reason I am selling this gun is it is a second for me as I have a Flat Dark Earth with the threaded barrel and RMR attached. This gun comes with 3 mags and a factory case and for back straps. This guns around count is under 250 rounds as I shoot the suppressed 45 much more often. If you want the ultimate in a high-capacity firearm with multiple carry modes this is the gun for you.

May include my Blackhawk holster. *Kahr Arms// Worcester, MA gun manufacturer *Double-Action-Only Trigger*lightest, most compact .45 ACP pistol available for such major caliber.*five-round magazine and 3.1-inch barrel*Polygonal Bore*Stainless steal slideBeing Brand New, Kahr has REALLY tight tolerances. Manual says it should be “broken in“ by first firing 200 rounds through it. I previously owned the 2nd generation Kahr PM 45 and experienced several failures to extract for the first 3-400 rounds. The Tarnished, older ammunition may stick to the chamber walls creating stovepipes. I found the best ammunition to be the Hornady hallow points. The right rear corner of the magazine's polymer bumper base has a sharp corner, The heavier the hollow points gave me a heavier recoil.The magazine corner can be painful, it dug into my skin for the first year or so. Also, the slide is difficult to sling shot. Prob wasn't designed for females. I've carried this weapon brand 11 years, I won't carry anything but."

This rifle isn't a build, it is all factory with nothing but the trigger springs replaced to reduce the trigger pull. It was a ten minute job that anyone can do and did not alter the mechanics of the rifle.  Now, this is the 2nd Generation spring kit from JP, as the first Generation kit from JP had reported problems on the internet regarding difficulty firing extremely hard primer ammo. So I did my research first before buying a spring kit and this 2nd gen kit that they produced remedied hard primer ammo problems altogether. It fires everything, all of the time, with half of the trigger pull. It has proved to be the best modification I have ever performed on a rifle. My accuracy was greatly improved, as only about half of the pressure is now required to clear the trigger sear; about 4.5 pounds.Rifle is like new and I have had it to the range maybe 5 times, fired about 100 rounds each trip. Zero malfunctions, ever.Comes with a new Red/Green multi reticle holographic type red dot sight.This is a great shooter, looks new and feels great.Im selling it because I need the money, so I can't consider any trades....unless you have something so great I just can't turn it down."

Young Billy Dixon and 27 other buffalo hunters were surrouned by more than 500 indian warriors. One medicine man told the warriors that his medicine would make them invisible to the bullets of the White eyes. When Billy fired his 45-90 Sharps rifle and knocked the Medicine man off his horse at 1538 yds the Indians left with haste.   The only improvement I have done was install a Malcom Scope.  This rifle has proven it will kill a 375 lb buffalo at 410 yds.  Rifle is in great shape. I can send as many pics as you like.   Will post pics this weekend.The basic rifle sales for $1,800.00.  Plus tax.     When you add the Malcom Scope your cost would be cost to $1,900.00"
