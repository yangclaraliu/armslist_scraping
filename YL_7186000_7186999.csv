There is a Rogers stock that allows you to lock in a position other than the normal 5 or 6 that you find in most AR's, you also get a 13"" Key-Mod Handguard, 1:7 twist (which is a nice upgrade in giving you at least 2 full rotations before the bullet leaves the barrel) Also has a forward assist that is found in most higher end rifles.The Omni Hybrid lower features a patented hammer and trigger pin retainment system, preventing movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing. Along with an over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin. This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear take-down pin thus increasing strength and durability from recoil and consistent firing.
