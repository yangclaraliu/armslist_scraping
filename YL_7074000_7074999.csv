The price reflects these faults.  This rifle was made around 1967 as far as I can tell.  They were not mass produced so they are hard to find.  Comes with period correct Pachmayr swing mount.  Cash is king but I am also interested in other rifles and pistols.   I have too many 30-06s and this one just sits in the safe.  $600 obo. Will meet half way if outside of the area.  Thank you. Text or email.  501-4two two-1five1nine. I need this gone!"

The HK91, like the HK41, was also marketed to civilians however, in order to comply with US firearm regulations, slight modifications had to be made to the HK91 to prevent full-auto customizations. Today, the HK91 model is a highly sought-after collector item due to the limited amount of imported rifles that made it to the US. Comes with two 20 round mags.

It has a notched rear sight, ramped front sight, and 4"" heavy barrel with a bright shiny bore and cylinder chambers.This classic S&W revolver is in excellent operating and good aesthetic condition. It was a law enforcement trade-in and was hand-selected from the shop's inventory as a limited use gun with not many rounds put through it, but there are some minor cosmetic marks from carry and storage. I had the gun's side plate off and cleaned the internals before oiling them and replacing the side plate. That helped improve an already smooth trigger and added to my accuracy with the gun.I have fired 150 problem-free rounds of factory .38 Special 130 grain factory ammunition through it since I acquired it. This revolver is versatile as it is dependable and durable enough to carry or use as a house/vehicle gun.

Serial number PA 65158 (PA stands for Pederson Automatic) indicating the gun was made in 1923-1925.  John Pederson worked for Remington and was a rival designer to John Browning in this time era of the early 1900's.   These guns were made from 1918-1927. There were 65'000 plus of these guns made. Originally, there were 55,000 offered in 380 cal and later there were 10,000 plus offered in 32 cal. This gun has the Remington trademark engraved on the right side of the frame and an anchor proof mark on the right side of the trigger guard. The bluing is still at 95%-98%. There are some reflections from the flash on my camera making it look like the bluing is worn on the slide, but this is not the case. The barrel is perfect and shiny. The grips are perfect with no cracks or chips. There are three safety's on the pistol. There is a magazine safety that prevents the gun from firing when the magazine is removed, a second manual safety, and a third grip safety similar to a 1911. Collectors and owners of this gun describe it as having perfect ergomics in the way it fits your hand. It has been called a self aiming pistol. General George S. Patton was given one of these guns and carried it in his waistband or in a pocket holster in his rear pocket. He had custom grips made with 3 ivory Starrs and later 4 stars when he was promoted. He called it his insurance gun. There is no rust or pitting on the guninternally or externally. It appears to have been fired very little in the last 90 plus years. This is a perfect addition to anyone's collection."

I bought this testing station and built a sound reducing box to put it in. The box reduces the noise by about 50 decibels. It is great for use in an indoor shop. The photo of the DB meter is a 120db airhorn with the door open and then closed, you can see it reduces the noise to about 70 DB. It doesn't make it sound proof, and if you fire a semi auto into it you will still hear the action pretty loud but definitely makes it quieter and more comfortable for others in the shop.This is a great bullet trap, it is easy to use and clean, and requires very little maintance. This one has never been used, I am selling this because I bought an extra one and just don't have room to keep it. I paid over 2000 shipped and spent another 400 on materials for the enclosure (MDF Board, Green Glue and Mass Loaded Vinyl is not cheap). Works very well, my loss is your gain.  Local pickup or buyer arranges freight. I will crate it up and send dimensions to buyer"
