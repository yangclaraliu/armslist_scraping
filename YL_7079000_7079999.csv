It is pinned and recessed and has most options that were available from Smith and Wesson at that time including target grips, hammer, and trigger.

Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol? The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there. The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there. The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger. Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

These are NOT the Pakistani Ordnance Factory marked POF. And these are NOT the British Aerospace mags are marked EN.   This magazine is ORIGIANL GEMAAN H&K FACTORY MADE.  Whether you buy ours or not Please be careful  I have read through a lot of auctions and they state Factory or H&K OEM and they are NOT GERMAN made.   If you are looking for the Great German Craftsmanship, you want these mags.  
Just for your information when purchasing H&K MP5 HK 94 magazines  here is a brief list of things you should know, Some of the H&K listed mags are made in Pakistan, POF, Pakistani Ordnance Factory mags were not marked other than being stamped 9 x 19. Later Paki mags were stamped POF and 9x19 on the body.    Turkish H&K mags are marked MKE and 9x 19 and British Aerospace H&K mags are marked EN,  if I remember correctly. Korean, made in Korea by a military NATO approved manufacturer, sometimes marked ATI or KC or they have a numerical date code on them.  HK NEVER produced any 40rd straight or curved mags for the MP5
 Note the picture with the “Made in Germany” imprinted
Blue Steel and Stainless Steel Follower. These are the best H&K mags on the market. Not only do they function flawlessly, they have a Collector value. there were only a finite / limited number of these produced and they are no longer in production .  I have not seen another one of these for sale anywhere.  
These mags are not new  they some were and usage age on them. There is some small tarnish on some.  Springs and followers are excellent.  A must for any serious H&K COLLECTOR or ENTHUSIAST Priced for Fast Sale
