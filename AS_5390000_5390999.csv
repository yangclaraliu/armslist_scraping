Not perfect, but in great shape overall. This gun was manufactured in the 80's by Group Industries, a company that no longer exists. However Vector Arms (a quality, current production Uzi manufacturer) now builds their Uzi's using Group Industires' recievers.These semi auto Group Industries are pretty rare, and I am told that one in this green color is also rare (as opposed to black). I am not sure of the exact round count but it's relatively low. This gun has the full size barrel and is chambered in 9mm. They also make barrels and bolts that allow you to shoot .45 acp or .22lr out of this gun.Comes with a sling and four magazine repair kits-(2) 25rd and (2) 32rd. I could throw in a little ammo for the right trade.I value this gun in the neighborhood of $1,200 but I'd prefer to trade it. If your trade is not worth what this gun is worth, let me know much cash you can add on top. I would trade for older Colt or S&W revolvers, 1911's, quality AK's (or cheaper AK/SKS's with cash), an M1 Garand, an M1a, FAL, or G3 configuration, a semi auto 7.62x54. Possibly open to other stuff too. US made tools, ammo, Ford big block parts.

It will have a 3 screw frame and a pinned barrel. The dash 3 was in production from 1967 until 1977.These are very fine target .22 revolvers - some say the best production .22 revolver made in America. They tend to be very accurate and are extremely durable guns.The K-22 was part of Smith & Wesson's Masterpiece series, introduced after WWII (in 1947)."

After I received it I realized that it doesn't mount up in the rear properly with the Zhukov folding Magpul buttstock. It appears that this will work with most if not all of the AK variants with that rear tang buttstock screw.This is from UTG and is quality made, thus the price. This is NOT that cheap NCStar rail that screws into the dust cover and doesn't hold zero. This mounts in the front to the rear sight (after removing the flip up sight blade, the front of this rail snaps into replace it) and the included mount screws into the rear buttstock tang and the scope mount clicks into that mount. There are plenty of Youtube vidoes for install of this UTG scope rail. No box or instructions, just the rail, the rear mount and the mounting screw.

This is the forerunner to the .38 special we know today. This particular revolver is a .38/200 British Service Revolver made by Smith and Wesson in the USA. It has a 5 inch pinned barrel and was made somewhere around 1943. Most of these revolvers went to England around this time but there are no proof marks on this to suggest a military or export model. It has the original grips. It does not have the ""V"" serial number prefix or the ""US Property"" mark meaning it was most likely a civilian model. I never lettered it from Smith and Wesson to find out any details since it was bound to be a restoration piece for me. This gun was never converted to .38 special after the war like a lot were and is chambered for the .38 S&W (short .38). According to experts the serial number puts it in the range of the later hardened steel cylinders so if you decided to shoot this beauty it can take modern .38 S&W ammo, NOT .38 Special though!
