The gun is very nice and also has the talon grips installed on it, so it's comfortable in the hand. If I had to put a value on it, with the grips and everything, I'd put it somewhere around 400-425$ only because it is missing the second magazine (not the end of he world, you can find them anywhere). I'm perfectly fine keeping this gun and adding it to my collection, simply because it is truly a nice piece... however, I would entertain trades for another 9mm, .45, or a centerfire rifle. I'm wide open to ideas and will respond to all offers, but I will not throw in cash on my end. I'm looking for a straight trade. Message me or text me if interested. Thanks! REDACTED"

Check the reviews on YouTube to see how people are raving about them. The gun comes with the black grips and the wood grips. It comes with 3 10 round mags. This is my only 40 caliber gun so if you buy the gun I'll make you a good deal on some ammo of you want it. If not no big deal. The gun retails for around 449 and only comes with one mag. I was able to find two more mags at 30 bucks each and the wood grips were hand made by a grip maker in Serbia where this pistol was made and cost $80 bucks. It's not your typical cheap copy or clone it is very well made and if I don't sell it for my asking price it won't hurt my feelings to keep it. I'm mainly looking to sell but I would be willing to trade for a Taurus 24/7 OSS or a Taurus PT145 or a Taurus PT1911 or a Canik TP9SF.

The gun has been fired fewer than 50 rounds. The PA-10 is a nice gun and a good platform, just not really my cup of tea. My wife has asked me to sell a few guns, so this is one I'm looking to sell.Includes:-PSA cardboard box.-One 20-round Magpul magazine.-Eighteen inch stainless barrel.-Adjustable stock. For a little extra, I could include either nice flip-up iron rear sights,  a Bushnell TRS-25 Red Dot with riser rail,  or a Sightron 3x9x40 scope. I also have more magazines and some ammo I could add to the deal for less than they'd cost you elsewhere, if interested.  I can send more info and pics upon request. All sights and mags are LNIB and were lightly used. The ammo is milsurp. Asking $700 OBO.  Cash or certified funds only.  If you think my price is too low, snatch it up. If you think my price is too high, send me a reasonable offer, and I'll listen. I prefer cash but am willing to consider trades. I particularly like SIG handguns - especially the P226 with manual safety (yes, I know most have a decocker). All laws will be followed, and I will prepare a bill of sale.  I don't have a burning need to sell it, so I won't consider unreasonable low-balls. I'm an attorney, so please don't waste my time or yours with scam attempts. In the event of a trade, I have a concealed carry permit. FTF in Triangle. I will not ship, so don't bother asking. I will ask to see a concealed carry permit or a pistol purchase permit, but I will not keep your pistol purchase permit, since it is not required for a rifle purchase. I just want to make sure the gun is going to a responsible home.  Thanks for looking. I will respond to all reasonable inquries, so fire away!"

It has about 50 shells through it, gun cycled every shell I put through perfectly with zero problems, (light 2.75"" 1oz #7.5 shot, to a couple 3"" Kent #4's, also a box of Rio 7.5's). Recoil is fantastic, probably the lightest recoil 12 I've ever shot. However this gun is heavy for me, its only 7.75 lbs, which isnt bad. But after shooting and moving around with the gun, I think im going back to my 20ga to hike around the dove field, and I was hoping this would replace it. Still have the box, and everything that came with the gun. Will post pictures when I get a chance. Will not ship gun. Got a pretty good deal on the gun, just looking to get my money back out of it. thank you. ~Current photos are for reference only"
