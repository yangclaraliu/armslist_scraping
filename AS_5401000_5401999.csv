It has Hogue rubberized grips, which feel amazing and won't slip even when wet. It has an ambidextrous safety, an extended beaver tail, a skeltonized hammer, and a two-piece, full length guide rod. The sights are target style and perfect for most types of shooting. The trigger breaks right at 4.4lbs and has a very short take up.This is no safe queen. I bought it used and have run it hard. It has scratches and wear marks. That being said, it is accurate and reliable. The only issue I've ever head with it are two cheap magazines and cheap hollow points. It eats Hornaday or Tula just as easy. Included with the gun is a small thing of RemOil, a Feild and Stream .44/.45 cleaning kit, a Wilson Combat bushing wrench, and an Avid 1911 bushing wrench. Five magazines are included. The two blued ones are Springfeild 7 rounders and have never failed me. The larger one is a ProMag 10 rounder. The two stain less steel ones are Ruger 7 rounders and don't like hollow points for some reason. It's not a big deal, they're just range mags.Ammunition includes:-20 rounds of Hornaday 180gr Critical Defense that I use for carry. They're great polymer filled hollow points that feed like FMJ.-8 rounds of Remington Golden Saber. -45 rounds of Tula 230gr FMJ.-85 rounds of Federal factory reloaded 230gr FMJ.All for just $600.If interested I can also include the holster for just another $50. The holster is an Alien Gear. This is the most comfortable holster I've ever worn. You forget you're wearing it sometimes. You can conceal a full frame 1911 with just jeans and a tee-shirt. It has a neoprene backing so you don't sweat from it and it's fully adjustable for ride height, cant, and retention. Even better is that you can send the shell to the company and request a differnt one for free.All of this together makes for a great starting package for someone looking to carry or just have a decent gun without having to go buy everything it needs. Please text five7three-6four4-three2zero if interested."

It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand: considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination. Flawless Fit and Finish While not as elaborately decorated as our premium shotguns, the Silver Pigeon I has all the elegance that you can expect from a Beretta. The oil-finished stock sports a beautiful and crisp checkering pattern, and the schnabel fore-end adds to the classic flavor of this over-under. The scroll-engraved receiver is a functional work of art in itself, with its interesting geometry blending perfectly with the stock and contributing to the gun’s graceful lines.

The Standard Series is a faithful semi-auto only recreation of the original M14. Keep in mind that the Standard M1A™ is as well suited for a day at the range as it is for filling that special place in your military collection. All the design features that the Armed Services found essential for a battle rifle make the Standard M1A™ a great shooter. The windage and elevation adjustable rear sight minimizes the effort required to zero the rifle. The two-stage military trigger, detachable box magazine, op-rod and roller cam bolt call to mind the rich history of the M1A™ while providing functional ease of operation and legendary reliability. You may be looking for a special addition to your collection, or you may be looking for a hard-working rifle that will pull duty on the range, in the treestand or in your truck.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design. The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect. If your mission requirements call for a compact tactical rifle, but won’t let you sacrifice power, you need the SOCOM 16. Bring Enough Gun™.

886,http://www.armslist.com/posts/5401886,For Sale:  Lakeside Razorback Beltfed Rifle & Accessories,"Northeast, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 5,000","Listed On: Wednesday, April 20, 2016",Rifles,no type,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The Razorback Upper sold for $5025 on Gunbroker and only included the upper and accessories. http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=540104055. If you want to buy mine for $5000 which is rarer and probably shot much less, and more complete, let me know. :-) Mine is a complete rifle with the accessories and not just an upper receiver. (Or I can sell just the upper & accessories with no lower or ammo.)  Cash, sports cars, hot rods?? (Although I want the cash for a project, I will consider trades (hot rods, classic luxury cars, sports cars) of a higher value. Want more on my part? Ask me and I'll show you what I have to trade.)  What is the Lakeside Razorback? The Lakeside Razorback is a beltfed semiautomatic rifle that shoots 22LR ammo. It is like the Ares Shrike (another belt-fed), but much cheaper to shoot since it shoots 22LR. Many people shoot these as automatics. There are several videos on YouTube that show how they work and how much fun they are. The guy that made these (Eric) retired. They are not making anymore. He is still available for questions through their forums on their website. Evidently these are going up in value, otherwise there is no way this would have sold for over $5000 on Gunbroker for just the upper and accessories.   What I have: Lakeside Razorback Anniversary Edition Complete Rifle. Only 70 of these Anniversary Edition Uppers were made. They have the 2001-2011 imprinted on them. (There were 100 produced of the uppers in the gunbroker ad referenced above.) My rifle has the stainless steel barrel. I'm not sure how many of the 70 had these barrels. (That 70 would include pistols & rifles, so there were probably very few with this barrel.)  I have only brought my rifle to the range twice to shoot. That is all. It's in perfect or near perfect condition.   I have 2 of the advanced rebuild kits. (In the Gunbroker ad, the seller only had 1 and I don't think it was the advanced kit.)  I have the belt reload kit which aids in the loading of belts (also seen in the gunbroker ad). This is also sold out and hard to find.   My rifle has a vertical foregrip/bipod.  My lower receiver is manufactured by CMMG. It is included in the purchase. (In the Gunbroker ad, the purchase price did not include the lower receiver.) I can give you everything except the lower with payment,  but transfer of the lower receiver will be through the FFL.  Some of my belts are brand new & never opened. I have Qty 7 (seven) 200 round belts (3 are used with ammo currently loaded, 4 new & sealed), Qty 2 (two) 100 round belts (1 used with ammo, 1 new & sealed) and Qty 2 (two) 50 round belt (both new & sealed). The ammo that are loaded into the belts are included in this sale. The ammo is CCL Blazer & MiniMags.  I believe the buttstock is a VLTOR Enhanced Modular Stock. (It says VLTOR on the bottom.)  The optics is a red dot site. I believe I have a spare new battery that I will include, if I have it.   I will include the AR15 rifle case that I am using, if you want it. (Not shown in pictures.)  The cloth belts are sold out and not being made anymore. It can be hard to find this rifle with as many belts as I have. And since I have new belts, that is harder to find. Links would be the only option to buy after the cloth belts. I do not have links because I wanted the ease of the cloth belts.  I believe that the accessories is what helped to sell that rifle on Gunbroker. The cloth belts and belt reloading kit are sold out and probably extremely hard to find.  (I have both with my rifle purchase.)I can provide more pictures through email.  I do not need to sell. You can low ball me, but I probably won't accept. If you have interesting trade or a trade with cash, feel free to email me. I might be interested. (Total value of your trade/offer should be more than $5500.)  Be ready for elections. There WILL be last minute panic on all guns that have more than standard capacity. If you sell at that time, you could make a very nice profit."
