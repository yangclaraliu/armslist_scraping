135,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3557135,For Sale:  HK VP9,"BLUFFTON, South Carolina, United States",$ 670,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 1, 2014",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014."

How could the enduring design that is the 1911 be improved? Springfield Armory® answered that question in 2007 with the introduction of the Enhanced Micro Pistol™. The EMP® changes what a compact 1911 can be.

The action of the EMP® is 1/8 inch shorter than that of the original 1911. This translates into several concrete advantages for the shooter. The shorter grip radius produces a shockingly comfortable shooting experience. You have to shoot the EMP® to believe how controllable it is. The shorter dimensions also work to increase reliability – something that’s crucial in a concealed carry pistol. And of course, the overall dimensions are one of the smallest 1911s out there.

The good news doesn’t stop with the innovative design. The EMP® comes loaded with all the features you expect in a 1911 of this class – like low profile 3-Dot tritium combat sights and a match grade fully supported and ramped barrel. And with 9+1 rounds of 9mm or 8+1 rounds of .40 SW, the EMP® packs an amazing amount of punch in one of the smallest 1911s ever.

If you’re looking for a 1911 to carry with you every day, look no further than the Springfield Armory® EMP®. Sometimes innovation changes everything.

Me too.  Only I have too many!  I got this to replace my P2000sk.  Sold the sk because the grip was too short, plus it was a .40 and I prefer 9mm in smaller pistols.  The P2000 is only slightly longer and taller than the subcompact (less than one-half inch by length and just about that in height).  Weight is only 1 oz. more.  Perfect for EDC.

I have only put about 150 rounds through.  Comes with two 13+1 mags, box, etc.  I have had it less than two months. The SA trigger pull is really sweet and recoil is what you want in a 9mm - low.  

Being the compulsive sort, I buy more guns than I can shoot!  I have about seven other smaller guns, so since I cannot carry them all -- or at least at the same time :-), I have to periodically cull the herd.

Finish is still perfect on this P2000 -- not even broken in yet.  Also, I just dropped the price to as low as I will go; please consider as ""take it or leave it.""  (I am sure some knucklehead will still ask for a lower price.)  I just want recoup as much as I can.  You are essentially getting a new gun.

All Illinois laws followed, cash only, NO TRADES. For those of you that think ""no trades"" means ""maybe"", it simply means no, nein, non, nyet.  Thanks.

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide (elderly, those with arthritis, small women etc...). You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. Taurus also makes a small caliber tip barrel design, but has a much heavier trigger (due to being double action). The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00. I never had any type of malfunction/misfire with the Raven."

The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Less is more. Many shooters with small hands are forced to carry a revolver for self-defense because the grip of a semiautomatic is too large. Enter the Aegis®, a 9 mm pistol that combines the real-world advantages of a 1911 in a platform with a smaller grip.

Small, light and accurate pistols get carried. Bulky guns get left home. Light weight, compact and absolutely reliable, Aegis® models are built in the Kimber Custom Shop for shooters with small hands. Thin grips, altered controls and rounded edges make them easy to shoot. A great single-stage 1911 trigger that breaks clean at 4-5 pounds makes them easy to shoot accurately. Standard features include night sights, 30-lines-per inch front strap checkering and a premium two-tone KimPro II finish that is both self-lubricating and extremely resistant to moisture. Self-defense is no place to compromise. Carry the best. Carry a Kimber Aegis®.

A tribute to attributes. Specialized features are the hallmark of the Compact and Pro Carry families. Some have shorter grips and light weight aluminum frames—even night sights and the Kimber Tactical Rail. All have shorter 4-inch barrels that make them easy to carry.

Chambered in .45 ACP, 9 mm and 38 Super, Kimber mid-size pistols are an ideal compromise of size and weight. With a variety of options and features, they cover every need from duty and concealed carry to home defense. More importantly, these pistols do not compromise quality or dependability. The Tacoma, Washington, P.D. extensively tested Pro Carry models, finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years. They checked the records, comparing Kimber not only with other pistols, but with rifles and shotguns as well. When you carry a Kimber, you carry with absolute confidence.

Cure for the common pistol. Built in the Kimber Custom Shop, Raptor .45 ACPs take their name from dynamic slide and frame serrations, feathered logo grips and finish accents. While the design theme is unique, performance is exactly what shooters expect from Kimber—unequaled.

Raptor .45 ACP pistols come in a variety of sizes and finishes, each loaded with Custom Shop features that ensure dependability and accuracy. Night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety, bumped and grooved grip safety and match grade barrel, chamber and trigger are standard. Ultra models have 3-inch barrels and aluminum frames, making them easy to carry and conceal. Larger models are available in either steel or stainless steel, making them ideal for everything from duty to competition and home defense. The quality of Kimber Custom Shop pistols is on par with that of America’s top pistolsmiths. Pick up a Raptor. See for yourself.

Stock # SP COMM. Serial # 354xx. This is an antique single shot, lever action Marlin-Ballard lever action rifle, chambered for .25/20. (We believe 25-20 SS) The rifle has a 26 ½” octagon barrel, the front sight has been removed, and mounts for a Unertil-type scope have been added to the rear of the barrel – not surprising, as the Marlin-Ballard was often used in competition target shooting, as well as hunting. Despite the addition of the scope mounts the adjustable flip-up peep-type tang sight was not removed and is still quite functional. The receiver has been buffed, and the markings are almost totally obscured. There is also freckling on the receiver, and all the casehardening is gone. The rifle’s wooden stocks have probably been re-done, they have a few minor scratches, and look pretty good. The rifle has a Stevens marked barrel-with very crisp bore with strong rifling, the lever action works smoothly, and trigger pull is smooth as well. Ballard rifles are not often encountered, and this would be a nice one for your collection. We do not have any accessories for this gun. This is an antique firearm – with a copy of your Drivers License, establishing that you are over age 21, we can ship the gun direct to your home,"

The stainless steel slide and barrel are CNC machined from solid bar stock for precise tolerances. With loaded magazines, each of these handguns weighs less than one pound. They both measure 5.5 inches long and have a 2.75-inch barrel. The minimal weight and length of these guns, combined with the short single action trigger, grip designs, frame designs and firing pin safety block make these firearms ideal for personal protection.

Also includes a extra recoil spring for firing lower velocity ammo, and an extra pair of sight screws ($10 value). That's over a $460 value for $345 OBO - Less than the cost of the kit alone if ordered elsewhere.
  The installation procedure takes  30 seconds, plus you can save 35 ¢ on each round fired. Just think, you will pay for your conversion kit after firing just a few bricks of .22LR ammo.
This kit comes with both the standard sight rail and target scope mount rail version.  The 1911 Target Conversion Kit is our most accurate conversion kit.  The barrel is fixed solid to the frame with the sights mounted to the barrel.  Accuracy is not affected by the movement of the slide, and is super accurate with a red dot or small scope.
 EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF the 1911 TARGET CONVERSION KIT
 1 ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
Target models use Champion adjustable sights. 
 2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique magazine design and patented heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR conversion kits.
 3.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 4140 steel.
 4.  THE 30 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your 1911 pistol. Simply remove the 1911 magazine and slide as outlined in your 1911 owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, insert the slide stop pin and tighten guide rod. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.
 This procedure can be accomplished in less than 30 seconds with some practice.
 COMPATIBILITY OF OUR 1911 CONVERSION KITS
 Our 1911 .22LR Conversion kit is designed to fit any full size 1911-A1 frame made to U.S. government msil-specs.  I used this kit with my Sig Sauer Tacops 1911, and it's a tack driver using CCI Mini Mags .22 ammo.  This is a great way to get trigger time on your 1911 with much cheaper ammo. Highly recommend Remington ""Golden Bullets"" for everyday plinking and CCI MiniMags or Federal Automatch for better accuracy.  I accept payment through PayPal to: REDACTED.  Thanks!"

45 ACP 5"" 8+1 w/Heinie Sights
I bought this new...came with one mag...this one will have 2.
It has been modified to Model 70 style...which is: remove the firing pin block and spring assembly from the slide; install frame spacer. Trigger pull is now nice 4.5 # safety is still solid and holds.
Original parts come with pistol if you want to convert back.
I put ~100 rounds of various ammo through this and had no problems.
If you want to buy a new one...please do not bore me with what you may find cheaper.
My price is $500 and is firm...thanks.
Pick this up face to face Annandale, MN 
I will need to see ID and you sign bill of sale.

Here are some prices as of today...not that it matters....just as reference.

They were ready to steal all your cool stuff. Unfortunately for them, your valuables were locked up in a quality safe purchased from and installed by Parker's Safes and Vaults. www.parkerssafesandvaults.com
 They found your safe and began attacking it with pry bars and hammers. They quickly determined that your safe wasn't like the common imported safes. Bad guy #1 said, ""Let's just take the whole safe with us and cut it open in my garage!"" Bad guy #2 said, ""Heck yeah!"" They tried moving it, but it wouldn't budge because it was properly anchored to your floor. Then they got mad. They beat on the safe and used crowbars to pry around the door. They couldn't get in, but made a real mess of your safe. All the paint around the door was chipped and the lock was busted. They ran out of time so they grabbed your toaster on the way out of your house and fled. You came home, and immediately noticed that your toaster was missing. ""Oh no, what about the safe?"" you said. A quick look and you saw that it was intact but damaged. You called the police and filed a report. Then you called Parker's Safes. Great news! Your safe is covered under the manufacturers warranty and you'll be getting a new safe! And you lived happily ever after...

 I know, I probably shouldn't quit my day job and become a writer. Fortunately for you though, my day job is selling and delivering safes and vault doors!

 If you'd like a quality safe to protect what you treasure, call Aaron with Parker's Safes and Vaults. We'll help you find the safe that best meets your needs and budget, bring it to you and install it discretely without big logos on our trucks and anchor it down for you. And if you're ever in the situation where you need to file a warranty claim, we'll help you with that.

It is in excellent condition restored condition and always insides! Not even any dust on it! We believe there are only a couple like this in the USA.

The Finnish technical Manuel is included. It is demilitarized to BATF specifications, but ""not destroyed"" as it was done by the Finland Defense Force and accepted by BATF!

The breech block is tack welded to front half breech and back half tack welded to breech block, so easy to disassemble. Should be fairly easy to make functional. The breech is cut to BATF specifications, but cuts made so not to cut vital holes. A hole cut in compression chamber as required by BATF and small metal rod is inserted through the barrel. It is easy fix if you don't plan to shoot an actual 76mm round but want to make smoke and noise with blank rounds or could be sub-caliber to .50 easily!

Technically this semi-automatic pistol is trademarked under the name “Five-seveN"" as a homage to manufacturer FN Herstal. The FN Five Seven was developed alongside the FN P90 but was released later (in 1998). Originally only available to law enforcement and military buyers, the FN Five Seven has been available to civilian markets since 2004. Like its counterpart the FN P90, the FN Five Seven today is lightweight, has ambidextrous controls, relatively low recoil with its corresponding FN 5.7x28mm cartridge and can pierce body armor with some types of ammunition."

This is a brand new pistol unfired by me (I assume it was test fired at the factory). This is a 9MM pistol. The pistol comes NIB with all it came with as new. One 17 round magazine is included but I have 4 NIB Mec-Gar 17 rounders that I will sell for $20 each. This is a helluva lot of gun for the money!

I was under the assumption that RIA would not make these in a 40SW but just a week or so after I bought this one, they are now selling the 40SW version.

These are hard to find. If you are thinking about getting into the competition shooting or want to upgrade from production into limited minor division or three gun competition, this is a great starting point. 

I am asking what I paid for it, which was $670 (FIRM). 

ARMSCOR RIA is offering a $50 dollar rebate through 10/15/14 (must be post marked by 10/31/14). That brings your true cost down to just $620. I did not apply for the rebate. MSRP is $820.

Here is the link for the rebate details:

As usual, all laws will be followed. CHP or PPP required with a bill of sale for both of us. I am not looking for any trades but might consider a H&K VP9, Walther PPQ, CZ SP01 or CZ Tactical Sport with cash to or from as necessary.
