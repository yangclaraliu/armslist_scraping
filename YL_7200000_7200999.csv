The subcompact model of the renowned P30 handgun, P30SK (SubKompact) series has all of the sought-after characteristics of the larger frame P30 and P30L pistols but in a more concealable design.
The completely adjustable P30 grip feature — consisting of interchangeable backstraps and lateral grip panels — is replicated in the ultra-compact grip frame of the P30SK. This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.
Other trigger modes include conventional double action/single action (DA/SA) with a serrated de-cocking button located on the rear of the frame. The DA/SA mode is available with and without dual ambidextrous manual safeties located on the left and right side of the frame. Other ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.
An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process.
Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot; currently available in 9 mm.

Cash Only and prefer to meet as I will not deliverUp for Sale is this absolutely beautiful 6” Colt Python 357 Magnum built in 1975. In Electrolysis Nickel. Condition is Good to Very Good. Only Very small mark on left side of barrel under stamping. Only needs a Detailed Cleaning. I’ve owned the gun about 5 years and had it to the range twice. I shot less than 20 rounds through it. I’m not sure how much it was fired before I owned it, but it doesn’t appear much at all. The bore looks mint and the gun locks up tightly. I have owned a number of Colt Pythons and feel it’s the most beautiful revolver ever built by a good margin. I’m selling this one because its almost too pretty to shoot. The checkered walnut grips are, likewise, in beautiful condition with sharp checkering and no cracks only one small chip on left grip by screw. The action is silky smooth, as you would expect from a vintage Colt Python. Models from the 1970’s and earlier have always been the smoothest, in my experience. The 357 Magnum is by far my favorite revolver caliber. For those who don’t know, you can also shoot 38 Specials through it for a lower cost and lower recoil alternative. If you’re a first time Python buyer and want some attention at the range, this is definitely your gun! This is perfect for the vintage Colt collector or the high end revolver collector. Its also great for someone who loves finely built and highly accurate handguns. Don’t let this beauty pass you by!  No box or papers. I’m firm with the price."

Rifle has a 16"" chrome hammer forged lightweight barrel from BCM with a 10"" KMR Keymod rail also from BCM. The enhanced lightweight barrel is unique as it is thicker near the receiver and then gently tapers towards the muzzle. I can easily shoot 1.5 MOA and I'm sure a better shooter can do even better than that. Muzzle break is a battlecomp. Lower receiver is from Tactical Edge and is made of the right aluminum per mil-spec. Trigger is also from Tactical Edge and is set at 3.5lb. Very light and crisp trigger. Pistol grip and stock is by Mission First Tactical. Has an ambidextrous safety selector. I will also throw in a 15"" KMR keymod rail from BCM with mounting hardware as that is the rail that originally came with the rifle. Stripped of accessories, rifle weight 5lb 7oz. It is super lightweight. With all the accessories shown in the picture, rifle weighs 6lb 5oz. Rifle has seen less than 500 rounds. It is practically brand new. Selling as I have unforeseen medical expenses and need the cash. CASH ONLY NO TRADES. I want to do the transaction in person and will not mail to an FFL.

Built by National Ordnance, it is according to the serial numbers part of their 3rd-4rth production . Receiver built by National Ordnance, barrel made from new 1903A3 stock. Round Bolt. (This is not from the production with the problematic “short slide”) This carbine runs like a sewing machine-which they all will with proper care and tuning. All parts; extractor, plunger, mag catch (type 3) safety, springs ,etc are GI issue. And in proper order (replaced all to get it fine tuned) Although not in the original stock (which I have) and vented handguard (which I have) , I placed the carbine in a nice “fat boy” Chu wood stock and the handguard is a nice walnut which matches very well. I also replaced the front barrel band with a GI type III band with bayo-lug for improved accuracy (yes, the Type III band makes a difference) I do not run cheap steel cases through it...that is the cause of most wear and breakage/malfunctions on carbines. The magazines : 15 rnds; 3 are GI, 2 are Korean surplus All feed as they should.
30 rnd: 1 is GI, the other is suspected GI copy-but a good one-both feed with no hiccups
5 rnd: I have no idea-never used it  I do also have a Lee 4 die set for reloading .30 carbine
 
Barrel is in superb shape
 
My main reason for sale/trade is my desire for a Swiss K31, other than that I probably would not consider any other trade , but my interests do tend towards military surplus/vintage.  I have the package priced according to current values, including the magazines and original stock parts, spare parts(many of which I have not listed)"

The pistol comes with 2 magazines, I may have a third (I have to look for it, no promises on the 3rd magazine). I have less than 500 rounds through it because this firearm has been a total piece of crap since day one. I literally hate this pistol. I have sent it back to Sig for repairs twice. I own several Sigs, and this is the worst one. The last time Sig sent it back (after repairing it) I refused to shoot it, but the Sig gunsmith swears it is fixed and that he put over 100 rounds through the gun with no hiccups. Sig is 100% certain it is fixed now though. I want to stay ignorant of whether it is fixed or not. This gun has had numerous FTE and FTF in its life.  After getting it back from Sig the first time, I took it to the range and it had numerous Failure to Feed, Failures to Extract, you name it, this gun has had it. So I sent it back to Sig for a second time. I have all of the Sig Armorers notes to show the new buyer. The gun may be fine now. I am being totally honest and want the new buyer to be aware of the history I have had with this firearm. This firearm will be sold as-is, not warrantied or guaranteed by me (the seller). I just want the pistol gone so I can purge the bad memory of its existense. Sell of firearm must be done at a Licensed gun dealer so that the transfer can be legal. Photos can be sent upon request."

I will also include a brand new Voodoo Tactical 36"" double rifle case in black, as well as a set of spare Mega Arms lower parts(I contacted Mega and ordered an extra set of their proprietary pieces, just in case I ever needed a back-up since you can't really get them in a pinch). I easily have over $1700 invested in this build (conservative estimate) but I have too many AR15s and I want a nice 9mm, so I'm willing to sell it with the new Voodoo case for only $899 shipped to your FFL.Unfortunately, if I can't find a buyer at this price then I think I'll have to part it out and sell it off in pieces, which I really hate to do because this rifle is just waiting for someone to slap on an optic and go to work! *I will also throw in (2) new in wrapper Magpul Gen3 30rd PMAGs (allowed states only)*PLEASE see all of my pics at:https://www.ar15.com/forums/equipment-exchange/WTS-WTT-Brand-New-MEGA-ARMS-Ambi-Billet-AR15-only-899-shipped-FINAL-Price-Drop-08-29-/21-1683865/?page=11.)

This particular model does not have an ordinary trigger, instead this trigger is extended towards the rear of the gun beneath the firing pin. This rifle is in full working condition, and is fired by depressing the trigger on top with your thumb. It is chambered for .22LR, & .22 Short. From what I understand, this was the only Winchester ever made with a thumb trigger, and their first rifle listed with a rebounding lock. They made approximately 75,000 of these and many were shipped to Australia.  They were made between 1904 - 1923 and none of them had a serial number. If you have questions, please ask, if you want a specific picture from another angle or better lighting, please ask. This was passed down to me by my father who fortunately took very good care of it. I hope to allow someone else to enjoy it that truly appreciates the gun, that in my opinion is a very unique and interesting find for the avid collector.  Thanks for your interest!"
