The Pink Platinum has a combination of black pink with a beautiful blend of platinum. This gun rocks! Why sell? Because I have a second 15-22 and don't need two. Could use the extra money for some education expenses. 
My preference is to sell local. If sold local, Colorado requires us to get a background check. My local FFL dealer has agreed to do the background check for the $6 fee. As required by law, if you live elsewhere you must include a notification from your FFL with contact number, shipping address and account number for verification before the gun can be shipped and buyer assumes all shipping costs and must provide legal proof gun can be sold to your state and/or community."
