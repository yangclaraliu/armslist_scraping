The Rem 700 Special is an upgraded version of the Primary model which further enhances accuracy and precision on any right-handed Remington 700 model rifle. Utilizing CLKR Technology™, and some additional hand refinements, the pull weight on the Special model is quickly and confidently adjusted from 1.0 - 3.5 lbs in ~1oz increments from an externally accessible set screw. Due to the exceptionally crisp break, most shooters report the pull weights feeling ~0.5lbs lighter than a friction based trigger of the same measured weight. Just like the Primary model, this drop-in trigger provides a true zero-creep break, extremely short overtravel and offers outstanding reliability, even in the harshest environments. Frictionless Release Technology™, along with hardened, 440C, stainless steel internal components ensure corrosion resistance and an extended service life. As Frictionless Release Technology™ does not rely on coating, polishing or lubricating the key engagement surfaces, trigger pulls will be more consistent from shot to shot and after thousands of shots than you ever thought possible.    All pull weights and measurements are approximate.

Featuring Frictionless Release Technology™, this drop-in AR trigger has a short, two-stage action, designed to feel like a 1911 trigger, that provides a true zero-creep break, extremely short over-travel, a sub 0.030” tactical reset and offers outstanding reliability, even in the harshest environments. The pull weight is fixed at 3.5 lbs and due to there being truly zero creep, most shooters report the pull weights feeling ~0.5lbs lighter than a friction based trigger of the same measured pull weight. The lower pull weight does not affect hammer force so you can count on dependable primer strikes. Frictionless Release Technology™, along with hardened 440C stainless steel internal components ensure corrosion resistance and an extended service life.

It weighs about 35 ounces. The slide rides inside the frame. Between the weight and the slide riding inside the frame this gun is very accurate.

We estimate bluing to be 95 %. There is a fair amount of wear on the grips. Some letters and numbers are hand engraved on the frame between the trigger guard and grip – “DC 134417”, this is shown in photos. We were told this is a police badge number, which is possible as this gun was carried by someone. Bore is bright, mechanically the revolver is excellent with perfect timing, smooth double action pull and crisp release. The gun has been test fired and shoots fine. This would make an excellent home defense gun, or just a great gun for target shooting."

In November the Navy requisitioned 1580 new pistols while the number of new pistols in inventory or OS (Ordnance Stores) had fallen to 82. The Ordnance office directed Springfield to order 1580 pistols from Colts Manufacturing Co. before July 1936. This order would fulfill the Navy’s requisition, but allow the Ordnance stores to deplete through normal attrition. This is hardly a comforting thought with war brewing in Europe. Before the end of the year, Colts had received and delivered three orders totaling 2349 pistols. All of the 1937 production pistols still had the “MODEL OF 1911 U.S. ARMY” slide designation. On May 26, 1926 the official designation for the “New Model” pistol was changed to “Pistol, automatic, caliber .45, M1911A1” by approval of the chief of the Ordnance Technical Staff and the Ordnance Committee. Drawings however were not approved showing the new designation until January 27th 1938. Consequently the 2349 pistols delivered in 1937 still retained the “Old Model” slide marking of “MODEL OF 1911 U.S. ARMY” rather than the official marking of “M1911A1 U.S. ARMY” that had been moved to the frame for 1938 and later production, and are also “Transition” pistols. The nomenclature “Transition” is not an official Army designation but is part of the vernacular of pistol collectors. Hence the term is, to some extent, open to interpretation. Barrels of 1937 produced pistols are believed to be marked ""COLT 45 AUTO"" on left side and a ""P"" proof mark on the left lug. The magazines are further believed to be two-tone and marked identically to the commercial magazines of the time with a “COLT .45 AUTO” on the bottom. Normal commercial production at Colts numbered the slides to the frame serial number by adding a matching number underneath the firing pin stop plate. Many pistols observed by collectors, made in the prewar years (1937 through 1941) appear to have slides with numbers that are mismatched by a few tens or hundreds of numbers. This is thought to be a result of mass barracks cleaning of pistols and subsequent re-assembly of mismatched pistols. A mismatched number will usually decrease the value of a pistol significantly. The first pistols made in 1937 had neither a “P” mark on the frame or slide. Sometime during 1937 production, (at about 711001) the “P” proof mark was added to the slide and frame. Interestingly, Colts started 1937 production by marking pistols with their normal “Verified Proof” (VP in a triangle) in their normal commercial practice on the upper left trigger guard bow. They did this despite WWI production military pistols and (1924 pistols) never having had the mark applied. Workers at Colts apparently felt that their Verified proof was an adequate proof marking and did not initially apply the “P” proof. Furthermore, when the “P” proof was added, Colts continued to apply the verified proof throughout WWII production"

The GLOCK G17 is a full-size service pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The GLOCK 17 is a short-recoil operated, striker fire pistol. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The main frame of the GLOCK semi-automatic pistol is constructed of high-strength polymer that is resistant to shock, caustic liquids and temperature extremes. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body, or kept in a holster for extended periods of time. The slide cycles on 4 hardened steel guide rails within the frame. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and is drift adjustable. GLOCK pistols fieldstrip easily without the use of tools. The GLOCK G17 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be fin the field, at home, or on duty.

The GLOCK G17 is a full-size service pistol, shooting the 9x19mm pistol cartridge (9mm Parabellum), a standard military round that's easy to find ammo for anywhere. The GLOCK 17 is a short-recoil operated, striker fire pistol. The Safe-Action trigger system makes shooting in stressed situations infallible. The main frame of the GLOCK semi-automatic pistol is constructed of high-strength polymer that is resistant to shock, caustic liquids and temperature extremes. The milled steel slide and the barrel are treated with matte black Tenifer finish for extreme resistance to wear and corrosion. The Tenifer treated steel and polymer frame make the pistol impervious to corrosion caused by perspiration and humidity when carried close to the body, or kept in a holster for extended periods of time. The slide cycles on 4 hardened steel guide rails within the frame. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard allows for the attachment of aftermarket tactical flashlights or laser sights. The white-dot front sight and the white-bracket rear sight provide rapid acquisition in dim lighting situations. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and is drift adjustable. GLOCK pistols fieldstrip easily without the use of tools. The GLOCK G17 Semi-Auto Pistol is an ultra-reliable handgun that is easy to learn how to operate and maintain, making it an ideal choice for self-defense, whether it be fin the field, at home, or on duty. The model G17 comes with two standard 17-round magazines or two 10-round magazines that comply with various city or state restrictions on magazine capacity.contact broker at..........."

In 1953 colt came out with 2 different revolvers. One was the Colt Trooper, available in .38 and .22, later in .357, and the Colt Model .357 in much smaller numbers, available as a premium option to the Trooper. In 1955 however Colt Introduced the super premium option in .357, the famous Colt Python which was essentially the Colt Model .357 with a flattop barrel and more finely fitted internals and better finish. Because of this, the Model .357 never found a niche not being as cheap as the trooper or as polished as the Python, only about 15k were produced until its discontinuation in 1961 after only 8 years of production, while more than 100k pythons were produced in the same time.Colt model .357s are significantly more rare than either the trooper or python variants, and this is a very nice mechanical example of a Colt model .357.  It has all the orginal parts as well as a removable trigger shoe for target shooting, the finish suffers from a significant amount of holster wear, but is mechanically perfect, and the bore is 100% as you can see in the pictures.This would make a good candidate for a professional refinsh or just a very good shooter grade gun."

This rifle isn't a build, it is all factory with nothing but the trigger springs replaced to reduce the trigger pull. It was a ten minute job and does not alter the mechanics of the rifle.  Now, this is the 2nd Generation spring kit from JP, as the first Generation kit  had reported problems on the internet regarding difficulty firing extremely hard primered ammo. So I did my research first before buying a spring kit and this 2nd generation kit remedied light primer strikes on severely hard primered ammo - altogether.  It fires anything, everything, all of the time, with half of the trigger pull as factory.  It has proven to be the best modification I have ever performed on a rifle. My accuracy was greatly improved, as only about half of the pressure is now required to clear the trigger sear; about 4.5 pounds.Rifle is like new, I have had it to the range 5 times, fired about 500 rounds through it total. Zero malfunctions, ever.Comes with a new Red/Green multi reticle holographic type sight.This is a great shooter, looks new and feels great.I'm selling it because I need the money more than the rifle at the moment."
