I also installed Talon grips over the stipple for a more confortable concealed carry (I don't wear a t-shirt underneath and move around a lot) but that can easily be taken off if you prefer. I personally think that it gives it more character plus the stipple/talon combo has a very nice feel to it. I can add 1000rds (700 brass, 300 steel) of factory ammo for only $200 more.

This bow will produce arrow speeds up to 350 FPS, but keep in mind that arrow speeds will vary depending on the total weight of the arrow and tip/broadhead.  That said, I have chronographed this bow at 347 FPS with a 150-grain field tip.  At 347 FPS, it has more and enough power and punch to take down the largest of North America game animals (deer, elk, bear, moose, etc.).  And, in the event you do not know, crossbows are legal archery equipment in the state of Oklahoma so long as they have a minimum of 100 pounds draw weight, are equipped with safety devices and the bolts/arrows must be a minimum of 14 inches in length.
The Exomax crossbow is one of the fastest hunting crossbows of its kind with amazing downrange performance. The Exomax comes wrapped with Realtree Xtra® camouflage and is a very comfortable bow to shoot and hunt with.
Specifications:
Velocity:          350 FPS
Draw Weight:  225 lbs.
Power Stroke:  16.5""
Mass Weight:  6.5 lbs.
Overall Length:39.5""
Arrow Length: 20""
Arrow Weight: 350 Grains
Stock Type:      Traditional
Finish:              Realtree Xtra
You want the best, get the best!  Read the reviews on this crossbow!  Excalibur crossbows are the best and you don't see these bows for sale very often as they are virtually indestructible and people just don't want to get rid of them!  I've taken lots of game with this bow and it is is in really good shape and absolutely solid!  I’m only selling because I want to upgrade.  This bow also includes a ton of accessories – Varizone scope, sling, soft carry case, R.E.D.S (Recoil Energy Dissipation System) suppressors, two extra strings, two extra quivers, 17 arrows (3 with Lumenoks), arrow storage tube, rope cocking aid, and all original paperwork.  This bow is easily a $1000 crossbow with all these accessories!  Asking $575 OBO.  Please text Stan at 9-one-8-six-seven-one-3-two-one-6 if interested.
Scammers: I only sell locally and for cash only!  Please do not contact me as I will not be interested in your little games and won’t fall for them!"

This handy little backup/concealed carry gun features a 3-inch barrel, 6 shot magazine, and sights that are completely confined to the groove on the top of the pistol. These handy and accurate little .380 pistols were discontinued after S&W acquired Walther and it what decided that this pistol would compete with Walther's line of small pistols. This particular example has some light holster wear on the edges but is still in 95% condition. The pistol is very tight overall It comes with 2 extra magazines (total 3) and a strapped carrying case. This pistol has been ranged fired and has never jammed or misfired since I have owned it. It has the ability to function on any kind of ammo. I know of a LE agency that was testing 380s to figure out which to adopt. The SW 380 was the only gun that fed and fired every brand of ammo it was given.  I have another SW 380 I purchased (almost new) that has worked fine with the six or seven brands of ammo I've fed it. This pistol requires a takedown/Armorer tool to field strip which is not include, but available for about $4.00. Despite its reputation, I don't think the Sigma .380 is such a bad pistol. It's light enough and smooth enough to be easy to carry, it points well, it has a decent trigger for a pocket pistol, and mine has been boringly reliable. Changing magazines isn't easy but then you aren't likely to have one fall out by accident either. An often-maligned pistol to be sure but it seems like most of the people who denigrate the SW380 have never owned one. I don't consider this a range gun at all. More of a ""carry a lot and shoot a little"" pistol. Perfect for that."
