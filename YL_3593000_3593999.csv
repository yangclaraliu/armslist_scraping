This is the rarest combination of the 1100 20 gauge.  It has a 25"" Skeet barrel with a fixed choke and a vent rib.  This functions flawlessly and I hate to get rid of it.  Take some time and try to find another one like this, there were no other lw20 skeet models that I could find anywhere.  The gun values at $800 and up, but it does have one ding in the vent rib which is pictured and it had a slip on recoil pad for a long time so the stock wood is darker where that was.  This is a fast and functional gun and perfect for bird hunting.

Frame is an officer size. Slide is a commander size. New recoil spring has been installed.
Here's a little history of this model.
There were only 10,000 of these pistols made by Colt for the Argentine Army (Ejercito Argentino) under contract in 1927. The pistol is basically a '1911A1' (post 1924) configuration and featured a World War I style (Pre-A1 version) wide spur hammer withcheckering, short checkered trigger and a checkered (arched) mainspring housing with lanyard loop. All of these Colts had a deep blue finish. Production is said to have begun in July, 1927 and ended in February, 1928. After the initial 10,000 units were produced, the Argentine government purchased a license to build the 'Model 1927' pistol in Argentina under the markings 'FMAP' which stood for 'Fabrica Militar de Armas Portatiles'."

I'm selling my barely used (200 rounds) LWRC M6A2 10.5"" Upper 5.56mm. I realized after buying it that it doesn't have the two-position adjustable gas block, just the one-position self-regulating one, and I've decided to upgrade to the newer ICA5 upper for suppressed use.

Priced to sell at $1100 shipped (normally this is over $1500 new).

If you want me to throw in a new LWRC ambidextrous charging handle, I'd ask $1150 shipped.

Would be great on a pistol or SBR build.

(Apologies for getting a little carpet fibers sticking to it in a couple of the pictures, not scratches or anything, it's in beautiful/excellent condition).

Metallic Rim Fire Carbine, also known as the “No. 56,” or “56-56.” (Referred to in modern times by collectors as the “50 Caliber.”) Not a conversion with the Stabler “cut off” device. All original. Un-altered. Not been tampered with. 7+1 Rim Fire cartridge capacity through the butt stock to the chamber. Lever action repeating rifle. The Model 1860 was manufactured from 1863-1865 (according to the serial number, this rifle was made in 1863). 22” barrel. Six groove rifling (the post-Civil War altered conversions with Stabler device were three groove rifling and those made by Burnside Rifle Company in Providence, Rhode Island). Sling swivel at butt stock (an original factory feature). Only 45,785 were made in 1863. Low 5 digit serial number 25791 (the serial numbers started at 11,000 and went up to 61,000). Stock shows combat use. Metal ok condition. Bore ok. Mechanically good. Full functional. Very rare Civil War collectible. All of these made in 1863 were sent to the battlefield and used in combat, mainly by the North, or Union Cavalry (though some carbines fell into the hands of the South, or Confederacy). After the Civil War this carbine, as well as others like it, remained un-touched and un-altered, and were used by the military and civilians, including the American Indians, outlaws and law enforcement throughout the American West. There is no telling who originally owned this rifle during the Civil War and afterwards. It has quite a history to tell. “If it could only talk”!  (see Flayderman’s Guide p. 633).

Very thin yet large enough for normal hands to grip well.
Lightweight with a sweet DA type trigger pull. 
I got this to carry under T-shirt during summer months but now that cooler weather is coming I no longer need deep concealment. And I've got the bug to get something else.
Gun has good reviews and Kahr has a great reputation. 
I've put just enough rounds through it to get past the ""break-in"" period specified by the owner's manual (200 rounds) Very clean and not scuffed or damaged.

Comes with original box and the 8 rd magazine supplied with it. I may also include the best holster I have ever concealed with: A Remora IWB holster. No loops or hooks, stays in waistband purely through friction. I have jogged multiple miles multiple times with this gun/holster and have even played volleyball and never had to adjust it.

Originally this guy contacted me about my Gun he was supposedly interested in trading me and contacted me 10/26/14 Sunday wanting to make a trade on my shotgun.  I asked him several times to send me pictures and more info on a Beowulf rifle he offered.  He can't seem to follow directions and not answer any of the followings i'm requesting.  He mentions he has other stuff he can't even give me info on.

We were supposed to meet Monday 10/27/14 but then tells me he's planning on going out with his wife on a boat and that he just sold his business so he's free any time blah blahh so we agreed to meet on Tuesday 10/28/14 then offers me a Glock .45 BUT his ""wife was drunk one night and hidden the gun which can't be found"",  SERIOUSLY why would you even say something like that???  Anyway i kept telling him to call me but doesn't do so i requested more pictures of the Rifle he doesn't do so he offers me a Spikes AR but doesn't give info,  Offers me a TWS AR still can't give me any info on that,  then offers the Glock and tells me that it's hidden.

So it's Tuesday never gets back to me were suppose to meet today he still hasn't called me i sent him a text an replies all of a sudden with a sorry ridiculous sobb story that his dad is in the hospital and has been busy with personal issues......He went from going on a fun boat ride with free time when Tuesday comes just like that.   I called he decline's call and doesn't reply back.   I have text messages save and would provide to anyone that cares to look.

I had the impression he was either making stuff up,  didn't have a gun to began with,  Stolen possession of a Firearm or just an idiot this person is a red flag seems very shady and should avoid anytime he Emails you.  We all value our time and no one likes to play games i'm sure this isn't his first time he's done this EVERYONE take a stand and start calling people out when their wasting time and flake out on you.  Avoid this guy or boy he's a big time waster and a FLAKE!!!!

If you were interested in the Ruger, please feel free to email me again. 
I am asking $550 cash for the revolver. If you do not want to pay $550, then I will take trade for a Mossberg 500 or Remington 870 tactical shotgun. I really want an 18 inch barrel,  AR style collapsible stock, upgraded for-end, and ghost ring sights. I can work out a deal on one without those features, but extras or cash will have to be added on your end. If you have a basic shotgun, you could offer it with enough cash to equal $550 value. If you have a Shot gun that is valued higher than my asking price, I am willing to pay extra. Also, I am keeping the ammo because it seems that nobody wants to pay $50 for 300 rounds of reloaded .357 magnum."

I never fired the gun with it on there.
I was test loading and dry-cycling a few rounds to test functionality, when the spring sprung back and slammed a round into the follower.
A small piece of the follower broke off and some scratches were left on the inside of the drum, but it seems to still function okay.
The follower may need a little tweeking/bending, but seem to still be usable.
The catch lip that locks into into the gun is too fat/thick - it needs to be filed a little.

851,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3593851,For Sale:  Steyr Model M 30-06 Double Set Triggers,"Cheney, Spokane, Washington",$ 999,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 4, 2014",Rifles,Steyr                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a rare Steyr model M chambered in 30-06. It has a 23.622 inch cold hammer forged barrel (600 mm). This rifle is set in the Cycolac synthetic stock and has the standard parkerized finish. The stock and finish are really nice features for hunting. The parkerized coating is highly corrosion resistant and the synthetic stock is resilient to inclement weather. The stock has nice checkering on it to ensure a good grip even when wet, while maintaining a more traditional appearance than the typical synthetic stock.

The Steyr model M never sold all that well in this country, and it seems that virtually all of the ones available here come with a standard single trigger. This one has double set triggers. You have two modes in which to shoot. If you are at the range and desire an extremely light pull, you pull the rear trigger first. Pulling the rear trigger sets the front trigger to a very light weight, allowing you to be more accurate at the range. However, a very light pull weight can be hazardous when hunting. With double set triggers, you don't have to worry about a hair trigger. When hunting, you can simply pull the front trigger and have a normal trigger pull. The double set triggers allows you to have the best of both worlds; a hair trigger for target shooting at the range and a normal (good) trigger pull when hunting.

This particular rifle also has a rare set of quick-detachable scope mounts and rings. This is very convenient, as you can remove the scope and mounts instantly for ease of cleaning the rifle from the breech. Then, you can place the mount and scope back on the rifle and be very close (if not exactly) at your previous zero point. These mounts and rings are worth about $200 and are very difficult to find.

The rifle is in used-very good condition. This Rifle has seen very minimal use. It has a small nick in the plastic in the tang area. Though not significant, I wanted to bring it to your attention anyway.

The bolt is remarkably smooth and the triggers are very crisp. This rifle has a very similar bolt design to the SSG-69, so it is capable of outstanding accuracy when in good hands. It points and balances very well, weighing only about 8.25 pounds with a scope on it. This would be the perfect gun to take hunting in the mountains, forest, or over rough terrain.

Armslist only allows three attached pictures, but I have a lot more. Please contact me via email to get the rest of the pictures. This rifle is a very nice shooter, you will enjoy it. I would prefer a local sale (either in the Seattle area or the Spokane area), but will ship at buyer's expense. I live in the Spokane area, but will be back in Seattle over Thanksgiving weekend and Christmas."

I have used this Remington R25 for the last two years to hunt with in Oregon and it has been a fantastic rifle.  I would not be going back to my Weatherby if I didn't have to after using a semi auto to hunt with, they are such an improvement over bolt actions.  This rifle has been a tack driver, and I took a nice 5x5 elk last year with it.  

****Nightforce optic and bipid are not included****

The specs on this rifle are as follows:

The Remington R-25 is an advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered in 308 Win.  For peak accuracy, its precision crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is free floated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube.   Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation.  The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight.  When it's time to make the shot, the R-25's ergonomic pistol grip gives you unmatched control and rock steady aim.  As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position.  True to our hunting market, the traditional two state trigger found on AR platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp single stage version that comes from the factory set at 4.5 to 5 lbs.  

Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings.  The entire gun is dressed in Mossy Oak Treestand camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field.  Included is a 20 round magazine and the rifle is compatible with both DPMS and Magpul magazines.  Front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.  

KEY FEATURES
Semi automatic AR-10 style rifle developed in conjunction with an industry leader in the category (DPMS)
Free floated botton rifled 0.680"" muzzle OD ChroMoly barrel with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.
Well-suited for personal defense use, this HK45 is a DAO (double action only) model that uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.
The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.
Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.
Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.
An improved USP-style control lever (not included, must be purchased seperately), a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.
By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever (not included) function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.
Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull
