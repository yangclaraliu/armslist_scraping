Unlike Swedish Husqvarna Model 40 copies of the Lahti, L-35s are stronger and show the more meticulous manufacturing typical of Finnish VKT pistol as designed by Aimo Lahti, adopted by the Finnish military in 1935 and used with lethal effectiveness against Soviet troops during the 1940 Winter War in Finland. This heavy 9mm pistol is designed around a bolt accelerator that levers the bolt closed against ice, mud or other impediments to lockup - a design more reliable than the lighter weight Lugar P-08 pistols which the L-35 superficially resembles. The pistol has a 4 ½” barrel with crisp, clean rifling and shiny bore. The brown VKT Bakelite grip panels are original, but with a minor 1/16th"" chip on the rear left grip panel. Metal finish stands at better than 90 percent with some thinning and silvering at the edges. The gun is missing the small blued dust cover that normally caps the front end of the frame beneath the barrel - a matter that does affect functionality. The gun otherwise has a tight slide, finely notched rear sight, unblemished front blade, and excellent trigger. Test firing produced 1 1/2"" five-shot groups at 25 yards."
