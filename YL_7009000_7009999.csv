Just got a bad guy saying he was going to trade me a Burris 1-4*24 and 6 aimpoints and that's why I became sketchy cause all his aim points were not the real aimpoints. So here I go again as you can see the gun needs a re bluing job or a nice cerakote. Believe me when I recover I will have $ for this. And the blonde wood is missing. Ironwood designs have excellent wood handguards and pistol grip. However if you want real Bulgarian handguards cope distributed had the set but some wood finishing you will have a great one of the kind pistol. Rifle was bought in 2005 I bought it from some guy during hurricane Katrina and was trying to help him out with cash. From there on out I shot probably around 300 rounds will eat up any ammo you feed it to and it is very accurate from 50 yards to 300 yard. And I'm sure further just didn't have the room. ¬†Ok I prefer cash. Cash is king and asking $1300 cause cause it needs a new finish job and handguards and pistol grips. Please don't waste my time.

I am very reluctantly selling this rifle due to an emergency that requires funds I don't currently have. My price is absolutely firm. The Eotech was over $400. The trigger was $500.

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who‚Äôs picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it ‚Äî it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‚Äòbrick-in-the-hand‚Äô feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10‚Äôs trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‚ÄòC‚Äô in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Payment Options:The quickest and easiest method of payment is moneygramm/westernunion or money order.

The internals and takedown are more or less the same as a 5.56 AR minus the buffer tube, so it's a great choice for an AR platform training rifle.
This one is pretty much brand new with only 75 rounds through it and zero malfunctions. I'm the original owner and bought it only a few months ago. Reason I'm selling is because I have two of them and mostly use the other so¬†she's quickly becoming a safe queen. It's time to let her go to a new home while¬†I use the proceeds to invest¬†in a different gun/project.
It comes with all the original accessories and a few extras including an MBUS sight adjustment key, three 11 slot Magpul MLOK rail segments + the original 5 slot, Magpul MOE pistol grip as well as original A2 pistol grip and one 25 round mag.
Price is firm and buyer pays transfer fee, though I do know a couple good FFLs in the area to keep your cost down. First to be able to meet is the one who gets the rifle.
Feel free to inquire with questions and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks for looking!"
