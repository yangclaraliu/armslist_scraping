I really don't want to get rid of it but I want to see what's out there. Must be willing to met me in and around my city. Some of you might have seen this add recently but I didn't really trust any of the people trying to buy it. Just got a bad guy saying he was going to trade me a Burris 1-4*24 and 6 aimpoints and that's why I became sketchy cause all his aim points were not the real aimpoints. So here I go again as you can see the gun needs a re bluing job or a nice cerakote. Believe me when I recover I will have $ for this. And the blonde wood is missing. Ironwood designs have excellent wood handguards and pistol grip. However if you want real Bulgarian handguards cope distributed had the set but some wood finishing you will have a great one of the kind pistol. Rifle was bought in 2005 I bought it from some guy during hurricane Katrina and was trying to help him out with cash. From there on out I shot probably around 300 rounds will eat up any ammo you feed it to and it is very accurate from 50 yards to 300 yard. And I'm sure further just didn't have the room.  Ok I prefer cash. Cash is king and asking $1300 cause cause it needs a new finish job and handguards and pistol grips. Please don't waste my time. Only interest I would consider is a mossberg jm pro cash on your end, varsa max competition, straight up trade and a 1 once gold bar or 1 oz American eagle straight up . 1911 colt, kimber,45acp. Sig Spartan, and a nice practically brand new industrial power washer with hose no Troy built. Billet noveske lower and upper receiver and a barrel and handguard. But price is kind. Also a engagement ring and I can tell how much a diamond is worth and also very knowledgeable about diamonds. Size 7. Rra competition is up there too. But please don't give me an attitude if you drive out to my area and you have just and I either want more cash or just tell you to that it is fake. I'm a ccw holder. Would prefer to gold diamonds and cash. Also you will be receiving 600rnd 7.62*39 4 mags one Bulgarian circle 10 waffle mag. Bulgarian steel mag a romanian steel metal and a pmag ak mag that is as good as the as the waffle. Please get ahold of me or text only. Will not pick up phone.

I am very reluctantly selling this rifle due to an emergency that requires funds I don't currently have. My price is absolutely firm. The Eotech was over $400. The trigger was $500. The BCM lower was over $400. The Aero Precision upper was over $450. The Lantac Dragon muzzle break was over $100. The MBUS sights were around $100. The charging handle was $50. Buttstock was $80.

Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. Designed to minimize creep and stacking, the P-10’s trigger breaks at a clean 4-4.5 lbs and rebounds with a short, positive reset, meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1.Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Payment Options:The quickest and easiest method of payment is moneygramm/westernunion or money order.

A great shooter for plinking or inexpensive tactical drills, the 15-22 is one of the smoothest and most dependable .22 rifles on the market. The internals and takedown are more or less the same as a 5.56 AR minus the buffer tube, so it's a great choice for an AR platform training rifle.
This one is pretty much brand new with only 75 rounds through it and zero malfunctions. I'm the original owner and bought it only a few months ago. Reason I'm selling is because I have two of them and mostly use the other so she's quickly becoming a safe queen. It's time to let her go to a new home while I use the proceeds to invest in a different gun/project.
It comes with all the original accessories and a few extras including an MBUS sight adjustment key, three 11 slot Magpul MLOK rail segments + the original 5 slot, Magpul MOE pistol grip as well as original A2 pistol grip and one 25 round mag.
Price is firm and buyer pays transfer fee, though I do know a couple good FFLs in the area to keep your cost down. First to be able to meet is the one who gets the rifle.
Feel free to inquire with questions and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks for looking!"
