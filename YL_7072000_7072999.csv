Each round was marked in ink print '.SM . 308Win'. I was told by the importer that this was a condition required by the seller in order to allow for commercial sales of this ammo. This ammo is Brass case, Berdan primed, non-corrosive made in Germany by SM Chemnitzer Sportwaffen und Munitionsfabrik GmbH. The bullet is lead core with 'Cupro-Nickel' jackets that make the projectile magnetic. Please note that the ammo has tiny grey spots of oxidation / discoloration on the brass of some rounds where the rounds contacted the original military packaging, this ammo was repackaged in new boxes when it was prepared for commercial sales.

No rust  that I can see and all external metal numbers match. These have a screwed in barrel and milled parts. The wood is solid and free of cracks but does have numerous scratches, dings, dents, etc.  Upon receiving it I completely removed all cosmoline inside and out.
Though I have had it for several years I did not shoot it much  ( 2 test sessions with 20 rounds each )  but I can give you my word that it never malfunctioned in any way for me and is fairly accurate. It was always shot with NON –Corrosive ammo.  It was  disassembled, cleaned and lubed  after both shooting sessions. I do strongly suggest that the new owner do this upon ownership before firing as it hasn’t been fired in a few years. Feel free to ask me any questions. I may or may not be able to answer them but they will be honest.  I do however pretty much know this rifle inside and out. . I have more pics I can email upon request with an E address.  It does not have a bayonet ( the lug is there to mount one ) or a cleaning rod but both items can be found easily for not a lot of $.    The ad says no shipping but I will ship.
 
This must go to an FFL  ( It is C&R eligible )  . No PO boxes and only to those locations that can legally be shipped to. No Exceptions.  So know your laws.   Payment must me made by USPS money order only.  The price is $300.00 .  Shipping will be an additional $35 which includes insurance, Adult Signature and a UPS tracking #.  I have online sales feedback at your request. I strive to pack things very well with lots of protection and where possible to double the cardboard .  I communicate throughout and ship promptly. Thanks for looking ."

These hand guards are part of the fittings known as koshirae. These handguards often had a theme that went with the sword and many thought was put into choosing the correct tsuba which impacted the meaning of the sword. The names of the schools these were made by are as follows going in order from left to right top to bottom. Iga/ Tosho...Bushu-Ito...Umetada then bottom row... Shoami.....Heian-jo. These fittings often sell for several thousand dollars and for a small fee you could submit them to a group called Shinsa which will appraise these and a tribute a paper to go with it saying who made it and verify everything. Once this paper is achieved you can achieve the maximum value that this item is worth. I have no doubts whatsoever that each one of these is worth at least $600 and can be worth thousands each. The reason I'm selling for so cheap is because I enjoy giving items to others who will appreciate them and I won these at auction and simply do not have the time to submit to shinsa with everything else that I have won at auction. This is a opportunity to not only own a piece of History used by the elite Warriors Samurai but to also make a good amount of money if you are interested in doing the research and submitting. Call or text REDACTED and if you are interested I have no problem having you take it to someone who knows what they are looking at.$300 each. Two of the handguards have signatures and the square looking one has a carving of a scholar or poet which has poems written on the handguard as well. The fittings with signatures are 500 each"

They are packaged in 9, 64 round boxes, 124 grain, boxer primed, non corrosive, copper jacketed reloadable ammunition. The back story of this ammo is it was manufactured in 1955 in the Dominion Arsenal in Canada. It was sold to the CIA which issued the ammo to Central and South American countries the CIA was secretly supporting during the cold war of the 1950's. The ammo was packaged in plain cardboard boxes, 64 rounds per box. The boxes were 64 rounds each as the Sten submachine gun of the Canadian military used 32 round magazines. The rounds per box and manufacture date disguised the fact the CIA was providing ammo for the wars and made it look like Canadian surplus ammo.  The surplus ammo after the cold war was distributed in the US  through Inter Arms Corp. The story is very easy to verify on numerous websites. In addition to having a very interesting history for collectors this ammo is great range ammo. I took a box to the range this week and it shot flawlessly. Asking .21/round, cheaper than Winchester white box ammo. I am interested in selling in one or maybe two lots.

It is not from abuse or misuse and doesn't effect function, it is merely cosmetic. This Leatherman Wave comes with the original clamshell packaging and nylon sheath.

This thing locks firmly to the Glock with a push pin. Adds a lanyard or sling loop there. Has two moving pieces, one that adjusts angle and the other lets it swivel side to side. It can easily unscrew and fold under the pistol for storage. Works to hold the pistol muzzle-climb down firmly.
I've been hunting for this type of accessory for my AR pistol builds. This one works really well for Glock and am happy with mine. I installed one on my friend's G19 and he's very happy with it as well. I have 2 of these left for sale/trade. Brand new in packaging. People can see/feel/use mine as demo if they want to see how it works before they open the package or buy one.

The stock has been refinished. The finish has flaked a bit in a few places but isn't bad at all.   (Looked like hell before I did it)At one point there was a screw on pistol grip on it. The Screw broke off in the stock but doesn't interfere with the operation of the rifle and isn't visible unless looking at the gun from the bottom. (Grip made it easier for me to work the bolt being a lefty)Matching numbers on the barrel, bolt, mag, and butt-plate. Is missing the cleaning rod that goes under the barrel. No idea where it is or when it went missing. Plenty of spare parts out there to anyways, no biggie.You also get 200 rounds of surplus free and a rubber butt pad.The bore is alright as well. No problems with the rifle or its operation. What else can I say, looks good, goes boom, (not bang, it's an m44 lol) and is accurate. Also, if you're looking for a fairly cheap deer rifle it'll work great. Dropped a buck with it last year.To buy this rifle you need a valid state ID and will fill out a bill of sale of which we will both have copies. Price is $250 cash FIRM, don't try to haggle, you will be ignored. Price is more than fair. Mosin m44's are getting harder and harder to find, I've seen em go for 250 to 300 and more recently.Also, NO SHIPPING. So don't ask, you will be ignored.I look forward to doing business with you."

It is essentially a military specification Beretta 92FS.  The M9 is a short recoil, semi-automatic, single-action / double-action pistol that uses a 15-round staggered box magazine with a reversible magazine release button that can be positioned for either right- or left-handed shooters.  According to Wikipedia, during US military trials, the pistol survived exposure to temperatures from -40 to 140 °F (-40 to 60 °C), being soaked in salt water, being dropped repeatedly on concrete, and being buried in sand, mud and snow. Additionally, it proved a MRBF (mean rounds before failure) of 35,000 rounds. That number is often touted as the equivalent to five or six times the pistol's service life.

This particular example was purchased new from Cabela's in 2012 for my wife for Army pistol qualification; it's had less than 500 rounds through it, and now the Army is replacing the M9.  Great condition, comes with factory box, Beretta factory gun lock, 2 factory 15rnd mags, warranty card, operating instructions, etc and a RH Blackhawk military surplus belt holster with retention; shoots like a dream, I can consistently make one ragged hole at thirty feet with a 5 round group, and I'm no expert marksman.
