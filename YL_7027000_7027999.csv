Will throw in additional ammo for the right deal.-Badger Concealment holster (pretty beat up, but I won't need it anymore if we come to a deal)-No rust, minimal wear on the finishThis firearm has served me well from a concealment standpoint, and is a blast to take to the range and just plink with. It will eat up any ammo that you throw at it, and has been maintained as a carry gun should be. Please feel free to send me any questions or concerns via e-mail, and I will be sure to get back to you A.S.A.P. The price is negotiable, and I am looking at any and all trades. Thank you, and God Bless America.
 P.S. Armslist is a fantastic medium for buying and selling firearms, but the lack of file sizing means I may only upload one image. I only take high quality images to showcase my firearms as best as possible. If you would like more pictures, more are available upon request. Thank you.

Serious shooters who care about the details welcomed the precision features that made the Range Officer® perform far beyond its price tag. We insisted on the best components and manufacturing techniques, like forged national match frames and slides, both features found on our top end 1911 models. A gun is only as good as its barrel, so we didn’t skimp there either. We added a national match stainless steel barrel and precisely fit bushing for maximum accuracy. Many of those competition gun customers couldn’t help wonder why we didn’t make a self-defense version of the 1911 Range Officer®, so we did – in both 9mm and .45ACP calibers. New for 2016 is the 1911 Range Officer® Operator® model. We’ve kept the same great “under the hood” features that made the original Range Officer® great, but added features to turn this pistol into a formidable self-defense pistol for carry or home use. The five inch barrel with fully supported ramp provides an extended sight radius, making your job of getting fast hits on target even easier. Speaking of sights, the front is a shielded fiber optic tube while the rear is a low profile combat style that won’t snag during the draw. There’s no reason a functional combat gun can’t look good. The 1911 Range Officer® Operator® sports a Parkerized finish that looks sharp and will ward off corrosion and rust. Checkered Cocobolo grips provide a firm hold without shredding carry holsters and clothes. Serious 1911 fighting features are all there too. The classic flat mainspring housing is checkered for positive grip, and the extended beavertail safety includes a memory bump for positive activation. Add a long aluminum match grade trigger, skeletonized hammer, and rail for light or laser and this pistol is good to go. When it’s time to get down to business, place your trust in a gun that’s built for the task. Try the Range Officer® Operator®.

It has a wooden stock and aftermarket drilled muzzlebreak. This was a hunting rifle, not a safe queen, so there are some dings in the stock but overall the rifle is in good shape. Comes with its original sling. No scope unfortunately. That is the only thing you need to be hunt ready. I will also throw in a box of ammo and the reloading supplies I have for this caliber. That will include the reloading manual, a couple partial boxes of bullets, a bag of brass, primers, half a pound of powder and a hand reloading kit. The hand reloading kit had a pin break, but replacements can be ordered through LEE. I am mainly interested in handguns. Let me know what you have. Not interested in hipoints.

I still cleaned it and kept it in good-to-go condition. I really would prefer not to part anything out. I might be willing to part the ACOG from the rifle, but I'd like to sell the package together to one buyer seeing as the Pelican foam has been cut for all the accessories.
