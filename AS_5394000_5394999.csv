I just bought it yesterday (Saturday 4/16) and have no idea how many rounds have been fired through it, as I bought the gun used. I fired 50 rounds through it myself today (4/17) to make sure there were no issues with it. 
As mentioned, it came from a Glock 30, so it's a 3.78"" barrel, the compensator is a little over an additional inch, looks like it came from a rifle. 
I know new the barrel sells for $105, and new the compensator sells for $90+, no idea of the used values. 

Asking $150 OBO for both items, and I prefer to sell as a pair. 

Prefer cash only, no trades.

It is like new, with hard case, papers, cleaning tools, lock (all the factory stuff), 2 magazines and the factory grips (as shown in the smaller picture taken before the G10 grips were installed). The grips are VERY grippy and are a little bit thinner than the factory grips, allowing for a better grip with smaller hands. I have only put 10 rounds through it and there is not even a tiny scratch, smudge or bit of wear on it anywhere. Still in ""Mint"" condition. Other than the ""snakeskin"" G10 grips I've added, it looks just as it did in the case when bought new.This is the SA/DA version, and has the hard to find ambidextrous safety. You can carry it ""Cocked & Locked"", and fire rapidly due to the single action.If you look this exact same model up, you'll see the lowest price listed at $580....Anyone who has ever bought a gun new knows that isn't the price you'll end up paying. By the time you add in all of the fees (Transfer, BG Check, Taxes, cc card processing) you'll be close to or over $700. Then you'd have to buy the grips!I'm selling it for $555 (FIRM), which is less than the base price. I will accept cash, or partial trades (with some cash) in the form of a pistol (good condition) chambered in either 9mm Luger or .45 ACP.UPDATE: I NEED CASH TODAY! WILL SELL FOR $500 TODAY ONLY!!!
