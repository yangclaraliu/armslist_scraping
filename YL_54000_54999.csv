Now if I trade for something that is not a .45 caliber I will throw in some Honaday Self defence ammo.  Super nice Conceal Carry Gun.  

What I am looking for as far as a trade:
Sig Sauers - p226 p229 in 9mm .40 caliber or .45
Kimbers - Would like a one size up on my gun.  I love the pro carry compact in .45.  or another ultra carry in Black Stainless.
Love Glocks.  But be prepared to add cash to the deal.  If you have a glock that has some accessories like Lights or lasers or stuff like that the trade starts to become more even.
Would consider a FNP.  Heard good things Might try it out.
Im not really interested in just Selling but If I had to put a price down i would put 800 firm.
Will Consider Other 1911 Manufactures.  I love Colt. and Springfield amory and Para ordianace
Not really interested in Rilfes or Trailers or Non Weapon items
I will pretty much consider everything that comes to my inbox.  Just stay in the boundaries that I will consider or outside the box a little Ha ha ha!  I will shoot you a email back and let you know if Im interested or not
Thank you!"

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Everything on the gun is great except that the trigger assembly in the left gun will need to be replaced the spring in the trigger assembly has become too weak to function with the gatling crank. Other than that everything works great the right side works like a charm. I have a little over 900.00 invested and about 2 hours to put it together since it needs one new trigger assembly i am asking 700.00 firm or possible trade. I am looking for a ftf only as this would be hard to ship. If the buyer would like they can shoot it on site after to purchase to test function.

New-in-box: my original LCR was sent back to Ruger for repair and they determined it un-repairable and have replaced it.

Comes complete with soft case, lock, all manuals and spent shell casing

Fired once at the factory

.38 caliber: can fire both .38 special and .38+p ammunition

Probably one of the smoothest double-action trigger action for a non-modified handgun I have ever owned.

This is a model 5401, equipped with front pinned sights and the Hogue Tamer grips

Why I am selling it: I added a new handgun to my collection and this sale will partially ""pay"" for it

Why buy mine: can be purchased on-line for around $400, plus shipping and FFL tranfers fees - puts you over $450; bought locally for around $450 plus tax puts you over $500.00, mine - no tax, so a pretty fair deal.

541,http://www.armslist.com/posts/54541,For Sale/Trade:  Gun safe - Heritage 12 locking bolts - built like a tank. TRADE?,"Sherwood, Little Rock, Arkansas",$ 600,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 14, 2010",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Heritage gun safe - I replaced the combination style dial lock with a brand new S&G (high end) digital keypad combination lock. You can set it to any combination you want...quick access for you - impossible for everyone else.

The safe has internal hinges as well... no way to pry the door off.

This safe has 5 bolts on each side, one on the top, and one on the bottom for a total of 12 and they all move in and out when you turn the wheel... they all lock into place when the door is closed and safe is locked.

There are slots on the left for 8 rifles or shotguns. The right side is all shelved. You could modify this to hold twice as many long guns if you wanted and still have some shelf space.

The interior is a tan suede. And I don't see a fire rating on it - but that sticker may have been removed... I can't find a model number so I can't be sure of a fire rating. However a thief would have to camp out to try and get in this thing. The door and the body of this thing is made out of rediculously thick steel.

Now although it functions perfectly... it's not perfect. It has been moved around and has a few scuffs and chips in the paint- you can see some of these in the pics.

If you trade me for this safe - you will come and get it :) Bring a few buddies and we'll unbolt it from the concrete and get it into a truck. I do not have a truck - so you're on your own there.

What I'm looking for in trade is (and feel free to offer ANYTHING at all ... worst I can say is no - I like all sorts of pistols and rifles ... nice 22's, carry guns, full size pistols, whatever ) :

1911 - Flawless Springfield loaded with all accessories / box - or a higher end model than that. Basically a top notch factory 1911... not really looking for a custom built gun - but let me know what you have.

Other than that... let me know what you have. I don't think you could get close to a safe like this one for under a grand.

I'm open to combinations of rifles / pistols / whatever. I might like to have a Remington SPS in .223 with some quality glass on it - or maybe the SPS and a pistol? How about a nice hunting rifle in .308 with quality glass and something else?

Just let me know what you have - I'll take the best or most interesting offer :) The safe isn't going anywhere... the incredible hulk couldn't carry this thing off.

Oh and sorry for the crappy pics... it's bolted down in a pretty tight spot. I couldn't get back and get better ones and it's dark in there. There is another shelf up top you can't see from the pics."

It can be SA Finned marked or not, doesn't really matter to me but I would like it to have the original Russian arsenal marks and not a Finn built rifle.

The upper is flat top and has a rail gas block, you would need to add flip up sights or an optic.  I just fired this rifle last weekend and it holds a great group and functions flawlessly.  I am asking 725.00 or best offer.  Please e-mail with any questions and if you are serious you can contact me @REDACTED.  I am located about 40 miles East of Toledo."

This is a great ccw gun and I have put less than 200 rds through this and never jammed or misfired. xd's are safe and reliable with the addtl safety feature in the palm swell that you dont get with the Glocks however there is not a manual safety to slow you up if need to use quickly. Gun sells new for 500.00 and up plus about 42.00 in tax so you are looking at at least spending 542.00 at a dealer if they have a subcompact in stock. I am including a in the pocket holster which was only 18.99 at the local gun shop made by blackhawk and a comfort carry hybrid In the Wasteband holster that is very comfortable to use and retails for around 65.00. So total in brand new value is well over 600.00 in this. Now reason I am wanting to sell or trade is wanting something bigger in size. Am wanting more of a target shooter than for CCW at this time. Am interested in 45 acp 1911's please no cheapie's. Would consider Glock 17's and 19's. Also would entertain AR's. Let me know what you have or how much you are offering. please include pics to save on me emailing you asking for pics.

Stainless steel / 2 ¾"" barrel / round butt
Pre-warning (no barrel stamp)

Here's the round butt, snub-nosed version of arguably one of the best series of 357 magnum revolvers ever made. Time-proven to be strong, accurate and utterly reliable. Many feel they are capable of several lifetimes of serious, magnum-shooting use.

This particular example is in excellent condition and has an early (more refined) finish, no warning mark on the barrel and locks up especially tight. By far the most popular version of the Ruger ""Six"" series and made of the more desirable material (stainless). It has its factory walnut grips and is waiting to serve for CCW use, nightstand duty, truck gun or . . . ?
