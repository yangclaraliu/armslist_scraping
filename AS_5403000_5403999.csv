The finger grooves have been removed and the entire grip has been stippled. The trigger guard has been filed down to allow for a higher grip. The included holsters are both inside-waistband holsters, one being a Theis IWB holster and the other being a Bladetech Phantom. In my opinion, the Theis holster is one of the most comfortable holster designs out there. You probably won't ever need to buy another IWB holster after owning this one.The gun is in good condition, with no wear beyond what you would expect from a gun that has been holstered and unholstered daily for a few months.I am looking for $550 for this package, though I am willing to negotiate on price or trades. I will consider any trade offers besides sub-compact handguns."

High AccuracyThe high velocity of the 5.7x28mm ammunition guarantees a virtually flat trajectory up to 200m for outstanding accuracy.         Fully ReliableThe simple design of the mechanism, the unique feed mechanism and the materials used to manufacture the FN P90® make it highly reliable, whatever the conditions.         Rapid DeploymentThe FN P90® is carried ready to fire. There is no need to extend any folding buttstock. Despite its shortness, the FN P90® is designed to be fired from the shoulder, giving maximum stability.         Quick AimingThe FN P90® Standard is fitted with an integrated optical sight without magnification. The user can therefore shoot with both eyes open. Performance is fully retained in low light conditions thanks to a tritium capsule.         Easy to CarryThe compactness of the FN P90® allows easy movement in confined areas. The magazine is fully integrated in the upper part of the FN P90® for optimized ergonomics.         Fully AmbidextrousThe cocking handle and magazine catch can be operated from both sides of the FN P90®. The fire selector is under the trigger and can be operated in either hand. Empty cartridge cases are ejected downwards. The FN P90® can therefore be handled by right- and left-handed operators without any modification.         High Magazine CapacitySince the 5.7x28mm rounds are light and small, the magazine fitted above the barrel can accept up to 50 cartridges."

Rifle was originally a mk1 that was updated to mkII standards. The rifle was brought back from Afghanistan. All parts are British made, this is not a Khyber Pass rifle. The rifle was fully taken apart by myself and the wood is properly British stamped in the barrel channel. The metal parts below the woodline have all original bluing and the barrel, receiver, rear sight match. Bore is very good and there is no pitting. The rifle is stamped with the Royal Afghan cypher on the nocks form, a very nice piece. Very few rifles are marked so. It is my last Afghan example, selling to generate funds for an AK74 to plink around with. Asking $600 shipped. Rifle is an antique and can ship to your door with proof of age. For some reason this site says ""shipping no"" but I will ship!"

This pistol was worked on by Curtis Bullock whose work can be viewed at bullockcustom.com. This pistol has the following upgrades: front strap checkered at 25 LPI with matching mainspring housing, magwell, VZ simonich grips secured to frame with o-rings, single-sided thumb safety hand fitted to frame, EGW grip safety blended to frame, EGW match barrel bushing, tuned extractor,  polished feed ramp, throated barrel,  17lb Wolf recoil spring,  and refinished in satin glass bead blast.  The pistol also comes with either a set of Trijicon HD night sights with orange front sight post or Heine Straight 8 with modified rear ledge. I left the trigger stock since it's capable of bulls-eye accuracy. The pistol was purchased brand new in 2012 and has only seen approximately 500 rounds through the barrel, only 100 rounds fired since the work was completed. All factory parts will come with the pistol. Asking $1295, cash sale only. No trades. Buyer must have either a concealed carry permit or NC concealed carry permit."

The HK 416 D145RS Semi-Automatic Rifle in .22 L.R. is manufactured exclusively by Walther under license from HK.

It has the awesome slim keymod rails. It weighs next to nothing and is built as solid as they come. I've only had it for about 8 months and have only zeroed the rifle maybe shooting 30-40 rounds. The only reason I am selling is to fund a new rifle that I want. Comes with all original paperwork and Magpul metal flip up sights. Below is DD description. The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4V11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip."
