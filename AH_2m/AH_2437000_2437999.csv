The Bauer .25 Automatic was made of precision machined 416 stainless steel investment castings and fitted by hand. The pistol features a two-position thumb safety.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This gun dates back to 50's I think, but has almost no wear.  The ivory colored plastic stocks are like new, no rust at all, excellent star, crown, barrel; slight turn ring on cylinder, appears to have been used very little and well cared for.  Double action/single action.

This is a pull pin type gun, very strong construction. Would make a good tacklebox gun or trail gun.  4 inch barrel.

there is one issue to note:  there are a couple of tool marks on the barrel where it looks as if someone slipped when making an adjustment to the front sight.

these marks do not detract from good use, but makes it not as interesting as a collectible.  otherwise this appears to be collector grade, if you like H&R.

so best use is as a good reliable shooter that will give you years of service.

$175 or best offer, don't be shy.  I know that 22 ammo is hard to come by now, so for a face to face transaction with Illinois resident, I will include 100  rounds of either Remi Golden Bullet or Federal hi speed hollow point, you choose.

No trades for guns.  Will accept cash or US silver coins if face to face deal.  If through mail, only US Postal money order.  You pay shipping to your FFL in the 48 states.  Will not ship to places where prohibited.

Are you just wanting some color or accents done? I can do it for you and make it look however you want. I specialize in military style camo and can do basic blending that matches the environment around here. I can do digi, desert, urban, tiger stripping, ect. Ten years of marine corps infantry including instructing camouflage at ocs in Quantico VA has given me the skills to match just about any environment. I can do pretty much anything you need done. Deer binds, tree stands, you name it and I'll camo or paint it. I don't have set prices because I will work with your budget and also the work you are wanting done. I am painting/airbrushing, not dipping so don't be confused and any work I do is removable if you choose. I'll take your old paint off for a fee if you want to change or remove completely. I don't disassemble your weapon unless you ok it. I'm especially proficient with ar, glocks, and Beretta. I will make some samples upon request of patterns if you want to see what you will be getting before I start any work. If you have been looking to camo your weapons, hunting items, or whatever just hit me up. I am much cheaper than having them dipped and my stuff can be changed if you do wish to do so. 

I CAN DO DURACOATING. If you want duracoat, I will need a deposit up front because the materials must be ordered and takes 3-5 business days to arrive. I will not pay out of pocket for materials for the duracoat, although I do not charge for the labor until the weapon is finished and you approve. If you want the duracoat, go to the website and look around at what you want. I only charge a deposit of the materials that you wish to order. (plus shipping) 

Some examples of what patterns I can do: (these can be done with duracoat or airbrushing if you want cheaper prices)
Multicam (the current camo the army is wearing in Afghanistan) 
MarPat digital
Desert Digital
Army/ACU camo
Vietnam era tiger strip 
zebra/ leopard print (any animal print for the most part)
skulls, spider web, (working on zombie stuff so that will be available soon)
snakeskin 
Urban (divi, tiger striping, or normal patterns)

I can do most items you may want done such as:
Rifle cases
Pelican Cases
ammo cans
animal skulls
scopes and other optics
Deer blinds/tree stands
anything you want, I can usually work with, just ask!

These are just the common ones I can do, I am constantly working on new patterns and ideas so if you don't see one that you are interested in give me some thoughts on what you would like. I can pretty much do whatever you want done. Think about it like a tattoo for your weapon (or any items like ammo cans, tool boxes, boats). I can also do those patterns in any color scheme you want. For example the urban pattern with red like the spetznas wore. I can also do a detailed cleaning on your weapons for additional fee. I spent a decade scrubbing m16s, SAWs, M9, ect and know how to get it inspection ready. I can take even the dirtiest AR and make it brand new. (no chemicals or power tools just elbow grease and an AP brush) Text or call anytime but text works faster for me. I am 100% Disabled Vet and do not work FYI so I can spend a great deal of time getting your weapon back to you fairly quick. Semper Fi

50 BMG RIFLE SYSTEM: (FLAT DARK EARTH COLOR. COMES WITH: 10 ROUND MAGAZINE, BIPOD, MONOPOD, HARD CARRYING CASE. It may be related to the Model 82A1/M107, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold."

I just built this bad boy a few months ago, and have put 400 rounds through it.  It's a great shooter, and the optics provide for close, and long range, targeting without any hassle.

Holiday season has not treated me well,  so my loss is your gain.  I am offering this rifle, case, single point sling, optic, 2 magpul pmags, and ~100ish mixed .223 and 5.56 green tip.  $1000.  This is my bottom price, as I dont have to sell it, but would like to for some extra cash for the holday. 

FTF, cash or bank check ONLY. Will not ship.  18+, and would like a peak at ID. CPL preferred, but I dont have one either, so not required.  Please be willing to travel to bellevue\redmond area.

A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold."

562,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2437562,For Sale/Trade:  800 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP,"Puyallup, Washington, United States",$ 650,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 11, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Best CCW Ammo you can buy!

For sale/trade is 800 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Current retail price on this is between $1.25/round and $1.50/round - I am asking far less than that for cash offers.

Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

Like all Dan Wesson 1911s, Commander models incorporate top quality parts from the best names in the industry.
• Round top slide with fixed 3 dot tritium night sights
• Forged, one piece match grade barrel and bushing
• Ed Brown Bobtail mainspring housing

• Wolff springs used exclusively
• Tuned, machined, internal extractor • Test fired for reliability • 34 ounces unloaded
• Diamond checkered coco-bolo grips

As noted above, this is the two-toned stainless with ceramic upper (slide) and is simply a beautiful firearm.  I like it a LOT but I don’t LOVE it if you know what I mean and frankly, I’ve put less than 150 round through it. It’s a great firearm but as I’ve had it all this time I’ve realized how very little I’ve used it; my Glock 20s have gotten the lion’s share of my 10MM attention.

Comes with everything as it was from the factory.  I’ll check again tonight when I get home but I’m sure there are zero blemishes of any kind.  I’ll also post a couple of pictures this evening as well and I can always send additional by text or by email.

Asking $1,450…not interested in any trades at this time.

Thanks for taking the time to look and feel free to ask any questions you may have!

I will post a ""stock"" photo so that you'll at least have an idea but so far, all the picturs I've found aren't of the two-toned model!

Rifle was built on a peened 1943 DOU (Bruno (Waffen-Werke Brünn AG,Waffenwerke Bruenn, Bystrica, Czechoslovakia)) for vintage sniper rifle competition by a professional gunsmith.  

This rifle is a Russian capture rifle and was initially part of a crate purchased for reenacting and was used for that purpose for several years.  Eventually I had the barrel, stock and handguard replaced with ones that were in better shape for use in Vintage Military rifle matches.  I later had the rifle converted to a sniper rifle for use in Vintage Sniper Rifle matches with the addition of a reproduction ZF-39 scope and solid ring high turret mounts, at that time the entire rifle was polished and re-blued.  

The reproduction Zf-39 scope is 4x magnification and has post and crosshair reticle and is legal for Vintage Sniper Rifle matches.  The scopes objective and ocular both unscrew in order to mount in the solid high turret mounts. The high turret mount scope and rings are removable, the bases are both screwed and soldered into place, as per original specifications. The scope has not been soldered in place in the rings as the originals were and should be soldered into place at some point.  

The peened markings on the receiver are covered up by the scope mounts.  The stock that is currently on it is also a Russian capture stock that has been filled with some type of resin near the butt plate. There are some original markings on the replacement barrel and butt plate.  MOST of the part numbers match, the bolt does not match.  The extractor on the bolt has been replaced with a new one, the original one is included in the sale, it was replaced since it has a significant chip in the rim of the extractor.

The original barrel, stock and handguard is included in sale.

Additional photos available to serious inquiries only!

Payments accepted are money order, certified check, personal check (personal checks will be deposited and shipping will be held for 10 days pending bank clearance).  

Shipping is actual cost.   

Rifle must ship to an FFL dealer or holder, OR if you are a C&R holder I can ship directly to you.  Face to face will require me to see a valid purchase or CCW permit.

I have up for sale a like new Charter arms Lavender Lady 38 spl Hammerless model. This is the model that has ""The Lavender Lady"" engraved into the barrel rather than anodized on like some of them do. This is also the Hammerless model which isnt as easy to come by compared to the hammer models that run 399.99+ in stores. This little 5 shot is perfect for conceal carry for a man or woman. The color actually grows on you and has a great sheen to it. Haha. It has had less than 75 rounds through it and has zero issues. The grip is fantastic and pockets very nice for being this kind of gun. The kick is very light considering its weight and the punch it is delivering. I would keep this but I already have a conceal and my gal just isnt in to revolvers. So, I will pass this great gun on to someone who will use it for more than just a safe queen! Included for the asking price are the original case, paperwork, lock, and the pistol itself. I can also possibly include ammo on my end for the right trade. I need to meet in or very close to norman if possible due to my current time constraints, but Im not unreasonable. For any questions or for more pictures please shoot me an email or text me at REDACTED and we can try and make a deal."

It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate.

Selling only due to going from DI to Piston.  The suppressor in the pictures is NOT included.

***** PLEASE BE ADVISED:  This upper itself is NOT considered an NFA item or even a firearm.  I will ship this item to anyone over 18, after you email me a scanned copy of your valid DL and state that it's in fact being shipped to you.  However, know the laws in your state and NFA laws in general.  You do NOT want to have an unmated AR lower (non-SBR'd) in your home.  I recommend you have an AR pistol or an SBR'd lower if you buy this.  Know your rights, but know the law *****

This is a built 10.5"" AR upper only, perfect for someone running an AAC QD can.

Upper:  Staag Arms Receiver

Barrel: 10"" White Oak Armament Match Grade Stainless 1:7 Twist

Gas Block: White Oak Armament Low Profile

Rail:  Daniel Defense 10"" Lite Rail

Grip:  Spike's Tactical VFG

Sights:  Yankee Hill Machine Same Plane Auto Flip Up Back Up Iron Sights

Bolt: Auto carrier and bolt

Charging Handle:  PRI Gas Buster

Brake:  The price as listed is with a standard Birdcage muzzle brake.  The muzzle brake pictured is an AAC Blackout Compensator.  The comp was custom spaced, clocked, and fitted so that an AAC can will fit perfectly against the rail (see pictures).  If you want the brake pictured, add $100 to the price.  They run about $125 new and that's not including the proper clocking done due to the DD rail length.

The upper has 150 rounds through it and tested on full auto with no issues.  The comp and bolt/carrier are brand new.  The pictures show some smudges, but it's in excellent and like new condition.

I'm looking to sell only and the price is pretty firm. NO TRADES.

It features a 1/7 twist Colt Gov't profile barrel and everything is near perfect on it. The upper is paired to a new Aero Precision mil-spec lower using many of the Colt lower receiver parts. The stock is a Colt USGI A2 stock with Colt rifle buffer and spring. As you can see by the photos there is little to no wear on the upper receiver and the lower is new. Unfortunately the lower is darker than the mid-80s gray color Colt used on the upper. Or maybe the upper is just a lighter color. Either way, the color cosmetics don't affect the performance of either. I believe the upper came from an R6550 AR-15 A2 Gov't Model rifle. It has the 1/7 twist, government profile barrel with the deadly bayonet lug (the barrel is a smaller diameter under the handguards). It has all the A2 features including 800M sights, forward assist, brass deflector, etc.

I've also added a few very useful upgrades for the Leftists among us (left-handers, that is).  I've installed a Norgon ambi mag release and a Rock River Arms ambi-selector switch.

The sale will include one Colt-brand Colorado neutered and legal, non-high capacity, non-massacre capable magazine which is clearly incapable of causing destruction and mayhem on a large scale. So you can feel very socially responsible when you purchase this gun/magazine combo.

I fired 10 rounds of 69gr SMK ammo for function and, naturally, it functioned perfectly. USGI and Magpul mags fit the lower without issue.

Transfer will be at Colorado Gun Broker in Bailey, right on Hwy 285. It's only 25 mins from C-470 and US 285 and it's much easier than driving across town"
