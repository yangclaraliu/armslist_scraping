Pistol features walnut stock, 9” barrel with a 1 in 30” twist, brass trigger guard and wooden ramrod. This pistol would make an ideal ‘camp’ gun where the authorities might otherwise frown upon or outright arrest you for having a modern arm, and the caliber is such that it should be able to handle most any camp emergency. This is also a neat gun to take to the club or local shooting range where a couple of rounds fired off will fill the shooting  ports with smoke and have all the curious gathering around your point for a look see. Pistol comes with in-line capper, short ball starter, belt hook, and loading instructions. This pistol will take either a .490 round ball with a .010 to .015 patch or a .495 round ball with a .010 to .005 patch. Nipple is a common 6mm x .75, as found on most Pietta percussion revolvers. Cap size #11 is called for, but depending on the maker some # 10’s will fire off a charge as well. All black powder substitutes {Pyrodex/Triple Seven} can be used in this gun as well as black powder – this includes both pistol and rifle grade [FFFg / FFg] powders. While modern loading specs call for FFFg powder, FFg grade was used in mostly all black powder loads back in the day – this includes black powder cartridges. Asking $200.00 - FIRM - for this piece and no trades; I have everything I want - shipping and insurance costs included. Please note – ridiculously low offers will go unanswered. I accept for payment:  money orders, bank checks, and verifiable personal checks. I will answer your e-mail inquiries, but please be patient – I don’t live on my computer and my time on such varies from day to day. Please be sure that you really want this piece before you jerk me around for three days and then decide to crawfish out of the deal. Thanks for stopping by and looking."

My RMR is a RM02 it is a 6.5 moa LED red dot. it is non adjustable and always on. Battery life is a over a year. I have the box and life-time warrenty for the RMR. The only way to make this combination is by buying two glocks, There are no reliability issues. They are both 21's and by specs exactly the same except the C has 2 ports in the barrel and slide. The SF frame is brand new from glock with 0 round count. I traded in a DOD 1913 SF for the standard SF. The upper has maybe 2-300hundred rounds out of it. This gun has almost no recoil and with RMR I can easily make shots over 50yards and am much quicker target to target. I am only selling to build another project.

I also have a raven concealment holster made to fit this weapon with a x300ultra (x300U not included) I have OWB and IWB adaptors.
I list both pistol prices so you can get a range of each value. the SF is the most popular LOWERS and the C is a very rare UPPER on 21's. Best of both worlds.

CHECK YOU LOCAL LAWS AND LISTINGS.


This is a 5-shot top break .32 revolver. The timing is perfect. It is in excellent condition, there is no rust on it, barely any patina. It looks like a large gun but it is actually very small and compact, no longer than most cell phones and has a smaller profile than most wheel guns. The barrel is about 3 inches long.

Despite being an antique, this gun is actually very modular.

This is due to it being top break, so unlike most revolvers, it is very easy to change out the barrel and cylinder.

You could shoot .32 ACP out of it so long as it was lead ammo, and not FMJ.

There are tons of parts for it on ebay. You could get a spare snub nose barrel and a spare hammer, then grind the spur down to make it the ultimate carry gun, you could get a cylinder and barrel set chambered in .38, which you could also probably shoot lead .380 out of.

You could even get a .22 barrel and cylinder for it.

IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL TO BUY A HANDGUN THROUGH A PRIVATE SALE AT THE AGE OF 18. YOU MUST BE 21 TO BUY THROUGH AN FFL, BUT 18 FOR PRIVATE SALES.     Now that that's over with, on to my ad

I am an 18 year old college student looking to buy a nice quality handgun preferably in 9mm or 45. I'm looking for something I can keep in my glove box or beside my bed for the next three years and then use as a carry piece. I may be interested in a revolver, but semi-auto is preferred. I'd also like it to be polymer framed, and ambidextrous as I shoot lefty, but it doesn't have to be. I've been dealing with it for years

I'd like to stay in the $300~ range or am willing to trade a couple month old Mossberg 535 12 gauge at $450 trade value. Camo, pistol grip, multi-position stock, and fiber-optic sights. Just shot it for the first time this weekend and it's flawless. 5+1 capacity.
If trading, I'd like to get a nice handgun and another (cheap) 12 or 20 gauge for home defense use. 
I also have some fishing poles that I wouldn't mind trading off. I love fishing, just don't need this many poles. 
I may add cash for the right multi gun trade.

Calibers considered: 380, 38 special, 357, 9mm, 40, 45. 
Would like to stick with the big manufacturers: S&W, Ruger, Glock, Taurus, Bersa, etc. but most others considered.
Would also consider a Kel-Tec in the $250 range.

All offers considered, the worst I can say is no thank you.

I may also be interested in a cheap (~$100) 22 caliber handgun to plink with on the weekends/camping trips. Semi-auto, revolver, it doesn't matter. Not too picky with this one as long as it shoots. No Jimenez, Jennings, Bryco, Raven or HiPoints!

This is a modern .38 Special made entirely of Stainless Steel and is suitable for for defensive and/or recreational use, it is also collectible. It has adjustable sights, beautiful Brazilian hardwood grips, and it holds 6 rounds of .38 Special ammo. This revolver appears to have been fired very little if at all, I have never fired it, it's a safe queen that sits on a carpeted shelf in my climatically controlled safe, there is not a mark on it anywhere that I can see and it looks like it left the factory yesterday. Mechanical function is correct in every way; the cylinder locks and unlocks properly and there is no cylinder play or slop, trigger pull is very nice, the bore is perfect with crisp and sharp lands and grooves and the stainless steel finish is a nice as any I've ever seen on any revolver. There is not another revolver on the market today with all the positive attributes this revolver has, the 3"" barrel and ventilated rib are particular desirable. Will meet buyer at a store front FFL dealer for a MSP compliant transfer, I use a shop in Charles County and one in southern Prince George's county and they are both a pleasure to work with, I will consider your dealer if you don't want to use either of these guys but I'm not interested in driving any further north than Bowie, MD. I won't rule out going thru an local MSP barracks but I have found them to be less than accommodating in doing transfers between private individuals. Once we meet at the dealer, you pay me in full in cash, we both do the MSP paperwork, then my part of the transaction is complete. Buyer pays FFL and MSP fees, must have Maryland HQL. I will ship out of state (where legal) to your FFL if you pay for insured shipping. Not interested in trades of any sort."

CHECK YOU LOCAL LAWS AND LISTINGS.


This is a 5-shot top break .32 revolver. The timing is perfect. It is in excellent condition, there is no rust on it, barely any patina. It looks like a large gun but it is actually very small and compact, no longer than most cell phones and has a smaller profile than most wheel guns. The barrel is about 3 inches long.

Despite being an antique, this gun is actually very modular.

This is due to it being top break, so unlike most revolvers, it is very easy to change out the barrel and cylinder.

You could shoot .32 ACP out of it so long as it was lead ammo, and not FMJ.

There are tons of parts for it on ebay. You could get a spare snub nose barrel and a spare hammer, then grind the spur down to make it the ultimate carry gun, you could get a cylinder and barrel set chambered in .38, which you could also probably shoot lead .380 out of.

You could even get a .22 barrel and cylinder for it.

This rifle is in excellent condition with very little wear on metal or wood. This is also considered a take down model by removing the forward grip and unscrewing with the lever inside. Made famous by Bonnie and Clyde this is an excellent example with no drilling or tapping holes like so many others out there on the market. This was manufactured in July of 1944 by the earliest date code on the barrel shroud near the receiver. This rifle comes with the reloading dies for 300 savage and some ammo and brass. On a side note brass is easily available by converting 308 brass. Simply cut the 308 brass to the correct length and size in the 300 savage sizing die.

I have collected handguns imported by InterArms of Alexandria VA for over 30 years and now I soon to retire and relocate and am selling the last of my collection. This is a modern .38 Special made entirely of Stainless Steel and is suitable for for defensive and/or recreational use, it is also collectible. It has adjustable sights, beautiful Brazilian hardwood grips, and it holds 6 rounds of .38 Special ammo. This revolver appears to have been been fired very little. I have never fired it, it's a safe queen that sits on a carpeted shelf in my climatically controlled safe, there is not a mark on it anywhere that I can see and it looks like it left the factory yesterday. Mechanical function is perfect; the cylinder locks and unlocks properly and there is no cylinder play or slop, trigger pull is very nice with no creep or stacking, the bore is perfect with crisp and sharp lands and grooves and the stainless steel finish is a nice as any I've ever seen on any revolver. There is not another revolver on the market today with all the positive attributes this revolver has, the 4"" barrel and ventilated rib are particular desirable. Will meet buyer at a store front FFL dealer for a MSP compliant transfer, I use a shop in Charles County and one in southern Prince George's county and they are both a pleasure to work with, I will consider your dealer if you don't want to use either of these guys but I'm not interested in driving any further north than Bowie, MD. I won't rule out going thru an local MSP barracks but I have found them to be less than accommodating in doing transfers between private individuals. Once we meet at the dealer, you pay me in full in cash, we both do the MSP paperwork, then my part of the transaction is complete, buyer pays FFL and MSP fees, and must have Maryland HQL. I will ship out of state (where legal) to your FFL if you pay for insured shipping. Not interested in trades of any sort."

Average condition and nonmatching #'s from $300 & up. But mine has something I've never seen mentioned and as such am unsure of the value. The stock has been stamped with a Nazi eagle crest w/SS and under it reads WaA2. I  think it's an Abbreviation for Wehrmacht Division A2. The Gestopo, under Heinrich Muller had internal departments asigned to investigate and act upon certain groups they were A1 Communists,A2 Counter Sabotage,A3 Reactionaries and Liberals, & A4 Assassinations. There were also departments B,C,D, & E. Dept B was Sects and churches, B1 Catholics, B2 Protestants,B3 Freemasons and B4 Jews. If you want to know more I found this info on Wikipedia under the term Gestopo. It also said the Gestopo or Hitlers Secret Police used a number of these exact rifles, & I believe this to be one of those.it's in too good of shape to have seen any time in the trenches. It's 39"" long. Anyone with any info they want to share drop me a line and I'll email you my phone # As far as price goes? Make me an offer...... P.S. I'll try to get some better pics on here, the glare off the stock makes it impossible to see any thing but the Eagle in the crest, but the SS is bright and clear in person.... I have 40rds of non corrosive  ppu, and 20ds of the corrosive 1938/39 nazi marked ammo w/clips & the same SS crest printed on it to go with the rifle."

 Im guessing its a indian enfield.  And before my email gets swarmed I do not know anything about the scope other then stated. If I put a high dollar scope on it id want my high dollar money for the scope so it dont make since. 
 Gun shoots great. Boly has been polished along with firing pin    will throw in ammo for right offer.  But people be real. A basic rock island can be bought new for 400 bucks. Id trade even but dont offer me a 150 dollar gun. My scope alone cost more then that.  This is valued at 450 to me  so make it a good trade  no junk! Dont tell me im to high because if it were yours you'd be asking more so dont start.

I do not have enough time to shoot and have decided to thin out the collection.  This gun only has 40 rounds through the chamber.  I brought it to the range to test fire after I bought it then it sat in the gun case since.  It shot like a dream dead in accurate.  If you want to pay for me to get into the range I will let you test fire it to see how sweet of a shooter this gun is.  All matching serial number so it isn't just a mutt gun like most of them out there.  Thanks for looking and let me know if your interested.  If you have trades I will entertain the right trade.

Description courtesy of Primary Arms:
The ELCAN SpecterDR 4x/1x Dual Role Optical Sight represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.

Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 1x mode the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x the Specter DR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image.

The SpecterDR 4x/1x offers the best single solution for both Medium Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

The date code on this gun is “IC” so it was made in Germany in 1982. The HK 91 is chambered in .308 Winchester and this one is an original A-3 with the very desirable retractable stock, which is also referred to as a Paratrooper Model. The condition is excellent to mint, and will grace any collection. There is no wear, damage or alterations, just a couple of insignificant handling marks. I would rate the metal features at 98%+ condition. The barrel has a flash hider; hooded post front sight and a rotating diopter rear sight with quick adjust from 100 to 400 yards. The gun also comes with the claw mount base for mounting a weaver style base for rigging the optics of your choice. It is recoil operated delayed roller lock bolt & comes with five 20 round magazines. The 5 magazines are stamped as follows: G3 HK 5/60, G3 HK 11/60, G3 HK 8/61, G3 HK 11/61, G3 HK 12/61 which makes them all older than 50 years qualifying as curio and relics.

How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragonov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers a magazine adapter to use AK47 mags. $575.00 Cash only at this time.
