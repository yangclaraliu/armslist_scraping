From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.

It shoots .308 projectiles so you can shoot from 110 grain to 240 grain bullets in sonic and subsonic speeds. My favorite load is loaded with 150 grain Hornady SST with 15.5 grains of Accurate 1680 powder a CCI primer in hornady brass set with .002 jump. The velocity and kinetic energy of this load reminds me a lot of a 30-30 but with better bullet selection for greater Sectional Density and better Ballistic Coefficient ratting.

lightly used Hornady Lock n load AP for sale. Included is a brass collator to stack the brass for constant feeding. I built the collator myself, using a geared motor from an arcade coin pusher. It's a heavy duty A/C motor, like what dillon and hornady uses.

After the first 4 pulls of the handle, every pull of the handle will spit out a freshly loaded round. Really fast.

It's set up right now for .45 ACP, but the collator will also feed .40 S&w brass.

Price isn't really negotiable, since I am losing money selling it at this price.
I will knock 50 bucks off if you let me keep the .45 acp carbide dies, since my pistol is in this caliber.

I am selling most of my reloading gear, including my rifles and pistols. I plan on keeping the bare minimum of reloading gear and guns and getting better at using them, instead of letting my possessions accumulate to the point where they become a burden on my soul.

I still have a wife and 3 kids, so it's not like I can give the stuff away though. I am selling at no actual profit at all. Just getting SOME of the money I've spent back.

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant.

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

Cost of Sight Pusher $120.00 plus $6.00 for priority shipping, if you pay with PayPal they is a $4.00 charge making the total $130.00. It will be the last money you will need to spend for a sight pusher!
If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is. It will be the only sight pusher you will ever need!"

No shimming necessary and it's rock solid. It is currently sighted in at 100 yards using Bulgarian silver tip surplus ammo.

586,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2760586,For Sale:  Universal sight Pusher,"Meadville, PA, Arizona, United States",$ 130,"Listed On: Sunday, March 2, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here it is: The Top-of-the-line, Heavy Duty, XD (plus others) sight pusher. 
They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

Cost of Sight Pusher $120.00 plus $6.00 for priority shipping, if you pay with PayPal they is a $4.00 charge making the total $130.00. It will be the last money you will need to spend for a sight pusher!
If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is. It will be the only sight pusher you will ever need!"

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

Cost of Sight Pusher $120.00 plus $6.00 for priority shipping, if you pay with PayPal they is a $4.00 charge making the total $130.00. It will be the last money you will need to spend for a sight pusher!
If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is. It will be the only sight pusher you will ever need!"

Stainless ... in 45 caliber.

This is a great gun because it combines all of the combat proven aspects of the US 1911 45 with Sig quality and function.  

It functions and breaks-down just like a 1911 except this one has a de-cock butting, just like Sig 226, 229 and others.   So, for those of us spoiled by Sig's de-cock, this is the 45 to have.  Also, with Sig quality you get the sweet Sig trigger pull.  Note, nice Hogue grips added.

Stainless is great for the added protection and sturdiness of the gun.

This one comes with two clips ... one standard and one extended Sig clip that buys you one extra round in the clip.

I prefers face-to-face, cash, with VA IDs and paperwork.  Yes, I will ship.  FFL and shipping are not cheap but I will eat part of that expense.  So, I'll FFL this to anywhere in the 48 for a flat $30 (yes, it costs more than that).

I have a new box of 100 target loads from Bass Pro and about 50 home defense hollow points that I can negotiate into the deal ... if that helps.   My Sig 229 holsters fit this perfectly so, if throwing in a holster helps, let me know.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints. Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions. Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic • Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use. • 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances. • In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy. • Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes. • Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit. • Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing.

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

Cost of Sight Pusher $120.00 plus $6.00 for priority shipping, if you pay with PayPal they is a $4.00 charge making the total $130.00. It will be the last money you will need to spend for a sight pusher!
If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is. It will be the only sight pusher you will ever need!"

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

Cost of Sight Pusher $120.00 plus $6.00 for priority shipping, if you pay with PayPal they is a $4.00 charge making the total $130.00. It will be the last money you will need to spend for a sight pusher!
If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is.

Product Description

Originally designed by Bruce Browning, this is the Browning Autoloading Rifle that started it all. Featuring fine Walnut, a precision machined ordinance steel receiver and a hammer forged barrel, this magnificent BAR will make autoloading enthusiasts out of the most skeptical riflemen. Classic in looks and contemporary in performance, the BAR MK II Safari is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet.

Hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy.
The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
Patented BOSS® device available on certain models of the BAR MK II Safari model allows your to dial-in barrel harmonics to maximize accuracy with your favorite load.
Scroll-engraved ordinance steel receiver on the BAR MK II Safari is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
Gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel.
Seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges.
Strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration.
Buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability.
Bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves.
BAR MK II Safari is equipped with a traditional detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading, in the field or on the range.
Magazine capacity on the BAR MK II Safari is 3 rounds in WSM calibers, 4 rounds in traditional magnum calibers and 5 rounds in standard calibers.
Trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod.
Generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.
Richly blued steel finish is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
Charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard.
Crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Walnut stock on the BAR MK II Safari has cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end to improve your grip, and a beautiful deep gloss finish that brings out every nuance of the warm grain of the wood.
Traditional recoil pad on the BAR MK II Safari greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching.
Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling.

Custom bolt work including, Badger handle, silver soldered smooth, then the handle arm has been drilled, tapped and screwed to bolt,(It will never break., see last picture), and then it was all Teflon coated in black for a super smooth and quiet action.

5R specs:
Barrel

    The rifle has a stainless alloy barrel at 24 inches long. The barrel's twist is RH 1:11.2 (many other rifles like it shoot RH 1:12). Originally, the 700 Milspec 5R was based on rejected rifle barrels that did not pass inspection on the M24 production line. These rejected barrels were then fitted onto the Remington 700 body and retooled as the ""Milispec"" rifle with a shorter twist.

Weight and Length

    The overall weight of the Milispec 5R is 8.25 lbs. (3.75 kg) and the length is 43.75 inches, or roughly 1,111 mm.

Magazine and Trigger

    The 5R's standard magazine is a five-round internal box. The trigger is Remington's own X-Mark Pro. The X-Mark Pro trigger has a pull weight of approximately 3-1/2 lbs. with roughly 2 lbs. of adjustment capability.

Stock and Finish

    The stock on the standard 5R is the HS Precision Composite and the finish is a dark gray/black color. Similar to Remington's Varmint Synthetic stocks, the 5R's stock is speckled with green within the gray/black of the plastic. Unlike the M24, which has a black powder-coated floor plate and metalwork, the 5R's barrel and action are unfinished stainless alloy.

Rifle has maybe 60 rounds through it.
No box.

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is.

Next is the Custom Gen.4 Glock that has more money in the modification than the actual gun cost. Some people thinks its dumb, and swear by there stock Glock. This Glock isn't for those people. I feel like this Glock performs better than a factory Glock, and the money was well spent, and done right. This is a smooth shooting accurate subcompact Glock that is perfect for concealed carry, home defense, and personal defense. The trigger is super light, and its balanced to handle recoil better, and get back on target faster. First, it has Trijicon night sights. It has a Match-Grade KKM Precision barrel that was match fitted, and is extremely accurate. It has a Double spring tungsten guide rod that's 5X heavier than a factory guide rod, and 2X heavier than a Stainless Steel Guide rod. It helps greatly with muzzle flip, and recoil. I also installed a Zev Tech Fulcrum trigger, and trigger bar. I put a 6lb. Enhanced trigger spring in , a Ghost Evo 3.5 lb. connector, Lightning Strike Titanium polished safety plunger with reduced power safety spring, a 6 lb. firing pin spring, (also have a factory setting 5lb. And 4lb. Firing pin spring to reduce trigger weight more if desired), and a polished skeletonized firing pin with Marine Cups to make the trigger very smooth and crisp with a clean break at 4lbs. All the slip and grittiness is gone from the trigger with this setup. I have it setup for self defense with a 4lb. pull, and the pre-travel is slightly shorter than factory with the after travel virtually eliminated from the trigger. It can be adjusted to be lighter with the changing of some springs or heavier, and the pre travel and over travel can be adjusted to be a hair trigger to a long trigger pull. I put a Vickers Tactical mag release, and slide catch to help with the controls of the gun. If you know about these modifications you know it's not a cheap setup at all. I also have 3 mag all with +1 Pearce Grip Extensions, and a Minotour Comp-Tac IWB holster for it. I really want to trade this than sell it. I would need around $1,150.00 for it. I have close to $1,400.00 in it. If you want a polymer frame gun that performs like a high end 1911 this is your gun. If you just want a Glock this isn't for you. 

The last gun is much more simple. It needs no upgrades or extra parts. It's a Kimber Ultra Raptor in Stainless Steel. It has 3 Stainless Kimber mags, and a custom leather IWB holster. It's in excellent condition, and around 200 rounds put through it. Very beautiful gun, and is very accurate for a 3"" barrel. I won't sale it for cash. It's trade only. I can trade it alone or in any combo with the other guns for the right deal."

They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well. 
Its unique universal feature uses a clamp on the bottom and swivel tipped screws on the sides. The swivel tipped screws provide added slide support, extra finish protection along with aligning many different slide configurations. 
This pusher will remove and install most sights including Tru-Glo. This tool can help take the nightmare out of changing sights and sighting in an XD and many others. 
It can move, install, or remove the sights in either direction.
This XD sight pusher is shown on an XD service pistol but works on many others.
Why not save yourself time, money and aggravation, buy the best the first time

Cost of Sight Pusher $120.00 plus $6.00 for priority shipping, if you pay with PayPal they is a $4.00 charge making the total $130.00. It will be the last money you will need to spend for a sight pusher!
If you look at the cost of the materials; I use a 6061 solid aluminum block that's hard coat anodized, grade 8 screws, a hardened push block,a hardened rail, swivel tip (derlon or stainless tip) support screws, the material and outside service cost (heat treat, anodizing) is significant. I am not making these to get rich or as my full time job, I make these because I know what a difference a great tool can make to a shooters experience and how fun shooting is.

Standard production AK 47 with black synthetic furniture. The only thing I did to upgrade this rifle since I bought it was add a Hogue grip (I have the original grip which comes with the rifle).

--
The LWRCI™ M6A3™ features our midlength short-stroke gas piston system that is the perfect blend of tactical carbine and sniper-capable rifle. The midlength operating system’s softer recoil allows for faster return-to-target and follow-up shots.

Designed with optics in mind, the M6A3™ rifle is perfectly suited to accept a red dot sight or a high-powered scope. It features an integrated flip-down front sight and patented ARM-R free-float rail system. The easily removable top platform gives quick access to the barrel and piston system and reinstalls in seconds with no tools required."
