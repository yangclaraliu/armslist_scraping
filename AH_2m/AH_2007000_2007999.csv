These uppers were built for full auto Colt M16s so the lowers are replaced with various makers to make for a civillian legal AR15.  The lower is a DPMS model A2.  The entire rifle is in great condition.

I had the rifle professionally stripped and duracoated at Kemps custom coatings in southern IN.  I chose to go with a cammo pack option from Duracoat in their ""swiss camoflauge pattern"" I just really liked the look of the Swiss cammo pack Duracoat offered. I paid $500 for the duracoat service alone.

This rifle is a pre ban unit with a functional bayonet lug and a threaded barrel. I installed full rifle length aluminum quadrail before duracoat was applied so the rails are done and I have one Colt magazine in the cammo pack.

.The first interchangeable barrel pistol produced was the W12, or the Dan Wesson Model 12 which was chambered in .357 Magnum. The barrels and shrouds for this model were interchangeable and used an exposed nut on the muzzle end to secure the barrel and shroud. The shrouds on these early models had an elongated flange which helped to center the barrel and properly secure it. Later, this design was refined into the Model 15 which still used the flanged barrel assemblies, but which had the nut recessed inside the flange in order to give the pistol a more conventionally finished look. Further refinements to the model 15 resulted in the Model 15-2 which is the most well known as well as the best selling Dan Wesson model. The 15-2 used a roll pin inserted into the frame as a centering dowel combined with a precisely drilled hole in the shroud assembly to facilitate proper shroud centering and alignment, thus eliminating the flanged barrel shrouds. The 15-2 also introduced more barrel offerings, including lengths of 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 15 inches, venting, ribbed shrouds, shrouds with full underlugs, and plain solid shrouds. The pistols could be ordered as ""Pistol Pacs"" with 3 (initially) and later 4 (or more) barrels shipped inside a fiberglass briefcase with barrel changing tool and clearance gauges; however, many pistols were sold with only one barrel- though owners could choose to purchase other barrels later."

Serious cash offers will be considered. Cash price is for pistol, magazines and holsters only.

The E2 in 9mm is a very wonderful gun.  The E2 is the Sig Sauer's first pistol to feature the new E2 grips and updated main spring that has been adopted in all new Sigs.  It has factory Sig Night sights and comes with the factory installed SRT (short reset trigger.)  The E2 comes with 3 15 round magazines all Sig originals, and the original Sig box.  Pistol is very accurate and wonderful to shoot.

The pistol was manufactured in August of 2010 and I have put about 500-600 rounds through it.  A  very low round count considering these pistols were built to withstand 10,000 plus rounds.  I have never had any malfunction's or issues with any part of this pistol or the magazines.

I am looking to trade for a Sig Sauer P229 in .40 S&W.  Your pistol must have Sig Night sights, and the SRT is desired as well but not a deal breaker if it doesn't have it.  I am not looking for the SAO, DAO, or the DAK versions of the P229, I want the SA/DA version.  

I will also consider a Glock 23 plus cash (to make up the difference in price).  I would like a Glock 23 with night sights but standard sights are acceptable.  Along with a trade for a Glock 23 I can also add a Crossbreed holster and a Triple K Shoulder holster that fit the P229.

I am also willing to trade some ammunition.

All trades will be in the Colorado Springs to Castle Rock area, I will not travel all the way across the state to make a trade.  Must be legaly able to own a firearm, I will require to see your CO DL/CCW in order to trade.  If you have any comments or questions or would like to see any other pictures please let me know."

No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger Mark III pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol. The 22/45 Lite has aircraft-grade aluminum upper receiver with a black anodized finish and features a fluted barrel shroud, making the pistol extremely lightweight. The 4.4-inch stainless barrel sleeve is kept in place by a tension nut, ensuring the same accuracy and reliability of the Ruger 22/45 line. The barrel is threaded 1/2""-28 for popular muzzle accessories with a thread protector supplied. The 22/45's integral cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving slide designs. The comfortable, precision-molded Zytel polymer grip frame has a serrated front strap and backstrap. The accurate sighting system features precision-adjustable rear and fixed front sights and a drilled and tapped receiver for the included Weaver-style scope base adapters. Ruger's patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that the chamber is loaded and the magazine disconnect prevents discharge when the magazine has been removed. Other features include: a contoured ejection port, easy-to-grasp tapered bolt ears, and a conveniently located push-button magazine release on the left side of the frame."

Please respect the fact that I am pricing this at a very fair value unlike most people selling used guns.

It is priced to sell as is. Bill of sale and ID confirmation required at time of sale. Concealed handgun permit holders go to the front of the line.

The Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine. The advantage is unmatched. Built to mil-spec standards, no other company combines the quality and craftsmanship that Colt Defense LLC does. The LE6940 demonstrates fresh ingenuity with mil-spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, mil-spec backup iron sight and folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, straight gas tube, and removable lower rail providing modularity for under-mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous mil-spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature provides unmatched repeatability for mounting of optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, it provides a true free-floating barrel, giving enhanced accuracy for longer-range acquisition capability.

*The only blemish this AR has is a scratch on the barrel. This was on the gun when I bought it Brand New 2 months ago! Probably happened at the store. It is the only blemish on the gun. As it has been tucked away in my safe and only seen daylight once! Other than that this AR is immaculate!!

**I would also love to trade for a Gen 4 Glock. Either a 22, 17, or 19 model. It must be in prestine condition! Or possibly a Beretta 92A1 or any other pistol? But I'd rather trade for Glock 22 or 17!

However she is craving a bit larger of a pistol as lately she has been going out more often to shoot with me and likes the feel of a bigger gun. Ammo is around the same price as 9mm as i bought a 50rd box today for 14.99. This will surprise you on accuracy and the fun factor of plinking as the weight allows this to feel more like a .22 although unloaded the metal gun is only 15oz. Fits in my pocket including me back pocket with my wallet in there as well. Would be the wrong person to say gimme your wallet to when I have it in there with my wallet!

Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

This .17 is a 1 MOA tack driver! It started out a 2 MOA gun purchased new with tax for $220. I had a gunsmith float the barrel, do a trigger job and add 2lbs to the stock for $100 to make it a more solid bench rest shooter. And that it did! (See 100yd pic below). All that with only a $50 3-9x scope and rings.  I'm including 70rds of CCI and hornady ammo $20. That brings the total value to $390.

Thank you, but I'm going to have to pass at this time without knowing more about the rifles history, ie age, importer, maker, etc.trigger group, barrel chrome lined or not, There are just to many variables with any AK. Which I was hoping you would answer with text in addition to the two photos.
 Yes I realize that any trade is a bit like buying a pig in a poke, for both parties, but AKs are more suspect than most. Hence my reluctance.
 Thank you for your interest. [End}

A simple Bo thanks would have worked fine.And by the way if I had all that info it would have been included. That's alot more info then what is in your add.Have a good one. [End]

Gun owners tend to run in three general types. honest, dishonest and ignorant. I can only guess that you fall into one of the latter two. For the sake of dissemination though I'll say ignorant. Which isn't a bad thing, just a lack of knowledge. There is nothing wrong with an honest ""I don't know"". However coupled with bad manners, as you demonstrated, it pretty much adds up to dishonest.
In my first response to your offer, remember you came to me! I asked for specific information aside from the photos (which I DID state in my alist ad), the maker and importer. Which you should know, but even if you didn't you should have said, I don't know. Now I can't say that I know the round count of history of every gun I've owned. I can say something about each one though and I educate myself as much as I can by asking questions and doing simple research.and yes even learning by having had a few lemons along the way because I was ignorant.
 So here you come wanting two of my pistols and offering zero information and not smart enough to ask your own questions and you want to be pissed at me? Maybe that gun of yours isn't just a pig with lipstick on it. I know better than to assume that though. All the more so when you can't (won't?) answer a few direct questions.[End]

The Glock 17 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the
world's most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you
instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size.
The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed,
real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the Glock
dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system.
A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates
left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 also retains the Glock
accessory rail for your attachments.

As the images show, the grip is substantially improved by adding this texture. When seconds count in a tactical situation, you want to give yourself every advantage, and this texture will significantly increase your gripping ability, making it less likely to drop or bobble your mag when it is most important. A standard, non-stippled PMAG is shown for comparison only, and it is not for sale. Item shown is brand new, never used, it just has had the stippling process applied. $25 each, or buy three for $70 and save five bucks. You have to hold these to appreciate the improvement in grip. Each one is painstakingly prepared by hand. These aren't cheap stickers-this is permanent. Distinctive and usefully tactical, these mags will set you apart when you are on the range.
