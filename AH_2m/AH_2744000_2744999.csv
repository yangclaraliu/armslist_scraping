Truly a rare find in this condition.  Would make a perfect addition for a WW1 Gew or WW1 bayonet collection.  Highly sought after and collectable due to it being a saw back bayonet version of the classic M1898/05 second pattern design - AND the saw blade scallops appear to slightly worn down due to authentic use!  This is an Emperial German WW1 era1917 production bayonet based upon the number 17 stamped below the Royal Cypher of Kaiser Emporer ""W""ilhiem crest on the side of the bayonet as depicted in the pictures.  This is a unique un-tampered saw back bayonet (made famous by the book titled ""All is Quiet on the Western Front"").  This German saw back bayonet design has a rich history - while useful for cutting brush and debris, it inflicted horrific damage when used in combat.  It was so hated that Germans captured with this bayonet attached on their rifles were executed.

Here is a little more info; found on the Internet---
The 1871 Army pistol (sometimes referred to as the Army and Navy Model). This was the final redesign. The trigger and trigger guard were moved forward on the receiver, and a spur was added to the receiver behind the hammer to allow for a better grip. A firing pin retractor was added, and a rotating extractor was designed. The front sight was changed from a bead to a blade, and the lock-work was also redesigned.  The gun was available in .50 center-fire, but could be special ordered in .22 rimfire. It was designed for the U.S. military, but was never actually sold to them. Approximately 6,000 were made.

It is still in excellent working order and is as clear as day. I have compared it to similarly priced leupolds and nikons, and the Sightron was the clear winner in my opinion. I hunted in a heavily wooded area, and was able to sit and hunt up to and sometimes after legal shooting light(never killed anything after dark, but could spot deer, and other objects out to 100 yards with no problem). The original price on this scope was $339, and is currently available from opticsplanet.com for $247+shipping if required. I am asking $200 which is somewhat negotiable.

They have been sitting in my finished basement and handled very little (moved from this shelf to that shelf). I took them on trade a while back and have no use for them. Makes a nice paintball/airsoft get up (if your not a puss and can handle the extra 10lb :P)

The front/back plates have been listed between $275-$350 across the net and the sides are hangin in between $125-$175. Basically this whole set would be around $500 based on the average listing prices. I will take $200 for the set. I WILL NOT NOT NOT SHIP! LOCAL ONLY"

These are a 6x135 bolt pattern and will fit 2004 - up F-150's. The tires are 285/65r18. I had these on my truck with no lift or leveling kit and they never rubbed. Tires have about 10K on them and were rotated every 3K, so they're evenly worn. I'd say they are at least 75%. I also have a set of billet adaptors that will make the stance of this package more aggressive. Add $50 if you'd like those, as well. 
I will accept cash or paypal. If you pay via paypal, you will need to add 3% for the transaction fee. Price is firm at $1100 and I will not seperate the tires from the rims. Not really looking to trade, but would hear you out with what you have.

Bianchi IWB leather hostler. This holster is brand new in the box it came in ($47.00). 
3 boxes of Winchester FMJ Ammo 50 round boxes ($22.00/each)

I am asking $365.00 for the gun. However, I will only sell it all together cause I don't own any other .40 cal pistols. I expect exactly $60.00 for ammo & $40.00 for the Holster. So total to buy everything is $465.00

I'd like to keep it but looking for work right now and need to fix my truck before it breaks down on me.

If you know anything about cold war guns, these are hard to find.  Although the look similar to an AK-47 and shoots the same rounds, it is definitely NOT an AK.    It is arguably more reliable and more accurate than an AK or SKS.

Some of the differences are:

Milled receiver, not stamped like AKs and SKSs.
-Slightly smaller and lighter than an AK, 7lbs with an empty mag.  35"" long with stock unfolded, 26"" folded (Without bayonet attached)
-Striker fired
-Bolt stays open in when the last round is fired.
-Fewer parts, more reliable bolt assembly
-Easier safety to operate, can be switched on or off with the trigger finger while still holding the gun, the AK safety leaves an opening where debris can get in.
-More accurate and reliable than AKs and SKSs
-Bayonet is quickly attached or detached and can be used as a stand alone knife.
-Open bolt design makes stovepipes extremely unlikely.   When looking into this gun, I could not find an incident of one.

I'm not thrilled when I have to sell one of my guns so no low ballers please!  I will include 3 magazines, Bayonet with sheath and shoulder strap.

Check the link at the bottom of the page for the manufacturer's specs. Includes a 6.8 bolt carrier group, mags, and ammo, everything you need to start shooting 6.8 today with your standard AR lower receiver. I've fired this upper at the range using three different brands of lower receivers without any problems whatsoever. I paid $500 for the upper assembly in December, and I've invested another $450 in upgraded parts and gunsmith fees. Willing to ship in the original PSA box, buyer pays shipping costs. 

This upper assembly was purchased new from PSA in December 2013 and has fired a grand total of 80 rounds of 110g Hornady varmint express V-MAX. I collected the brass and will include the 80 empty once-fired cases if you are a reloader. I'll also throw in four 20-round boxes of Hornady varmint express 6.8 if you meet my asking price. When you can find it, this ammo sells locally for about $25 a box. I'll also include a Precision Reflex Industries 5-round 6.8 magazine (which functions flawlessly and can fit up to 9 rounds) and two C-Products Defense 10-round 6.8 magazines (which I have not had great luck with).  

I had the gunsmiths at Wiser Owl Firearms & Tactical in Miramar install a Parallax Tactical 15"" free-float super slim rail and a Midwest Industries low-profile gas block in December 2013. The rail is a $200 upgrade, the low-pro gas block another $50. This sale also includes an assembled Maxim Firearms 6.8 SPC bolt carrier group, which retails for $150. I don't know much about the Maxim BCG, but it was the only 6.8 BCG I could find for sale, anywhere, when I bought the upper. 

I'm asking $750, cash, meet at a neutral location in San Diego county. I'd prefer to meet at a gun store, but would be willing to go elsewhere if necessary. I'll consider trade offers. I'll accept PayPal to ship it, or suggest another payment method. I've got more than $900 invested in this upper, not including the $100 in magazines and $100+ in ammo that is included in the sale. Please no lowball offers.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

This thing is a great handgun, is in great shape, and you can choose what color you want the slide to be. I typically charge 80 per semi-auto slide I Cerakote, so that is a significant value added.

Selling my beloved m&p 45c with apex carry kit installed.  This gun is flawless, and leaves nothing to be desired.  Comes with original everything: box, papers, two mags, all three backstraps, etc.  Trigger pull is now 5.5 lbs, with zero grit, less uptake and actually has a reset!! None of this is there from the factory.  Gun has had a polish job on the barrel, sear and internals.

Only selling because I can't get into double stack for carry, they print on me as I carry IWB.   It's had three mags through it.  One before trigger kit, two after installation.

CASH PRICE IS FIRM,   REDACTED texts preferred.  Lowballers and know it all's ignored."

I have several things I could trade:

Rubin Schmidt m1911 7.5x55 Swiss straight pull bolt action rifle. 135 rounds (all non corrosive surplus fmj), bayonet, scabbard, and frog. Also has two rare stripper clips, different than usual ones. Predecessor to the Swiss k31, this is a highly accurate rifle, a little longer than most hunting shotguns. Rarer specimen with the 10.63"" twist rate. Great finish, rifling and bore. All original. Valued at $500

Bulgarian ""circle 10"" Makarov 9x18 semi auto pistol. 475 rounds (450 silver/brown bear, 25 hornady critical defense), two grips, and 4 magazines. Original red star is missing the screw, and smooth aftermarket is currently installed. All original. Valued at $425

M48 Yugoslavian Mauser 8mm Mauser bolt action rifle. 120 rounds (mix of new commercial fmj/sp and surplus that I do not THINK is corrosive). Includes some stripper clips.  Patterned more after the m24/47 than the famed k98 that it strongly resembles and is often mistaken for. This rifle has been slightly modernized for hunting. Bolt was professionally bent by a gunsmith to allow use of a scope($100). After market low swing safety, I lost the original but the are cheap and easy to find($20). Timney trigger, I believe this an adjustable 2-4#, breaks very cleanly with no slop($75). Luepold once piece scope mount with medium rings, matte finish($50).  Stock and all else is original and with simply swapping the bolt out rifle would look ""period correct"". Valued at $450. 

Depending on what you have, I'm willing to trade one or more. I also have a little silver and a little cash so we can make a deal.

Some information on the Shotgun:

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun is the new product from Turkish company Akdal Arms. This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight."

Taurus ULTRA-LITE M85, .38 SPL., SS, 2"", 5 Round

Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. It's no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special +P ammo - making them powerful, easy to carry - and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers. 

The compact 5 shot self-defense favorite built on a hammer-forged frame +P rated- for Duty Use! The Taurus UltraLite models make for uncomplicated carry. For those who need a dependable partner on and off-duty.

Plus P
Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications. 

Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 

Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear."

Glock G26 Gen4, 9mm, STD Sights, 3 10RD Mags



The Glock 26 G4 9mm Bodyguard is similar in size and weight to the small frame .38 snubnose revolver. The G26 fires the powerful 9mm cartridge while possessing 11 rounds, that is the combined capacity of a 6-shot Detective Special and a 5-shot Chiefs Special, with much less recoil and more deliverable accuracy at a faster rate of fire. The 4th Generation of the Glock Safe Action Pistol brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands.

I have several things I could trade:

Rubin Schmidt m1911 7.5x55 Swiss straight pull bolt action rifle. 135 rounds (all non corrosive surplus fmj), bayonet, scabbard, and frog. Also has two rare stripper clips, different than usual ones. Predecessor to the Swiss k31, this is a highly accurate rifle, a little longer than most hunting shotguns. Rarer specimen with the 10.63"" twist rate. Great finish, rifling and bore. All original. Valued at $500

Bulgarian ""circle 10"" Makarov 9x18 semi auto pistol. 475 rounds (450 silver/brown bear, 25 hornady critical defense), two grips, and 4 magazines. Original red star is missing the screw, and smooth aftermarket is currently installed. All original. Valued at $425

M48 Yugoslavian Mauser 8mm Mauser bolt action rifle. 120 rounds (mix of new commercial fmj/sp and surplus that I do not THINK is corrosive). Includes some stripper clips.  Patterned more after the m24/47 than the famed k98 that it strongly resembles and is often mistaken for. This rifle has been slightly modernized for hunting. Bolt was professionally bent by a gunsmith to allow use of a scope($100). After market low swing safety, I lost the original but the are cheap and easy to find($20). Timney trigger, I believe this an adjustable 2-4#, breaks very cleanly with no slop($75). Luepold once piece scope mount with medium rings, matte finish($50).  Stock and all else is original and with simply swapping the bolt out rifle would look ""period correct"". Valued at $450. 

Depending on what you have, I'm willing to trade one or more. I also have a little silver and a little cash so we can make a deal.

Do you have a Military spec ""Low End"" AR-15 you want to sell?

I see all these ads where people want ""High End"" AR-15's. I think ""High End"" is a term gun seller's made up so they can charge 4X the price for a normal AR-15. The only difference being they stamped a brand name on them. Take off the $400 Hand guard and flash light, $200 stock, $100 pistol grip, and the guns are the same. One person like's Chromed lined barrels, another person does not. It's comes down to personal preference, or Military Spec. Do you have a Low End AR-15, send me some pics and what you want for it.

This New $499 AR's from Classic Firearms seems like a great deal, and it's all Military Spec. Why are people buying used AR's when NEW AR's are this cheap?? I don't get it.
