Pre-war craftsmanship through and through. I wish Smith still made them like this. It is a S&W Hand Ejector .32. It is built on the ""I"" Frame which is just slightly smaller than the current ""J"" frames like the Chiefs Special. This one is nice because it has the longer 4.25 inch barrel. This looks like a long barrel on this gun, doesn't it? It's actually quite small and really cool. Al Capone would have liked it and so will you.  

It has a nice and tight action, and locks up and is as smooth as new. Bore is bright and shiny but with a few scattered spots in it. I have shot this revolver and it is a good one, and quite accurate. Finish has a lot of mixed blue and gray, but a very smooth patina and not pitted at all. Only 80 years of careful use can get this finish. Grips are perfect. Serial number is 95704 which puts it as being made in the 1920s, I believe. I have 34 rounds of ammunition that will go with it, so you will be ready to go when you buy it. 

These old S&Ws are quality pieces, and this would not only be a good investment, it would also make a fine concealed carry gun, trial gun, or just a fun plinker. Price is $275, which will get you something nice like this, or a plastic gun that won't exactly ever be a family heirloom. 

This S&W has not been shot much in its long history. This isn't some loose, rusty, or reblued junker. It's a nice revolver and you will like it when you see it.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and I will call you to arrange to meet.

I bought this gun looking for something to keep next the the bed, but I was just recently given a different setup by a family member. I've put 25 rounds through it, never had any issue. just out of curiosity I took the stock off when I was cleaning it to see it a Remington 870 stock would fit on it, and surprisingly enough it did. you do have to make the hole in the stock a bit larger in diameter, but I'm guessing that most gun owners have a drill at their disposal.

1940 Model 12 Trap Winchester Serial #: 90298x Monte Carlo Stock is raw high grade English Walnut. It will need to be sanded and sealed. The wood is very high figure. 30"" barrel with full choke. Simmon Gun Specialties high vent rib with two beads. Slight, light rust pitting in right side of receiver above trigger. I don't believe it is significant but that is your call. I believe it can be taken out and re-blued if you desire. There are some normal light spots in the blue around the trigger guard, under the receiver and on the end of the muzzle. The stock has a scratch in the left side under the comb that appears in the picture to be a check. It is simply a scratch that will finish out. This gun has been in the family for nearly 50 years. My dad shot it with the unfinished stock. He didn't want it to be ""pretentious"". I shot it as a teen in trap. It will crush a target into a black ink spot. Additional pictures on request. The reserve is well under a $1,000 and this date of gun is worth every bit of that. $25 flat shipping......"

The bill includes the following provisions:
Increase in federal excise tax on handguns (both pistols and revolvers) from 11% - 20%
Increase in federal excise tax on ammunition from 11% to 50%
Increase in NFA tax (pre-’86 autos, SBRs, suppressors, etc.) from $200 to $500
Increase in NFA AOW tax from $5 to $100
Increase in special (occupational) tax for importers, manufacturers, and dealers
Adds semiautomatic pistols “chambered for cartridges commonly considered rifle rounds, configured with receivers commonly associated with rifles and capable of accepting detachable magazines” to the list of items taxable as NFA items (26 USC § 5845)
It must be obvious to everyone now that since Democrats can’t completely ban guns, they want to tax them out of existence.

The Nagant M1895 Revolver is a seven-shot, gas-seal revolver designed and produced by Belgian industrialist Léon Nagant for the Russian Empire. The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).[3] Other Nagant revolver designs were also adopted by police and military services of Sweden (7.5 mm M1887), Norway (M1893), Poland, and Greece (Περίστροφον M1895). These revolvers were largely similar to the Russian Nagant M1895, but lacked the gas seal mechanism."

Understated Elegance. The Ruger® New Bearcat® is different from other single-action revolvers. Smaller, lighter, and based on older Remington® single-actions of the 1800's, it has a one-piece cylinder frame that also forms its compact grip. It has been described as ""a mechanical jewel,"" and is the smallest and lightest 22 LR caliber single-action made by Ruger.

Compact and perfectly proportioned for 22 LR caliber ammunition, it is easy to carry and fits comfortably in a backpack or tackle box. Fulfilling the ideal of a smaller ""kit gun"" style 22 LR caliber single-action revolver, it is perfect for hikers, campers, boaters, small game hunters, or just about anyone who needs a dependable 22 LR revolver for the trail."

As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.
Listers basic review of this product : This tigger is designed for those who want a high rate of fire but want to control their shots for maximum efffectivenes.  This trigger has a small learning curve to master but will fire at rate close to a full auto with more control for more shots on target.  If you want to just dump magazines as fast as you can (spray and pray) this is not for you.  This trigger is very crisp. I had 4 other people try this out at the range and they had a blast. They really liked having the ""auto"" 3rd selector mode.

Description from the L3 website below;

XPS3
Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.  Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.
◾Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
◾Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space
◾Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
◾Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
◾The XPS3 is Night Vision compatible, for non-Night Vision compatible units see the XPS2 sights."

It was origionally a dark finished gun and was showing more signs of wear than I am typically willing to accept; but the gun is mechanically sound and the slide is still tight.  However, I am kind of OCD about my firearms; so I sent it off to to have it Cerakoted in FDE to resemble the Sig Scorpion 1911.  Additionally, I ordered a set of Hogue G-Mascus(Piranha - green) G-10 grips to complete the look.  I sent my Kimber to Darin Hudson who is the owner/operator of ""CamoMagic"" which is a locally run gun refinishing business located here in Concord.  In addition to refinishing the Kimber, Darin (who is also a certified gun smith) inspected the Kimber from top to bottom and gave it a clean bill of health.  All in all, I have about $1,350 invested into the gun and would place a $1,250 trade value on it.  I am primarily wanting to trade this for other high end tactical firearms but would consider selling it for a FAIR cash offer."

Built like a tank. Heavy 1.5mm Nodak RPK receiver w/bulged trunions. Heavy barrel. Grenade launcher flip-up sight. Chrome bolt carrier and bolt. Original m70 grip. G2 single hook trigger (very light pull). Grey parkerized finish (zinc phosphate). 

I have added a Tech-Sights windage-and-elevation adjustable rear aperture sight- increases sight radius by 100%. See photo below. this AK has a much longer sight radius than a carbine length AR. The rear sight comes with 3 different aperture inserts to tailor sight picture to your liking.

again.. NOT CENTURY.. This aint no WASR. These rifles weigh a good 3 pounds more than a wasr-10 and 2lb more than the current N-PAP Yugo models.

Included in sale is a spare bolt carrier, original leaf rear sight, cleaning kit, and 700 rounds of ammo. Also have original teak wood handguards (have been re-stained since photo, darker in color) as well as polymer handguards.  Two Yugo bolt hold-open mags and one Korean steel mags included.

Here is the D.C. Engineering Dragonov Style Norinco SKS in like new condition. This company, DC Engineering, is worth taking a look at. They supply after market AK, Ar15, and SKS parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detroit magazine is hand welded in two separate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragonov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers a magazine adapter to use AK47 mags. $525.00 Cash only at this time.

Someone had cut the wood stocks down, messed them up, and glued a rubber butt pad onto the butt stock. So, I installed an ATI Dark Earth Brown stock on it just this month, and also installed an ATI Scope Mount and Weaver Quad Lock 1"" Rings. I've polished the bolt to make it a little smoother.
