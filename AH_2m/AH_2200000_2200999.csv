His name is Roman, he is 1 years old, potty and crate trained, very lovable and affectionate, has a VERY high prey drive and I used him to hunt hogs when I was over in the New Orleans area and he did a great job. He comes with an X-L crate, 3 collars(including a prong collar), two leashes(Leather and a normal one) he is up to date on his shots and paperwork to prove that. He is VERY tall and VERY big, he weighs about 110 pounds the last time we went to the vet a few weeks ago and his head is literally the size of a bowling ball trust me, he is not a backyard breeder mixed dog. He is full bred Johnson American Bulldog.

I paid $1200 for him as a puppy last year and my hunting rifle just went out on me so I need a rifle ASAP. I am looking for a rifle in the $400-$1000 dollar range straight trade for Roman and his crate and all the other little things that come with him plus his vet paperwork and all that good stuff. The pics do not do him justice, he is just about as tall as me when he stands on his hind legs, he loves to give kisses, hugs, barks at people who walk by our apartment guard dog wise, loves children and other cats or dogs(I trained him EXTENSIVELY as a puppy) and will tell you when he needs to go outside.

So let me know what you have id love to set up some sort of trade today. I am open to any caliber and type of rifle.

The pictures do not do him justice, he is a damn beast and massive, his head is literally a bowling ball or basketball and he is so damn fast on the hunt. caught me 9 hogs with him in 1 day and yet he is great around children and other adults."

His name is Roman, he is 1 years old, potty and crate trained, very lovable and affectionate, has a VERY high prey drive and I used him to hunt hogs when I was over in the New Orleans area and he did a great job. He comes with an X-L crate, 3 collars(including a prong collar), two leashes(Leather and a normal one) he is up to date on his shots and paperwork to prove that. He is VERY tall and VERY big, he weighs about 110 pounds the last time we went to the vet a few weeks ago and his head is literally the size of a bowling ball trust me, he is not a backyard breeder mixed dog. He is full bred Johnson American Bulldog.

I paid $1200 for him as a puppy last year and my hunting rifle just went out on me so I need a rifle ASAP. I am looking for a rifle in the $400-$1000 dollar range straight trade for Roman and his crate and all the other little things that come with him plus his vet paperwork and all that good stuff. The pics do not do him justice, he is just about as tall as me when he stands on his hind legs, he loves to give kisses, hugs, barks at people who walk by our apartment guard dog wise, loves children and other cats or dogs(I trained him EXTENSIVELY as a puppy) and will tell you when he needs to go outside.

So let me know what you have id love to set up some sort of trade today. I am open to any caliber and type of rifle.


The pictures do not do him justice, he is a damn beast and massive, his head is literally a bowling ball or basketball and he is so damn fast on the hunt. caught me 9 hogs with him in 1 day and yet he is great around children and other adults."

Smaller that a Kel-Tec P-32 in size, the Double Tap features the 2 rounds in the chambers, 2 more rounds on a speed feeder in the grip, and 6 more .45 acp's on a rubber speed feeder in your off side pants pocket,  IT IS BELT FED!!  Ten rds of .45 acp in a package half the size of the smallest Kimber made.

Asking price is $525 obo.  That's less than new in most stores when you figure in sales tax.  This one is house broke, no papers needed.

Since the Columbus Ohio Metro Library illegally fired me from a full time security job a few weeks ago, I need to move this unit to help cover some bills.  If you would like to express your dismay to the library, their number is REDACTED, ask for Pat at ext 1005."

The Browning BDA 380 pistol was introduced in 1980 or so as a compact and lightweight pistol for police and civilian use. The gun was manufactured in Italy under contract from FN Herstal (Belgium) and marketed as FN model 140DA (in Europe) or Browning BDA 380 (in USA). Some sources said that BDA 380 is a copy of Beretta 84, but close inspection shows some differences (i.e. Beretta 84 has frame mounted safety while BDA 380 has slide mounted safety). The manufacture of the BDA 380 was ceased circa 1997. It was adopted by Belgian police."

This buffer tube cover kit is made of high strength reinforced polymer and made to be used with a standard carbine buffer tube. So instead of buying and installing a more expensive pistol buffer tube, this cover can be used on your pistol build with a regular carbine buffer tube saving you money (especially if you already have an extra buffer tube laying around). If you are building an AR pistol there is no need to spend money on a buffer tube that is made only for an AR pistol. Plus if you ever want to use your pistol lower receiver with a carbine length upper and wish to install a stock, this cover is pretty easy and simple to remove giving you the option to convert from pistol to carbine. 

This cover provides a comfortable surface to place your cheek against, and if you have a high mounted optic you can easily install the included riser to bring you to proper height.

Easy and simple installation.

The de-cocker, combined with the double/single action capability, makes this an outstanding handgun for home defense.  In addition the trusty 40 S&W, which is preferred by most police offices, is an exception cartridge for shooters of all genders and ages (above 21, of course).

Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode. Compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s AR – 15 and you will not be disappointed.

MFG Description:
Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

I was going to tac this out with Tapco products but i am moving on in projects.  this is a straight shooter and and have it sighted for man-size targets at 150 yards.  The internals on this rifle are clean and it has deep rifling.  everything on this SKS is numbers matching including the furniture.  the only thing that I have added to this rifle is the cleaning kit in the butt-stock.  I do have an original 10 round internal mag that will come with it, and the 30 round mag will come filled to the brim with 7.62x39 wolf.  I can take it down for you to show you the cleanliness of the internals if you would like.  has a slight split in the stock that does NOT affect the rifle at all.


first $400 gets it.  the price is pretty firm but I will consider offers.  i would like to see it go to someone who will take care of it and make use of it.  I am also interested in Silver at current spot price.
