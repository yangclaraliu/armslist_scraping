This rifle features a 16"" 4140 Chrome Moly Steel M4 profile barrel with a 1:9"" twist rate suitable for most commerical ammunition. This barrel boasts CMMG's W.A.S.P. salt bath nitrocarbuerization treatment, sometimes known as nitriding, which offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance as compared to chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without build-up, so accuracy is not compromised. The barrel and upper receiver have M4 feed ramps for flawless cycling. A ""F"" marked front sight post/gas block is fitted, and a removable MBUS rear sight is included. The upper receiver is forged aluminum with a flat top Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. This particular rifle has a quad rail handguard installed, making mounting accessories like tactical lights, fore grips, and bipods, among others, quick and easy. The lower is forged as well, with a low shelf for RDIAS, and is compatible with standard mil-spec componentry. The magazine well is bevelled for quicker, more confident reloads. An adjustable butt stock and A2-style pistol grip are outfitted. Front and rear sling mounts are mounted for easy carrying. One 30 round PMAG is included.

Hi,

I’m selling my Hi-Point .45 JHP ACP firearm with a total of 2 mags. This gun has about 200 rounds through it and operates flawlessly. I stripped and cleaned the firearm after each shooting session. This gun is in excellent condition. This gun is surprising reliable, very accurate and has never misfired with 3 types of ammo through it. I'm selling it for $170 (that is rock bottom, so don't ask if I will go $160 or less), which is the cheapest on this site.  

****No exceptions to the following: CASH ONLY. You will need to provide me with a valid MN Permit to Purchase or Carry Permit and state ID before I sell this firearm. I can provide you with my DL if you want to take a picture or document it.

I will not ship it, so don’t ask. This has to be in person locally.

Hi,

I’m selling my SIG SAUER P250 SUB-COMPACT .40 S&W firearm. I bought this gun from my neighbor (St. Paul Police officer) about 8 months ago and have not shot it. This gun is in mint condition. I was planning on listing the package for $500, so don't as if I will go lower than the current listing. I went to my bottom price to make it easy for you. I’m selling it for $400, the others similar are really beat up looking going for more. 

It comes with:
1 x 10 Rd Mag
1 x 14 Rd Mag (has spacer so it fits flush with gun and allows full grip including pinky)
1 x OWB - Leather CQC detective belt holster

****No exceptions to the following. CASH ONLY. You will need provide me with a valid state ID before I sell this firearm (not a paper copy). I can provide you with my DL if you want to take a picture or document it.

I will not ship it, so don’t ask. This has to be in person locally. 

No trades.

Most customized lever actions are Marlin or Henry, this is a customized, centennial edition of the Winchester 94 AE in 30-30.
So it's rare for being a customized Winchester and rare as it's an ""1894-1994"" centennial edition (as can be seen in the pictures. )

The customized features are:
Polymer furniture. 
Trigger has been worked on
Loop enlarged (not much, it looks to have been heated and expanded)
Sights moved to end of the gun, so even though it's a carbine the sights are much more accurate as they are as far apart as they can be on this rifle. 
The sight is a peep sight. 
Ceramic coating to inhibit rust and corrosion. 
Leather butt cuff for holding 5 rounds of .30-.30
Nylon sling. 

I bought it off a consignment rack so I'm not sure what else has been customized, they do a lot of internal stuff. 

I don't think the guy was happy about having to sell it so he gave it to the gun store and didn't really want to talk about it. 

I was told it was customized by Yost Bonitz when I bought it, but they contacted a few days later to say it had been done by someone who used to work for Yost Bonitz, so I don't know who did the work, but he did a great job. 

It had never been loaded when I bought it, much less fired. 

I've put 40 rounds through it, 20 were Hornady LeveRevolution, 20 were normal Hornady rounds. 
It's in very good condition. 
I'll include what 30-30 ammo I have, maybe 20-40 rounds, I haven't checked lately."

This is pretty much the same break open, single shot shotgun that we all know but with a rifled barrel for .45 Colt and a removable choke for shooting .410 loads. This also differs from the typical H&R with it's pistol grip/thumb-hole stock. The but of the stock is hollow with a removable base for storing things such as a survival kit, extra ammunition, etc.

As stated earlier the barrel is rifled, so shooting .45 Colt loads is reasonably accurate. When it comes to shooting .410 loads, there is a choke that screws into the barrel to minimize the erratic spread of lead shot caused by the rifling. There is a key included to unscrew the choke. The choke must be removed when shooting .45 Colt. Like other .45/.410 firearms you cannot fire .410 slugs as they are of a smaller diameter than the barrel.

I've put less than 50 rounds through this total. About 25 .45 rounds at paper and <25 .410 target loads at clay pigeons, which did surprisingly well. I wouldn't go shoot skeet competition with it, but it held it's own....

First pistol is a p38 walther 9mm. My grandfather brought this back from the European theater. The story is he was on a patrol and came across a germen officer ridding a horse. My grandfathers patrol stopped him and he took the pistol. Its been sitting in a old trunk ever since. All numbers match and is in good shape. Based on the serial number it was made late in the war. It still shoots well and come with extra mags. The barrel is bright and has good riffling with minor pitting on the outside.  Very nice piece of history that you can still shoot.

Second pistol is a p08 luger 9mm. This is a ww2 Russian capture. All numbers match and was produced in 41. This is also a shooter and is in good shape. The wood grips are original to the gun. The barrel also has minor pitting but has good riffling. I have the original holster for this gun with extra mags. 

Im want $2000 for both guns. I will through in a few boxes of 9mm ammo and a extra ww2 holster. I will separate if need be for $1000 each but the ammo and extra holster will be more. The price is firm in cash or money order and will not take trades or payment plans. You must have a current NC pistol permit for both guns. If you email me junk or low ball offers I will not respond.

RUGER & COMPANY INC Over/Under
Ruger 4191 Red Label Over/Under 12ga 28"" 3"" Walnut Stock SS Rec/Blued Barrel
Ruger's Red Label Shotgun has returned with its world-renowned rugged
construction, handsome American styling and brings refined inner workings,
a redesigned center of gravity and reduced recoil, making it lively in the
hand and even more pleasurable to shoot. It is perfect for hunting upland
game, waterfowling, sporting clays, skeet or even just informal clay target
shooting. The precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged
barrel is made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel featuring a 2""
forcing cone and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more
uniform patterns. It has a 1/4"" dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib
with brass bead front sight and is stress-relieved, contour-grounded,
precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished
monoblock. The finely polished, stainless steel receiver is
corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws. The Red Label is set
off with a beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American walnut stock
featuring a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless
steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr buttpad is mounted on the 14.5"" length
of pull stock. It comes with five steel-shot compatible, screw-in Briley
chokes, featuring two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one
improved cylinder choke, plus a premium-quality Briley choke tube wrench.
Built by American workers in American factories, the Ruger Red Label
shotgun is another 100% American-made product from Ruger.
