This is the ""pre 590"" tactical shotgun Mossberg made before releasing the 590. It has dual action bars, unlike the regular 500s of this period. Synthetic stock and forearm, both stippled by Diversified Firearm Concepts.

Has a brand new barrel, mag tube, mag spring and XS big dot bead sight. Unknown round count through the receiver, but it doesn't appear to have been shot too much (I only put a handful of rounds through it myself). Hasn't been shot since putting on the new barrel and sight.

Also includes an Ares Gear 5 shell holder, and a Limbsaver slip on recoil pad. The pad is a bit oversize, but it's been glued on and hasn't been an issue thus far. I would recommend a fitted recoil pad before hard use.

Looking for $500 cash, no trades. Located in Brighton, MI. I'll throw in a couple boxes of Federal tactical Flite Control 00 buck with it as well.

Iv installed Ghosts springs in the firingpin which is now 4lb, also comes with factory sping and 6lb spring. Iv put on the reduced power safety plunger spring also comes with factory. And iv put on the 6 lb trigger sping. So it has a much nicer trigger pull compared to factory.  I put the chrome 3 piece pin set on it. Comes with the factory black. Iv got a black and chrome glock brand extended slide release that I haven't installed but they go with the gun. Also I put a stainless steel guide rod and spring on it. And the last thing iv done to it was put the ace of spades on the back of the slide and on the bottom of the mags. This gun comes with 3 mags (2) are 13 round and (1) is 15 round. All glock.  The good thing about the glock 40 is you can make it a 9mm or a 357 Sig by changing the barrel and magazine.  But the .40 is known for its stopping power. Thats why a lot of law enforcement carry them. I'm looking to trade or sell. I'm not out to screw anyone. No your century arms ak is not worth 1000 dollars. Lol for trades I do like pistols and revolvers.  I'm kind of looking for a ruger 10/22 but cash or another gun would have to be added. All together in this gun I have close to 700.00 in it but it has been shot and is like a new car so I'm asking 650.00 or trade. I fix up guns as a hobby.

I have for sale my nickel Model 36 Smith and Wesson round butt revolver. This classic J-frame 5 shot snub nose .38 Special has no dash after the model #, and was manufactured in 1981. This was the last year for the much desired pinned barrel. The trigger is hands down the finest factory SA/DA I have ever seen. Words don't do it justice. It's an old Smith... Enough said.

It has two small blems worth mentioning, first is a slight discoloration beneath the S&W logo and above the grip. Also the frame on the rear just above the grip is dulled. Both of these could probably be buffed out, but I didn't think it worth it. The barrel, cone, and all internals are unbelievably clean and it appears to have very few rounds through it. Timing and lock up are as good as the day it was built. This gun will not disappoint you. Would make a great, reliable carry gun or a timeless classic for your collection.

No box, no manual, but a very clean 32 year old gun and I will include a nice Bianchi thumb break belt holster with it. Comes with a set of Pachmayr Presentation Grips.

Asking $450 cash or will consider trades for long guns in most common calibers. Will also consider trades for.. 45ACP handguns."

I have done some upgrades to it but everything from the factory comes with it. Here is what iv done. Iv installed Ghosts springs in the firingpin which is now 4lb, also comes with factory sping and 6lb spring. Iv put on the reduced power safety plunger spring also comes with factory. And iv put on the 6 lb trigger sping. So it has a much nicer trigger pull compared to factory.  I put the chrome 3 piece pin set on it. Comes with the factory black. Iv got a black and chrome glock brand extended slide release that I haven't installed but they go with the gun. Also I put a stainless steel guide rod and spring on it. And the last thing iv done to it was put the ace of spades on the back of the slide and on the bottom of the mags. This gun comes with 3 mags (2) are 13 round and (1) is 15 round. All glock.  The good thing about the glock 40 is you can make it a 9mm or a 357 Sig by changing the barrel and magazine.  But the .40 is known for its stopping power. Thats why a lot of law enforcement carry them. I'm looking to trade or sell. I'm not out to screw anyone. No your century arms ak is not worth 1000 dollars. Lol for trades I do like pistols and revolvers.  I'm kind of looking for a ruger 10/22 but cash or another gun would have to be added. All together in this gun I have close to 700.00 in it but it has been shot and is like a new car so I'm asking 650.00 or trade. I fix up guns as a hobby. So let me know what you have and maybe we can work something out.

This is the Inch model and has the reliable Imbel receiver, not the cheaper aftermarket versions.  This rifle has been professionally cleaned and maintained.  I recently had it professionally taken apart and completely went over and anything needing repair was replaced ( only things replaced were the gas piston spring and a rivet that had a chip out of it).   While they had it at the shop it was also professionally zero'd in.  This gun is actually better now than it was when it was new.  I have replaced the original barrel cover with an aluminum quad-rail.  This allows for a much more reliable bipod than the original metal legs that were not adjustable.

IMPORTANT CONSUMER SAFETY ALERT and INSPECTION PROCEDURE - August 22, 2013


PRODUCT:

ALL M&P Shield™ firearms manufactured before August 19, 2013.

DESCRIPTION OF THE HAZARD:

Smith & Wesson has identified a condition where the trigger bar pin could damage the lower trigger in certain M&P Shields in a way that may affect the functionality of the drop safety feature of the firearm, potentially allowing the pistol to discharge if it is dropped.

Any unintended discharge of a firearm has the potential to cause injury, and we ask that you STOP USING YOUR PISTOL IMMEDIATELY UNTIL IT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND, IF THE CONDITION IS FOUND, REPAIRED.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCT INVOLVED:

This Safety Alert applies to all M&P Shield pistols manufactured before August 19, 2013. We believe this condition is largely limited to recently manufactured M&P Shield pistols. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are asking all consumers of all M&P Shields manufactured before August 19, 2013 to immediately inspect their pistols for this condition.

INSPECTING YOUR PISTOL:


Figure 1 


Figure 2 


Figure 3 

Your firearm must be inspected to determine whether it exhibits the condition identified in this notice. To determine whether your firearm is affected by this condition, please inspect your firearm as follows:

Click Here for Video Instructions


1.	Follow the procedures in your Safety & Instruction Manual to ENSURE THE FIREARM IS UNLOADED; ENSURE THAT THE MUZZLE IS POINTED IN A SAFE DIRECTION; THE SLIDE IS LOCKED BACK; AND THE MANUAL SAFETY IS ENGAGED. 

2.	Hold your pistol sideways with the muzzle pointed to the left. Look at the trigger. Note that the trigger is actually two pieces, with a pin in the middle that connects the two halves (Figure 1). 

3.	Look at Figure 2. Without touching the trigger, identify the plastic tab circled in red in Figure 2. 

4.	Slowly pull the trigger. The plastic tab encircled in Figure 2 should disappear into the upper trigger section (Figure 3).

5.	Slowly release the trigger. The tab should reappear as shown in Figure 2 completely on its own. 

6.	Repeat steps 4 and 5 several times. If the small tab as shown in Figure 2 reappears each time, your pistol does not require repair. 

7.	If the small tab does not consistently reappear as shown in Figure 2, YOUR PISTOL MUST BE RETURNED FOR SERVICE. 

If you are uncomfortable conducting the inspection outlined above, or are unsure whether the condition described in this notice applies to your firearm, please take your firearm to your local M&P Certified Armorer or send your firearm to Smith & Wesson for inspection. M&P Armorers can be found on the Smith & Wesson website under Find a Dealer.

If after inspection it is determined that the condition outlined in this safety alert exists, the firearm must be sent to Smith & Wesson for repair.
REMEDY/ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

STOP USING YOUR FIREARM UNTIL IT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND, IF THE CONDITION IS FOUND, REPAIRED.

Your firearm must be inspected to determine whether it exhibits the condition identified in this notice. To determine whether your firearm is affected by this condition, please inspect your firearm by following the inspection instructions above.

If your firearm is affected by the condition outlined in this notice, please send your pistol to Smith & Wesson. Your firearm will be inspected, and if necessary, repaired at no cost to you. Your firearm will be returned within 5 to 7 business days. All shipping and repair costs will be covered by Smith & Wesson.

Outside the United States, click here for a list of Authorized Warranty Centers that will repair your pistol.

CONSUMER CONTACT:

Please contact Smith & Wesson directly at REDACTED to arrange for the repair, if necessary, of your pistol."

It is heavy, around 9 pounds when loaded, it's nearly all metal.

I'm also looking for AR-10 parts.
