This has a Separate on/off button, so from everything I have read, this is a revision F (the latest and most sought after).


This is -exactly- the same as an L3 EoTech, just without the heavy duty protective shield.  Because it doesn't have the additional hood, it's lighter.  This makes it better than an EoTech for a ""lightweight"" rifle.  The holosight is -extremely- durable, the hood is just plain overkill.

This is NOT a clone, or a ""copy"", or a ""Fake EoTech"", it is the exact same holographic laser technology, NOT an LED (which is what the fakes use).  If you bought an Eotech hood (like one of the ones with the laser, etc), this would be -exactly- the same as an Eotech.

This is the smallest ultra-lightweight version of a true holographic sight.

It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it. I still have the mount so if you have some American optics you can use it. The drag bag I have it in was issued to me during my tour to Afghanistan and my supply guy didn't want it back. The rifle is with my father In-law in E-town because I'm overseas. I'm willing to except money, and guns or a combination of the two. Please don't come at me with a piece of crap and then flag my post as spam when I'm not interested. The picture of me and the drag bag is old but that's it. It's painted now though. The tan was standing out a little. Here's all the stuff that my father-in-law has:
(1) PSL-54C chambered in 7.62x54R

Bolt action Spanish Mauser re-chambered to 7.62 in the 60's by the Spanish government.  These rifles saw much use during the early 1920's and 30's by the Spanish Guardia Civil. It was at one point adapted with a scope mount in place of the rear sight as well as removal of the front sight. A long eye relief scope, which does not currently come with it, was used and worked very well when I took it to the range. Have a box and a half left of ammo as well depending on possible trades. Asking $250 cash or $300 trade value, but am negotiable for less if you have a good trade i.e. Very nice Mosin Nagants or Hi Point 9mm, .40, .45 etc."

It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it. I still have the mount so if you have some American optics you can use it. The drag bag I have it in was issued to me during my tour to Afghanistan and my supply guy didn't want it back. The rifle is with my father In-law in E-town because I'm overseas. I'm willing to except money, and guns or a combination of the two. Please don't come at me with a piece of crap and then flag my post as spam when I'm not interested. The picture of me and the drag bag is old but that's it. It's painted now though. The tan was standing out a little. Here's all the stuff that my father-in-law has:
(1) PSL-54C chambered in 7.62x54R
(1) PSO-1 Romanian

Two extra kimber magazines (comes with 3 total, paid 70 for extra 2)
Soft cloth storage case (paid 15)

Total value: 1495 before taxes one month ago.

I am asking 950.00 cash. 

Must have current Colorado drivers license and sign bill of sale. No shipping, no paypal, no BS. Cash is king. I live in Buena Vista which is a solid hour and 15 minutes west of Springs. I will be in Springs all day Monday (MLK day) and can meet up at a place of my choosing if you want. Otherwise, I will be in Buena Vista where you can come pick this bad boy up.

I took this on a trade but it is too large for me to happily carry as I am short and slender I prefer compact guns. This gun was carried much more than it was used but it is nicely maintained and broken in beautifully. The guy who owned it before me was in the army and cleaned it till the parts shined. Not specifically sure how many rounds fired but it is not overly used and is still in pristine condition minus the fact that it has been carried and has a little wear. It is going to the Glock factory on Tuesday to have each part given a once over and anything out of date is getting replaced to function like new for you. Comes with gun, 2 standard mags, Hogue grip, and Blackhawk belt slide holster. Both the plate on the back of the slide and the one on the bottom of one of the magazines has been replaced with the ""do not tread on me"" logo. Would like to sell it and do my own search for the future but I am always open to trade offers and the worst thing I can say is no. Please text me at REDACTED with any offers.

This Mod. 629 has the -4 designation which is the last dash model that is pre-lock and pre-MIM revolver with the complete factory Endurance Package. This package was developed to combat problems with shooting high volumes of heavy rounds in previous/older 629 & 29 models. S&W simply beefed up these revolvers to last a lot longer and to be able to take more of a beating. It entails as follows: strengthened hand & bolt, strengthened retention system on the yoke/cylinder crane, radius-ed internal studs, and elongated bolt cuts on the cylinder.

I would consider this to be in great condition with very good lock up, perfect timing, and excellent cylinder-forcing cone gap.

Fiance purchased this less than a year ago for a weekend trip. Hardly used for the trip due to having iPhones, and we never used after. (With the exception of today just to verify it functions as new).  Has just been taking up space in the desk and its time to get rid of it. Purchased this new for $180. Looking at $120 or trade for firearm related items.

Cobra firearms have a wide range of pistols to choose from. Cobra derringers are among some of the most sought after American derringers. Cobra firearms used Davis derringers design and began to manufacture these wonderful pistols. The derringer pistol has a special place in American history, as well as a practical use today. These durable pistols are much more reliable, then some of the derringer kits.

My research indicates this ammo to be first generation Ranger SXT ammo in a +P load. After Winchester pulled the Black Talon SXT name off the market due to bad media, they renamed the ammo Ranger SXT and re marketed it. 

This ammo is packaged in a 50 round (white and red box), bearing the description “Ranger SXT Controlled Expansion”.  The ammo has the black lubalox coated bullet with six talons seated in a brass case and from my research, is nearly the same bullet design as the original black talon.  The other difference is the original Talon had a nickel plated case and the Ranger SXT has brass.  It is packaged in the white and red box bearing the description  ""Ranger SXT CONTROLLED EXPANSION"".

I acquired this ammo in the mid-late 90’s and it has been stored inside most all the time. 

Asking $ 65.00 for the box of 50 rounds.
