One is 1918 and one is 1925. These were carried by Italian infantry.

Attention collectors, here is a WWl and WWll Revolver made by Castelli of Brescia Italy. The 10.4 mm cartridge (sometimes called the 10.35 mm) was made for the French Chamelot-Delvigne design Italian Model 1874 revolver. The Model 1889 is a descendent of the Model 1874 and was designed by Carlo Bode who in 1886 had obtained a patent for a revolver and it was intended as an improved version of the 1874. There were about 70 variants over its life time from 1889 until 1945 however there are three basic types, the “A” recognized by the folding trigger and the lack of a trigger guard, the “B” with a trigger guard and shorter (3 ½”) lighter round barrel version. There were both single action and double action versions.

This 6 shot revolver, widely known as “the bode,” has a 4 1/2” hexagonal barrel, fixed sights and is a double action. Mechanically this revolver is in pretty good condition, fully functional (loose), with a very good bore, deep rifling and no pitting or corrosion. The finish is mostly brown patina or bare metal and it has some dings and mars in the metal (see photos) but it is not a rust bucket. The checkered wood grips are in surprisingly good condition (see photos). The 10.4 mm cartridge is similar to the .44 Russian cartridge (see photos). The ammunition is still available in limited quantities from time to time from Foicchi. No ammunition is included in this auction, photos are for reference only."

The scope mount is a Gen 4 Springfield Aluminum mount that is also brand new never installed.

Shoots great, very accurate, light recoil, has a wonderful feel in the hand.

For those that don't know, Beretta developed the Cougar and released it just before polymer framed firearms hit the market. To answer the demand for a polymer framed handgun they took the guts and created the Beretta Storm. Later they transferred the tooling to Stoeger (all under the same umbrella). They have since made slight refinements to the design (more robust parts here and there, added rail, etc) and have kept a great gun on the market for relatively small cost.

I am selling it because I cannot find a Class 1 or Class 2 retention holster for it, and a holster of this type is required for a security position I am in.

With the P938, Sig Sauer offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm
cartridge in a platform similar in size to the P238 pistol. A
single-action-only trigger coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights
makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry
concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP
counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal
frame and the most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line. The
cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy
in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine
release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety
makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Item 90021 comes
with the standard 6 round magazine and a 7 round extended magazine."

""With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

In addition, the M3 model can accommodate an under barrel weight which can be individually removed and positioned to suit user preference resulting in customized balance.

Private party sale. No sales tax - no fees.

The P22 is a 3/4-size rimfire rendition of the famous Walther P99 center-fire pistol however, besides the size difference the P22 has an external hammer. Its frame is made of polymer giving this pistol a very light weight of only 19.6 oz. The barrel is threaded and will accept an adapter to allow for barrel extending accessories such as a noise suppressor. The magazine is constructed of stainless steel with a polymer follower and bump pad. An interchangeable backstrap allows the grip to be customized to the shooter’s hand. Sights are three dot sights with windage adjustment on the rear sight and included different height front sights to adjust for elevation. The P22 features a novel ambidextrous magazine release located at the bottom rear of the trigger guard which can activated with the either the thumb or index finger. When the magazine release is depressed the magazine drops free and is completely ejected from the hand grip. I have owned several of these and they are good shooters. And now with the latest P22Q model, they have also proven to be very reliable with many different types of 22LR ammo. Another P22 I have with about 2,000 rounds fired now even cycles perfectly with subsonic ammo.

Asking price is $420

The Glock 26 G4 9mm Bodyguard is similar in size and weight to the small
frame .38 snubnose revolver. The G26 fires the powerful 9mm cartridge while
possessing 11 rounds, that is the combined capacity of a 6-shot Detective
Special and a 5-shot Chiefs Special, with much less recoil and more
deliverable accuracy at a faster rate of fire. The 4th Generation of the
Glock Safe Action Pistol brings revolutionary design changes to the world's
most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the
multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to
small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Gen4
Rough Textured frame scientifically designed, real world tested,
Internally, the Gen4 Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially
increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable
in seconds, accommodated left or right handed operators.

The Mini-Revolver series by North American Arms is available in 22 Magnum
or 22 Long Rifle. With a barrel length of 1-5/8"" or 1-1/8"", both calibers
offer a lightweight concealed carry pocket gun with a 5-shot capacity.
Using the half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely
away from live or empty chambers without chance of accidental discharge.
The steel frame is fitted with a handy locking black holster grip with a
pocket clip and fixed blade front sight. The holster grip unfolds and locks
to become the handle of the gun. Press the release button and the
mini-revolver folds back into the grip. For added safety, when the holster
grip is folded, the trigger of the gun is completely enclosed making it
virtually impossible for the gun to be fired.

North American Arms mini-revolvers are equipped with a unique safety giving
its owner maximum protection against accidental discharge. The safety
cylinder feature allows the gun to be carried fully loaded. There are
halfway notches between the chambers. After loading, the hammer is lowered
into one of these notches. When the hammer is pulled back to the firing
position, the cylinder rotates to the next chamber. The traditional
half-cock position is to be used for loading and unloading only.
