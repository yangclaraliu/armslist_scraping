I also have a new PS3 that is the Red Edition 500 GB. I still have the box and packaging for it and one of the controllers. It's very new, only played a few times. I don't have time to play it. It opens from the top and is really cool! I have an HD Cable and the original cables it came with. Two Sony Wireless Controllers, the charger, and 12 games. All 6 God of War games which include God of War, God of War 2, God of War 3, God of War Chains of Olympus, God of War Ghost of Sparta, and God of War Ascension. Also have Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Resistance Fall of Man 1&2, Grand Theft Auto 4, Resident Evil 4, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Plays Blurays, gets free wifi and free to play online, can watch Netflix, it's really cool. Easy way to make a gamer or kid happy. I will maybe add a little cash for right deal and have green tactical bag too, will give with trade or a new issues pair of desert military boots with tag still on it. Size 12. If trade was really good I also have a DPMS AR15 Oracle .223/5.56 NATO with ammo and mags"

With a 25 year track record of reliability, durability and performance in the field, P-Series pistols are simple, economical, and serviceable and can be counted on to perform in adverse conditions. The P345 is designed to be easily maintained and can be field-stripped into five major subassemblies for cleaning, without the need for special tools. Its black, custom-compounded polymer grip frame has a built-in picatinny rail to accept modern lights and lasers to keep your sighting options open and also features contoured and checkered grip panels, front-strap, and backstrap. The P345's high-visibility 3-dot sight system is drift adjustable on both the front and the rear for faster, more precise target acquisition while its manual safety is ambidextrous and within easy reach of either thumb. Its rugged slide is made of Ruger's proprietary Terhune Anticorro stainless steel. Two 8-round magazines and a hard plastic case included.

The Ruger P345 comes with two eight-round magazines, a hard plastic case, a cable lock, magazine loader, and instruction manual. Like all Ruger firearms, the P345 is an excellent value, and is built to last.

 A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

 The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

 Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

 Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic

• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery.
 No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking
 and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared

• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with
 Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world
 conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with
 both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.

Bad: Has been carried a lot and has nicks and dings to anodized alloy frame, and bluing loss on barrel and cylinder.  One cylinder has some very shallow pitting on it from storage.

Outstanding carry gun, and cheaper and better built than a new one.

No real trade interest at this time.  This is on my C&R FFL book, so to purchase I need either a copy of your WA driver's license or state ID, or if you are an FFL holder I need a copy of your FFL and I will give you one of mine.  I can ship it out of state to any 03 FFL (C&R) directly."

This stuff is amazing! Not only did I get a 1 and 1/4"" grouping shooting 50 rounds rapid fire with  a pair of BX-25 magazines at 50 yards, but more importantly, I DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE MALFUNCTION! Unlike other 22 ammo, this stuff is made for semi-autos and the powder is much cleaner. It does not cover the bolt and action in a very gritty carbon residue causing stoppages. 
Sure, there were a couple fliers, and I pulled a couple, but raggedy holes was the rule of the day! And this was done with a stock 10/22 with a cheap simmons fixed 4X scope!

This is a Kowa 88mm High Performance TSN-884 Spotting Scope with Kowa TE-10Z 20-60X Zoom Eyepiece, and Gitzo Carbon 6X Tripod for sale or trade.

The 883 features the pure fluorite crystal “PROMINAR” 88-mm objective lens, the Kowa TSN-883 offers simply unsurpassed light throughput for the brightest, aberration free images. Despite the huge lens, the durable magnesium frame helps limit the weight of the Kowa TSN-883 to less than 54 oz. Kowa’s inner focus system shortens the prism box on the TSN-883 scope, giving it a compact 13.5 inch length. The Kowa TSN-883 spotting scope features a dual focus system with separate knobs for coarse and fine focusing, an eyepiece locking mechanism, and a tripod mount that adapts to accommodate either a 1/4- or a 3/8-inch mounting screw. With its superb optics and Kowa’s special adapters, the TSN-884 makes a great digiscoping rig. The Kowa TSN-884 scope is completely waterproof and nitrogen-purged to be internally fog-proof. 

The Gitzo tripod features a 6X carbon fiber tube, made of a unique structure of 6 crossed layers that maximises rigidity, vibration absorption and lightweight performance. 6X tube has a high density structure made of top quality ultra-thin carbon fibers (7mm or 0.007 mm). Built-in Anti Leg Rotation is now a feature of the whole carbon fiber range. Tripod also has a Gitzo G1177M series 1 Center Ball Head.

This combination is valued over $3,500. Asking $2,700 or will consider a trade for a Springfield M1a with ammo.

From a review in Accurateshooter.com by Danny Reever: 
One of my tests included a Snellen Eye Chart, just like the one at your optometrist office. Instead of it hanging on a wall, I placed the Snellen Chart at 500 meters along with some previously-shot paper Ground Hog targets. Conditions were hazy and humid with moderate mirage. My Nightforce 12-42x56mm Benchrest riflescope set at 42X could read line 6 on the chart and I could distinguish only a few of the 6mm bullet holes. My Pentax PF100-ED set at 60X (to match the Kowa’s maximum power) was better. With the Pentax I could read line 7 on the chart and see more of the bullet holes. With the Kowa set at 60X, I could read line 8 on the chart and see all of the bullet holes on the white parts of the targets.. FYI, line 8 on the Snellen Chart defines 20-20 vision at 20 feet. Reading that at 500 meters (1641 feet) is pretty impressive!"

The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature their short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of LWRCI's rifles, the bolt carrier group of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The 16"" barrel is Cold Hammer Forged and NiCorr treated with a 1:7"" twist rate. The barrel is also spiral fluted to reduce weight by 20% and is treated with a NiCorr surface conversion process. This rifle has a 12"" lightweight scupted quad rail handguard derived from LWRC's REPR platform. This rifle features LWRC's enhanced fire control group and both it and the bolt carrier group are coated with a proprietary nickel coating for permanent lubricity. The butt stock is a B5 SOPMOD and the pistol grip is a MagPul MOE+. The sights are LWRC folding BUIS.

Below is the build list, if you have any questions please ask. The rifle has under 100 rounds of factory 168gr through it. It is in perfect condition, and will hold easily under 1 moa. In fact if the prospective buyer provides the ammo I will allow them to try it before purchasing. I am only selling to consolidate, as I have another 700 setup the same way.

Remington 700
20"" Heavy Barrel
Tuned Mark X Trigger - I am drawing a blank on the smith that did this, if I find the paperwork it will be passed on. This break is crisp with no grit and the trigger is far above a stock trigger.
HS Precision Stock - Fully Floated - Custom tri-color spider web camo, looks amazing and gives the stock a three dimensional look. It also blends in very well with it's surroundings. $400 stock before the custom finish.
Zeiss Conquest 4.5-14x44 - ZRF Reticle and externally adjustable knobs. Great piece of glass and I love the reticle, it makes ranging easy without cluttering your view. If you ever decide to swap the reticle, Zeiss will do it for $90. With the external knobs, this scope sells for over $900.
Warne Tactical Steel Base
Warne Steel Rings
Harris BRM Swivel Bipod

The price is $1,550 as it sits, or $1,450 without the bipod. Located in Canton, Ohio 44710. Willing to drive to meet partway within reason.

This bow was $1000.00 bare and the paint was $100.00 and new strings and cabels were $130.00 It has brand new orange/black Firststring strings/cabels, with about 50 shots on them. I have the original strings and cabels as well that are in great shape, just got new ones to change the color. The riser was sent to Splash Graphics in North Dakota this past March 2013 to be painted pearl white with a gloss clear coat. The limbs are factory and in great shape. The bow is set at 29"" draw length, the draw length can be adjusted with moving 2 screws per cam and without a bow press, 50-60 pound draw weight. Currently it is shooting 287 FPS. But i am shooting heavier than needed arrows. With the right grain arrow it will shoot in the low 320s.. The specs of the bow are listed below..$475 cash is the lowest ill take and trade value is $600.

I'm interested in trades for guns. I do not need to sell, just don't shoot it anymore.. The bow is in great shape and never abused. Feel free to text/call/email with any questions or offers at REDACTED. Thanks!"

 Offered for your consideration is one (1) factory new High Standard Crusader Compact .45 ACP pistol. The Crusader Compact is a well-built defensive handgun with forged steel parts and quality assembly. The pistol is of the “Officer’s Model” size, having a shorter butt and having a 3.65 inch barrel. It is finished in a business-like matte Parkerized finish. It has a bushing less slide with a coned barrel for a good slide to barrel fit which incorporates a single spring over a steel guide rod recoil spring system.

What makes this compact 1911 special is that despite its low price, it is loaded up with features that usually are found only on pistols that carry a much higher price tag. This is no stripped-down basic pistol.

The Crusader Compact has an excellent set of steel Novak-style combat sights that are very easy to see, and offer a good sight picture for target work. They are dovetailed into the slide, and the rear sight has a set screw to loosen to make windage adjustments. Another feature usually found only on more expensive pistols is the beaver tail grip safety and skeletonized Commander-style hammer. The feed ramp is polished, and the barrel is throated to feed hollow point ammunition. The trigger is a good-looking partially skeletonized unit, with a crisp trigger pull that feels lighter than its measured five and one-half pounds. The short magazine still holds seven rounds, for a loaded capacity of eight, and has a base pad for positive insertion into the slightly beveled magazine well. The safety on the Crusader Compact is well-designed, and is securely held in place with the slotted pin method, instead of relying upon the right-hand grip panel to hold the safety in place. The grip panels are of the fully checkered wood pattern, and offer a secure grip. The mainspring housing is flat and serrated. Additional pictures upon request. Please……serious inquiries only.
