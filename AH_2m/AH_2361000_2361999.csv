This is a 1967 model (first year) first sold in Dec. 1967. Included but not seen is the cleaning rod that the manual says “also serves as screw driver to unscrew the face plate in the slide.”   This complete original 2 box set has 5 magazines (2 for .380 cal.). A later manual I found explains changing to the .22 cal. extractor but there is no mention of it in this manual which is not only correct to this model but correct to this particular pistol (documented by the selling California gun shop).  Sorry, factory targets did not survive the first owner. (Priced well below book at $1700.00)

Complete Upper receiver assembly.

Specifications:

Spike's Tactical M4 flat top upper receiver, Machined from a 7075 T6 Mil-Spec Forging with Mil-Spec Type III Hard coat Anodized finish, T-markings, Spike’s logo and M4 feed ramps.
Barrel is certified MIL-B-11595E CMV. Bolt & barrel are HPT/MPI tested, M4 barrel extension, Chrome chamber and bore, 5.56mm Nato chamber, 1:7 Twist, Magnetic particle testing on every barrel, Phosphate finish.
Lightweight (Pencil) Profile with Mid-length gas system.

Spike's Tactical 12"" BAR 4 Rail Free Floating Handguard.
Pinned Spike's Tactical DyanComp Muzzle Break.

The Spike's Tactical 12” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The 12” BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA.

Only 500 of these were ever manufactured.
This is the Winchester model 94 Classic.
Chambered in 30/30
20"" octagonal barrel
This one is very unique, Embedded in the stock is a 1oz, 14k, solid gold Michelob coin.
We're assuming that these were given as promotional items or retirement gifts.
A lot nice than a gold watch!
Ok, as far as condition goes, this one needs a little TLC.
There is some water damage to the butt end of the stock.
Looks like someones gun case was in a basement.
Pretty minor, if you want it perfect, you are going to have to refinish.
This one's worth it!
Bluing is good and bore is in excellent condition.
This one appeals to all sorts, Winchester guys, lever-action fans, western shooters, even beer drinkers.
Come in and check this one out, you'll probably never see one again.

90's pistol by Laseraim. They were leaders with laser technology and added the rails and a trigger guard mount for a pressure switch. The lasers are long gone but the pistols are still around and going strong! This is the heavy duty 5"" model, ambi-safety and comes with a 7 round magazine. Has been in a safe and then in a truck glove box for awhile. 2nd picture shows scratches/dings from riding up against something metal in the glove box, so please take note of slide by front sight as price is in consideration of slight dings. Pistol shoots great and straight and eats all ammo I've fed it without jams or stovepipes.

Pictures speak a 1000 words so have a look and can e-mail more pics upon request.



Please note*** I have 4 Wilson Combat magazines that hold 10 rounds each that I will sell to the buyer of the pistol only for $25 each (I paid $40 each last year)***** 10 rounders are above and beyond asking pistol price of $375.



Pistol $375

1-4 10 rd. Wilson Combat mags $25 each = $25-$100

So, she's spent most of her life in a case in a climate controlled room. I get her out once or twice a year to clean her and inspect her for rust. I would rate her at about 8.5/10 for condition (only because of a couple of marks on the stock, no rust). Comes with 30mm scope rings. The scope is a Swift Model 3-9x40mm Waterproof Model No. 680M. Scope has a variable power illuminated reticle, but it hasn't been sighted in a while. I'm asking $550 OBO for just the rifle and scope rings. A couple of more pics at:

• During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction.
• The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta.

The SureFire M900 Vertical Foregrip WeaponLight delivers the tactical advantages of increased weapon control plus 500 lumens of ultra-reliable LED illumination. The light output is focused by a TIR lens into an intense, comparatively tight beam capable of illuminating mid-range targets and beyond, along with providing significant surround light for peripheral vision. The M900 also features two low-output LED navigation lights. Three switches control the primary beam: two momentary-on pressure pads on the vertical grip itself (one on each side for ambidextrous operation), and a constant-on rotary switch at the rear of the light housing. The navigation lights are activated by a momentary-on pressure pad thumb switch. A rotary system-disable switch at the bottom of the grip turns all lights off to prevent accidental activation during covert operations, transport, or storage.

Shotgun is only a year old, and has only 10 rounds through it, I am only selling it to have some extra cash for Christmas.  This is not a safe queen so there are some minor cosmetic issues, there are some scratches on the left side of the gun from where I had a 6 round side saddle mounted on it, as well as scratches from everyday handling, but they are not very noticeable.  I also had to make a slight modification to the fore end to allow the weapon to cycle with the side saddle on it.  This is a great shotgun for home defense and because of the FLEX option you are able to use other FLEX parts to quickly and easily customize it to fit whatever need you have.
