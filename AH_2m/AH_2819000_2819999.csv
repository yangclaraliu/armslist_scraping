This is a 1960's ( no serial number)  Western Auto Revelation 310c  20 ga pump shotgun made by Mossberg.  The photos show it as it sits for sale today, with a new mossberg synthetic rear stock, New oversize aluminum safety, and a 19"" barrel (cut down from 28""), with a threaded brass bead. I stripped and re coated the receiver with Brownells Aluma-Hyde in flat black because I just couldn't get the Aluma-black to look right.   It takes standard Mossberg  barrels stocks, pistol grip, parts, etc.  The 12 Ga rear furniture all fits, so you can add tactical stocks, or a pistol grip."

All guns are NEW, WE DO NOT SELL/DEAL in USED GUNS.
Buy one or ten price is the listed price. We DO NOT GIVE VOLUME DISCOUNTS due to our low low sale prices.
Sorry, but WE DO NOT ACCEPT TRADES. WE are in the business of selling guns..
If your an Ohio resident you can stop by and purchase handguns or rifles... out of state residents GUN MUST be shipped to a FFL in your locality (exception is an out of state resident may walk in and purchase a rifle)

Shipping out of state typically runs 12.95 for handguns, more for rifles.
Cash is preferred, but if you insist on credit cards THEY charge a 3.65% FEE on top of the total price.
We do accept Personal Checks/Bank Checks or Postal/Bank Money orders..Items will ship after check clears bank.
WE DO OFFER NO-INTEREST LAY-A -WAY. 20% down gets you started.
Ohio residents MUST add 6.50% sales tax (sorry not our rules)

WE DO OFFER E-File for NFA items and as ALWAYS ALL NFA RULES APPLY>

We do accept Personal Checks/Bank Checks or Postal/Bank Money orders..Items will ship after check clears bank.
WE DO OFFER NO-INTEREST LAY-A -WAY. 20% down gets you started.
