BRAND: RUG NEW VAQUERO


Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

PATENTED RUGER REVERSE INDEXING PAWL allows for easier loading and unloading, while the traditional

I drove an hour and a half and waited over an hour after already delaying the meet 3 hours to accommodate an individual from the Dayton Area.

It is my single favorite one to shoot that I have ever had. Because it is a modern handgun, some modifications have been done to it. If by chance you want to return it to its original appearance, it can be done by reinstalling the factory grips, and just drifting out the sights to replace them. However, I doubt you will want to do much of that once you shoot it. 

 I am a Tokarev freak (among other things, lol) and this one has had a trigger job and its action polished. I have even shimmed the hammer group, which aids in the trigger's crispness. All the polishing below was done by hand, and not with some Dremel tool, by the way. I learned a lot about tuning Toks from this pistol. It has the single best trigger pull of any Tokarev I have ever had. It is light and crisp, and everything I have learned about smithing Toks was put into it. trigger bearing surfaces are polished to 2000 grit. The feedramp was polished to 2000 grit, and the barrel polished to 1500. The magazine safety has been removed, which also helped the trigger, and puts it inline with a 9mm 1911 as far as accuracy and its fighting capabilities are concerned. I have installed a set of polymer 1911 grips on it, and stained them to a desert camouflage coloration. In my photos it looks like the right grip is lighter than the left one. in person this isn't true. they match. the sights not have a bright orange enamel three dot sight picture. I have found it to be superbly accurate and prefer shooting it over my CZ75.

 it was already a great pistol when I got it, but let's face it, they are not known for the smoothest actions or the lightest triggers out of the box. This has been corrected. I shoot empty shotgun shells with it as 25-40 yards, and empty Coke cans at 50-75 now. It has gun grip tape on the front and rear backstraps fitted, and coupled with the checkered 1911 grips, it locks into your hand as well as a Hi Power or a CZ. I suggest you shoot it a bit before removing these. You'll see what I mean. I have never had any sort of a malfunction with it, and partly because of the polished barrel, it feeds anything you put in it, including every hollow point I have feed through it.

 It will come with its original box and sleeve, the factory cleaning brush that is unused, and all the papers. The original Zastava grips are in it. I am also including a European holster of some sort that it fits in, and works well for field use.

 I bought this pistol new about a year and a half ago. I am selling it for less than I paid before spending the money and hours on it. if you get it and don't like it for any reason at all, return it to me undamaged and I will refund your money with no questions asked.

 I can take cash, a USPS Money Order for payment or a discreet online one if you want to use your credit card.

Im looking for a few different firearms. Im a fair person, and willing to pay fair prices. In no particular order, im looking for an AK47/74 in 7.62 or 5.45, a wasr is fine as long as it has the chrome lined barrel (newer production 10/63) also looking for an FN FNP or FNX Da/Sa in 40 s&w, Sig 226 in 40. Maybe a SR40. And I would also be interested in an XDM in 40S&W as well. Im open to other 40s but please no glocks, or m&ps. Already have one of each and not looking to duplicate. Will consider some 45acp pistols, maybe a ruger 10/22, or a 308 bolt action but please no 9mm offers. $600 is pretty much going to be the most you'll get out of me, unless you got something thats worth pissing my wife off for a week over."

If you shoot this caliber, you'll know this stuff isn't cheap.  I used a collet puller, so the bullets are good, and range in size and shape from 140 gr Spitzer BT to 90 gr JHP.  I left the primers intact, and they may or may not be good.  I imagine these were reloaded in the late 70's or early 80's.

It has EXACTLY 49 rounds down range.  When I purchased this I started trying loads of Sierra MatchKings (180gr) and shot 49 rounds of the 100 in the box.  The remaining 51 were loaded with the round I build for this gun and it is shooting 3/8"" at 100yrds.  Those rounds are matchgrade and will be included with the gun along with the reloading specs.  

The gun is built off of the Remington 700 Police.  It has a 26"" heavy barrel with target crown. I had planned to have the barrel trimmed to 20"" but didn't just due to not shooting the gun much.  It has a jewel trigger and HS Precision stock.  The gun is heavy so unless you're a bigger guy not sure if you will want to lug it around the woods but it does help reduce the recoil.  

The scope is a Burris Black Diamond 4x16x50mm and is in perfect shape.  It is mounted on a picitinny rail with a Burris Extreme tactical mount.  As you'll see on the stock there is small card taped for the specific holds for this round using the Billisticplex reticle. 

This gun is an amazing shooter and you won't be disappointed.  I'm selling it for exactly what I have (gun, scope, mounts, trigger, gunsmith costs, etc.) in it which does not include my time building the loads and making about 10-12 trips to the range to try the loads."

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Description: Up for sale is a Factory New Ruger Mini-30 7.62x39mm semi-auto rifle with a threaded barrel!

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger Mini Thirty rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

The 25-20 is the second rarest caliber second only to .218 bee, I believe only about 40,000 were made out of the 1,000,000 or so 1892's, and of those only about 26,000 were rifles. Just got this for a trade, now need the cash.  Action cycles, but needs to be field stripped, and cleaned to fix hammer follow issue, I hit it with some CLP, and that helped, but it needs to be taken apart, and thoroughly cleaned to get the rest of the crud out of the hammer notch, as it stands it cycles fine, but the lever must be thrown with some force to get it to cock, cleaning should fix this, but I am not a gunsmith.  Other than that it's mechanically sound with a nice patina, and near flawless wood from what I can tell, there is a slight dent in the feed tube, but I don't think it should effect function, but I have no ammo to verify this, but if it's a problem the tube can be easily replaced, Numrich has the part for just $11.80, and it's in stock as I type this.  It's a good honest rifle for 100 years old.  I have more pictures for serious inquiries.  As I said I just got this on a trade so that's about all I know, sold as is.

No Trades, I'm looking for money this time.  I'd prefer to send to a transfer dealer, if you want face to face you'll have to send a deposit, I'm tired of people not showing up."

What I have for sale is a very rare and very nice Winchester model 1911 12 gauge semi auto shotgun.  It was manufactured in 1912 and all serial nubers match.  I fell into two of these, and I am going to let this one go.  It was winchester's first attempt at a semi auto shotgun and trying to work around John M. Browning's patents of the time!!!  It cocks from the barrel instead of a charging handle.  It was dubbed ""the widdow maker"" due to a series of accidents caused by poor gun handling techniques.

This firearm has a 5 round capacity and features a 26"" full choke barrel.  All original blueing, all original parts!!!  I removed the plug for skeet, but it will be included.  The stock and forend are amazing and are american walnut stained a deep reddish brown.  

I have used this for a couple hundred rounds playing skeet, with zero problems.  You can use factory target loads no problem, do not be stupid and throw high power rounds through it, its 102 years old.  I personally reload shotshells for these.  

This beast is a slayer of clays.  I can show you a video.  Ranging out to 90 yards, will still smash them.  It has never ceased to impress me, and anger the people I shoot against.  You will love this weapon.  I want her to go to a good home.

May be willing to consider trades, for an o/u or something of interest.  I am pricing this at 650 or best offer.  email or text preferred  8 zero 8 three 4 three 9 nine 9 four.  let me know what you got.  If no interest, its going on gun broker."

Springfield Armory Description:  Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance.  They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

I have up for sale a 2001 Nissan Xterra. It is the powerful 6-cylinder engine and is 4x4. This is the automatic transmission. This also has power windows and locks. The tires on it are decent and the 4x4 works great (as the recent snowstorms have shown us!). This has keyless entry and rear wiper. This shows 123K miles and it still runs fine. This has two keys and two keyless entry remotes. This is a fantastic truck and would be great for anyone needing a reliable car. The A/C blows cold and the heater blows hot! It has the sunroof and the rack insert that covers the glass up when not in use (the thing everyone breaks or loses). This also comes with a Haynes repair manual that lists out everything I have done to the vehicle for the time that we have owned it. This also has the trailer hitch installed as well. Here is a brief list of what has been done to it recently 
-Fresh oil and filter change 
-Brand new front Windshield 
-Spectre Performance Air Filter 
-New Headlight Bulbs 
-Aftermarket Grille guard (Light ready!) 
-New SSL 6.5 door speakers 
-New 6x9 rear speakers 
-Brand New Radiator and Flushed Coolant System! 

If you have any questions please shoot me an email on here, or shoot me a text only to REDACTED and I will respond ASAP. For any specifics or any questions don't hesitate to message me! This is a used vehicle so please don't expect it to be perfect; she has her dings and a few fluid leaks, but nothing that would make it ""ugly"". We would be asking a significant amount more if I had the time to fix the leak and the light was off, I just dont have time and we need it gone.It appears to have a valve cover gasket leak causing a decent oil spot under the truck. I have already bought the gaskets and grommets (will come with the truck at no extra cost) I just don't have the time to put it on yet due to school, work, and my internship. It is minor enough of a leak that I have been driving it this whole time with no other problems or noticeable issues, i just monitor the fluid level. Just like most other Xterras out there the check engine light occasionally pops on (it's on as of now). We've taken it into the shop a couple times and every time they tell us that it is nothing major and that it wont effect anything mechanical. (usually like a loose connector issue or occasionally the O2 or cat sensor) Either way, it has been this way since we bought it about a year ago and it has never given us any kind of issue with it. Also, if you let the truck sit for a few days and do not start it the battery seems weak. but with regular driving it seems fine. Even if it needed replaced it is a comparatively cheap fix. Plus, we have it priced very fair considering taking into account the relatively low costs of the probable repairs. This drove perfect through the snow like nothing was out of the ordinary! This has an up to date tag and clear title ready to become yours! Spend your tax return on something that will last! This is obviously ""as is"" ""where is"" so feel free to ask any and all questions and I will answer them ASAP! Really not looking for any trades but would consider ""partial"" trades for firearm related items. But we are mainly just looking for cash.

Description: Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance.  They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.
