I am selling my Ruger P95 handgun in stainless finish. It's lightly used as I've only put around 115 rounds through it. The gun comes with everything when purchased new. The two magazines are 15 rounders.

Installed on the grip is a Pachmayr with finger grooves. This is the newer version of the P95 that has the accessory rail on the frame for mounting flashlights/lasers. Gun has decocker/safety. For the price, this gun is reliable and solid. Can't go wrong with a Ruger, they have great customer service.

I am asking $290. Must be face to face and buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale. I will only meet locally, also depending on distance. I would prefer to meet at a gun shop or shooting range, if possible.

Close quarters work requires split second target acquisition and aiming. The AR-332 delivers on both fronts with its unique Ballistic/CQTM lighted reticle which can be adjusted to match any lighting condition day or night. For daylight operation, choose the high contrast black reticle for precision aiming out to 600 yards, or switch to red or green for better contrast and faster targeting.

Like all Burris optics, the AR-332 is waterproof and built to last. Multi-coated lenses reduce glare and ensure brighter images. Lightweight and compact, it comes with integrated lens covers and a Picatinny rail mounting bracket. It also easily mounts on an AR carry handle.

From the manufacturer:
Vepr Super .308 Win caliber rifle, walnut stock, 10-rd magazine Built on the same standard as the RPK style machine guns, Vepr Super is 50% more reinforced than a standard, stamped AK rifle. Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel. Vepr Super in .308 Win caliber features a front sight / gas block combination and a fluted barrel with greater surface area for more effective cooling. The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount can be attached to this rail system. Each rifle comes with high quality, beautifully crafted walnut furniture as well as a rear sight with adjustable windage. They are shipped with one 10-round magazine, a cleaning rod, and a cleaning kit."

The unique reversible backstrap allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip without the use of separate inserts or special tools. The SR40's high-visibility 3-dot sight system includes a rear sight that is windage and elevation adjustable and a front sight that is windage adjustable. Both the ambidextrous thumb safety and the d-shaped magazine release are easy to reach and actuate. An integral accessory mounting rail provides space for mounting lights, lasers, and other tactical accessories. Every pistol ships with two fifteen-round, flush-fit magazines, a magazine loader, and a hard plastic case.

The serial number is 04154, so it's an early, pre-ban model. It was owned and well cared for years by a small arms engineer who used it to experiment with. 

The M17S is an excellent weapon and unusual in that it has a 20"" barrel (20.3"" actually) in a package that is shorter than an M4 carbine. So, not only is it a good weapon for Close Quarters Combat, this rifle has hit man-sized targets out to 500 meters. 

It's only design flaw is that under sustained or rapid fire conditions, the aluminum stock can get very hot, making it difficult to handle without gloves and some kind of added cheek piece to protect the face. This rifle has been modified to rectify that problem without drilling holes or adding parts. 

A copper heat-transmitting compound was used to coat many of the internal components to spread out the hot spots and improve heat dissipation. In addition, a rubberized coating was added to the fore grip and butt-stock areas to protect the hands and face, so the rifle is comfortable to handle under sustained fire conditions. 

The magazine visible in one of the photos was used for reference only and is not included in this listing. However, the illuminated reticule 1x sight pictured is included."

This is a classic 336 before the lawyer safety and the use of ""hardwood"" stocks. The stock on this gun is Walnut. It has a Half Cock safety that functions like it should. This is a nearly 40 year old gun in good condition. It functions perfectly. The finish is good but not perfect as it has been used for hunting in the woods. 

.35 Remington is 30-30 Winchester's big brother. It fires a larger bullet with more energy at the around same velocity. It is much better on larger and thicker-skinned animals.

The barrel and the magazine tube were shortened to 16 inches with the end properly crowned by a gunsmith. The barrel was also drilled and tapped for the factory front sight by the gunsmith. The bluing on the end of the barrel is not perfect due to the length reduction.

This gun is light weight and super handy. It aims naturally and is a real pleasure to shoot. With the short barrel the overall length is only 34 1/2 inches. It would be an ideal truck gun or a great gun for hunting from a blind.

This is a great rifle for stalking deer or hogs. 6+1 capacity. I use it from a stand or the ground and trust it to drop deer to 200+ yards with Hornady Lever Evolution Ammo. I will include a box of ammo. 

I will include a Weaver Scout Scope Base Kit. I used it to mount a scout scope and a conventional scope."

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL--A 46100 steel plate is military spec armor steel. Typically MIL-A 46100 armor plate steel is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel plate is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. (Ar500 is target Material only) I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 hangdun...still no penetration. As displayed and shown in the photographs you will see the test shot target and the ones never before shot at. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches and etc.

With that being said the EoTech and Bi-pod DO NOT come with the rifle! If you want the Eotech add another $300 (it's the 512 model with box and all) I'm willing to entertain trades, for quality AR's in 5.56/6.8 spc, and .308 Arsenal AK's, Glocks, 1911's etc. Do not waist my time with DPMS, bushmaster or like wise trades. WILL NOT happen. Hate to sound rude but it has to be said. If you offer a trade, make sure it is worth my time and equality fair priced** Text or leave a voicemail REDACTED Located in S.Fort Worth"

Made in Germany.

USP Compact 45 Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame.
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life.
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes.
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish.
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves.
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel.
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories.
Ambidextrous magazine release lever.
Extended slide release.
Patented Lock-Out Safety device.


Was $1000. Now priced to sell fast at $900.
NOT interested in any trades.
Requires an FFL transfer.

Get it now, or miss out on the opportunity to own this pristine condition 'classic' Pre-Ban American manufactured AK.

If you know Ak's - you know that Arsenal makes the most expensive, and best, with the tightest tolerances - aside from ordering a custom AK from Rifle Dynamics... which can't be touched in this price range! This rifle is stamped Arsenal Las Vegas Nevada USA, is in pristine condition and currently owned by a gunsmith.

This Arsenal Pre-Ban SAM7A1R 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.

From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.

The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7A1R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, 2 30 round magazines, sling, and cleaning kit.

FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. AK scope rail. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.

SPECIFICATIONS Caliber: 7.62 x 39 mm Total Length: 927mm (36.5”) Barrel Length: 415 mm Weight without Magazine: 3.67kg (8 lbs.) Muzzle Velocity: 710 m/s Rate of Fire (practical): 40 rds/min Twist Rate: 1 in 240 mm Effective Range: 400 m Max Effective Range: 1350 meters/4430feet

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2334959,For Sale:  Remington 870 Police Magnum - This is NOT an Express shotgun,"WPB/Treasure Coast, Florida, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Thursday, November 14, 2013",Shotguns,Remington                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is NOT a Remington Express gun - this is Police Magnum, which is much more durable!

Remington Police Magnums come with a parkerized finish on an 18"" barrel (as opposed to a Blued finish on an Express); feature a stronger sear spring and magazine spring; better extractor and ejector, and much more.

Shotgun has rifle sights and has been gone over completely by in-house Remington LE Certified Armorer. This shotgun goes for $650 new in the box if your are Law Enforcement.

Differences between an Express 870 and a Police Magnum 870:
The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market. It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality. All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences. It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models. Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.

Synopses of the variances are provided below.
870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.
