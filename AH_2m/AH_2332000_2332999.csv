I have put together a $400+ gun and ammo package for trade. I'm also adding up to $200 cash for the right gun. SO, I am offering a $600+ FAIR value for a nice semi auto or maybe a pump action shotgun. I will also sell the whole package for $375 OBO. Package as follows:

- MAUSER bolt action rifle chambered in 308 win. Nice sporter in good condition looks and shoots good. 21"" military contour barrel, polished bolt, good finish, lethar cobra sling, limbsaver recoil pad, it is way nice than your average surplus rifle!

- RIFLE CASE, soft ballistic nylon, padded, black, AR style with mag pouches, in great condition, made in USA. 

- 134 rounds of 308/7.62, ALL factory, ALL brass cased, most of it is Federal Match King 168g hollow points. 

- 60 rounds of 223 (American Eagle) 55g FMJ, pre-loaded into 3, 20 round mil spec AR mags (made in USA) and in very good condition

- I am also throwing in a new 50 rnd box of Federal 40SW tactical 165g HP, a box of 5, Federal 12 gauge tactical slugs, 5 rnds of tactical buckshot and a new 25 rnd box of Federal Steel Shok #7 12 gauge shells! 

- And as I noted, I will gladly add up to $200 CASH, depending on the gun. No games, no BS, just looking for something nice that I have not yet found locally. 

I prefer Remingtons, but will consider other NICE ""domestic"" guns. What I have in mind is a nice Rem 1100, 1187 etc to hunt deer with. I may look at a lever action or other IN deer rifle as well, but am pretty partial to a nice scoped 12 gauge. 

I would like to trade fairly close to Lafayette, Delphi or Lebanon IN, but I will drive up to an hour to meet. I am legal to purchase and carry and will make good on any deal we stike. Thanks!"

No matter how you use it, you'll find the Steiner Military-Tactical 3-12x50 Rifle Scope to be rugged, flexible, and supremely functional. This Steiner Scope is fitted out with world-class Steiner optics, multi-coated for superior contrast and edge-to-edge sharpness. This waterproof military scope provides up to 5 mil of windage adjustment on each side, and up to 19 mil of elevation adjustment, with audible click adjustment knobs that give precise 0.1 mRAD/click adjustments. The shooter can adjust the parallax setting of the Steiner 3-12x50 Tactical Rifle Scope without taking their eyes from the scope. The Steiner 5312 Illuminated Rifle Scope features Steiner's G2 Mil-Dot reticle, a first focal plane reticle with 11 illumination brightness settings to keep you operating smoothly from the dimmest light to the brightest.

Though Steiner's site does not seem to specifically address manufacture and assembly the most reliable information I can find indicates that this scope features German made glass and is assembled in the USA.

Steiner's US reps have confirmed that this scope is covered by a lifetime transferable warranty.

I have a SCCY Industries CPX-2 for sale. Purchased recently to check it out and consider as a new carry pistol (currently a Kahr CM9). The gun is rated very well in many publications. I put between 250 and 300 rounds through it.

The gun comes with box, papers, lock, 2 mags with either flush or extended base plates, and a lifetime warranty. It is no Glock, but it is a well made pistol. I found that while it has a long trigger pull, it is easy to shoot and accurate. I put it out to 10 yards and was shooting very well, even during rapid shooting. I fired 5 different FMJ rounds and 4 different HP and it did well with all except Armscor .124 gr. (feed issue on occasion).  It shot the Golden Sabre .124 + P with no problems.

The gun resembles a Kel-Tec P-11 but appears to be made much better. It uses stainless steel for the barrel and slide and has a good protective nitrate coating on slide. It is light, about 22 oz fully loaded w 11 rounds. Not as thin as my Kahr but it is lighter than my Glock 26 and appears to conceal easier (not as blocky).

So the gun is reliable, easy to conceal, and priced well. This would make a great CCW gun or a great backup. It just wasn't enough to replace my Kahr, so I am looking to sell. If interested, please feel free to call/text, Don REDACTED. Must have the firearm transferred at FFL. The cost to have that done is $25 and I will split the fee with you. Thanks, and have a great night. I have had a lot of time wasters lately so here is my FAQ section.

Q) I have XXXX for trade, are you interested?
A) NO, thank you, but not interested in any trades.

Q) Can we just do a bill of sale, I have a lifetime carry permit?
A) NO, through the FFL, sorry

Q) I will give you $200 for your SCCY.
A) Well first, that isn't a question, that is a statement. Second, NO you will not give me $200 because my price is $250. I am firm at that price, if it doesn't sell, oh well.

Q) I can get that same gun at XXXX for $XXXX.
A) Again, that isn't a question, that is a statement. If you can get it here or there for this or that, GREAT, go get it. I know what the prices are locally and online and mine is well within reason."

I have an unfired Remington 887 nitromag tactical. Comes with 45-50 rounds of 00 buck, 5-10 rounds of slugs, and 30-40 rounds of bird shot. Comes with shell sling and new boresnake cleaner.

This is an excellent shotgun, but as you can see, I don't get out to shoot it. Has excellent sights. 7 round capacity. Can shoot 2 3/4, 3, and 3 1/2 inch shells with no modifications. Has a recoil pad which I understand greatly reduces felt impact.

If interested, please contact Don, REDACTED. The gun must be transferred at an FFL and I will split the cost. 

ALSO - Thank you for trade offers, however I am not interested in any trades right now.  While my pricing is firm for the most part, I MAY work with someone a little provided they are serious on the purchase.  I have had way to many people wasting my time.  If you can't afford the firearm, I appreciate you looking, but move on."

The Aimpoint cost $588, the mount was $165 and the extra cover was another $30. The mount houses a spare battery in case you're actually able to exhaust the original's 50,000 hours of continual use. I have over $780 in this optic (probably over $800 after shipping) and everything is brand new!

•Built primarily for armed forces and police use to hold up under the roughest physical handling and most severe weather conditions, the CompM3 is also ideal for hunters and sport shooters.

Replaceable rubber cover 

The CompM3 comes with a replaceable, outer black rubber cover, which protects it from scratching and adds an additional stealth factor. The outer cover is also available in Dark Earth Brown – perfect camouflage for use in the desert and in the jungle.

I am interested in selling it or trading it for an ar, ak, or pistol (glock or 1911) or I would trade for a browning a5 light 12 or ithaca model 37. I will look at anything on trade and might be able to throw in some cash or something else to even out the trade if I need to. Text 865-eight0six-5351. Thanks."

I bought it new a year ago at an auction and have put less than two boxes of shells through it. I originally bought it for my wife to use as a concealed carry gun in her purse, but I can't get her to go to the range. If she won't practice she won't carry.
I have occasionally carried it myself, as it fits easily into a pocket or iwb holster, but my Kahr is my main carry arm.
This would make a perfect ccw for someone. As far as reliability there is no equal. You pull the trigger and it fires. There are none of the issues that you run into with a semi-automatic. You have five shots available and it is very easy to carry a couple of speed loaders for added loads.
It is rated at +p so it is capable of shooting loads from reduced recoil .38 special to (near .357 powered) .38 +p's.
I will included two holsters. One is a pocket holster and the other is a soft iwb belt clip. Both are inexpensive but allow immediate carry. This gun would also work great in a carry purse or ankle holster. I will also include 45 Winchester personal protection +p hollow points.
My price is firm.
I don't really need it or I would keep it. The money is gonna go toward my new .308 AR build.

One 17 round extended mag and one 10 round mag
All other factory goodies included
$425 firm don't bother with lowball/trade offers please!
Pick up in Tulsa, OK.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Manufactured in 1983 Marlin Model 60 semi auto .22LR. 18 shot tube. No last shot bolt hold open, that feature was not available until 1985. Comes with a Tasco 3-7X20 scope. This rifle is in very good plus condition 90% with only a very little blue loss to the top edge of the rear of the receiver and a very minor mark or 2 on the stock. This Model 60 (unlike many other 60's that choke on cheap ammo) will feed and cycle every single brand of .22lr that you want to use. Dirty Thunderbolts, craptastic Golden Bullets it doesn't matter to this guy, it eats them all with no stove pipes or failure to feed issues of any kind. I regularly pull 1"" groups at 50-75 yards with this rifle. It's a wonderful shooter. I hate to sell because it's a great rifle & the last firearm I own, but bills need paid so it has to go. 

I can not drive to meet you, you must come to Camdenton/Linn Creek to pick it up. I will not ship.

I advise prospective buyers of pawned firearms to seriously look into procedures and regulations in re: pawn returns/pawn DROS. 

In the posting that was flagged, I explained the circumstances re: my SIG 226. Apparently some folks require remedial English comprehension instruction to be able to understand the basic English language. Be that as it may, I hold no ill will to the person whom flagged my posting, you know who you are, you did what you felt in your gut was the right thing to do.

Entire rifle was stripped down, cleaned of cosmoline in a bath of mineral spirits for 1 week.

Bolt has been disassembled, polished, and cleaned.
All metal parts re-blued or touched up, butt plate duracoated, barrel bands reblued, etc. 

Chamber has been thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed (no sticky bolt on this one), and barrel thoroughly cleaned. 

Headspace checked with OKIE GO, NO GO, and Field guage. Good to GO! 

Strong riffling and groves.  Most T53’s do NOT come with a cleaning rod. I picked one up from an online vendor, but can’t confirm if it’s Chinese or Russian. The seller said it was Chinese, but after looking at some cleaning rod variants, can’t confirm either which way. The cleaning rod screws in flawlessly and fit’s perfectly though. 

If you're familiar with what's on the market, all the T53's stocks are rough! Not much out there in quality “Chue” wood (original chinese wood on T53’s) so started to restore the stock. The wood that the Chinese used is particularly soft and doesn’t take well to stain and is a PITA to work with. 

Ended up completely stripping the stock - it was rough, sanding from 300 grit to 1200/000 steel wool. The original stock was almost a dark chocolate brown and was beat to death, so to get even  stain, ended up bleaching the stocks to level out the colors. Chroline didn’t work so well, so bleached with multiple treatments of Oxalic acid. This went on for over 3 months in my spare time. 

Stained with a custom mixed dye to get closest match to what the color might have been originally. Photos do not accurately reflect the light, but it’s a shade lighter with a hint of orange/brown VS the Russian “RED” Nagants. 

Finished off with 22 coats of Tru-Oil over 6 months. Has a High Gloss sheen right now, but can easily be knocked down with 000 steel wool for a ""matte finish"". Tru-oil is easier to work with and touch up than Poly and I prefer it for gun stocks! 

The stock is gorgeous and is the original Chue wood!!!! 

Negatives: This T53 is NOT numbers matching and there was a small patch on the stock that you can see in the photos. Right side near the crossbolt. Not very noticeable, but it's there. 

I wont’ say the stock is perfect, but it’s damn nice! I doubt you’ll find a better Type 53 and one that is pure Chinese Chue wood that came with the T53’s.

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

    Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
    Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.
