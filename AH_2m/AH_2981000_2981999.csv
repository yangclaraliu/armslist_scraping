 Ruger LCP - LNIB, box, manual, spent factory shell, etc. low round count on this LCP. Very good ratings on this gun but just doesn't fit my hand well at all.

NO credit card fees!! The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip. The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight. Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

Welcome to Tampa Armslist.

Here's something you should do. Before you buy a gun on Armslist, go to www.slickguns.com and see what it goes for new. Suncoast Firearms does $15 transfers + $5 call in. Most places online do free shipping. So when some douchebag is asking $300 for a hi point, do your homework and let them know its a $160 gun. They actually know what its worth they're just trying to rip you off.

Same goes for ammo. If you guys stop buying .22LR at 10+ cents a round, these guys will stop clearing out Walmart to make $20 bucks a box on Armslist. 

Thanks, and God Bless."

The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun. The frame and cylinder are Stainless Steel for exceptional strength, with a satin finish for an attractive appearance. Its durable frame and barrel is built for continuous Magnum usage."

The M1917 Enfield I have not clened up other than ran a few cleaning clothes through the barrel. I am not sure what caliber the M1917 is. I had removed the top stock and there in engraving on it that says ""CAL .303"". However, a .303 does not chamber. I tried .30-06 and that did not chamber either.

I fixed up the other rifle and it works and fires great. The Enfield looks like it would be a fun shooter once some love is put into it.

SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights. I have less than 200 rounds through this gun.....hardly used!

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right.

The pistol comes with one 6 round mag but I am including another 6 round and a 7 round mag. I have two extra holsters besides the plastic one that comes with base gun. A Remora tuck and a leather pocket holster which prevents it from printing. Using the leather wallet holster makes it appear as a wallet in your front or rear pocket. The Remora stays put in your waistband or pocket due to the outside material keeping it in place while pulling gun out of it....very nice.

I also installed the Tillamook Precision stainless steel trigger....much easier on your finger but makes for a nice crisp trigger....much improved over the stock plastic.

I am also including a Hogue grip which makes a very nice 'purchase' when pistol is in your hand. The Hogue is larger than the stock grips and allows you to get a fuller grip and with the 7 round mag the pinky extender allows for a much improved grip for larger hands.

I would like to sell as complete package and looking to get $738 cash.

includes target recoil springs and high-velocity recoil spring kits with original box and paperwork and chamber flag 

the barrel is a full 5.25"" and really accurate considering the fixed sights

the barrel also is in-line with your hand so there is no recoil whatsoever

very fun to shoot - and it shoots FAST

has one of the best triggers i have felt for a stock pistol

has re-strike capability (has charge handle and a re-strike handle)

very safe to shoot as it has something like 5 internal safeties - and one external safty

all the tools for breakdown and complete diss-assembly are included and stored INSIDE the gun

i purchased it during summer 2013

uses ruger 10 round or 25 round 10/22 mags you already have (mags not included - these guns ship without a mag)

this is one of the newer versions and it works great!
 (the first versions were made to tight tolerances and were jam-o-matic)

i have it broke in and it runs really good with ruger 10 round mags but it will also use the BX-25 mags as well

 i have put well over 300 rounds of various brands of 22 ammo and seems to work really good with all types. (it's easier to clean if you use plated ammo.)

make sure you use the right springs with the appropriate ammo
(use the high-velocity springs for 36gr high velocity ammo and use the target springs for target ammo)

first picture is the actual bull-pup gun - 2nd and 3rd pic to show what it looks like with attachments - can be mounted on a rifle with the rail kits... or mount a scope, etc.

The TA01NSN-RMR combines the technology of the battle-tested Trijicon ACOG (4x32) gun sight with the 3.25 MOA Trijicon RMR™ red dot sight. This provides the shooter with the option of quick acquisition close range sighting with the Trijicon RMR sight and the precision for longer range shooting with the Trijicon ACOG 4x32. This ability to adjust to tactical situations gives the user the needed edge when the lives are on the line and success is the only acceptable outcome. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments. The reticle will appear black during the daytime and will glow amber in the dark, thanks to Trijicon’s patented tritium illumination.

http://www.trdleather.com  

Features

- Extremely rugged, full grain, THICK leather.  This jacket weighs 10 lbs.  I ordered it extra heavy duty, and got it. Their standard thickness leather jacket is made from 1.3-1.4mm cowhide -- I don't have calipers to measure with, so I'm not sure HOW thicker this is, but it is seriously thick.
- Removable liner.
- Two inside pockets, large enough to hold a compact semi-auto if you CCW.
- Four external pockets: 2 hand warmer pockets, a diagonal chest pocket, and a small front pocket.
- Epaulets.
- Lace-up sides.
- Attached belt.
- Brass hardware.  All zippers are heavy-duty brass YKK zippers.  (The lining zipper is silver colored, but all external hardware is brass.)

Fit and Story

This was a custom order jacket, and I could not return it.  Overall I am VERY happy with the jacket... except for the fit. I am 5'10"" 180 lbs, 42"" chest and 36"" waist, and they fitted me wrong, and I waited too long to exchange it.  

The story goes like this:  I purchased my first TRD jacket at the Cleveland Motorcycle Show in 2004, in size 42.  It fit like it was made for me from day one, extremely comfortable, and I wore that jacket almost daily for six years, and in that time it was just starting to get nicely broken in.  In the winter 2010 it was stolen. Remembering the label, I could only remember the letters TRD, so I tried looking up on the internet and found that they were a local outfit with a good reputation for building quality jackets.  

So I went and bought this one that I'm selling today, brand new as a custom order in spring 2011.  Between 2004 and 2010, I had gone from 140 lbs to about 160, so the 42 had been fitting a bit snug, and I wanted to go up to a 44.  They measured me and advised to go a size larger so I could layer under it in cold weather, so I ordered a 46.  I had wanted some custom features which deviated from their standard 2010 design, to keep as close to my old jacket as possible. They built it for me, I tried it on, it seemed to fit well enough, I took it home.

In late Spring, before I had a chance to wear it on its inaugural ride, I broke my arm in a bicycle accident, and could not wear it again until I recovered from my injuries.  That winter, following my recovery, I put it on and went to my garage and sat on the bike, to find that it fits a bit too long for me in the torso.  When seated in a riding position, my thighs push the waist of the jacket up, causing the entire jacket to shift up.  In the summer this would let in a lot of wind and be a nice feature, but for colder weather it would be too much.

So if you are about 5'10"" and have a 30"" inseam like I do, then for your torso length this is probably not a good jacket for you.  However,  If you are  6'0"" - 6'2"" and 200-210 lbs, with a 44-46"" chest and about a 36-38"" waist, it would probably fit you very well.  

Measurements

Size: 46 (according to tag)
Sleeve length: 26"" (measured from where the sleeve joins the shoulder to cuff.)
                       33"" (measured from where the collar meets the shoulder to cuff.)
Body length: 28"" (measured from center of base of collar to bottom hem of rear of jacket.)
Chest width: 25"" (measured armpit to armpit across the back.)

If you need any other measurements, please ask!!

Price, Terms, Conditions

Condition is offered as ""New Without Tags"" because the jacket never had tags on it.  It is essentially new, has just been hanging in the closet for about 2 years.

I am trying to represent this jacket as completely and honestly as I can.  No returns are offered, so if you have any questions about measurements please ask.  If the listing is active, it's still available.  Serious inquiries only, please."

Very solid, has never jammed or malfunctioned in any way, only reason i'm selling is because I got a new carry gun.

Retail for everything is around $770, due to the minimal but inevitable wear on the gun and especially the IWB holster, i'm asking $550, not in a hurry to sell so please no lowballs, the gun brand new is nearly worth that.

I purchased the rifle new 3 months ago and have taken it to the range a grand total of ONE time during which I fired TWO twenty round magazines to dial in the sights and check for functionality. The rifle performed flawlessly and exceeded my expectations in accuracy. I took the rifle home, cleaned it, checked the bolt gap, and returned it to the safe... and there it has remained because I have found that I cannot afford to shoot 308 as much I would like.

Therefore, I have found myself with another excellent safe queen and without a safe big enough to continue stockpiling. Rifle comes with 6 mags + the original hard plastic case and manual. If you only have cash, feel free to make an offer but realize that I am not particularly looking to sell the rifle, just to trade straight across or with some cash and/or ammo from either end

I would like to trade for a Sig Sauer 556R (that's the 7.62x39 version) or other ""tactical"" style rifle. I will not entertain offers for handguns, shotguns. antiques, collectibles or anything of the sort. I will also look at higher end ARs, especially in 300 blackout but only if you can provide a decent amount of ammunition with the trade. I would especially like a ""retro"" style AR (A1 or A2 receiver w/ 20"" barrel) in 5.56. That being said, please don't hesitate to contact me with any inquires. Thanks!"

There are only listings for 3 towns in all of NH! Armslist, please fix this soon.

This is a noticeably used Remington 870 Police Magnum. I outfitted it to be a clone of the one used in The Terminator movie. 
This shotgun was used as an actual Police gun so there is noticeable finish wear from the clamp in the squad car. There is also finish wear on the tube, barrel & receiver, mostly from handling by the police force and not from excessive shooting.
It is a true Police Magnum Model, with upgraded springs, polished internal parts, and a more comprehensive QA check from the Remington factory. The gun will come with the ammo sidesaddle, and for a full price offer, I will throw in the 40 rounds of pictured 00 buckshot.
I also have more rounds of 00 buck, low or high recoil. $7 for 10 rounds, or I can make a deal on larger quantities.

You must show me a New Hampshire drivers license or other Photo ID card to prove age and residence. Sales to other states are OK (except MA, NY, CT, NJ, CA or other states as I decide) as long as your FFL will accept shipment from a private person. If not, I can ship through an FFL on my end, but you will have to pay both fees and shipping.

I am near Keene, NH but would meet in other local towns like Hinsdale, Walpole, Winchester, Westmoreland, Chesterfield etc.

Up for trade is a USED Glock 23, GEN 3, with exactly 250 rounds through it. Pistol was purchased by me from the Marksman in May of 2010. It comes with the original case, two fired rounds from the factory, three (3) 13 round magazines, and night sights (sorry, no factory paperwork). Take a look at the pictures and you will see that there are NO scratches, dents or dings on this pistol. It was cleaned, lubed, and stored after every range visit. As is typical of Glocks, it has fired with every squeeze of the trigger with no FTF or FTE. Absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, just getting away from striker-fired pistols.

I would like to trade my G23 for something that shoots .45 ACP, 5.56mm, 30.06, OR 7.62x51 (NO STRIKER-FIRED PISTOLS PLEASE).  I have 150 rounds of UMC .40 cal FMJ and 27 rounds of Federal 180 grain HST JHP to even up the trade if your trade has more value.  I would also add some cash, depending on the trade.   

I am located in Lacey and would be willing to travel approximately 30 minutes in any cardinal direction, maybe a little further for the right trade.  FTF will be conducted in a public place of my choosing.  I am an honest guy that treats people fairly and I expect the same from those that I conduct business with.  If you don’t fit in this category then go bother someone else.  

CPL and DL from the state of Washington is a must.  If you are military contact me and we will work it out.  I will require a peek at both (no pics) documents and will do a transfer of ownership for both parties that will go no further than my safe.

Send me an email through Armslist or text David at REDACTED and I will respond ASAP.  More pics available upon request."

This rifle has not been sanded,sporterized,refinished,repaired or altered in anyway then when it came off factory floor production 100+ years ago guaranteed. Highest quality Mauser variant ever made as agreed by all Collector's, a high point of artisan craftsmanship.Chambered for accurate 7.65x53mm Argentine. No import mark defacing pre-1964 import. This specific rifle made out of West African Mahogany as I am told from my research and local expert woodworker (not from walnut as I incorrectly originally assumed, I am not an expert of different woods.), which was the luxury wood import into Europe around 1907, around time this rifle was made. This is not the cheap,low quality,plentiful 1891 or cavalry model Argentinian Mauser. As excellent of condition as a 100+ year old rifle can be found in 2014 I guarantee it, best condition Mauser rifle I have seen in all my time.Additional pictures please request.

But when bullet velocity begins to change, surprises can happen. Many factors cause velocities to change-gun type, barrel length, distance to target, barriers and more. That's why you need a bullet that you can depend on to perform over a wide range of velocities. You need the XTP."
