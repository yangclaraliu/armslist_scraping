To help them enter the woods with the best rifle possible, Marlin is offering the legendary Model 336 in a configuration specifically designed for youth and optimally
engineered with the young hunter in mind.  Chambered for the low recoil 30-30 Winchester cartridge, The Model 336Y is modeled after a Marlin classic, the 336C.  To accommodate a small framed hunter, this carbine tips the scale at a light weight 6.5 lbs. and is only 33.25 inches in length.  The hardwood stock is shortened to a 12 inches length of pull and the 12 groove, Micro-Groove barrel is 16.25 inches long.  The rifle comes standard with an adjustable, semi-buckhorn folding rear sight, a ramp front sight with a brass bead and a Wide-Scan hood.  The solid top receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and an off-set hammer spur is included with every rifle.  The Marlin Model 336Y is the perfect rifle for young hunters to take their first deer.  They will be proud to join generations of Marlin owners who have engaged in the deer
hunting tradition by carrying a classic Marlin lever action, The Great American Rifle.

Any of these would make the centerpiece of the most impressive engagement ring that most people have ever seen. 

I also have a variety of other smaller loose rubies, sapphires and spinels. The stones are mostly cut facets, but I also have some uncut sapphires and spinels which are really cool and nigh-on impossible to find in the US.

Makes the perfect pocket pistol.  It is in excellent condition.  Only about 4 mags through it.  It is ported so the recoil is actually pretty tame for its size.  I find it fun to shoot.  Th he porting muzzle flash is barely noticeable.

It comes with 2 mags and all boxes and papaerwork.  I am wanting to trade it for a Beretta Tomcat (32) or a S&W Bodyguard 380.  Why do I want t trade it?  Just because I am used to manual safeties like the smith and tomcat.  I am really just looking for those 2 but would listen to anything offered. If you are wanting t buy I would sell for $400 FTF only  I am located in Olive Branch (Memphis are) but go to the grenada area often.  Also willing to meet half way if reasonable.  

The top pic is a crappy cell pic of my actual gun.  The 2nd is a stock pics (next to a Kel Tec P3T) to show you how small it is"

This the SASS (semi auto sniper system) by DPMS.  It can take either 7.62 NATO round, or the .308 WIN round.  This gun is extremely capable of influencing targets out to 800+ yards.  It comes ready-to-fire right out of the box with the exception of a scope and rings.  This rifle is also one of the few 7.62/308 rifles that WILL take Magpul LR20 PMAGs.  

Price is $1849.99 plus 5.5% tax (cash only).  This rifle normally sells for $2200 most other places.  Because this will be a special order, I will require a 10% non-refundable cash deposit.

For the right deal I will include the recoil pad and a Redfield 3-9 scope, for an extra 100.  I love this gun, but need to come up with a down payment for a new bike."

Argentine Mauser Modelo 1891: The last antique rifle.
The late 19th Century was witness to a frantic global arms race; the introduction of the Mle. 1886 Lebel by the French had, almost overnight, obsoleted every other military rifle in the world. The Germans responded by fielding the Gew. 1888 ""Commission Rifle"", so called because it was designed by a committee, rather than any independent factory. Mauser, feeling snubbed, set to work designing a rifle that eclipsed the Gew. 88 in every way, and shopped it to the Belgians. Due to the fact that the Mauser works were running nearly at capacity supplying the Turks, Ludwig Loewe & Co.

The pica tinny rail on the top, bottom, and sides makes it very customizable. There are several things you could do with it. For instance I would either put a scope on the top or maybe a red dot, Bottom rail I would put a bipod or even a laser on it. There are so many different things and ways you could go with this. Has a pretty good trigger pull on it. The stock is adjustable which helps with adjusting it to you comfort needed. A nice looking, customizable, reliable firearm!!

If you want one of the BEST PISTON uppers made, then ADAMS ARMS is it.

They have the patend for the most diverse gas piston system ever made. It has a 3 position selector for Single fire, Suppressed, and standard operation. Much cleaner (Only has to be cleaned after 3000rds) and more reliable then your usual run of the mil gas system. I can assure you not many people have this upper especially with the M4 barrel. They are backorderd for 12 months and that's with the pencil barrel.

Yes, its totally complete with the PISTON BCG and Charging handle. Just slap it on your complete lower and watch your friends mouths drop. Don't spend $3000+ on an HK416

The wood has some light figuring to it on the butt-stock. The rifling is in excellent condition with very sharp rifling. The bolt is one of the smoothest I have ever felt. It is a 40+ year old gun though and it does have evidence of wear on the wood, scratches, dings and whatnot. Nothing too serious though. The butt-stock pad is a little worn as well. Some scratches on the outside metal as well too. Again these are not serious marks. This is an absolute beautiful rifle. More pictures on demand. The gun is at consignment at my local ffl, the extra pictures he took, so look closely for the dings and scratches and whatnot if that is a concern for you. The scope is an older tasco I had on a Saiga. I have never fired it on this gun, so it is not sighted in, not sure if it will work because of the recoil with the gun. It comes with the gun, nevertheless. Also comes with the bipod as well. If you meet my asking price face to face I'l throw in some ammo and some brass. If not local I'll ship for free for asking price, no ammo or brass though. Looking for $500 or best offer. Interested in trades as well, other guns, ammo, car audio, etc. Located in Mexico, NY."

I have 27 bucks into each box and will take $26.00 cash each, but you have to buy all six boxes....I won't split it up and try to meet a bunch of folks who just want one box....I'm already losing money so want this to go in one transaction. Also, I won't meet you halfway across town as I have gas money into these already from buying them all the way across the cities!

This price ($26 a box) is  a good deal compared to other prices I found on Armslist so I expect these will go fast. 
$156.00 cash for the six boxes takes them all. Let me know if you want them - Thanks."

I must not be nearly the man the rest of you are because 12 gauge is much more firepower than I need.  It fired beautifully.  I put 50 shells through it and have to say that it shredded skeet like no 20 gauge I've ever seen.  Nonetheless, I cleaned it up, repackaged it, and am putting it up for sale in hopes of recovering some small fraction of what I paid.  It rang up for $497 but for whatever reason, the tag said $418, so the total with tax came to $443.08.  To put this impulse buy behind me, I'll gladly accept $199. Please email me if you have any questions or want to make an offer.  I would also trade for a similarly styled Mossberg 20 gauge.

Sig 716 Flat Dark Earth (7.62x51 or .308)

I ordered this rifle 8 months ago.  It just arrived and I picked it up (09/10/13).  While I waited, I found another rifle that I like even better (means more expensive).  I love this Sig 716.  It has every feature I could want in an AR 10 platform.  I'm into it for $2200 and its yours for $2200 which a full $200 UNDER the total MSRP + TN taxes (if you could find an FDE for sale to start with).  If you don't believe me, look online and you'll see.  

For $200 more (again, my cost) you can have my 5 brand new 308 pmags and 100 rounds of Magtech .308 ammo.  I also have some .308 hunting loads I can sell  to the buyer if you're interested.

What could steal my attention away from such an awesome Battle Rifle?  Spikes Tactical makes an SBR with an integrated suppressor in the 300 BLK.  It'll take me a year to get, and a lot of paperwork, but I'm pretty patient when it comes to buying guns.

I'd prefer a face-to-face transaction with a CCP, LEO, or card carrying NRA member.

     I used to hunt with this gun, but I moved to Oregon and my wife had a baby, so I am not hunting these days.
  I has been used, so there are some scratches that I have done my best to photograph. I think it looks a lot better in person than in the photos.
   It shot great, but it has just sat since our move so it would be a good Idea to check the zero on this rifle. I have never had it shift, but better safe than sorry."
