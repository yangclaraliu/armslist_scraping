Design details
The Walther PK380 is chambered for the .380 ACP cartridge, and its design is very similar to the .22 LR Walther P22, which in turn is based on the larger Walther P99. Like the P22, the PK380 features a slide-mounted, ambidextrous manual hammer-block, non-decocking safety and an external hammer. The magazine release is also ambidextrous using the Walther-style paddle release on the base of the trigger guard. However, unlike other Walthers, there is no slide release lever. Thus, the slide must be pulled rearward and released to chamber the first round. To release the slide with an empty magazine, the magazine must be dropped slightly or completely removed and the slide pulled rearward and released. The slide, barrel, and internal frame are steel, and the grip is polymer for reduced weight. Magazines are single-stack design holding 8 rounds giving the gun an 8+1 capacity. Also included is a Picatinny-style rail which will accommodate Walther's laser aiming system.
Operation
The PK380 may be fired double action or single action. Unlike the P22, which the PK380 is based on, the PK380 does not operate by blowback where pressure generated by a firing cartridge is countered by a combination of the inertial weight of the slide assembly and the force of the recoil spring. Instead, the PK380 employs a Browning-type, tilt barrel design. The action will not open until the projectile has left the barrel and the pressures have dropped to safe levels. This tilt-barrel design, coupled with the PK380's relatively tame chambering, make the PK380 a very light-recoiling pistol. In addition, these features also allow for the slide to be operated with little force, making the weapon appealing to those with limited tactile strength, such as small-framed women and the elderly

When you bring me one of your firearms, you can rest assured that the job will be done right, and come out looking great.

Carbon Fiber
Wood Grain
Stone
Metal

Item 4B (300gr. JFN) is designed for super deep penetration at revolver speeds, but will mushroom and penetrate less deeply at rifle speeds. At handgun speeds you can expect a solid 3 feet of penetration in muscle and bone and at rifle speeds expect roughly 2 feet of penetration in muscle and bone. At handgun velocities, this bullet will act just like item 4A in living tissue. The greater velocities generated by the longer barrel of the rifle will cause the bullet to mushroom and that large mushroom will make a much bigger diameter hole in tissue, but that frontal area on the mushroomed bullet will cut down the depth of penetration.
You’ll note my below velocities form over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.
1.       Ruger Super Blackhawk with 6 inch barrel--------1330 fps
2.       Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch barrel-----------------------1334 fps
3.       1894 Marlin with 18.5 inch barrel---------------------1770 fps

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
    This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Here are genuine Radom Arsenal Polish made magazines for the P-64 pistols chambered in the 9x18 Makarov caliber that are abundant throughout the Country and throughout the world. Manufacturer is Lucznik Arms Factory in Radom, Poland. Construction is blue steel, with polymer finger rest and steel cartridge follower. Each magazine holds 6 rounds of 9x18 Makarov ammunition, and in some cases these pistols will function with .380 ACP ammunition. These magazines only fit the P64 Pistols. They will not fit a Russian Makarov, or a Walther PPK, or the ignition switch of an Allis Chalmers Tractor. These magazines come from service with the Polish State Police, and they are well preserved. Some of them have Department markings, as the photos show. We rate them as Very Good Condition, but the photos ought to suffice for our shoppers to assess finish grade for themselves, and buyers will receive magazines from the same lot as the photo specimens. Replacement pricing on similar magazines often approaches $75 apiece. We’re offering the magazines in the photos, however, each	for only	$ 39.00.		Not for sale to residents of New York City. 
Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10

Restrictions apply on high capacity magazines in some jurisdictions of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before offering to buy.  This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. From an old Carolina warehouse come these never fired, never loaded Para Ordnance Magazines to fit full size P14 and LDA Pistols. Manufacturer is Para-Ordnance of Canada. Body is marked, Made in Canada, and floorplate is marked with the Para Ordnance logo and numerals 1-10. Factory number is POML45, UPC is REDACTED01.  Construction is matte finish blue steel, with steel spring, black polymer cartridge follower, and +1 floorplate that allows for the extra round. Note the center punch removal system on the floorplate apparatus; these are old production, early 1990s magazines, Pre-Ban all right, but it doesn’t make any difference any more unless a person lives in Massachusetts and has a high cap permit. Models these fit include P1445, 14.45 LDA, 14.45 LDA Limited, D1445, DCS1445. DCS1445E, DCX1445E, DX1445E, DX1445S, PR1445, PRX1445, PX1445S, PX1445E BH, PX1445E, PX1445E MB, PCX1445, PX1445S, RX1445E, RX1445E CB, RX1445S, SX1445, SX1445S, T1445, TX1445,  TX1445S. These will fit any Para Ordnance .45 Pistol, so long as it has a standard Government length grip frame that accommodates double stacked high capacity magazines. These will fit in many other Paras, like the P12 and Warthog, but they will extend from the grip frame. Your pistol’s grip screw centers should measure 3 inches, and its magazine well should accommodate a .935 wide magazine. Each magazine holds 15 rounds of .45 ACP Ammunition. These magazines come to us from a dealer liquidation in neighboring North Carolina. All of them are still in their plastic wrap, and most of them still have the factory label affixed. The P14.45 in some of our photos is not included, of course. Replacement price on the current production magazines ranges upwards of $70 apiece in our area, if a person can even find any. Our Single Magazine price is $33.00. We’re offering the magazines in the photos in lots of 3, however, at only $26 each. Own 3			for only	$ 78.00.	Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 15 shot pistol magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement.

This model 11 is in great shape. It has a synthetic buffer pad inside the receiver that has helped keep the receiver save from the bolt cycling rearward. There is a nice patina to the metal, and in some places the bluing is worn. The rear of the receiver is missing the most bluing, however there is no pitting of any kind and the rest of the receiver looks great!

The wood is in very good condition and the forend *is not* cracked as is common with these shotguns. Please note, this shotgun is the ""Sportsman"" model which holds only three rounds. As a courtesy to whoever purchases this shotgun, I will go over the basics of its operation and how the gun comes apart to modify the recoil system for different loads.

The only trades I am interested in are for .308 projectiles that are at least 160gr in weight, large rifle primers, *nice* 308 Win brass, or 308 Win reloading dies.

Selling as I need to thin the collection, and not because I dislike it. (FWIW, Lowest new price I've found is $730 to $750 after FFL fees and tax).

Price is fiirm, which means I will not sell for less. I have to reiterated that as some people don't seem to understand what ""firm"" means.


Will be completing a BoS for my records only, and will need to see good guy credentials. Located in Seattle, though I make frequent trips down to Tacoma. Please include a phone number with your email and I will get back to you.

I'm not really looking for a trade, but might be swayed by a pretty Sig P229 .40 Cal, or a P220 .45."

A400 Xcel: the Fastest, Lowest-Recoil Clay Buster

The A400 Xcel is a 12-gauge competition shotgun that is faster-cycling, softer-shooting and better balanced than anything else on the market. Built on the revolutionary A400 action, it delivers follow-up shots 36% faster than any other brand, while its advanced recoil-reducing systems make it absolutely pleasant to shoot, even on demanding all-day competitions. Its sleek lines and superior ergonomics are designed with one goal in mind: letting the A400 naturally follow your eye to the target. This is why it has quickly become a favorite among serious competitive shooters the world over.  
 

Built on Today’s Most Advanced Semi-Automatic Action

The A400 action is the culmination of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and passion for shotguns. It feeds reliably all types of shells from 2 ¾” to 3,” with loads ranging from target-light to hard hitting--making it also suited for the occasional upland or waterfowl hunt. Also, it features the unique Blink technology, a gas-operating system that is capable of delivering two shots in less than half a second, while also integrating an easy-maintenance self-cleaning piston. Furthermore, the action has sleek lines and a low profile, meaning that the vertical distance between the dominant eye and the supporting hand is reduced to a minimum. The result? A gun that follows your swing like an extension of your body and eyesight--and many more broken clays.


Extremely Low-Recoil

There are no two ways about it: felt recoil is only a liability and the less of it, the better. The A400 Xcel incorporates several recoil-reducing systems operating simultaneously to make recoil virtually negligible (70% overall reduction). One is a hydraulic shock absorber that softens the rearward energy from the action’s moving parts, which minimizes felt recoil while reducing wear within the receiver. Another is a Micro-Core buttpad that all but neutralizes the recoil generated by the power of the cartridge. Also, the A400 is designed to recoil parallel to the comb, meaning no thump to the cheek and minimal muzzle rise.
 

Durable, Easy and Quick to Clean

The A400 Xcel's cold-hammer forged barrel is made of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel (Beretta’s “Steelium”), a proprietary formula engineered for consistency, toughness and durability. The bore is chrome-plated to facilitate cleaning and minimize wear and corrosion. And the new Optimabore HP choke tubes are particularly easy to remove--even after several thousands of rounds. Lastly, the new, improved gas piston makes assembly and disassembly a matter of seconds. All these are reasons why when your competitors see you approaching with the A400 Xcel’s telltale bright-blue receiver, they will know you have the absolute best--and they will know who the winner is.

$560 cash or may consider good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

Not in need of anything at all right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of since I know cash can be tight for folks, not limited to:

FN SCAR
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers or complete rifles in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf or .450 Bushmaster would be cool. 
Daewoo
Colts 
FAL 308/7.62 
AR-10, prefer around 18""-20"" medium weight barrel.
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers. 
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal.
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models.
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one. 
Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know.  Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top, maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm or other 1-6x optics.

Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,

.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

486,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2955486,For Sale:  Eberlestock Phantom Sniper Rifle Pack + FREE SHIPPING,"Midvale, Salt Lake City, Utah",$ 280,"Listed On: Thursday, April 17, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new regular retail 389.00

The Eberlestock Phantom introduces a new type of tactical pack system; it's the first product that provides an integrated drag bag and backpack. It allows you to carry your heavy weapon in the backpack, either with or without the concealing top-cover. If the cover is not mounted, you can withdraw a full-scale sniper weapon from the pack very quickly. Or, with the cover over the weapon, nobody needs to know what you are carrying. And if you leave the Control Clips undone, you can still pull the gun right out. At left is shown the abrasion resistant DuPont Hypalon drag surface of the drag bag, and the re-configured pack. Note that the waistbelt can be removed, and the shoulder harness can be mounted to the bag so that the pack can be used as a conventional, non-scabbard pack.

The Eberlestock Phantom modular system lets you choose how much or how little of the system you need for your mission: The full set, just the Backscabbard, just the pack, or a drag bag.
The Phantom pack is a Gunslinger-sized pack in its main load bay, but offers a little more capacity because it is equipped with outboard hydration/radio pockets. It offers the ability to remove the bag and straps from the patented Backscabbard™, which can then be combined with the top-cover to make an excellent drag bag. The Phantom is a front-loader, with two levels of varying-sized tuck-pockets lining its interior, PALS racks inside and out, and a fold-down shelf that can be used to divide the main compartment into upper and lower chambers.

It will carry two 3-liter hydration kits, mounted in side pockets.

It features a longer waistbelt, with a 5 x 3 PALS matrix on each side.

The Phantom incorporates Eberlestock's unique approach to a variable-length gun case / drag bag, and allows you to carry a wide variety of tactical weapons. It will accommodate most light arms that military and police forces use. The top-cover incorporates a pull-out sleeve that goes over the butt of the rifle and the optics. It provides a good amount of overlap for keeping debris out of the gun compartment when dragging. The bag can fully enclose a weapon up to 60"" in length.

The pack includes a lightweight pull-out rain cover, which stows in a pocket on the bottom of the main compartment. It can be used to cover the whole pack and the weapon that's being carried, or just the pack -- so that you can pull your weapon from the Backscabbard."

From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

Got this in a trade and I have way too many calibers to stock. Trying to cut some of them down. I just shot this and it is accurate and so much fun to shoot. One of my favorites so far. But I could really use the cash for school. The gun is not the prettiest thing in the world, but man can it shoot!It will come with 17 magazines, black and OD furniture set, and 100+ rounds of ammo. So at least $200 alone in ammo and mags. Also comes with a leather sling and a couple other things stored in a tupperware box.Might entertain a trade+cash deal. I like military surplus items. I really could use the cash more than anything thoughAny questions, feel free to ask.

They opened in the late 1800s and closed in 1916 from what I read. The axe is stamped C.M.MCCLUNG KNOXVILLE TENN. It does not have date on it bu the store closed in 1916 so you could say its basically hundred years old or older. The handle is original and in pretty good shape. You can see it has some light ware on the head but I don't think its ever been sharpened other than when it was made. I seen one or two online asking $50, 75 just for the head, no handle. I'm not really sure what its worth its seems quite rare. It could be worth alot more.. so I figured $125.00 obo. If I didn't really need the money right now I wouldnt sell it so I can' do any trades on it.. if you have any questions feel free to ask... thanks keith"

969,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2955969,For Sale/Trade:  Wizard 50G2 Blasting Machine,"Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 300,"Listed On: Sunday, October 26, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a very accurate and reliable blasting machine which incorporate many safety features and a built-in continuity check - used in throughout the world and even military issued.  I have one that is new in the package.  Retail these go for close to $400.  I’m asking $300.  Will ship at buyers expense.  See trades below also.

Manufacturer Info:
The Wizard 50G2 mini-blasting machine is a capacitor discharge machine, the most reliable type of firing system available.  This mini-blaster generates and stores a large electrical charge and is supplied by a single 3-volt CR2 lithium battery.  This stored power is discharged to the firing system in a fraction of a second.  It has been field tested by firing over 50 electric blasting in series on a half mile of military communications wire.  The addition of the built in Demolition Safety Light (DSL), powered by a separate battery, to the Wizard 50G2 provides the assurance of a continuous circuit.  An optional clip-on shock tube adapter is also available.

The Wizard 50G2 is the smallest, most powerful and feature filled blasting machine in its price range.

Feature List: 

About the size of a deck of cards, the Wizard 50G2 fits in the palm of your hand and requires only one hand to operate.  The single 3-volt CR2 battery is in a separate compartment from the electronic components.  There is no shock hazard when changing the battery and uses stainless steel, Mil-Spec spring-loaded contacts.

Built in continuity LED red light has all the features of the Wizard DSL. The red LED indicates a complete circuit. 

Mil-Spec switches are waterproof to a depth of 3 feet - no worries of getting caught in the rain, dropping it into a puddle or crawling through a swamp!  You'll be ready for any environment.

Output of 300 VDC at 8 Joules - both the ""CHARGE"" and ""FIRE"" switches must be depressed to fire the blasting machine.
The ""CHARGE"" switch is held down until the ""READY"" light glows (less than five seconds). 
The yellow ""READY"" light can be seen in the brightest sunlight. 
The charging sequence can be stopped at any time by releasing the ""CHARGE"" button. As a safety precaution, the capacitor is instantly discharged and power is removed from the circuit upon release.

Voltage:  300
Capacity:  50 caps single series

The receiver has a full-length dust guard extending to the end of the slide and an area behind the trigger is relieved to allow a user to maintain a more substantial grip on the pistol. The Dieudonne Saive design also introduced a magazine safety mechanism similar to the one utilized on the Colt Vest Pocket pistol. Parts are not interchangeable between these pistols.[2] A loaded chamber indicator was also incorporated on the back of the slide. This model was marketed under the name ""Baby"" - and some of the original thermal hardened plastic grips were molded with both the initials ""FN"" at the top of the grip in a circle and the word ""BABY"" at the bottom of the grip under a raised crescent. This particular pistol was and continues to be known worldwide as the ""Baby Browning"" pistol and is the pistol reflected in the picture accompanying this article, excepting the BROWNING marked grip which indicates a more recent (circa 1960 and beyond) production run utilizing nylon impregnated polymer grips. The Baby Browning made its reputation during WWII when it became the pistol of choice of the French Resistance Movement. It was standard issue survival pack gear for US Air Force Pilots during the Vietnam War.

Ruger LCP - LNIB, box, manual, spent factory shell, etc. low round count on this LCP. Very good ratings on this gun but just doesn't fit my hand well at all. I fired approx 70 flawless rounds through this gun with FMJ and JHP. I purchased an extra mag and have ran both mags through it with no issues. LCP was 349.99 +tax (still have receipt). extra mag was 29.99 and Uncle Mike's pocket holster was $12. I have 131 rounds of .380 (108 Winchester white box, 18 CorBon, 5 Hornady Critical Defense). retail on ammo, no mark up is $95. That's over $500 in package deal.
