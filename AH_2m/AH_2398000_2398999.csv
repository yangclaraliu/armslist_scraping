Hogue Overmolded pistol grip and handguard with rail on one side (really nice).

Tapco 3E2Q7 Muzzle break (tac welded)

Absolutely 922r compliant so you don't have to worry about converting it. You can use imported mags. Comes with one Chinese mag.

The nickel is factory original, as it has a big N stamped on the frame below the grips.  I talked with S&W customer service which stated that there were guns that came from the factory this way, but without sending a letter in and waiting approximatley 3 months, there is no way to verify whether it is factory or not.  This gun also has adjustable sights installed like the Model 57, but I do not know whether this was factory or not.  Whoever did it, did a pretty good job if it is not factory.

I have a 1943 Izhevsk Mosin-Nagant with round receiver.  I have done some light sanding (no more) on the sides of the trigger and it now has a reasonably smooth 5-pound pull.  Being a proper 1943, it has the half-gusset on the front sling strap mount and no gusset on the rear (things were pretty tough in Russia in 1943 and they were whipping these out as rapidly as possible with no frills).  

The rifle comes with all of the kit that comes with Mosins (strap, pouches, bayonet, bottle, tool kit) - see picture.

It's a fun rifle, but I'm selling it because the recoil is a bit rough on my shoulder, and I'd like a round that powerful to group just a little better at 100 yards (it's pretty decent for a Mosin, though, at least when I'm not flinching from recoil).  

Packaged with the rifle are 200 rounds non-corrosive ammo.  One box is Wolf; the rest is Privi Partisan. 

$275 for the lot.    

Ohio residents (ID required), legally able to purchase, and a receipt is required.  Not interested in trades."

Comes with the gun, 3 20-round magazines, original box, and a really nice Blackhawk retention paddle holster, and some ammo. (not much, like 20-50 rounds)

I'm looking for a Remington 700 in .308 or a similar caliber. Must be bigger than 5.56 but smaller than 30-06. Depending on what accessories you have with it (quality of scope, bipod, bag, etc) will depend on how much cash I want along with the rifle. Unless you have a really really nice scope or something to go with it, or a lot of ammo, etc. I just looked at walmart and a regular Remington 700 30-06 with a scope (poor quality one I'm sure, but poor scope is better than no scope) was about $600. If you look on gunbroker a 5.7 is running about $1300-1400.

All of the cosmoline has been removed from the wood. Numbers on the barrel and receiver match but numbers on bolt have been scrubbed and I can't find any numbers on the stock. This is a Romanian issued Czech Mauser. From what I have read, ""Romanian vz. 24's saw action in Ukraine, Bessarabia, and Stalingrad in the hands of Romanian soldiers fighting for the Axis."" This rifle shoots great and comes with 165 rounds of Turkish surplus ammo on stripper clips. I live in Sugar Hill and work in Alpharetta.
