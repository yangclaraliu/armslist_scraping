Description from Condor:
The Condor Summit Soft Shell Jacket is designed with a three layer integrated shell fabric technology with reinforcement on the forearms. The breathable shell wicks moisture from the body, prevents water penetration, while maintaining body heat. Underarm vent zipper to control temp, and multiple pockets are provided for utility and storage. Also available in a lighter version, the Summit ZERO, for warmer climates.
This durable, waterproof, lightweight, breathable fabric contains billions of microscopic pores smaller than a raindrop, but hundred times larger than a molecule of water. The triple layer combination wicks moisture, stops water from passing through, and circulates body heat.

Both of these are individually listed as basic rifles, but you can save by buying them both FULLY LOADED, right here. Individual listings are $1,450 for the SR-556 and $1,225 for the Scout .308, both just the rifle only with no mods. BUY THEM TOGETHER HERE FOR ONLY $2,500---FULLY LOADED. These rifles are virtually brand new, and the accessoriesâ¦ well, you do the math and you'll spend well over $3,300.00. DESCRIPTIONS BELOW:

Ruger SR-556E, Piston Operated Rifle. I prefer the E model doesnât feel and look like a corncob on the front end with all of the Pic rails. The fore end is slender and more comfortable-- add pic rails only where needed. As outfitted, this rifle is short, extremely maneuverable, and the back up iron sighs are not strung out the entire length of the rifle-- They're for BACK UP, so they're tucked away until needed.. I've put 50 rounds down the bore, so other than that the gun is brand new. This is a PISTON operating system, not direct impingement. I shot DI rifles in the ARMY, and much prefer the piston rifle for adjustments and cleaning. This rifle includes the following:

-  one (1) 20 round magazine
-  one (1) 30 round magazine
-  Ruger soft carry case
-  Factory Ruger ghost ring back up iron sights
-  Bird cage flash hider (not shown in pictures)
-  VORTEX VIPER 1-4 x24, Lighted reticle, WARNE 30mm Quick Detach Rings. 
-  Fixed, Short MAGPUL MOE Stock
-  TROY aluminum Quick-Detach sling mount (located at castle nut, fore end of stock)
-  BLACKHAWK 1/2 inch high, 9 inch long detachable riser
-  MAGPUL combat charging handle latch


This second  rifle is a Ruger Gunsite SCOUT .308, Stainless model. Other than 100 rounds down the bore, this is a new gun in perfect condition. Factory rounds produced 3/4 inch groups at 100 yards, easily hits at  400 yards.

Rifle comes with the following:
- Original box
- One (1) 5 round magazine
- Three (3) 10 round magazines
- Ruger Quick Detach 1 inch rings
- Factory Ruger Ghost Ring iron sights

Both of these are individually listed, but you can save by buying them both here. Individual listings are $1,700 for the SR-556 and $1,325 for the Scout .308, fully equipped. BUY THEM TOGETHER HERE FOR ONLY $2,600. These rifles are virtually brand new, and the accessoriesâ¦ well, you do the math and you'll spend well over $3,300.00. DESCRIPTIONS BELOW:

Ruger SR-556E, Piston Operated Rifle. I prefer the E model doesnât feel and look like a corncob on the front end with all of the Pic rails. The fore end is slender and more comfortable-- add pic rails only where needed. As outfitted, this rifle is short, extremely maneuverable, and the back up iron sighs are not strung out the entire length of the rifle-- They're for BACK UP, so they're tucked away until needed.. I've put 50 rounds down the bore, so other than that the gun is brand new. This is a PISTON operating system, not direct impingement. I shot DI rifles in the ARMY, and much prefer the piston rifle for adjustments and cleaning. This rifle includes the following:

-  one (1) 20 round magazine
-  one (1) 30 round magazine
-  Ruger soft carry case
-  Factory Ruger ghost ring back up iron sights
-  Bird cage flash hider (not shown in pictures)
-  VORTEX VIPER 1-4 x24, Lighted reticle, WARNE 30mm Quick Detach Rings. 
-  Fixed, Short MAGPUL MOE Stock
-  TROY aluminum Quick-Detach sling mount (located at castle nut, fore end of stock)
-  BLACKHAWK 1/2 inch high, 9 inch long detachable riser
-  MAGPUL combat charging handle latch


This second  rifle is a Ruger Gunsite SCOUT .308, Stainless model. Other than 100 rounds down the bore, this is a new gun in perfect condition. Factory rounds produced 3/4 inch groups at 100 yards, easily hits at  400 yards.

Rifle comes with the following:
- Original box
- One (1) 5 round magazine
- One (2) 10 round magazines
- Ruger Quick Detach 1 inch rings
- Factory Ruger Ghost Ring iron sights
- Adjustable butt plates for lengthening stock.

It is assembled exactly how you see it, it's not in peices. I will throw in a stock AR grip and a selector with the set. Maybe even a barrel nut. 

What you buy, has Rock River Arms lower parts kit, DSG Arms buffer kit and buffer/spring, forged charging handle, and of course forward assist and dust cover. This set was set up as a complete rifle, and saw two magazines if fire, and is clean in near perfect shape finish wise. Only marks are where the barrel nut was twisted on and off. 

RA is an excellent company, and their products the same. The receivers are actually made by Mega. You can ask them and they will confirm this, they just like to brand some products. If you have any questions, more pictures, just let me know.

I dont like using the word rare but this one is VERY unique, officials from Norinco and the Peoples Republic of the Chinese military came over during the start of the ban to hurridly make their AK's caught in customs legal at the time, this one had the bayonet lug taken off was about it, has the threaded muzzle w/ removeable nut or slant brake, it is marked MAK90 however was imported by GLNIC in LA, CA and the receiver doesn't have any other markings or 56s-1 etched or or ground down, not the usual 93 or 94  Mak90 serial # they almost all had (this ser# is very close to my pre-ban 56S AK) has the older style blued bolt carrier too, all serial numbered parts match, the receiver has the original and appropriate milled cuts for the Underfolder. This undefolder receiver missed the neutering most Mak 90s experienced in customs, which recieved the thumbhole stock format later on. The underfolding stock is correct for this Mak 90 & the receiver. It has the Triangle 66 factory mark stamped next to the Ser#, I've almost never seen a MAK-90 that had that stamp, again very unique as it was originally all pre-ban. Wood is minty. The action is perfect, the barrel is excellent and it functions flawlessly. The receiver has maintained its original bluing and is 1.5mm thick as opposed to the 1mm standard AK's. The trigger is original, and this AK has all the correct Chinese made features. Comes with chinese canvas sling, one 30rd magazine, cleaning rod and manual, no box. Price is FIRM, cash only and NO trades, this is a great Chinese AK that will make a great shooter, home defense and/or collectible that will increase over time in value like all the Chinese AK's have since they quit coming into the country in early 1990's. Has been fired but not much, bolt, bore and piston ar shiney. Private sale, you need to be 21 and az resident and were good.(You can also text me at 480 840 55 Four One)."

This Russian Saiga 7.62x39 AK-47 is just as good for much less money!

All original Russian AK-47 from the famous Izhmash factory has been converted to the same high standards as the Arsenal Factory rifles. Hammer forged chrome-lined barrel. No ugly plastic plugs, holes, or rivets on the receiver where there shouldn't be.  Eight U.S. parts to be more than Compliant. Traditional 14x1 LH thread with AK-74 style muzzle-brake (which really works to reduce felt recoil!). Traditional cleaning rod and holder installed. This is no half-ass Century Build or typical DIY Saiga conversion. All the attention has been paid to the details. See the pics and judge for yourself.

This rifle performs wonderfully. It patterns well at 100 yards, hits where you expect out to 300, and of course always cycles -never jams.

Less than 500 rounds of non-corrosive ammo down the barrel. Comes in original box with all paperwork and accessories.

If you've been looking for an authentic quality Russian AK-47 you know what they go for. You won't find a nicer AKM for cheaper anywhere but feel free to make reasonable cash offers. Only trade I might entertain at this time (plus cash) is an oddball 9mm revolver and I don't really even need that.

Please include your phone number because this is a face to face sale only, no shipping. If you are reading this, the AK is still available. Ad will be pulled immediately upon sale so no need to ask.

Thank you for your interest.  I am in Bisbee but often travel to Tucson on business.  Feel free to contact me."

Nice condition. It's no safe queen, but the action is smooth, the bore is shiny, and the forcing cone has no evidence of cracks. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say this girl rode around in a duty holster most of her life and was hardly ever fired.

821,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2718821,For Trade:  MARSHALL JVM210-C,"maynardville, Knoxville, Tennessee",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, February 20, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"In a nutshell, the Marshall all-valve, 2-channel JVM210C combo is a 2-channel version of the most versatile Marshall amplifier ever made, the JVM410C. It also boasts more gain than any other Marshall to dateâand that's really saying something.

Each of its 2 channels are completely independent of each other, and they boast 3 Modes, all 6 of which are footswitchable and feature their own unique gain structure. It makes the JVM 2-channel effectively 6 Marshalls in one.

The JVM210C has studio-quality digital reverb with a level control for each channel. This is also footswitchable, as are the amp's 2 Master Volume controls and the Series/Parallel effects loop. Resonance and Presence are equipped with master controls.

An ingenious footswitch (UK patent pending) and the fact that all the amp's switching (channel/modes, Reverb, Master Volume selection, FX loop) can be done via MIDI and you're looking at an incredibly flexible amp. The 4-way footswitch boasts LEDs and memory, plus it connects to the amp via a regular guitar cable.

From the cleanest clean to the filthiest distortion ever found in a Marshall and all points in-between, the JVM210C all-valve combo will give you whatever tone you need right when you need it."

Increase in federal excise tax on handguns (both pistols and revolvers) from 11% to 20%
Increase in federal excise tax on ammunition from 11% to 50%
Increase in NFA tax (pre-â86 autos, SBRs, suppressors, etc.) from $200 to $500
Increase in NFA AOW tax from $5 to $100
Increase in special (occupational) tax for importers, manufacturers, and dealers

This rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a black synthetic stock and forearm, an 18.50 inch stainless steel barrel with six grooves and a 1:16 inch right hand rifle twist. Clear matte finish. Adjustable rear sight and gold bead front sight. Ten round rotary magazine included. Weighs 4.67 pounds and is 37 inches long when assembled with each half being less than 20.25 inches when disassembled.
