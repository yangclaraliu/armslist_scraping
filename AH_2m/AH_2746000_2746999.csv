Comes with original box, cleaning rod/brush, soft case, and two mags. Ive included information on the gun below. Price is 500, or trade for??

Smith & Wesson announced their .22 caliber pocket auto pistol late in 1968, but the gun wasn’t actually available for sale until May of 1970.  It was called the Model 61 “Escort.”  Donald Simmons says it was called the “Escort” because it was designed for women.  Other writers say it was intended as a backup gun for law enforcement.

The Model 61
The original version of the Escort had a die-cast aluminum frame and no magazine safety, which was touted as a “feature” that allowed hand feeding of cartridges if the magazine were lost.  The Model 61 was available for two months--March and April of 1970--with serial numbers ranging from B1001 through B7800, making a total production of 6800.

The Model 61-1
Smith & Wesson must have almost immediately had second thoughts about no magazine safety, because in May of 1970 they introduced the Model 61-1 with a very effective magazine safety that blocks the hammer when the magazine is removed.  Owners could send their Model 61 back to the factory to have it retrofitted with the magazine safety, though I doubt that very many did.  Guns with the magazine safety added were marked 61-1 on the base of the grip.  (I’d be curious to hear from owners of Model 61-1 pistols with serial numbers in the range of the Model 61.*)  Serial numbers of production Model 61-1 pistols range from B7801 through B9850.  A group of presentation pistols was made with serial numbers from B1 through B500.  Total production of the Model 61-1, excluding retrofitted Model 61’s, was 2550, making it the most collectable of the Escort pistols.

The Model 61-2 
In September of 1970 a barrel bushing (or barrel nut) was added to the end of the barrel to more precisely position it in the frame.  Previous barrels had been press- fitted into the frame and could not be removed.  Simmons implies that the 61-2 and later barrels were removable, but I have been unable to verify this.  Serial numbers for the Model 61-2 ran from B9851 to B40000, with a total of 30150 being manufactured.

The Model 61-3
In July of 1971 Smith & Wesson began making Escort frames from forged machined aluminum instead of die-cast aluminum, and guns with the new frame were designated the Model 61-3.  The disconnector was also changed, from a two piece design with an L-shaped lever and a pivot pin that was pressed into it, to a one-piece design in which the lever and pin were riveted together; and the distance between the front of the breech block and the back of the barrel was reduced slightly.  These changes were prompted by endurance and proof testing performed by the H.P. White Laboratory in February of 1971, in the course of which two Model 61-2’s were essentially destroyed by firing over-pressure proof loads in them.  One of the guns had a non-functional disconnector before the testing began.  The original one-piece steel frame design of the Bayard had been weakened by the use of die-cast aluminum and the addition of a side-plate.  Of course, no one had ever blown one up before because the older guns were perfectly safe with normal ammunition, but Smith & Wesson took steps to allay any fears regarding the safety of the Escort by strengthening the frame.  According to Simmons, Model 61-3 serial numbers ran from B40001 to B65438, with a total production for the model of  25,438.  Production ended in March of 1973, but guns continued to be assembled from existing parts until March of 1974.  I have documented a Model 61-3 with serial number B17768--this gun was originally a 61-2 that was recalled and when it came back from Smith & Wesson it had been updated to a 61-3 but retained its original serial number.  Another 61-3 has been reported to me with serial number B31802.

Total production of all Escort variants was 64,938.  The vast majority were blued, but approximately 6600 were nickel plated.  The guns were marked SMITH & WESSON on the left side of the slide and 22 LONG RIFLE CTG on the right.  On the left side of the frame is the inscription:

Up for sale is a brand new never fired Sig Sauer 716 in cerakoted FDE from the factory.  I ordered this gun during the buying craze and it just finally arrived recently.  I’m simply looking to get back what I paid for the package as I have other firearms I was able to purchase.  MSRP on the rifle alone is $2,252.  This has the ambi-mag release & ambi-sling mount.  All items for sale are factory new in the box/packaging.  These items have been stored in my gun safe upstairs in a temperature controlled dry environment.  I have extra Magpul Pmags (10 round, 20 round & 25 round) available for this if you are interested, all brand new in package.

I DO NOT/WILL NOT trade anything for this package, I am looking to get the money I paid back, that’s it.  If you have any questions, need more pictures, or are interested in buying this package, contact Jason REDACTED or email me REDACTED.  I work evenings so I likely won’t respond until after noon.  Text or calling will provide the quickest response.    

Sig has changed the configuration this gun comes with to a Sig stock & grip which aren’t nearly as nice as the Magpul furniture this firearm has.  I will only ship/sell this package where legal and it must go through an FFL.  Thanks for your interest & God Bless!

1. M1 Garand (.30-06). Manufactured by Springfield Armory Inc.  It is in near mint condition with a new barrel, re-parkerized, its extremely accurate. 

 This rifle was not made by the Springfield Armory that made the ww2 wartime m1 garands but actually made by Springfield Armory Inc. the modern company that makes the the M1A/M14. The receiver is either a SAI post war production or possibly a wartime receiver that was remarked by SAI. It looks like some of the parts were newly made by SAI and some are USGI. Theres very limited info on these guns and I have tried contacting SAI for further info/history. Performs flawlessly and smoothly.
-6 8-round clips 
-GI sling
-50+ rounds of ammo. (20 of which are Winchester 180gr Supreme Elite XP3 about a $50 value) the others are Remington core-lokts and some Hornadys.

2.""The H&R Handi-Rifle, made to AAC specifications and chambered in 300 AAC BLACKOUT, is a 30 caliber rifle in a very compact and lightweight package with such minimal recoil that anyone can comfortably shoot it. This durable, optics ready break action single shot rifle is ideal for the beginner and great fun for the experienced shooter. The barrel is a low profile lightweight 16.1” barrel threaded 5/8-24TPI with a 5R 1:7"" twist. The rifle accurately sends rounds down range whether feeding it heavy subsonic or high performance hunting ammunition. The phosphate steel action and barrel are complimented by the compact, lightweight super tough glass polymer filled black stock. All models are equipped with the H&R transfer bar system that makes the Handi-Rifle one the safest single shot platforms available today.""

Initial production began in 1936, and due to low rate of production the pistol had been slightly redesigned in 1938, to simplify manufacture. New model had been designated as Mle.1935S, while original model became Mle. 1935A. Most noticeable change was in the shape of the backstrap and in the lenght of the frame, and in the fact that in Mle. 1935S muzzle protruded from the slide, while in Mle. 1935A muzzle was flush with the slide. Mle. 1935 was official French sidearm until 1950. It was a good pistol, with main drawback being somewhat weak ammunition of 7.65mm caliber. Mle. 1935A was quite an elegant weapon, while Mle. 1935S had much more simplified look. The Mle.1935 had been manufactured by MAC, MAS, SAGEM and SACM factories.
Technically, the Mle.1935 is a further development of the Colt-Browning M1911 pistol. Mle. 1935 uses same locked breech, swinging link operated locking with single locking lug on the top of the barrel (in the Mle. 1935S the locking lug was formed on the slide, and on the top of the barrel there was a recess). The hammer and lockwork was designed as a single assembly, removable for cleaning maintenanse (first originated in Soviet TT pistol of 1930). This unit contained hammer, sear and mains spring. The slide mounted safety locked the firing pin when engaged. Sights were fixed and magazine single stack, holding 8 rounds."

Shop more Glock products  This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

Technical Information: •Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity.
•If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load. 

NOTE: All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols.

You are getting an ALL MATCHING NUMBERS rifle, newly built in Kentucky, by Meridian Ordnance LLC (a licensed 07 FFL 02 SOT manufacturer). Even the bakelite hand-guard has a matching serial. The receiver is the superb CNC Warrior model which is a very good match to the original pattern, including the correct flared lightening cuts which are often incorrectly reproduced with a ball end mill by some other manufactures. The barrel is chrome lined and parkerized under the Moly Resin semi gloss black finish which is a great match for the original finish. This is a beautiful rifle. Original furniture and cleaning rod included.

We accept credit and debit cards plus 3%. Price does not include sales tax for KY residents or shipping to your dealer. Local pickup requires 4473 background check.

Late in 2013, I made the decision to change the colors of my personal guns.  After much research and after mastering the whole process and seeing the final product, I was surprised and excited at how beautiful Cerakote coatings were.  So, I decided to share this gift with the world.
Cerakote is a wonderful product that gives everyone the ability to affect a color change as well as protection to your firearm and coated accessories.  There are an incredible amount of colors to choose from.  Although Brodz FireArms Coatings is not a large company, we are a family business located in Berks County, Pennsylvania.   Because we are such a small company, I am able to dedicate myself to producing the highest quality products without worrying about the high costs of maintaining a large company.
My prices are competitive and in many cases well below current market value. My family’s reputation is on the line, so all the work is performed with the same care and love as if the job were for my own property. I do not skimp on prep work or finishing.  I use the best quality products on the market.
I want my customers to be happy and satisfied with my work.  If you want a quick turnaround, but also want a quality product at a reasonable price, I am the choice for you.

Simmons Whitetail Classic :

The Whitetail Classic offers the brightest viewing in the poorest light by utilizing advanced optics and special lens coatings - all adding up to the famous 30 Minute Advantage.

What is the 30 Minute Advantage?
 Brighter viewing in the poorest light for an average of 30 minutes longer than a conventional single coated scope. A leading shooting magazine took a Whitetail and an ordinary scope and mounted them on tripods side by side. They observed a 2"" square target at 100 yards. As the evening light faded the test began. At the point when the target was no longer visible with the ordinary scope the stopwatch was started and it was stopped when the target could no longer be seen through the Whitetail. The result- 30 minutes of extra shooting time.

How does it work?
An advanced formula of lens coatings called SC5 is applied to all lens to air surfaces a multiple number of times. This maximises the light transmission. In tests these ""Nightview Optics"" transmit over 90% of the light entering the front objective lens. This is 12% more than even standard high quality 40mm multi-coated lenses. 

The scopes are finished with a unique anti-reflective Black-Granite™ finish that reduces body tube reflection by over 80%, a matte finish reduces reflection by only 60%. A scope mounted lamp or sunlight can reflect from the scope body tube creating a distraction bright shine in your non-airing eye and can also alert game as to your presence. The Black-Granite™ virtually eliminates light reflection for clarity enhanced accurate shooting."

The Glock 23 has a professionally polished barrel. The Glock 27 has pearce extended mag plates. Both Glock’s have white color fill on the engravings (easily removed if not wanted).There are a few upgrade options I can sell with these as well. 

Glock 23 Gen4: It will come with installed night sights (stock included), polished barrel, stainless steel guide rod (SSGR), and everything stock as from the factory (3-13rd magazines, speed loader, rod with brush, lock, and all paperwork). As you know the Glock 23 Gen4 is on sale right now for $539.99, add $79.99 for night sights, and $59.99 for the SSGR. You’re out the door price for this would be $730.96 (Not including the $100 it cost me to have the barrel polished) so that’s not factored.  Price for my 23 Gen4 is $550 CASH ONLY.

Glock 27 Gen4: It will come with installed night sights (stock included), Uncle Mikes pocket holster, and everything stock as from the factory (3-9rd magazines with 2 of them having Pearce extenders, rod with brush, lock, and all paperwork). As you know the Glock 27 Gen4 is on sale right now for $569.99, add $79.99 for night sights, $13 for the Uncle Mikes, and $19.98 for the mag extenders. You’re out the door price for this would be $734.18. Price for my 27 Gen4 is $550 CASH ONLY.

Extras I have that are compatible with both: Zev Technologies Titanium 4 pin kit that accommodates using a back strap or not ($35), extended take down lever ($10), extended slide catch ($30), and an aluminum extended magazine release ($35). As you see there is $110 in extras here. I will include all upgrades listed here for $35! (This package would best fit the 23 as it already has the matching polished barrel and stainless guide rod but looks great on the 27 as well)

If you buy either the 23 Gen4 or the 27 Gen4, with the upgrades, I will also include a box of XM40HP ammo ($30 value).

You may ask, why are you trying to sell this stuff for well under what’s it’s worth/what you have into it? My answer is simple, I just bought a GT 5.0 and I need to upgrade it ;) so parting with a firearm is what I have to do!

The pics are only the 23 as I just decided to offer up to 27 as well but you know what a 27 looks like lol and being that both of these are brand spanking new with receipts to show, you get the idea. The two bottom pics are with the upgrades installed minus the extended mag release and the SSGR.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

She will put shot after shot downrange without significant change in point of impact from heat.  The stock is beautiful laminated wood with a light oak finish, and sports a 4 round blind-box magazine. The cutting edge technology of the AccuTrigger makes this rifle a dream to shoot.  It is adjustable down to a crisp 1.5 pounds, and it allows the shooter to do his job with ease. 

This fine rifle comes equipped with a Leupold VX-3 scope, 6.5 - 20 power, with a 30 mm tube and the fantastic Varmint Hunter Reticle.   The scope also features a side focus knob that allows the shooter to easily focus and eliminate paralax from the shooting equation. I have been able to consistently use the holdover and windage tools in this scope to decimate prairie dogs at 500 yards and beyond, even with strong cross winds. The scope is securely mounted on premium Leupold bases and rings, and the entire rig is silver that nicely matches the stainless steel action and barrel.

With muzzle velocity of 4,200 feet per second form the 204 Ruger cartridge, the varmint's life expectancy is measured in nanoseconds.  Recoil is almost non existent, so you can easily watch the impact through the scope.  The immediate impact of the round on target upon lightly pressing the trigger is the definition of instant gratification!  

Even at discounted prices, the price of this rig purchased new today would run close to $2,000.  Get this beauty today at a bargain price!"

*There have been two model number designations for this firearm, the 4410 (no longer produced) and the 4510 (current). Both model numbers are essentially the same revolver, and any 4410 or 4510 will yield basically the same performance. 

*It got its name ""The Judge"" in 2006 when Bob Morrison, Executive Vice President, learned that judges in high-crime areas of Miami, Florida were purchasing the revolver for personal defense in their courtrooms, and after Morrison investigated further, the model designation was changed from 4410 to 4510 to more accurately reflect the revolver's versatility (.45 Colt + 410 shot ? ""4510""). Taurus International reports that the Judge is their top-selling firearm. 

*Though Taurus deliberately designed The Judge to fire shotshells, the Judge does not qualify as a ""short-barreled shotgun"" under the National Firearms Act of 1934 as its rifled barrel makes it a regular handgun. However, the Judge is considered a short-barreled shotgun under California state law, which has a broader definition of ""short-barreled shotgun,"" and the Judge is thus illegal to possess in that state.

 Extended Ejector Rod For positive extraction of fired cases. 

 Ribber Grip 
 Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.

 Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
 Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key.
 When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged.
 As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). 
To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise.
 This engages the Security System.
 The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. 
To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. 
This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 

 Transfer Bar
 The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

 Light gathering tubes are inserted into the sight to offer the shooter the highly visible dot created by the end of the fiber optic
