75,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2491075,For Sale:  Stevens Vest Pocket Pistol .22 rimfire (Civil War Era derringer),"Wake Forest, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 3,995","Listed On: Tuesday, May 27, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Stevens Vest Pocket Pistol .22 Cal. (short)  (Early model Approx 150 yrs old.) 
Heritage Firearm from my great grandfather. 
You wont see another one of these..!!!
Only 200 made in .22 caliber
Couldn't find any sold in auction or anywhere else in .22 Cal.
Truly a once in a lifetime find.

Still fully functional and fires!!!!

Single shot tip up model. Also called the ""Fishtail""
First series of pistols made by Stevens arms who were taken over by Savage arms in 1920.

The frame and barrel are shiny with no traces of original blue on the sides of the barrel flats at the breech or even under the grips. (Not sure it was ever blued)

There is only a few pit marks and a few scratches in the metal on each side but very
minor.
The take down lock still engages solidly and hammer and spring engage fully.
The barrel looks to be smooth bore and has a few marks inside but no deep rust or pitting. It is stamped ""Stevens & Co. Vest Pocket Pistol Chicopee Falls Mass.""

The take-down, along with the grip screws are in beautiful shape and not knurled.
The serial number is 178 and matches on both frame (under grip) and on bottom of barrel that is covered by frame when closed.  So it was the 178th made out of 1000
units.

The cross hatching texture on top of hammer is still intact and can be felt with finger.

The grips are in great shape and not cracked and have slight handling marks as expected.


Gun Trader write up as follows:
This is a single shot pocket pistol chambered for the .22 and .30 rimfire Cartridges.
The .22 cal. version is rarely encountered and would be worth approximately 25% more than the values illustrated It has a 2.75"" part octagonal barrel that pivots upward for loading. It has an external hammer and spur type trigger. The frame is nickel plated or blued, with a blued barrel. The odd shaped flared grips are made of rosewood. The first models were marked ""Vest Pocket Pistol"" only. Later models have the barrels marked ""J. Stevens and Co. Chicopee Falls Mass.""  There were approximately 1,000 made between  1864 and 1876

I put the condition between very good, to excellent, and from the pictures I have seen of the .30 cal ones sold this one is much cleaner.

Values:
Excellent                  V.G.                Good                 Fair               Poor
$4600                     3200               2100                 1200             950

Auction write-up:
Also called the ""Kickup Model"" pistol, manufactured between 1864 and 1876 with approximately 1,000 made. The pistol is marked ""STEVENS & CO. VEST. POCKET. PISTOL/CHICOPEE FALLS MASS."" on the top barrel flat, and features a German silver blade front sight, a notch in the hammer spur services as the rear sight, a tip up barrel and smooth odd shaped flared rosewood grips. The matching serial number is marked on frame under the grip and on the left side barrel flat, with the left grip panel hand numbered to gun.

I am posting this to serious collectors and buyers only..
I will not give this away period...!

I may send it to a Stevens expert and use his evaluation paper to get more out of it.

I figured a price of very good (3200) plus 25% (800) as it is a rare .22
which would be $4000

I even have a box of .22 shorts for it.. Although I would not fire it..!!!
My Dad let me shoot three rounds out of it when I was about 12 yrs old and I bugged the mess out of him to shoot it.. He said ""this one time and don't ask again""
I have had it for years in my care and still haven't shot it since I was a kid.
But I know it will fire

If I send it off and have it appraised I will ask more for it.

Thanks for looking I have many more pictures at your request
I will also answer any questions I can about it.
Cash only... I can ship it without paperwork/permit due to age.

Beautiful piece of history family heirloom and I simply wont just give it away..!
nine one nine- 819- two nine two two.

Incudes all parts and some extras. Was recently sent to Oehler to get it checked up and had a new battery installed. Comes with a $100 pelican style case.
 The Model 43 Personal Ballistics Laboratory is the ultimate instrument for the individual shooter. Used on your own shooting bench, it gives you more test power than is available at all but the most sophisticated industrial and government laboratories. As Rick Jamison says ""You can learn more about real-world ballistics in a week with this unit than you could in years of studying books.""

The only test data most of us see is muzzle velocity. Chamber pressure in the gun and downrange performance of the bullet is determined by a strange mix of folklore and computer programs. Unfortunately, most computer programs can only give old guesses displayed on the screen of a new computer. The Model 43 does much more; it actually measures pressure and measures downrange performance instead of guessing.

The Model 43 measures it all-

Muzzle Velocity · Proof Velocity · Peak Pressure · Pressure Rise Time · Pressure Curve · Area Under Curve · Time of Flight · Velocity at Target · Ballistic Coefficient · Group at Target Accurate Ballistics

PRESSURE READINGS

The Model 43 measures chamber pressure using a small strain gage glued over the chamber area of your gun. You need not drill any holes in the barrel, but bluing will likely be marred. Measuring the inside and outside diameters at the gage location provides a realistic pressure scale for the readings. You can reliably compare the pressure generated by your handloads with the pressures generated by factory ammunition fired in your gun. You can reliably compare the pressures from different handloads in the same gun. You can measure the pressures generated by wildcats where there are no standards or factory ammo available for comparison.

The Model 43 is not intended to measure SAAMI pressures. The Oehler Model 83 is made for SAAMI applications.

VELOCITY READINGS
The Model 43 measures several velocity readings on each shot. You can measure both muzzle and downrange velocities, and you have two PROOF CHANNELS to go along with the primary readings. You can even use the system to measure the muzzle velocities of machine guns. It can catch the muzzle velocity and rate of fire for each shot of a 30-round burst.

ACOUSTIC TARGET
If your bullets are supersonic at the target, you can use the optional acoustic target. Special microphones record the bullet's passage and the system displays the exact hit location, time-of-flight, ballistic coefficient, and the velocity at the target. The large window of the acoustic target makes it easy to measure actual ballistic coefficients over long ranges. 	
M43 Downrange Amplifier

M43 Microphone for Acoustic Target

 You can still get warranty service and parts.

REQUIRED COMPUTER FOR WINDOWS M-43 SOFTWARE
. The computer must have a 9-pin serial port. If you must use a “dongle” to convert from USB port to 9-pin port, we suggest the unit by IO Gear.

TEST RESULTS

The sample output page shows the complete test results and documentation provided by the Model 43. Complete test conditions are shown in the left column of the upper block. Complete gun information is shown in the center column. Complete load information is shown in the right column. All the individual results (velocities, time-of-flight to target, ballistic coefficient, pressure data and pressure curve) are shown for each shot. A summary block includes the statistical summary of each parameter for the whole group, and a target plot shows the actual group as recorded by the acoustic target.

The summary is followed by a condensed ballistic table computed with the measured muzzle velocity and the measured ballistic coefficient. What more could you ask?"

Entire Rig Includes:

Springfield M1A Standard Rifle in Walnut Stock

Springfield Generation II Scope Mount

High Grade 30MM Scope Rings

AIM Scope 10x40x56 with Sunshade & Caps

Mounted and Balanced Anti-Cant Device

Custom Convertible Leather Cheek Riser

Springfield Factory Box and all Documents

Value is $3,000, in exchange for cash, gold, silver or military and/or commercial vintage collectible firearms in a condition to be proud of. Leather cheek riser attaches / detaches from leather saddle with snaps to quickly switch from telescopic to iron sights. Current set-up will make a target at 1,000 yards appear to be just 25 yards away. Again, all items are new, unused, and I have packaging and paperwork for most all items.

WWI & WWII service rifles and sidearms are of particular interest, but I like most fine examples of appreciable vintage firearms. Willing to travel an hour or so from the Louisville, KY area (I'm an Indiana resident near Louisville) for the right deal. Thanks."

The Winchester Model 47 is in very good condition however someone applied a coat of gloss urethane and attached a brass plaque engraved with the name ""Chris"". This would have been a popular thing to do for a youth competing in target matches in the 50's. Would be great for a youth training/target gun, especially if his/her name is Chris. :) They are somewhat rare. Book value is around $450. I would accept $300.

The Mossberg 151K with Mossberg 4x scope is in very good condition as well. I would gladly keep it if not for wanting to finalize another deal. No collector value with this one really, but a good solid vintage rig with one owner since new in 1952. The stock appears to have been refinished on this one too, but in a satin sheen. The scope has about equal value as the gun. Great shooter. $250

Lower production numbers allowed for more care during the builds and better quality control. Not to mention the lack of the Schwartz safety aka Series II. Its a little hard to sell, but I don't shoot much anymore and I'm not much of a collector either. Lets find a good safe for this one.

The pistol is in excellent condition. I rate it at 95+ No discernible play at the hood or muzzle. Slide to frame fit is just right; snug, not too tight. Finger tight barrel bushing and shortened solid full length guide rod make for easy and tool free field striping. The rifling is crisp and the bore is mirror bright. It cycles smooth and is very accurate. It has been well cared for and seen very little use.

This is a little Iver Johnson revolver in .32 Smith and Wesson. It is in time and can be fired. The bore is somewhat worn but not corroded or pitted. The only problem is with the extractor, which needs to be jimmied a bit during reloading. That's not uncommon with these little old pistols.

The nickel finish is worn. The left grip has a chip out of the bottom, but is otherwise sound. 

Remember that this little revolver was designed to work with blackpowder cartridges. Modern loads should not be fired from it: it's strictly a handloader's affair (many use a cast round ball or pellet of 00 Buck over 1 gr. of Unique or Bullseye). In any even, you should have this piece checked by a competent gunsmith before firing.

I am not a dealer, but I do have a C&R license and will have to get your DL number for my bound book.

The revolver is already priced to sell. I'd rather keep it than to lower the price further. It's worth this much just for the parts!"

A little background on the Bulgarian SLR-95:

The SLR-95(s) is/are 100% made in Bulgaria, has Steyr cold hammer forged barrels, and factory hot dipped hammer forge receivers. No longer being imported. The Bulgarian SLR-95s were imported back in the mid-90′s for just a few years. There are not too many of them in the U.S. The Bulgarian Arsenal SLR-95 is one of the best AK-47s in the world.

No other .22 LR pistol provides the feel of the classic 1911 pistol with the proven reliability and value of the Ruger Mark III pistols. The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice, providing shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 .45 caliber pistol. The 22/45's internal cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs. A magazine disconnect, a manual safety, and an unobtrusive internal locking device all combine to prevent costly accidents when the gun is not in use, while Ruger's patented loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication that the chamber is loaded.

This is the lightweight Scandium framed revolver with Titanium cylinder, 4 inch barrel and red fiber optic front sight.  I purchased this gun new from Kames in Canton maybe a year ago, and it has been sitting in my safe unfired since then.  It was one of those ""impulse buys"" that I'm sure every gun owner is familiar with.  It's a beautiful looking revolver that stood out among a case full of stainless guns.  Unfortunately I have no real need for a lightweight .44 mag revolver and no time to enjoy it even if I did.  There is no point in leaving it sit in my safe untouched, so here is your chance to buy a new revolver at a discount.

As mentioned, the gun is brand new and has never been fired outside the factory.  That being said, there are some minor imperfections on the revolver from being handled in the store.  I'm pretty picky and the blemishes are minor, but I will describe them anyway for the sake of complete disclosure.  This gun was in the display case so it does have some light handling marks.  There is a visible turn line on the cylinder.  There is also a small scratch on the cylinder that I'm guessing was caused when the gun was being taken in and out of the display case.  There are also a few very light marks on the barrel of the revolver.  These are not deep scratches, just light marks.  There is also some powder residue left over from the test firing done at the factory.  Apparently S&W doesn't bother to clean the guns after testing.  Other than that, the revolver is perfect.  The wood grips are in perfect condition as well.  I bought the gun even with the blemishes because it was the only one they had left.  All minor imperfections are shown clearly in the pictures I have uploaded to Photobucket.  I have many high-res pics uploaded to Photobucket.  Just ask for the link and I will email it.

Everything that came with the gun when I purchased it is included in this sale.  That means the revolver itself, both the wood grips (installed) and rubber grips (never installed), blue plastic case, gun lock, keys, casing from the test round and all paperwork.

Must be over the age of 21 and legally able to purchase a firearm in the state of Ohio.  I will need to see a valid Ohio drivers license at time of sale.  CCW holders are preferred and will get first priority to buy, but a CCW is not a necessity.  Please email with any questions.  Asking price is $900 and this is a cash only sale.  I am not interested in any trades at this time.  I live in Canal Fulton, 44614.  Thanks for looking."

Pistol cartridge lever-actions have had attention of the American public since the days of the Old West when having a rifle and pistol that shoot the same caliber just made sense.

There are numerous variations-rifles, carbines, standard loop, oversized loop-including Rossi's Model '92 hybrid-the Ranch Hand. The Ranch Hand is available in three popular pistol rounds- .38 Spl./.357 Mag., .44 Mag. and .45 Colt.

The Ranch Hand's 12-inch barrel complies with federal regulations, and features a gold-bead front sight with an adjustable buckhorn rear sight and an oversized loop lever.

Selling a Diamondback Firearms 380 (DB380) a perfect concealed carry weapon for men or women! This gun is super small and shoots great! It comes with several accessories all of which are used but in like-new condition starting with a ""Flashbang"" Holster designed for women to be able to carry concealed under a snug casual shirt email me for more pictures. Next we've got a Small Inside the Pants Holster by ""Uncle Mikes"" it is great for concealed carry and with most clothing so overall a great holster. Also comes with Snap Caps designed to be used with all .380 caliber handguns this is a great training tool to use to learn how to properly handle this handgun when a need to defend yourself arises. Snap caps do not make a snap or any extra noise over the sound of the gun dry firing but prevents the damage that dry firing can cause over time, so it really is a great extra. The .380 also comes with the original box when I purchased it last year as well as the paperwork, and the trigger lock.

The .380 has 167 rounds fired through it, i've had the Feed Ramp polished to help against misfeeds. I have 20 Rounds of 90Gr Federal Premium Self Defense Hydra-Shock JHP's (Full Box) and 33 rounds of 95Gr Lawmen TMJ (2/3rd Box)

The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. This one has a Nitron® Finish.  The RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile hogue grips.  These 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2491729,For Trade:  1959 Fender Bassman RI for your...,"Summerville, Charleston, South Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, December 26, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking to trade this amazing guitar/bass amplifier for something fun.  Open to trades but please be realistic.  This crank-and-play amp retails for $1,499.00.  (Yes, I do know that mine is used and I do not expect full retail)
Description:  The straightforward Fender 59 Bassman outperforms most of the fancy amps on the market today. In the 1950s, the Bassman was perfect for amplifying that new invention, the Fender Precision Bass. This 50W rig allowed the bass to hold its own onstage with drums, electric guitars, and miked piano, the common instrumentation of the day. Over the years, it also won the hearts of guitarists who, after experimenting with all kinds of preamps and effects racks, found its simplicity, great tone, excellent dispersion, and touch-sensitive dynamics a true pleasure. This reissue is true to the original while adding several enhancements: U.S.-made GT-6L6 output tubes, improved 12AX7 preamp tubes, and an internal bias pot, making it easier to experiment with other output tubes. It also features a genuine lacquered tweed covering, solid finger-jointed pine cabinet, and an original-spec 4AR4 rectifier tube for natural compression when you play hard. Includes fitted cover."

The patented Magpul ACS (Adaptable Carbine/Storage) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes.

Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21 Gen4 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with 13 round magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design on the G21 Gen4 lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology.

I had it covered with a grip decal. You can hardly notice it and would not be visible at all if you got her stipled.

With it’s newest package, the Springfield XD(M) 3.8 Compact –named for its 3.8-inch barrel, scaled own from the XD(M) 4.5–now comes with a Mag X-Tension, a high-cap magazine (we’re sure you got that from the name) that allows this one gun to go from a compact 9+1 to more of a 13+1 pseudo full-size option.

Thanks to the Mag X-Tension, you’ve got a short-barreled gun with a full-size grip. The interchangeable backstraps in three different sizes that are included with the XD(M) allow you to further personalize your grip length to match up with your capacity needs. It’s almost like you’re getting a two-for-one deal, and there’s nothing more American than that.

What could possibly be better? The other new wrinkle for the 3.8 compact is that it is now available in the caliber XD(M) fans have been clamoring for since the 3.8 was introduced: .45 ACP. This becomes the third offering in the compact line, joining 9mm and .40 S&W. We know, now you can die happy. When the original XD(M)s came to market  in .40 S&W it was just natural for expectations to grow that .45 would soon follow. Now, not only can you pick up the original XD(M) in .45, you can step out with its compact version in one of the personal defense world’s most popular calibers.

The 9+1 carry gun weighs in at just over 27 ounces with a height of 4.55 inches, and the Mag X-Tension adds just two ounces to the gun. With a fully ramped, Melonite-finished barrel and three-dot steel sights, the polymer frame gun is available with a forged steel black slide for $732. The stainless slide and black frame model is available for $797. It has a trigger pull between 5.5 and 7.7 lbs, features dovetail sights and comes with a carrying case, two stainless Megazines, mag loader, double mag pouch, three backstraps and three X-Tensions.

 There’s no doubt that fans of the XD(M) in .45 will find this compact model powerful and easy to conceal.
