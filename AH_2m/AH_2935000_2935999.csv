Item Description:
Nice USP compact in 9mm. Variant 1 so it can be decocked or carried cocked & locked. Standard three dot sights. Matching box, docs, lock, & shell casing. Born on date or 5/29/02. I'm not the original owner and do not know the round count but I've put 200 rounds through with zero problems. Included are two 10 round mags with ext. foot plates, two 13 round mags with ext. foot plates, and two 13 round flush mags. The 13 rounders are marked LEO but I bought them as ""unused old stock"".

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The rifle has had probably one thousand rounds through it (two federal 550 bulk packs plus or minus some). It is mechanically rock solid, and has never failed to feed, eject, or fire barring a few dud 22 rounds. Please note the butt plate has a 'scratch line' right at the curve of it where it rested against the floor of my rifle stand before I got a padded safe. The other brass and all the walnut are great, very-good to like-new.

It was original to my gun but I bought a new barrel with the porting because I'm a silly man. The previous owner (likely one of the lesser great apes) had tried to install the target millet sights with a rock and buggered up the edge of the dove tail (they did it to the rear sight too). Any whooo, I had my local gun smith install a original front blade and he fixed the edge a little bit. I tested it and it shoots straight so he did good work. I am including a brand new mag (well I used it twice) so that if you own a 44 mag desert eagle you'll be ready to roll (once you get ammo). 357 mag desert eagle owners will need a 44 mag bolt to use this. I think the barrel looks fine and I know it works great I just don't need two. This is probably the cheapest way to get into 50AE without having to spend 5-700 on a new barrel.  If you can't do a FTF I'll ship for an extra $5.  No FFL is required for this part, I can ship directly to you."

Flash Hider-

The AAC Brakeout Flash Hider Muzzle Brake combines the best features of AAC's Blackout flash hiders and Blackout muzzle brakes into a single, high performing unit. The Breakout's rear muzzle brake chamber is open on both sides and on the top for reduced perceived recoil & muzzle rise, yet closed on the bottom for minimal environmental disturbance when shooting from the bench or prone positions. The 3-prong front end incorporates elements of the Blackout flash hider's effective design to minimize muzzle flash. All Breakout flash hider muzzle brakes are machined from high strength aerospace 17-4 stainless steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish. 

This 51T Brakeout works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc.

Note our below real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

3050 fps - Kimber 8400 Montana, 24 inch barrel
2970 fps - Winchester All Terrain (circa 1995), 22 inch barrel

Here it is! Along with the Glock G 19, this is acknowledged to be the finest concealed carry pistol available anywhere. The advantage of the Springfield is the way that it fits peoples hands. For a large majority of people, it provides a more correct natural point of aim. It is dead-on reliable, very easy to shoot, has a superb trigger, and is very concealable. Plus, it comes with multiple interchangeable back straps for even improved fit to your hand, as well as Springfield's unbelievable case and generous package of accessories!

Please Note: This has a “A” prefix in its serial number and I have confirmed with TC that it is an Armoloy Coating which has a surface hardness significantly above that of the regular base metal. It does mean that while it will accept standard barrels they will not fit as close as the Armoloy barrel does. The Armoloy barrel will NOT fit standard frames.  There is at least one owner prior to me so I have no idea how many rounds have been fired through it. I have shot 2-3 boxes of .410 shells but no .45 Colt.

In the close-up photo showing the barrel markings you can see a small crack in the forend stock. That crack appears to go through. There are several small handling marks and dents in the grip but outside the pivot rub on the barrel the metal looks good.

There is no box or any other paper work. The instruction booklet can be downloaded from the Thompson Center’s web site. Only the gun (with its choke tube removal tool) is offered in the sale price.

I am not a dealer. I do have the ability to accept a credit card through my business but there is a 3% up charge for that and must be completed prior to taking delivery of the firearm. I am willing to do some driving to complete the transaction with a serious buyer.

To complete the transaction you will need to provide cash, a valid Minnesota photo ID (drivers license), and either a Minnesota permit to purchase or a permit to carry. I will in return provide a bill of sale.

I prefer to be contacted by email. If you provide a phone number and best time to contact you I will call as soon as I can.

The buttons have been moved from the back to the left side for instant access, allowing a magnifier, night vision, or a back up iron sight to fit closely to the HWS body. This new button position allows the user to operate the HWS function switches easier than ever before.

The battle tested circle/dot reticle will be offered along with a series of 1 MOA aiming dots that are vertically aligned and calibrated specifically for the ballistic drop of .223 caliber ammunition. The reticle provides 4 aiming dots for target distances of 0-300m, 400m, 500m, and 600m.

Factory Description: The Vepr 12 shotgun made by Russian “Molot” manufacturer is known for it's reliability and non-failure operation in any weather condition that nature can throw at it, with disregard to the type of ammunition that you use. The Vepr 12 shotgun is a great choice for gun competition, home defense, security, or just shooting at the range. All Vepr rifles and shotguns are based off of the RPK design, so they feature a thicker barrel and receiver than the Saiga counterpart. This tactical Vepr-12 is 922r compliant, has a functional folding buttstock, and comes with an original Russian made magazine. The self-regulating gas system of this shotgun works by utilizing the energy of vented gases from barrel vent ports in a gas chamber to cycle the action. Thanks to this innovation the use of 2 ¾ or 3 inch ammunition is possible. Also it does not require manual adjustment settings, in comparison with a base model Saiga 12. Cartridge chambering in to the barrel is accomplished by movement of rotating bolt inside of the shotgun frame. The trigger group mechanism is a cocking type to provide single shot and safety lock. The safety lock is bilateral with two levers located on the right side of a receiver, and one lever on the left side. This allows for ergonomic engagement of the safety, without having to take you hand off of the pistol grip. Barrel, cartridge chamber and gas chamber are chrome lined for increase of corrosion resistance. Other parts of the shotgun also receive special treatment that guarantee a long service of the weapon. Open sights consist of sighting rail that is windage and elevation adjustable, and a front sight that can be regulated. The front sight is mounted on top of gas chamber. For convenience of operations and possibility to install additional equipment, the Vepr 12 has a picattiny rail incorporated on the top cover to a receiver of Vepr for any optics. The receiver cover is attached to the frame and it is hinged, thanks to this design opening and closing the cover is much easier than a standard AK-based firearm. You don’t need to remove optics to get to the action of the shotguns. The skeletal folding buttstock has a rubber shock absorber, adjustable cheek rest that assists for convenience in aiming and firing of shotgun. It is also angled for a comfortable hold while firing. All of these features allow the shooter the focus more on staying on target. The Vepr 12 also features a heavy duty latch to fold the stock, and another button on the rear trunnion in order to put it back in the open position. OEM magazines on are completely interchangeable from gun to gun, meaning no additional manipulation needed if you borrow your friends magazine. Magazine loading and unloading operation is easy thank you to constructed magazine well. Vepr 12 works well with a US made magazine, but we recommend to get OEM magazines for flawless operation.

Say what you will about Taurus but Ive had 3 of this exact model and have never had a problem with them. Good timing and lockup, surprisingly smooth sa/da action, and with the polymer frame and rubber grips it is surprisingly tame for a 2 inch snub while firing .357 magnum loads. Very easy to carry, I carry it daily in my pocket. Has the boot grips on it now but will also come with the full length grip. Its almost new and has only had 140 rounds through it. 

I'm starting to reload .40 S&W so I'm looking to trade it for a subcompact or pocket sized .40 caliber handgun. My top choice is a Ruger SR40c, but I'm open to offers.  Would also consider 9mm pocket or subcompact handguns, like a Beretta Nano or similar.  Not interested in any other calibers except for .40 and 9mm.
Don't really want to sell but I will sell the revolver for $320 firm.

Pelican 720 FDE hard case with locks and foam cut out to match this rifle and accessories
Since this is the PMag model, I have 5 of the 10 round Pmags, and 5 of the 20 round Pmags
Also includes the factory armalite case, manuals and goodies, and I am the original owner. The gun was purchased directly from Armalite and built in Jan of this year. I also have every factory component except the Armalite national match trigger which I put into another rifle, but you can have your choice of trigger as id be happy to take the Geissele back. 

While I would prefer to sell this as a package, I am also willing to put it back to stock and sell as a factory rifle, which is the price listed, or with your choice of components since I will likely be building a smaller 16 inch gun that is more practical for shorter distances. This gun is in 100% like new condition and only been out to be zero'd, and then shot at long distances. The Pelican case has minor wear from one plane ride this rifle went on, every other component looks new. 
Price listed is for the rifle as is stock from Armalite. For Everything listed above, I would like $6,000 and can be negotiable depending which components you want or dont want.  Rifle is zero'd at 100 yards and turrets are set and ready to go. I also have boxes for everything (scope, mount, and other stuff)."

Springfield Armory’s® Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use.
