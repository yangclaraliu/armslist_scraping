These shotguns also work well for home defense and security applications, especially with availability of relatively short-barreled models with long magazines.
The Winchester 1300 shotgun utilizes so called pump action, which is operated by sliding for end. For end is connected with bolt group with dual action bars. Receiver is produced from lightweight aluminum alloy, and the bolt locks into the barrel extension using a rotary bolt head with four radial locking lugs. Feed is from tubular under barrel magazines, which can be had in a variety of lengths / capacities. Barrels are quick-detachable; in 'Defender' configurations barrels have fixed cylinder choke; in hunting configurations barrels are usually fitted with replaceable chokes and a sighting rib. Standard furniture comes in wood or plastic varieties, finish and sights may vary from version to version.

The 1898 has a steel buttplate. The 1906 has powdered remnants of a turn of the century plastic buttplate. It's not Bakelite, that was invented in 1907. Regardless of its composition, it's no longer there but can be replaced for roughly $30 by a number of online retailers. The 1906 also has a cracked stock and someone put tape on it a long time ago that's been there for a while. Either of these guns could use some love from someone more interested than I am.

The shortened version of this shotgun was known as the ""trench gun"" in WWI. They are both capable of slam firing.

I do not need to sell these guns, but have my eye on other firearms. I would consider a full or partial trade depending on what you've got."

I also installed high viz tricomp sight (the original brass bead will come with it). This has the KO so shooting 3"" and 3.5"" shells is a breeze.

These retail for $1560-$1680 new  --- selling this for $1200. Reasonable offers considered.

I originally bought it to hunt with and as a back up sporting clays gun, but on seeing it decided to buy a synthetic Beretta Extreme instead as couldn't let such a a nice looking gun get wet, dragged through the brush etc.

Comes with everything it came with new (i.e. the case, 3 choke tubes (Cyl, Full, M), choke tube changer, stock shim set, all original docs).

I shot a 1/2 box of shells through this (5 3.5 "" turkey loads to check out the recoil reduction - and its a lot, and about 10 target loads). There isn't a mark on this gun."

If you are looking for a really nice deer rifle, this is the one for you. I personally like the three way safety feature especially when it comes to loading and unloading the gun. Position one, safety bolt lock, trigger lock. Position two, you can open the bolt to empty chamber but the the trigger is still locked so you can't accidentally fire. Position three is fire, unlocks bolt and trigger. This is a Ruger M77 Markll 7mm Rem Mag, the design of this gun has less kick than other 7 mags I have shot. Not sure why but it is pretty sweet. Has a Bushnell Banner scope that is crisp when finding your target. No dancing around with a black circle trying to focus. I hate scopes that do that. Anyway, $550. Well worth for a quality gun for a lifetime of hunting for you and whoever you pass it down to. Thanks for looking, be safe, treat every gun like it is loaded and buy a hunting license to support conservation. Without it, we wouldn't be buying a rifle in the first place."

 I have a brand new henry golden boy 22 mag this is a very beautiful rifle make a nice gift or a hand-me-down octagon barrel SEE PICTURE , and you dont have to rob a stagecoach to shoot this one and there is plenty of ammo out there 22 mag. HENRY GOLDEN BOY 22MAG 
But there are still a few frontier staples that were so effective and ahead of their time that they remain in use today. Take, for instance, the intimidating octagonal barrels commonly found on the repeating rifles of that period. These heavy-duty workhorses sported added mass and extra weight to aid in heat absorption, making them the forerunners to the bull barrels used on modern target and varmint rifles.
 Like stagecoaches, swinging saloon doors and Pony Express riders, there are many innovations of the Old West that have long faded from use and live on only in Western movies and history books
 Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. Henry selected the Golden Boy as the canvas for the application of fine hand engraving which elevates an already beautiful rifle into a work of art. The result represents the true marriage of state of the art gunsmithing with the centuries old craft of engraving. will ship with ins. 35 dollars(CAN SEND IN TO HENRY TO ENGRAVE)

623,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2259623,"For Sale:  BUFFALO BARNES LEAD FREE 125GR. TAC-XP 40 S&W, STANDARD PRESSURE, LOW FLASH","azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Friday, October 25, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=303

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
1303 fps -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel

You’ll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

If I can sell this pistol, then we get to go camping all next summer.

Yes, I want to sell it, but I will NOT take less than $700. That is a very good deal for this pistol. I paid way more and it was still worth it.

Para P18 LDA, (LIGHT DOUBLE ACTION) SATIN STAINLESS, walnut grips, fiber optic sights, case, manual and 2 genuine para mags.

If you don't know what an LDA is, look it up. You will not find a better trigger pull on the market, hands down. This beast shoots like a laser. Fiber optic sights and LDA trigger make this a very VERY Accurate sidearm.

I will include some range ammo, and some hollowpoints.

It has a very light scratch on one side from a rivet on my pants. I called para, and they would fix it free if you send it to them, it never bothered me, its not that noticeable, but I'm just pointing out so there are no surprises.

1st $700 gets it, I will not take a penny less. If you have a nice pop up you want to trade for it, I may consider that."

Gun was cleaned, fired 20 times for a zero, cleaned and fired 330 times, cleaned and put away. This rifle is basically a brand new gun just someone else zeroed it and broke it in for you. The gun is easy enough to get the specs of the website so I would advice that. The claymore break is pinned in place but any good gunsmith could take care of that. The stock came pinned, I took out the pin slid stock to mid length of pull and re-pinned it. There is a magpul ASAP three point sling plate on the reciever/buffer tube. It comes with fixed Daniel defense sights with a trijicon front post. The rail is the alpha rail but not the one with the built in flip up. Also has a BCM dual latch charging handle. also has the quick detach sling mounts front and back and a troy sling.

Hey everyone, 
I recently got this little Walther PK380 (380 auto) and would rather sell or trade it for another 9mm. I took it to the range today and it shot great with no problems and was very consistent. It does have some carry wear on the slide, but nothing that wouldn't happen from you carrying it for a while. Also included are the take down tools, one mag, lock/keys, and the factory case. Ammo can be included for the right price or offer. I am a bigger guy and this gun feels great in my hands, just would prefer a 9mm. I would consider other calibers, but more preference on the 9mms. I really am wanting a 1911 9mm (any brand really, just be reasonable on your price), but open to most. Just ask, worst I can say is no. I could trade up or down for the right gun, but it will need to be balanced on both sides either with cash or extras. I would even do partial trades for certain ammo, or for some 22LR pistols plus cash (really looking for a pink SR22 if possible). I also need to meet around norman if possible due to my schedule. If you have any questions please message me and I will respond as soon as I can. I can send more pictures that way if you prefer as well."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.
