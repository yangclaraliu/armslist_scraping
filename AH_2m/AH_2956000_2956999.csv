NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines, hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. For reliable performance, there are only two names in magazines for 5900 series Smith & Wesson Pistols. One is Check-Mate, S&W’s own proprietary contractor. The other name is Mec-Gar. Mec Gar magazines ensure reliable functioning of semi-auto handguns in all manner of conditions, and they are the primary supplier for no less notables than Browning, Beretta, Sig Arms, and Smith & Wesson. Mec Gar magazines lock the slide back like they’re supposed to, and free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, every time. Here is Mec-Gar’s 10 round magazine for any Smith & Wesson 59 or 5900 type pistol, including models 59, 59-1, 659, 459, 669, 910, 915, 5903, 5906, 5946, 6906, and 6946. These magazines will also work very well in the Marlin Camp 9 Rifles, in Kel-Tec P11 pistols or SU-2000 rifles designed for Smith & Wesson magazines; and even in Star pistols models 28 and 30 but only Stars with their magazine safeties removed. The Smith & Wesson 459 and Star 30 in some of our photos are not included, and we are not advertising them for sale. These are solid blue steel bodied magazines with hard polymer black cartridge followers and extended spacer floorplate that ensures compliance in jurisdictions where standard magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of 9mm caliber ammunition, five fewer than the standard 5915B Mec-Gar. If we are in stock on those, buyers residing in jurisdictions where those are permitted may sub at the same price. Please message us, though, and let us check stock if that is what you want to do. Our ME page gives a summary of the restrictive areas. Replacement pricing on factory S&W 5900 series magazines is upwards of $60 apiece. Our single magazine price on these Mec-Gars is $39 each. We’re offering the Mec Gar 10 round magazines, the Ones in the photo or their identical mates in lots of 3 or more at only $29 each. Own 3 $ 87.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Width	1.062 inches (2.7 cm)
Height	4.1 inches (10.4 cm)

""As New Condition"", patterned after the 1800's Remington Elliott Patent Derringer this Hand Cannon is a true and functional novelty, very few made in 1983.

The COP 357 is a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum round. It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is only slightly larger than the typical .25 automatic pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.

The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 operates similarly to the Sharps & Elliott rimfire pepperboxs of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence. If you live in Connecticut and have a Pistol Permit we can transfer just buy filling out the proper forms from DPS and calling into DPS for transfer number.  All others will have to go through yours and mine gun dealer.  I do not have the box it had come in."

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. Longer barrel lengths of 24"", 26"" and 32"" will be available in the future. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, four-sided Picatinny forend, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, and many more.

NO NYC. This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. The shaky Spanish Economy is well publicized. As a direct result of that, here is a discovery from the reserve stock rooms of the Spanish Guardia of only a couple hundred factory Star Magazines to fit the legendary Star model B series pistols. These magazines are original Star production, and many of them are so marked on their floor plates. Manufacturer is the now defunct Star Echeverria Company of Eibar, Spain. Construction is entirely blue steel, from the bottom of their double or two piece catch floor plates to their stepped steel cartridge followers. Each magazine holds 9 rounds of standard 9mm ammunition; 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. These are manufactured for the Star Model B Pistols with slotted front grip frames like the grip frame showing in our photos from a 1953 Israeli Police issued model B. These will not fit non-slotted Model Bs, manufactured after around 1965 without modifying them by bending their floorplates. We have other magazines listed on this venue for the non-slotted B, BS, and Super B Star Pistols. This one ain’t it. These magazines are not easy to find, and this is a one-time deal. Photos show representatives from the same lot, and the buyer will receive a magazine from the exact same lot as the photo specimens. Surface detractions are minimal, only etchy toning here and there on some of the magazines surfaces, and occasionally Spanish Guardia 3 or 4 digit identification numerals. We rate all of them as Very Good, or even Excellent, finishwise. The Guardia Police Armorers wisely stored them in well-greased condition. Original period correct factory Star magazines for the slotted Star Bs are high and in short supply worldwide. Many sellers ask upwards of $75 apiece for them. We’re offering the 1940s Star B Factory magazine in the photos, or its substantially identical mates from the same lot each for only $ 49.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

NO New York City. This listing is for ONE magazine. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #965M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Star Model BM and BKM Compact pistols chambered in 9mm Parabellum. This fine California company is the last man standing for Star Magazines since the demise of both Interarms and Star Echeverria in 1998. Construction is all steel body, springs, and contoured steel floorplate. Cartridge follower is black polymer Smith & Wesson type. This magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm caliber. This magazine fits only the Model BM steel frame and BKM lightweight Star pistols. It will not work in any of the Firestars or other Star models, only the compact. The 1970s Spanish Israeli Police Star Model BM9 in some of our photos is not included, of course. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each for only $ 29.00.

The barrel is stamped NATO 5.56 1/9. The butt stock and grip are both Magpul in flat dark earth.  The charging handle is a BCM and larger than normal. The front and back sights at GG&G, and both are flip up and placed on angled attachments so as not to get in the way of the scope.  The scope is an NC Star 2-7x32 illuminated mil-dot reticle. It magnifies quite a bit, and illuminates in blue.  I don't remember what brand the foregrip is, but it doubles as a bipod and is also FDE in color.  The quad rail hand guard is from Acid Tactical  and is 7"" in length, FDE in color. As you can see, there is plenty of room to add a flashlight or laser.  I will include one 30 rd pmag magazine, as pictured.  There have been zero rounds through this rifle. Being a vet, and used to the army issued M4, I thought I'd get more opportunities to shoot this thing, but that just hasn't happened."

9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

This listing is for One Factory Mossberg Cruiser Grip assembly and all its hardware; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-stock price and with no additional shipping charges. The venerable Mossberg 500 Shotgun had been around a long, long time before Cruiser style pistol grips became fashionable in the 1970s. We still see some home made hillbilly cruiser grips, whittled out of the original hardwood stocks, come into our store with the stock bolt shining. Our more affluent owners wrap those with gray duct tape. For the past 25 years, we see lots of them with their hardwood forends intact. The buttstock is much easier to change than the forend, no real disassembly of the shotgun required. A person just gets a Phillips screwdriver, takes one of the butt pad screws loose, swivels the pad, and then goes into the buttstock with an extension socket wrench or even a long shanked big flat head screwdriver, takes the old stock off. Then, using the big Allen wrench shown and enclosed, along with the washers, install the pistol grip. Even our photographer can perform the procedure. Photos show brand new factory Cruiser grips we took off some Mossberg 500 M&P Parkerized finish 18 inch barreled shotguns, so we leave their conventional buttstocks on them. All these grips are brand new, factory fresh with their factory plastic bag and hardware like the one in the photos. Installation leaves an overall length of well over 28 inches. Installation will, however, transform the Shotgun into Any Other status on the 4473 form, and owners must be at least 21 years of age, same rules as handguns. Also, installation may run a person afoul of local laws, checking those is the responsibility of the buyer. Buyers should be advised that 12 gauge shotguns generate substantial recoil, and should be kept well away from the operator’s face while firing. These cruiser grips will fit any 12 gauge model 500, model 535, Model 590, or Model 835. They will not fit a Remington 870 or the gear shift column of a 1963 Pontiac. Replacement pricing on these often approaches $60 apiece in our area. We’re offering them each, however, the factory Mossberg grip in the photos or its identical mates, for only $ 29.00.

Those who choose autoloading .22”s are often shooters who practice a great deal and demand endurance from their firearms. The Ruger 10/22 rifle offers a superior combination of light weight, short overall length, and mechanical dependability that ensures years of reliable service, even with heavy use. One of the best-selling .22 rifles in history, the Ruger 10/22 is a favorite of small-game hunters, plinkers, and target shooters in matches where speed and accuracy are paramount.

Constructed with simple, integrated subassemblies, the trigger housing contains the entire firing mechanism. It employs a high-speed, swinging hammer to ensure short lock time. It is also equipped with a sliding cross-button-type safety. The Ruger 10/22 Long Rifle receiver is drilled and tapped for a tip-off scope-mount adapter, included with each rifle. The unique removable Ruger rotary magazine is the most reliable .22 magazine ever invented.

This listing is for One set of grips; buyers, however, may take as many extra sets as we have on hand at the same per-set price, and with no additional shipping charges. All Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolvers made since the mid 1990s are Round Butt Grip Frame, and Square Butt Js were never plentiful. Hogue grips have knocked Pachmayr off the ruling perch in the past 20 years with their ergonomics and affordability. Pachmayr, of course, wins all the beauty contests, but for shooting comfort and ease of handling, Hogue is the winner. This is Hogue's pink colored, finger grooved, compact size, concealable grip to fit any Smith & Wesson J Frame Revolver with round butt grip frame. Manufacturer is Hogue, Inc. of Paso Robles, CA. Construction is two piece pink outer shell rubberized polymer, with a hard black internal sleeve bonded to an absorbent yet firm synthetic rubber with stippled surfaces. Anchor inserts are steel, and they use the frame of the revolver itself for strength, not screw and escutcheon type that can easily loosen and break. These grips fit models 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and any of their 6 prefix stainless variants, including the model 60 itself. Smith & Wesson small or J frame revolvers, most specimens made since about 1995 are round butt, includes models 34, 650, 651 and the 3 prefix Air Lite siblings. For any shoppers who aren’t clear whether you have a round or square butt revolver, please see the grip frame photo. Lord knows there are plenty of them out there and there will be for decades to come. We mean the round butt Smith & Wessons. These Hogue Bantams preserve the compactness and don’t really take up as much space as a traditional set of Magna Goncalo Grips with a Tyler T on them. We're offering these fine grips for only $24.00.

German Mauser Kar98k (8mm Mauser)-  1940 Manufactured 42 Code receiver.  The 42 Code means it was made at the Mauser-Werke AG Oberndorf factory in 1940. All of the rifles waffenempts and swastikas are intact (have not been peened). The rifle has mismatched numbers but is not a Russian Capture. The barrel does match the receiver and the bolt almost (bolt body is different) matches itself. The rifle is in great external condition but the bore is pitted and worn with little rifling left. Perfect rifle for reenactor or a NOS barrel replacement for a fantastic shooter or reproduction sniper's rifle. As it sits though it is NOT A SHOOTER. $275 firm as the parts alone are worth that much.

I had a handguard that I took off a rock river predator that I refinished, and coated with duracoat matte satin.  It turned out really nice, so I used it on this build.  While i was at it, I duracoated the barrel.  This is a 223 wylde chambered (tighter tolerance makes it more accurate than a standard 5.56 while still maintaining the functional reliability) The upper and lower receivers are anderson manufacturing, with a ptac milspec lower build kit and collapsible stock.  The bolt/carrier group is a full auto, so it will last next to forever, and also nice because they are built a little more robust and have the correct mass for cycling properly.   Gas tube is stainless, low profile gas steel gas block (not aluminum).  When refinishing the handguard, I cut holes on the underside to  easily access the gas block.  Also doubles as a sling stud hole. If you ever want to change to a quad rail, these easy access holes will come in really handy.  Milspec charging handle, and 30 rd steel magazine.

Bipod is not included unless you want to buy it extra, the gun has had 2 rounds fired through it to ensure a good primer strike and proper ejection angle."

CZ USA 75 B 9mm Pistol, Full Size, SA/DA, Black Polycoat, 15-Round Mags- CZ 91102


Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The ‘B’ designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

What I do know is that it is a nice older S&W .38 Special.  Shoots well and is a great discussion piece.  Has a fair amount of character wear but is still in good shooter condition.  The grips are not original.  Timing is excellent.  Lockup is good.  Shoots straight, strong bright rifling.

Wood has some dents but overall is in good shape. The ladder on the rear sight looks to have been shaved down to a notch. Rifle barrel looks to have been resleeved to 56-50.

I've shot many 1911 pistols...this is the smoothest shooting (feeling) one I have ever shot -that might sound weird but if you've ever shot really fine 1911's you know what I'm talking about. Frankly, it's boring to shoot at anything inside of 25 yards...it just makes holes where the sites are when it goes bang. If you're a decent shot this gun will make you good. If your good, it will make you look really good. For a serious buyer showing up with cash we can take the gun to a range for you to see for yourself...just bring factory ammo (no reloads), ear and eye protection. 

I have the hard case, bushing wrench, two mags and the papers it came with. The gun was used very infrequently for light target practice."

It has about 200 rounds of 38's through it and about 30 357 rounds.   The frame is Scandium Alloy and the cylinder is Stainless Steel, it's very lightweight.  Comes with factory rubber boot grips as well as some Taurus boot grips that I modified to fit, the Taurus grips are similar to S&W models but cover the rear of the back-strap and help with recoil. These photos show the S&W grips. The front sight is pinned on, rather than integral as with early J frames so if you wish you can add a XS big dot or other night site. I can tell you from experience, if you have carpal tunnel or arthritis in your hands, this gun is not comfortable to shoot.

This is a Series 70 slide as it doesn't have the firing pin safety. Finish is very good but there is some thinning on the edges and a couple of dings on the front sight and muzzle end of the slide. Nothing a fine file/hard backed sand paper and a re-blue won't fix. I believe the barrel to be original. The Combat Government was a limited production model of the standard Govt Model that included factory high profile sights, lowered and flared ejection port, and upgraded barrel among other refinements on the frame. This slide comes with new Ed Brown firing pin, spring, and stop.  A great way to start that custom 1911 build you've always wanted.

980,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2956980,"For Sale:  BNIB Shiloh Sharps 40-65 ""Montana Roughrider"" RARE & HARD TO FIND","Huachuca City/Sierra Vista, Tucson, Arizona","$ 2,900","Listed On: Tuesday, May 27, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,Single Shot                                                                                ,Rifle,"Frank Mayer born in 1850 was an old time buffalo hunter in the days when Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill, and such made their footprints in the sands of history. He may also have been the oldest living Civil War veteran at the time as he lied about his age in 1863 and became a drummer boy in the Union Army. For four years from 1872 through 1875, Mayer hunted buffalo and was the last surviving ""buffalo runner"" as he called it.

Mayer started hunting in Texas and moved North with the herds. His rifles were Sharps. First came the .40-70 and the .40-90. Then Mayer got his big rifle, a sixteen pound .45 that shot a 550 grain bullet. The Sharps rifle goes all the way back to a time two years before Frank Mayer was born. Christian Sharps received his patent in 1848 for a sliding breech action on a percussion rifle. Unlike most muzzle loaders in use at the time that required powder be poured down the barrel from the muzzle end and then the bullet seated and rammed home, Sharps' rifle had a lever activated breech block that opened downward. A linen or paper cartridge consisting of a bullet and proper powder charge was inserted and the closing of the breech block tore the paper exposing the powder. Instead of a single percussion cap, the Sharps rifle first used a circular capper and then a roll of caps not unlike cap guns used in the early days.

The Sharps was used in the Civil War and a trained shooter could get off ten shots in one minute with the Sharps mechanism and design. The first 9,000 Sharps rifles of 1859 went to the military, and the famous Berdan Sharpshooters were armed with .52 caliber Sharps rifles. In all the Union purchased over 80,000 Sharps rifles.

It was an easy step for the Sharps from the use of linen or paper cartridges to the new fixed ammunition. By 1869 Christian Sharps was long gone from the company and Richard Lawrence received a patent that year for a new rifle and started designing and chambering large brass cartridges for what would soon become the Model of 1874. By 1881 the Sharps Rifle Company, like the buffalo, was gone. You won't find agreement on what chamberings were found in the Sharps as we have already pointed out. Some well known chamberings were .40-70, .40-90, .44-77, .45-110, .50-70, and the Big Fifty, the .50-90.

Sharps rifles were generally blued steel with case hardened receiver and butt plate, and a straight grip walnut stock. Barrel lengths were normally from 22"" to 32"" and octagon in shape. In the 1870's Frank Mayer's Sharps rifle, complete with bullet mold and reloading dies, cost $225 with an extra charge of $80 for the scope, at a time when a buffalo skinner averaged $38.50 a week. Sorta puts the cost of a modern Sharps in perspective doesn't it?

The original Sharps Rifle Company may be gone but the void has been filled in modern times by the Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing Company of Big Timber Montana. The ""new"" Sharps company goes back to 1976, opening operation 95 years after the demise of the original company. Known as Shiloh Products, there would be a split in 1983 with two companies emerging, Shiloh and C. Sharps.

One does not simply go to a local dealer and pick and choose from a rack of Sharps rifles. In fact there is a L-O-N-G back order situation. Many folks have hesitated ordering one when the delay was one year. Then the back order for one reached two years, eventually the wait for one of these fine pieces of history was four years!

YOU CAN OWN ONE OF THESE EXCLUSIVE ""Montana Roughrider"" RIFLES RIGHT NOW AT THIS VERY MOMENT!

Shiloh Rifle Manufacturing states: 

""As with the original Sharps, our rifles are not intended for the mass market. They are for the shooter, hunter, and competitor who wants something special. 

Therefore we will never sacrifice quality for higher production figures. To do so would compromise the soul of this product, and disappoint those wishing today for the quality that was the norm in 19th Century American firearms.

""We feel that Shiloh rifles reflect the extra time and effort that go into their manufacture. Due to the tremendous shooter acceptance of the Shiloh Sharps we find ourselves in a lengthy back-order situation. We wish to assure potential Shiloh Sharps customers that by increasing our work force and by turning to state-of-the art machinery, we are striving to reduce that waiting period."" 

NO WAITING PERIOD at High Country Guns & Ammo as you can own yours TODAY!

***NOTE: Shiloh Rifles come in a variety of styles and calibers. They also come with the recommendation that smokeless powder handloads not be used in the large volume black powder cartridge of the 1870's. The Shiloh is built like the Sharps was in 1874 and should be used the same way.

Chamberings available include .38-55, .40-50, .40-65, .40-70, .40-90, .44-77, .44-90, .45-70, .45-90, .45-100, .45-110, .45-120, .50-70, and .50-90. In all of these the first number represents the caliber while the second is the charge of black powder in the original cartridge.
