The pistol is in new condition and has two magazines and a hard case. The Walther P22 is slightly smaller than a SR22 or MP22. I have owned both. This pistol, unlike others, has an actual hammer...you can cock/decock this pistol, it's not just a striker fire like all the other ones. Also the magazine release is not a button but is a portion of the bottom of the trigger guard, it is a beautiful set-up...you push down the trigger guard and out pops the magazine... It comes with a second ""backstrap"" for the grip. That is so you can make the grip wider or narrower by putting in the other backstrap. They are both factory backstraps and Walther gives you two different sizes. This is for right hand and left hand shooters...every feature , including safety...is ambidextrous.  Best .22 pistol  I've ever owned. I have had the others, sold them and kept this one...hands down the best. It is single and double action. BUT, I want a HENRY Golden Boy with brass buttplate, brass receiver and brass barrel band...for that, this Walther is yours. I will consider a 30/30 also...I want one of those also.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact concealed carry pistol. Utilizing a removable serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

We have an International Harvester M1 (U.S. Rifle) Garand semi automatic rifle for sale. It is chambered in .30-06 Springfield. This comes as shown in sporter configuration. The barrel has been turned down and engraved. The receiver was re-blued back in the 1960's and has now turned a rose color. The floor plate & trigger guard have also been engraved. The bolt was jeweled. It is currently sitting in a stock we had lying around. We do have a wood for the for end included with this. The top cover wood is missing the band and is off color compared to the stock. The bore is in good condition but a little dark. There is some light pitting on the outside of the barrel and receiver. The action is fully functional. 

Before you send your hateful emails about how this rifle has been wrongfully treated, remember this is a consignment for one of our customers. It would make a great sporterized conversion. Or you could spend the money to take it back to original. There are plenty of affordable CMP parts on the market.  Thank you for looking at our items. 

Asking $550.00 with sales tax or free shipping included. If you do not want the wood we can drop the price to $500. Trades welcome. Must be 18yrs or older and pass a background check.

The Ruger Single Six is a single action rimfire revolver produced by Sturm, Ruger. The Single Six was first released in June 1953.[5]

The Single Six is currently produced as the New Model Single Six. The term ""New Model"" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single Six, though this will lower the value for those in pristine, collectable condition.[6]

This Savage 99 is featured in multiple (recent) magazine articles, and they are prized by all who own them.  The wood is darn near perfect, and there are very few blemishes in the bluing for a gun of this age.  I have shown this to many people and only two have ever even seen one before, and never one just like this.  It is chambered in .303 Savage, and has the original sights as well as a flip up peep in the rear.  It has the brass cartridge count indicator, pin indicator, and the lever has a gorgeous patina (imo).  There is a touch of rust colored patina on the butt plate, but I wouldn't dare touch it and diminish the value.  This is a very rare caliber/combination and for those of you ""in the know"" this is also not a fading barrel or frosted model, it's full blued.  It also has the shotgun butt as opposed to the more common crescent butt plate.  While I have seen other 99A's in 303 up for auction on Guns Intl and GunBroker, I have never seen this combination up for sale before, especially considering it's 26"" barrel not a ""short"" model.  The closest thing I have seen recently is listed on GunBroker, and has the crescent rear with a asking price of $1595.00 and not as nice of condition and with non factory front sight.  http://www.gunbroker...?Item=362179208 .

Gun comes with the usual stuff from the factory (i.e., hardcase, papers, spent casing, and owner's manual). The gun also comes with a 1-8rd factory magazine, and factory smooth wood grips, but it has a nicer Kimber tactical rosewood grips on it right now (brand new, cost me $40). I installed a new Smith & Alexander checkered mainspring housing (pictured, cost me $35) on it a few days ago (factory mainspring housing including). In addition, I'll throw in a box (50 rounds - not pictured) of FMJ ammo along with the gun. You must be at least 21 years old or older to trade this gun. And you must be a Kentucky resident and have a valid Kentucky Driver's License to trade my gun. Thanks for looking.

PF-9
The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

I have a Mauser 1909. It has been sporterized, but is unlike a great many sporters here in the US. the job was done by Chet Paulson out of Tacoma in the late 50s to early 60s. It resides in a handmade stock by Paulson himself, and sports vintage Redfield sights. It is in the original 7.65x53 Argentine, unlike it`s thousands of similar sporters, which were converted to .30-06. In my limited experience, I`ve found that it is a lot cheaper than .30-06 too. The weapon has been used, and it shows. It has no Rust, just some patina on the Bolt face. Mr. Paulson is now deceased, and that only makes this Mauser worth more. Most of his work is in private collections, too. I had it priced at about $700-$750 by a friend who is very knowledgeable on this subject. It only needs a good bolt cleaning, although everything functions exactly as it should."

Tubular 17 round magazine. Got it as part of a larger trade. Took it to the range, checked the barrel to be sure it was not obstructed, and fired away. It shot nice, but jammed every few shots. 
When I got home and took it apart I found that someone had bent the ""Ejector Lifter Spring"" the WRONG DIRECTION (lol), the plastic buffer block was broken, and it was filthy.

I've cleaned it and bent the ejector spring back to spec. The buffer is a $8 part and 10-15 minute job to replace it. I just don't have time to deal with it. I'll sell it for $120 as is, or for $150 with the buffer replaced.
It would be more, but there is a bit of patina on the outside of the barrel. Not active, visible rust, but you can tell it had a touch of rust on it at one point.
It will make someone a nice plinker or squirrel gun with a new buffer.

BILLet Option for Wilson Combat ARs
Designed by Bill Wilson and the Wilson Combat design team to be the base for the ultimate precision tactical AR-15 rifle, the BILLet-AR matched upper and lower receiver is 100% machined in our Berryville, AR facility.
The Wilson Combat BILLet-AR receiver was engineered from the ground up to address structural design weaknesses in standard USGI receivers and enhance overall tolerances.
The BILLet-AR upper receiver has a precise bolt raceway for smoother chambering, more rigid receiver walls to reduce firing flex, an oversize magazine well for quick reloads and an integrated trigger guard for gloved use and added lower receiver strength.
Our extensive experience as a premier custom builder of AR-15 rifles will ensure your satisfaction with this next generation precision tactical shooting platform.

As mentioned, it's new, so it includes the box, gun, manual, various cheek weld clip-ons, and lock.  Also included is a tactical black carrying case (see photos).  If serious, will also throw in 3 boxes of law enforcement slugs.

SHOTGUN INFORMATION:  This is not a play on words - this is a brand new 870 Magpul Edition Shotgun, which I purchased 6 months ago.  It's never been fired, and it was in the box all of that time.  I have a half-dozen shotguns and when I saw this baby, I knew I had to have it.  Problem is that since that time, I've not shot much at all and have had to scale back on my collection.  My loss is your gain.

PRICE:  This is a steal for $550 Cash (please - no trades or checks considered).  Do your homework to see what this costs new.  As I said, my loss is your gain (as I paid $700 plus tax when I purchased it six months ago).

I bought a 5 gun lot of these but this one had the best finish (Parkerized?) I've ever seen on any AK so I stuck it in the safe until about 3 months ago. I have shot one 40 round clip through it and that's it. It was new and I am the only owner plus all the serial #s match. I just installed a ATI Strikeforce stock kit folding front grip to facilitate changing high capacity clips. It has the Scorpion recoil system and it has a folding butt stock (left side fold)Comes with 2-40 round clips and strap and has the chrome plated barrel. I want to trade for a .308 AR variant or possibly a CIA 308/7.62x51. I don't need the money so if you don't have a AR .308 don't bother to respond it's not for sale. I can send pictures and would post a few if I only could get it to work, I have tried without success for the last hour. I even have the original paperwork from the distributor I bought them from. FTF only I will not ship or trade unless I can hold the gun in my hands.  If you like AKs you would be hard pressed to find a nicer one.

PH: 801-38BRASS (27277)

Item Description:

This is a brand new in box LWRC M6 Individual Carbine AR-15 semi automatic rifle chambered for 5.56mm NATO. The M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRC to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature a new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The charging handle is also ambidextrous, to accommodate any operator.

LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made out of 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling devoid of tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity. NiCorr surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. LWRC claims their barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4. The 14.7"" barrel has a popular 1:7"" twist rate and has a pinned flash hider, making it compliant with federal law.

LWRC engineered a complete solution to the deficits found in the direct impingement M16/AR15/M4 family of rifles and carbines. The principal improvement comes from the incorporation of their patented self-regulating short-stroke gas-piston system. This system eliminates the venting of hot, carbon-laden gases into the receiver and bolt carrier group, thus eliminating the intensive cleaning regime of the legacy rifle. It also means the bolt carrier group and associated springs are not subjected to the searing heat of the tapped gasses, this being one of the major causes of small parts failure. This translates into carbines that are far more reliable than the legacy direct impingement carbines regardless of user maintenance.

The bolt carriers of all M6 rifles are coated with a proprietary nickel coating that nearly eliminates corrosion while providing greatly increased lubricity. This coating provides permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

A comfortable Magpul MOE+ rubberized pistol grip and LWRC adjustable butt stock are outfitted. This rifle features LWRC BUIS and one 30 round PMAG are included.

The 32 H&R magnum for some reason is becoming increasingly difficult to find these days, and I don't think the major revolver manufacturers (Smith, Ruger, Taurus) ) are even producing revolvers in this chambering anymore.  So these will only get more and more difficult to find over time.  They seem to have moved to a much hotter 32 caliber round, the 327 Federal Magnum, which is a MUCH more violent 32, but also less controllable round. Anyway, I do have this extra revolver which makes for very comfortable shooting, and is a very controllable  point and shoot gun with very mild recoil.  I don't want to be accused of being sexist, but this is also a good caliber for some women and/or for some novice shooters in general, for whom even shooting 38 special in airweight frames is still a bit too recoil heavy for them. In this all steel Ruger configuration, the 32 H&R is very tame.  The trigger is glass smooth, and I would stack it up to any of the Smiths I've ever shot.  Ruger's seem to have the reputation that they are super strong revolvers, even stronger and more solidly built than Smith and Wessons, but ""that their triggers are not as good as Smith and Wesson."" But frankly, I find only the first part of that to be true, their triggers are excellent too.  Also, the advantage of the 32 H&R over the 38 special, is that in small frame J style revolvers like this one, you have an extra shot:   6 shots with the 32 H&R compared to only 5 shots with the 38 Special .  I also have several hundred rounds of 32 H&R ammo I can sell along with this gun, both target and self defense ammo. Lawful purchasers only please:  I am just a regular guy / non-dealer looking to offload some extra stuff."
