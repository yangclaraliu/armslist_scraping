There are some very minor blems on the outer finish, and most have been touched up, and you can barely tell where they were. It does have an accessory rail, and 2 magazines.

I have a brand new set of Warren Competition sights, plain rear, orange or green fiber optic front sight, and a Sig Short Reset Trigger kit, directly from Sig. Neither of these have actually been installed, and still in their packages.

I don't know the date of manufacture, but if the serial number was coded the same way as used by the /26\ Jianshe Arsenal, it would be 1967. Definitely post 1963.
The considerable amount of grime in the stock and the fact that the engraving is over the blueing leads me to believe this is Chinese military surplus (military rifles all factory code).
It think is misleading for B-West to have called this unmodified PLA stock military surplus rifle a ""Sporter""

Very good condition. Wood stock has a few dings, missing finish in spots, but no cracks, gouges, or repairs. Minor pitting. A great shooting rifle."

Standard magazines, for instance, can also be used for backup weapons. Compact and subcompact Glock pistol model magazines can be loaded with a convincing number of rounds. The innovative polymer frame of the Glock pistol does not require grip shells. As a result, it has considerably more space for the magazine body and enables double-row staggered cartridge configuration. For this reason, Glock pistols are superior in firepower to conventional pistol models of the same size. Glock magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven Glock high tech polymer. This resists deformation - even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions.

Carry The Load supports law enforcement, fire fighter, rescue personnel, and military charities. Specifically the best ones. None of the 55% admin fees ""wounded warrior"" gobbles up.

They are high velocity, copper plated round nose bullets and I believe the bullets are also moly coated (why they are black instead of copper colored) to provide smoother/more reliable feeding, go faster and minimize the need to clean your barrel. This is the really nice stuff that winchester makes specifically to feed reliably in finicky .22lr AR-15s and other ""picky"" guns that like to fail to feed other types/brands of ammo. Although they were designed with the feeding problems of .22lr ARs in mind, they work just great in any other .22lr gun also, my 10/22 just eats them up...  The lot numbers on all of the boxes are 2HA20L and 1HA80L.

Rifle has a low round count and is in excellent condition. The 6.8 round can fit into regular ar mags but due to it being a wider round it can only fit around 15 before the mag starts to bulge. The spc was developed by the military for special forces who needed more knock down power than a 5.56 but less than a 7.62. The round is excellent and the only down fall of it is that it's only been around for 10 years so the rounds aren't as cheap as a 5.56 but then again it's in mine and most others opinion a much better round! If u have any questions about it just let me know and I'll try to answer them the best I can?"

It will come with the pistol, hard case, paperwork, two larger back straps, cleaning rod/brush, four 15rd mags one of which is marked LE/Gov only for you glock buffs about a $50 value. I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol. Due to this being my last .40 I am also adding 100rds of FMJ and 55rds of quality jacketed hallow points. I am putting the specs from glocks web-sight below. I'm valuing the pistol and one mag alone at $600 and $120-$150 for the extras, I will take $700 cash for the package. I also have another add up for silver coins so check out my other listings.

The Remington R51 Handgun is a modern version of Remington's original Model 51, designed in 1915 by John Pedersen. The Model 51, considered ahead of its time, became one of General George Patton's personal side-arms during World War II. The Remington R51 Handgun modernizes and updates Pedersen's design to work with 9mm Luger and .40 Smith & Wesson cartridges while maintaining the personality, shooting characteristics and size of the original. The R51 averages 25% less muzzle flip with the lowest bore axis in the industry. It has intuitive pointing characteristics with optimized grip angle.

Its just a safe queen and I don't see that ever changing.  Time to pass it on to someone that will use it the way it needs to be used.

The Gun:
If you are not familiar with the Sig 556. Think of it as a Swiss precision AK47 that fires the .223/5.56 round. Overall the gun is as reliable as an AK (if not more) but with the accuracy and recoil of an AR15. Accepts any AR15 magazine. This is a SIG 556 Classic Rifle. Chrome lined barrel, 2 stage gas piston driven action. Adjustable factory trigger, Iron front sight, pop up backup rear & Diopter rear sight.  Sig 551 front hand guards, Vltor Flah suppressor, Magpul trigger guard and Magpul UBR collapsible stock. The gun maybe has 200 rounds through it and it is spotless inside and out. 

Optic:
The optic is a Trijicon Tri Power (battery, fiber optic, tritium night sight) mounted on an A.R.M.S. Quick detach mount. The Tri power is a zero magnification Chevron Reticle combat sight. Also has a removable Anti-Reflection Device.

Extras: I will include 1 USGI 30rnd mag, a Magpul single point sling, and a 5.11 Tactical Black Soft Case.

$1350 takes all - CASH ONLY!!!  I will sell just the rifle (no optic or case) for $1000 Cash!
Before I get another insulting lowball offer.

Sig 556 Classic: $1550
Sig 551 Handguards: $120
Sig Diopter Sight: $250
Magpul Stock: $250
Vltor Flash Hider: $50
Trijcon Tri Power & Anti-Reflection Device : $650
A.R.M.S. Mount: $110
Sling: $50
Case: $75
I paid = over $3000, so my asking price is more than fair and I would be fine keeping it. I am in no critical need to sell and I will not give it away.

I am located in Viroqua WI 54665, but can meet in La Crosse 54603. I will not travel anywhere else. Face to face transaction - no shipping."

Trijicon SA37 Smith & Wesson Three Dot Front & Rear Night Sight Set fits all Smith & Wesson M&P Weapons .

Trijicon Smith & Wesson M&P 3 Dot Front & Rear Nightsights are designed and assembled with the optimum combination of strength and safety. The patented aluminum cylinder and sapphire lens construction cannot be equaled. The brightness obtained from the tritium content is focused through the sapphire lens to give the maximum possible illumination. Because the sight blades are machined from steel rather than cast, their strength is unsurpassed. Trijicon night sights are the brightest, strongest and safest.

- White Rings: All Trijicon Night Sights feature a white ring around the glowing dots for unequalled daylight visibility.

- Silicone Rubber Cushion: Gives additional shock-protection to tritium filled glass lamps within the aluminum housing.

- Trijicon Tritium Phosphor Lamp: Glass lamps filled with pressurized tritium gas glow bright green, yellow or orange at night. The lamps are guaranteed to last 12 years (green or yellow lamps).

- Protective Aluminum Cylinders: Contains and protects the tritium gas filled lamps from heave recoil and harsh cleaning solvents.

- Sapphire Window: Each Trijicon Tritium Lamp is capped with a Sapphire Jewel which helps to evenly distribute the light from the tritium lamps as well as protect it from solvents and puncture."

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel. We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle."

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor."

 It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

 Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor"

Glock extended slide release 
24lb recoil spring installed on a stainless guide rod for very hot loads
Ameriglo tritium fiber sights
Talon rubber style grip panel
KKM Precision 6"" barrel, which makes this handgun legal for hunting.

Gun shoots fantastically, the trigger is a smooth 4ish pounds, but I'm just not a huge fan of the Glock ergonomics and I'm tired of compromising(we all want what we want, right?). I also have everything needed to reload 10mm if the buyer is interested, but this stuff is not included in the price.
Lee carbide 4 die set for 40/10 
some IMR 800X 
~500 220 grain plated bullets,
 lots of Starline brass

If you have balls of steel and perhaps a little faith in a higher power, using the KKM barrel and 24 lb recoil spring you can load those 220 grain bullets to 1350+ fps, which is closing in on factory 44 magnum loads(with recoil to match).
