The guy I bought it from had it sitting around for years in a ""chest"" as he called it. I bought it still in the cosmoline, I have tried my best to remove 99.7% of this stuff.

It was made in 1968 if I recall correctly at the famous factory 26. Again very good condition chrome lined barrel shines very bright.

I put 3 boxes through it, and decided I didnt like it.
It is a Czechoslovakian design, resembling the '47.  It has a few nicer features, however.  It has a bolt hold open device, a hooded front sight, nicer furniture, milled receiver (most AKs are stamped) and (at least to me), it's more accurate than the '47s I have fired.
The design, is a short stroke piston, without a gas tube, so that means it will run cleaner, but, the handguards get hotter faster. 
It comes with one magazine.  I have more pictures, if you would like to see them.

This is a controlled round feed rifle that was made in New Haven, Connecticut back when Winchester was Winchester. It has a bead-blasted non-reflective matt finish. When I got the rifle it was ""used"" but hadn't even been broken in. I broke in the rifle, cleaning between every shot with JB Bore Bright for 10 rounds, then every other round for the next 10 rounds. Once I adjusted the BOSS for the bullets I was shooting I found it was a shooter — as I then shot sub .5"" groups with factory Weatherby 180 grain shells!

For those that don't know the BOSS system, it is a system for tuning the harmonics of the barrel to match your load instead of having to find a load that will work with a specific rifle. The system WORKS! The standard BOSS is a muzzle-brake (with ports angled forward to reduce muzzle blast) that can be adjusted to lengthen or shorten the barrel to change barrel harmonics. I also have a stainless steel BOSS-CR (never used) that is interchangeable with the standard BOSS for when you want to adjust barrel harmonics for improved accuracy but do not want a muzzle-brake — and the muzzle blast from a brake. Many outfitters & guides do not want muzzle brakes as they can do serious ear damage to hunting guides or others in the party. The BOSS-CR is made for those times. (I don't believe they still make the BOSS-CR, so this item is effectively priceless.) Once harmonics are adjusted you can change between the BOSS and BOSS-CR without loss of accuracy.

This rifle weighs just 7 pounds 9 3/4 ounces with the BOSS and yet handles the .300 Weatherby round quite well. It is a perfect mountain elk & Muley cary-rifle, light enough to cary yet heavy enough to tame the recoil and shoot well. It would also make an excellent ""bean field rifle"" as the .300 Weatherby is capable of taking a whitetail at more than 1,000 yards!

The only blemish is a small rub mark on the bottom of the magazine door where a sling buckle vibrated against it in a double case. This could easily be removed with bead-blasting if someone wanted to. There are no other blemishes!

Although I did put around 45 rounds through this rifle breaking in the barrel and sighting it in, I have never hunted with it.

The only reason I'm putting it up for sale is that a friend gave me a stainless Mark-V in .300 Weatherby and I have no way to justify two .300 Weatherby rifles for one hunter. (Selling a rifle or 2 should make the wife happy, and when she's happy...)

Asking $1,150 with both BOSS & BOSS-CR. I'm open to trades. Currently I'm looking for an offshore boat (23-28'), trailer & associated gear, a 10-22 stainless, a nice .410 or 28 gauge & QUALITY optics. (I can add cash if necessary.) I'm not looking for modern pistols or ARs. MAKE ME AN OFFER!"

I am selling this firearm because I need the cash to stay afloat so I have been selling a few of the more expensive parts of my collection. This 1911 retail is $1,080.00. I have also added the following value to the firearm.

Paint Job - $50,
Extra Magazine - $40,

TLE II total value - $1,600.00 But I understand the item is used and the color may be a turn off for buyers. Which brings us to what I perceive to be a fair value for the gun given my predicament. 
This beautiful firearm has been lightly used in a few small local tournaments around the Phoenix valley. I'd say I have shot about 500 rounds through this 1911.

976,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2202976,For Sale:  New Glock 19 / G19 - Gen 3 + Adjustable Rear Sight,"Brinkley, Arkansas, United States",$ 415,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 9, 2013",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"When Gaston Glock introduced his Austrian duty pistol into the U.S. market, American gun-buying habits were transformed. Despite (or because of) the furore surrounding Glock’s “plastic” pistol—supposedly invisible to airport metal detectors—consumers and police departments were fascinated by the “wonder nine.” When they shot a Glock the resulting revelation spurred sales to unimaginable heights. The original G17 was lighter than all-metal pistols of comparable size, held more ammo and proved to be as trusty as a canine companion. As Gen4 enters circulation, the question looms: has time been kind to the Black Labrador of pistols?
Glock introduced the Gen4 Glock 19 in the middle of 2010. As befits the gunmaker’s evolutionary approach, the move from G19 3.0 to 4.0 was about as radical as a member of the John Birch Society. I received my Gen4 G19 in the usual black lunch box emblazoned with an XXL Glock logo. As someone who believes discretion is the better part of avoiding a Terry Stop, I would have preferred something more subtle. That locks.
Kudos to Glock for packaging the G19 with three fifteen-round magazines (accounting for part of the $50 up-charge from Gen3). In states that have enacted profoundly ignorant “anti-spree killer” high-capacity magazine laws, a buyer receives two emasculated ten-rounders. In Massachusetts, where new Glocks can’t lawfully be sold by any MA dealers to any MA consumers, buyers will receive nothing but the box, empty.
The kit includes the minimalist Glock speedloader, cleaning tools and a manual in 47 languages (including Sanskrit). There’s also a gun safety booklet tucked into the box, in case a buyer thinks The Four Rules of Gun Safety are a Tolkein thing.
I always found Glock pistols to be unnecessarily ugly, and as ungainly looking as broom-handled Mausers. Certainly, I’m aware that they’re fighting guns and not objets d’art, but still, there’s no reason for Glocks to look like they were designed by the local plumbing contractor.
The G19 Gen4 is not a bad-looking gun. I know. Crazy, huh? Those who like the “all handle, no slide” look of the G17 need only to add a palm swell to restore the iconic ugly look. With no palm-swell installed, the G19 is a well-proportioned piece. The sandpaper finish adds a touch of je ne sais quoi (that’s French for WTF), and the gun looks put-together, not thrown together. I’d still be embarrassed to display this pistol next to a Kimber Solo Carry STS, but the G19 has come a long way, baby.
The Gen4 design sports the same the finger-grooved handle of the Gen3. Owners who thought that the grooves were groovy on the Gen3 will find them no more or less groovy on the Gen4, since they’re the same groovy grooves. Those, like me, who hated the grooves will continue to hate them with great passion and conviction.To improve the G19′s grip-ability in moist conditions, the semi’s handle now sports a highly textured finish, bringing all of us one step closer to the elusive goal of shower carry. Since all things Glockian must have a snappy name or a number, Glock’s hard-charging marketing mavens call it their “Rough Texture Frame (RTF)” technology. Not to rain on other guns’ parades, but RTF is GTG (Good to Go); it makes an appreciable difference in humid or precipitous precipitate situations.
The obvious big deal here: Glock’s Smith & Wesson M&P and Springfield XD-chasing “Modular Back Strap System.” As it sits in the box, the G19′s handle is more slender than the Gen3, decreasing the distance-to trigger by .08”. The pistol can be used as it comes; the handle is completely finished with the aforesaid RTF.
Should the G19′s handle prove too small, the owner can add either a medium or a large palm-swell. The medium attachment adds .08” to the present handle, bringing it back to Gen3 dimensions. The large back strap adds an additional .08” to the handle, making it suitable for the hands of a mountain gorilla.I experimented with the palm-swells to determine my best setup. By way of comparison, I shoot my S&W M&P 40c with the medium back strap installed, so I first tried the G19 with no back strap. Hooray and hallelujah, the handle geometry was as comfortable as a cashmere sweater on a chilly day. Finally, I had found a Glock that didn’t feel like a block. That’s the good part. The bad part was that the trigger now seemed too close. I installed the medium back strap to lengthen the distance twixt palm and trigger. This resulted in a trigger length that was perfect, but made the stock too thick for my hands. Just for giggles, I tried the large back strap. It made the gun very clumsy and brought back unfond memories of the Desert Eagle that I recently tested. I settled on no back strap as the best compromise for me.
Changing backstraps is easy, but, like any gun club you care to mention, not tool-free. Glock provides a small and a large pin to hold the selected back strap in place, and a little T-shaped punch tool to push the pin in or out of its hidey-hole. The process starts with knocking out the small pin, which is already installed in the pistol.Thumb pressure it all that’s required to push out the pin. The owner mat then snap an extra back strap into position. Push the correct-sized pin into the hole to hold the whole shooting match together, and that’s that. Installing the medium or large back strap with the proper pin takes just a minute and presto chango, the pistol is re-sized.
The hexagonal rifling of the G19s barrel carries on Glock’s tradition of polygonal rifling—as opposed to conventional lands and grooves—across its pistol line. Glock claims its rifling creates a tighter seal of bullet to barrel and reduced barrel fouling. While the data remains in-house, gunmakers have been using polygonal rifling since the 16th century. So we’ll call it good.The Glock 19′s new dual recoil springs have been the G4′s headline attraction—and not in a good way.According to Glock, the new dual-nested springs were included to soften recoil and lengthen the spring’s lifespan. Similar springs have been used in handguns for a long time. Yes but—how do you improve on perfection? More to the point, Glocks have been good, reliable and strong firearms, springs included. Why fix what ain’t broke?
Reduced recoil? 9mm Glocks have never recoiled harshly. Perhaps they were flippier than some and less flippy than others, but nobody thinks of flippiness or harsh recoil as Glock characteristics. Increased lifespan? That didn’t work out so well. The new springs—called the “Recoil Spring Assembly (RSA)” in Glock spiel—was troublesome. At best. Owners reported Failure to Feed (FTF) and Failure to Eject (FTE) problems as soon as the first Gen4 G17s hit the market.
Users cured these FTF and FTE problems by installing a set of Gen3 springs with a little adapter. Glock moved quickly to head off a PR nightmare and offered replacement RSAs to its customers. In Glock-speak, this was called an “upgrade,” not a recall.
The replacements seem to be doing their job. Today’s buyers may plunk down their hard-earned cash without fear that their springs will fall by summer, leaving them with a winter of discontent. Moreover, the middle-school rumor mill that we call “the gun culture” is all quiet on the Glock front, reaffirming that the new springs are working as they should across the Glock pistol line.Glock polymer sights, with their single dot front and funky, squared-off U insert in the rear, have never been a favorite of mine. The sights on my G19 tester were worse than I remembered. Not enough light passes along the sides of the front sight, so shooting with “equal light” is difficult. The problem isn’t that the front blade is too wide, it’s that the 6” sight radius is too short. Were the sight radius longer, the front blade would block less of the rear and all would be fine with the world. Alas, the sight radius won’t change, but the problem can be rectified by installing better sights.
The G19 weighs under 21 ounces and seems even lighter. While the gun does seem a tad top-heavy, it still balances like a ballerina and points well, too. The gun’s geometry remains unchanged from Gen1, so Glock fans will be comfortable with the Gen4. Down to business . . .
I first loaded five rounds of crappy range ammo into a 15 round mag. I used a traditional 6 o’clock hold to get a good feel for the pistol’s true point of impact. At five yards, I was an inch and a half low-left. I noticed that I was depressing the trigger with my fingertip, not the pad. I never shoot with my fingertip, but with the small backstrap on the gun, my fingertip just went to the trigger automatically. I had to really concentrate on using the pad of my trigger finger with this pistol.
My next two shots, using the pad, rectified the low part of my marksmanship and hit in the same hole. After tiny adjustment of my sight picture, I was on target with two in the red.The trigger was a revelation. I found it just a little bit mushy, but very light for one that’s rated at 5.5 lbs. The reset was not as “clicky” or crisp as other Glock’s that I’ve shot, but all things considered, it’s a damn good trigger. After running through several boxes with two hands and gaining tremendous confidence in the pistol, I decided to try one-handed shooting.
I was surprised that my first shot was a flyer, but then I realized that I had used my fingertip yet again. Making the proper adjustment."
