Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

New from SIG SAUER®, the P238 SAS. The pistol has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry. It’s just a fraction of the size of our full-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with custom wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P238 SAS is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

It  isn't pristine but is in good shape for a 31 year old rifle. It has some scratches on the A3 stock arms where they usually scratch. I added the MP5 hand guard and ""S & F"" clipped and pinned plastic trigger housing (for the MP5 look), it also comes with the original slim hand guard, tactical aluminum hand guard made for Picatinny rails and a  ""S,E,F"" trigger housing. It has the Trijicon glowing front sight. It has one German magazine and 3 Korean magazines from HkParts(third gen mags). I did replace the ""H"" recoil button in the stock, the old one was dried and cracked rubber. I am ONLY interested in a 14.5"" 416 upper or an MR762(depending on what comes with the MR762 on the trade).

The grips are very worn and there is a screw missing.   Otherwise in pretty great condition.  I am the second owner, and I did not shoot it much.  Previous owner was police officer.  Well taken care of and oiled.

I am selling because I am far more accurate with a Springfield 1911, and this gun, though it looks beautiful and is super easy to tale apart, is just too big for my tiny hands.

Terms for transfer are that we will meet at a pawn shop and you will get $5 loan on the gun, which you can turn around and pay for immediately requiring you to fill out the 4473 paperwork as well as signing an affidavit stating the gun is your property, thus transfering it into your name.

Mossberg ATR 100 30-06.  This rifle is brand new!  Never had one shot through it.  I bought this ATR right before Thanksgiving and as luck would have it; I received a different 30-06 for Christmas.  This is the ONLY reason for the sale.  

This ATR 100 IMHO is a very quality entry level rifle.  While handling it (and its direct competition) I felt like this was the most bang-for-the-buck.  I comes with a 3x9 optic that seems to be able to get the job done (but remember I haven't personally fired this weapon).  The thing that I have been most impressed with was the LBT Trigger.  This is Mossberg's version of the AccuTrigger.  It is very crisp and light.

The rifle will come in the origional box with all of the literature from the manufacturer.

This is a great tactical carbine rifle..  these are a very limited production rifles, in fact, they are a spill over from a police force that ordered too many of these rifles from savage and backed out on the deal..  most savage 10's are 20 inches or more, but this 18 inch factory threaded model and is very hard to find. The value of this piece, in box or out, will increase rapidly.   Built on the reliable savage 10 action, she's already factory threaded and capped for muzzle brake or silencer! Black Light weight synthetic target stock (two front swivels and flat bench-rest shape for end), the ever so famous Savage Accu Trigger, removable 4 shot mag, and a very awesome tactical Oversized bolt Handle for a quick + smooth reload. 

I really do love these little PSR's.. only reason I am selling this one is because it is an extra one that still retains full value because it is new in box, and i am trying to fund a lil project within the next week or so. thanks for looking.

I've taken it to the range 3 times, putting about 50 rounds through it each time.  It looks new.  I found it just a bit too big to pocket carry, which is why I got it so I switched to a Bodyguard 380.  So now this one is for sale.  I have the original box and both mags.  I can add in an additional 7 round mag for $20 (they are $40 retail) and a leather IWB holster for $30 ($60 retail).  

So for $439 no tax you can walk with a CCW weapon with a holster and 3 mags.  At a store this would run you about $550 plus tax or $590 or so.  

This gun is mint, take advantage of my decision to go with pocket carry as opposed to IWB.

You take care of background & ffl -- please don't email with lower offer, I priced it lower than all other shields listed this is the best buy on armslist for a shield.  Not interested in trade except for S&W revolvers in 38 or 357."

Up for sale my Ruger SR40C. There was a lot of upgrades done and i would not sell it but need some cash. First there is night sights installed ($100 upgrade). Second as you can see from pictures stainless steel guide rod with 20lbs spring set installed instead of cheap plastic ($45 upgrade).And third Ghost 3.5 Lb trigger disconector and made a huge difference in trigger feel and reset ($30 upgrade). Honest 250 rds shot without single problem. Also i will include 2 leather holsters. 1st- Gould & Goodrich Of Back Holster ($50) and 2nd- Galco Wraith Holster ($30). Very nice and accurate gun for concealed carry. If you buy this gun from the store with all upgrades and extras it would cost you $628+tax.

I would like to point out that this is completely false, and will have NO noticeable affect on our ammunition supply. Ammo smelters use recycled lead, which there is a great supply of. There are also many smaller smelters that will remain open and keep on supplying us with our lead fix. Imagine it like this: Honda is closing down so Nissan's will be hard to find and expensive to buy. In reality the closing smelter didn't have much to do with lead for ammo anyways, so we should have no reason to worry.

808,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2521808,For Sale:  Radom VIS 35 Pistol with Original BNZ Code Holster & Ammo,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, April 1, 2014",Handguns,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Many say that the Radom VIS 35 was THE BEST sidearm in WWII no matter which side you were on. 

The handgun for sale today is a great example of a Type 2 pistol meaning that most of features of the Type 1 pistols that Radom produced before the war remain. 

A Type 2 pistol retains the original 3 lever design and is made from quality materials with very good workmanship. It differs from a pre-war pistol in that it does not have the shoulder stock slot and it's salt blued instead of the more labor intensive rust blue process used on pre-war models. 

This pistol is in excellent condition retaining at least 90% of it's original salt blued finish. Grips are crisp and clean with no chips or cracks. The bore is in amazing condition with strong rifling and a mirror bright appearance. It's mechanically tight and functions perfectly. The numbers match - frame, slide and barrel. 

My research indicates the pistol was made in the first quarter of 1943. The Waffenamt WaA77 is stamped on both the frame and slide indicating it was produced in Poland while under Nazi occupation. 

Pistol comes with 1 factory original magazine and 1 post war production replacement mag that I purchased years ago. Also included is an original holster that is stamped in green ink BNZ 1944 & P35. Holster is made from medium brown leather and is in great condition as well. Original Nazi holsters like this fetch $200 and higher all the time on eBay. 

Finally there are (3) 16 round boxes of real Nazi WWII production 9mm ammo included. Ammo is packed in it's original UNOPENED boxes which are in unbelievably good condition for their 1944 production date. Boxes are stamped with manufacturer code ak 25. They also bear the letters mE. which means the bullets have iron cores. 

Bottom line is that this is one fine collection of WWII history all put together and ready to go, and it's sure to increase in value in the future. 

Asking $1000 for everything. Local sales only - no shipping. Buyer must be a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old and be able to legally own a firearm.

RTF stands for rough texture finish, this means the frame has a rough texture grip. 
This limited edition came with a fish scale cut slide instead of the stock vertical cut slide.
This gun has around 500 rounds shot down range, it does have slight slide wear but this gun has been well taken care of. I have swapped the stock guide rod for the Glockworx 18lb competition stainless steel guide rod. I also replace the small magazine release for an extended lone wolf release. I also replaced the safety plunger with Glockworx titanium safety plunger and striker pin. I am selling the gun .2 factory magazines. aftermarket rock island arms case, factory pistol lock, 50 rounds federal fmj and around 45 rounds Fiocchi frangible ammo. I might be able to include 3 more magazines if the price is right. 
I will include the original guide rod and mag release, I can include the receipts if you like.
I would like 700 for everything. I will consider reasonable offers, I know this pistol is hard to find and I have been told by a few gun shops 700 is fair to ask for this model.
I really do not need trades  I am just looking to sell thanks 700 obo."

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

It IS in every way nut and bolt a winchester model 70. If you ever needed to fix you would by model 70 parts. It was manufactured by winchester to be resold under the model 53 Ted Williams for sears roe and buck co. There is no difference between the two brand versions other then the stamp on barrel.

 My price reflects this because a winchester stamped in this condition would be worth $500+ no extras.  This rifle is worth $350 firm, with well over $200 in brand new and used hardware."
