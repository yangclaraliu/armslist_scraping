This pistol has been carried for a number of years, so there is the expected amount of holster wear on the slide, but shot very little, so everything is in very good overall condition. This G19 is also a generation 2, which means it has the out-of-production, but quite desirable frame with no finger grooves. In other words, if you don't like the gen3/4 finger grooves, give the gen2 a try.

Includes Glock clamshell hard case and two 15-round factory magazines (one is the original LE-marked, the other is ambi-cut).

Comes with an Southwest Shooting Authority dry fire kit, with the trigger pull weight matched to this gun. Awesome dry fire trigger, uses slightly modified Glock factory trigger parts to duplicate the Glock trigger take-up, break, and reset. Easy to install and remove, as it replaces the entire trigger assembly and drops in as a unit. Nice to have if you are having trouble locating 9mm ammo.

Also, comes with a Raven Vanguard 2 holster, see http://www.ravenconcealment.com/vanguard-2-holster-full-kit. Great quick on/off holster, works with any Glock, not just the model 19.

Looking for a fellow shooter that can benefit from this ready-to-go carry package built around the always rugged and reliable Glock 19.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

There are 3 presses included in this offer.I have many pounds of brass,powder,primers and bullets included with this setup.I use LEE presses combined with Redding and RCBS Dies. Any issues that LEE has been known to have like the auto priming on their turret presses have been resolved by me with proper fixes so this setup is very reliable and you will be able to have ammo ready to shoot within an hour or so of getting it home.


INVENTORY LIST 

LEE Load Master 5 Station Turret Press
 with auto priming of both large and small primers and 4 tube auto loading brass station with sorter at the top to allow you to dump your brass in and it corrects the orientation and readys the brass for easy pressing. This press also comes with the powder hopper to allow you to do everything and generate 1 complete round per pull of the handle. 

LEE Auto-Disk Charge Bar (New In Package)
for use with the powder hopper. This bar allows you even more precise powder loads as it's adjustable.

LEE Breech Lock Challenger Press (Priming system is still NEW IN BOX)
this press has an auto priming system that allows for easy priming of large and small primers utilizing a gravity feed system.This is a single stage press and comes in handy for other things you may wish to set up so that you don't have to change out your 5 stage or the other single stage press.This press also includes a powder hopper that you can manually dispense measured powder charges. This is awesome for rifle calibers and makes things go fast and easy.

LEE Single Stage Press
Having an extra press is never a bad thing. I utilized this press most often to set up the Bulge Buster station that properly sizes the 45 ACP rounds after they expand in a large battery chamber such as Glock would have.

LEE Bulge Buster 
this is a great way to fully size your brass by pressing it all the way through a sizing die and getting a factory sized brass. Removes any and all warp and bulge.

RCBS Stuck Case Remover (New In Packaging)

Hornady 3 In 1 Electric deburring and primer pocket cleaning station.

From the manufacturer:

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6.  ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges).

-------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY OF OUR GLOCK CONVERSION KITS
Our Glock Conversion Kits are made to work on FACTORY STOCK Glock frames.
Note:  Aftermarket parts such as trigger bars and connectors, especially the Ghost Connector, can adversely affect the function and reliability of your conversion kit.


We highly recommend Remington ""Golden Bullets"" for everyday plinking and CCI MiniMags or Federal Automatch for better accuracy.

If you have any questions would like more pictures, or would like more information feel free to contact me. I will respond swiftly. Upon purchase I will need to see a valid Ohio ID and if you are a felon please don't contact me. I will not sell to you under any circumstances. Weapon will be sold unloaded in box and face to face in a public place. I am willing to drive a short distance to meet you. 

I would really rather have cash but as far as trades go, I would consider a sig p226 (9mm pref with rail), Saiga AK (no underfolders or Wasers please), HK USP 45 (doesn't have to be new or fancy), possibly an AR-15, and that's really about it. 

Otherwise the 1911 is $650 OBO. Let me know what you have. Worst I can say is no or work a different deal out! Please don't low ball, I don't have to sell."

This chamber is in between .223 and 5.56. Accepts both cartridges, but shoots much tighter groups from my experience. 

From Rock River's web sight: ""The .223 Wylde chamber was designed as a match chambering for semi-automatic rifles. It will accommodate both .223 Rem and 5.56mm NATO ammunition. It is relieved in the case body to aid in extraction and features a shorter throat for improved accuracy.""

I've shot around 100 rounds through this barrel. The barrel itself is a tack driver. Sub moa accuracy every time I have shot it. I changed my AR to a different setup and no longer have any need for this. Comes with a low profile gas block that I ground down from a picatinny setup. These run $280 new from Rock River not including shipping or the gas block. Last I checked there was a wait time as well.

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT: Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1. ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6. ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges).

-------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY OF OUR GLOCK CONVERSION KITS
Our Glock Conversion Kits are made to work on FACTORY STOCK Glock frames.
Note: Aftermarket parts such as trigger bars and connectors, especially the Ghost Connector, can adversely affect the function and reliability of your conversion kit.


We highly recommend Remington ""Golden Bullets"" for everyday plinking and CCI MiniMags or Federal Automatch for better accuracy.

New this kit retails for $299, I am selling for $225, will consider shipping. This kit does NOT include the Glock lower. Just the upper an the magazines.

Wingmaster vs Express -  internal parts  essentially be the same gun,  some more time in machine finishing for the Wingmaster and a prettier blue finish, extra chokes and  stock wood -otherwise interchangeable part for part with the Express.
 The  express has a modified choke  a good ""catch all"" solution that will work for rifled slugs, buckshot or birdshot at normal ranges. Not all shooters need more than one choke... and the wingmaster costs more than double this express but doesn't shoot twice as well.

The bore on this thing is like a mirror. The finish does have some spots of rust and pitting but not an unexpected amount for a 100+ year old gun. The last patent date on this is 1901. The wood is pretty rough shape but again its seen its share of miles. The important part, the action, locks up tight  and functions as it should. All the important parts are there including the often missing top shroud, ladder sights, etc. Does not have any government markings that I could find. Priced to sell. $500. Action is solid but the gun  is far from perfect, of course if it were perfect I'd be asking a whole lot more."

The MP-25 is a .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol developed by George Jennings in the late 1960s. In 1970, Jennings designed the inexpensive MP-25 pistol and founded Raven Arms, which was also known as the original Ring of Fire company. A 1968 federal gun-control law prohibiting the importation of inexpensive handguns prompted Jennings to enter the firearms business.
Before Jennings developed the MP-25, a friend who owned a small gun and pawn shop complained to Jennings, ""I can't buy these guns any more, and I used to sell 500 of them a month."" At the time, Jennings was running a machine shop that made parts for Southern California aerospace companies. Together, they cornered the market on small, inexpensive handguns, often called ""Saturday night specials."" Raven Arms was born. 
Over the next 20 years, the company sold approximately 2 million pistols. In parallel with this growth, gun-control advocates started pushing legislation in Washington, in state capitals, and in city councils to ban inexpensive weapons.
In November 1991, a fire destroyed the Raven Arms factory. The mainstay of the new company is still the .25-caliber Raven model. Phoenix also  ""designed for personal protection as well as sport and target shooting.""
As detailed in a 1992 article by Wall Street Journal reporter Alix Freedman, from an interview with Bruce Jennings, Jennings calls himself ""the leading expert in the world on Saturday Night Specials."" Jennings rejects charges that his family's inexpensive guns play a greater role in crime than more expensive guns made by up-scale manufacturers. Bruce Jennings founded Bryco Arms in 1992. According to the ATF, George Jennings' son-in-law, Jim Davis, founded Davis Industries, and Lorcin Engineering was launched by Jim Waldorf, one of Bruce Jennings' old high school friends. These companies and several others also linked to Jennings are known in the trade as the ""Ring of Fire.""

Its a very nice piece of gear but its not something that I really need. Text me your offer or trade items to 931-312-9I22. Be prepared for a very quick response as I will respond just as soon as I get your message. Don't message me and then not check your email for a week because the first decent offer I get, this puppy is gone! And don't contact me if you're not serious about buying or trading...

Its a great shooting gun, its sighted in at 100 yards and shoots a 6 inch diameter pattern no problem.  It is completely torn down and cleaned after each time being shot.  It does not have a threaded barrel, since it is a later model it has the pinned barrel (which some claim to be more accurate over the threaded).

1- Sig Sauer Generation 2 P250 9mm Sub Compact Xchange Kit w/ 2 mags,

1- Sig Sauer CPL-RM Compact Pistol laser,
1- P250 Xgrip,
4- Sig Sauer black plastic cases,
1- cardboard Sig Sauer box.

The .40 compact is new in box, never fired and still Sig banded. The .45 compact is LNIB. The sub compacts have night sights, the compacts have high contrast sights. The .357 barrel can drop into the .40 compact kit and uses the same spring and guide rod as the .40 Xchange kit. The mags for the .357 are stamped "".357"" but will run .40 (they are the same magazines otherwise). The compact mags in 9mm and .40 fit the sub compact models and I have the a Xgrip attachment that can fill the void (I really like the running a sub compact with the compact mag an Xgrip). The barrel to the sub compact 9mm, .40 and the .357 compact show minor cosmetic wear on the outside of the barrel, in the normal spots. Everything else is LNIB in the package. 

If I piece the package out I can make $2,600 with nine sales. I rather make one sale or trade than deal with the yahoo's here. I am not separating the package and my cash price is pretty firm at $2,000.

Low Ball offers and crazy trade offers will be ignored, or made fun of. I WILL NOT separate. If you ask to separate, I will ignore you or make fun of you. I will send pic's if you have serious interest, kick the tires as much as you want my email.  

I prefer local FTF in the Cincinnati area but will not sale the package to Nick Smith. I will ship from my FFL to your FFL but you are paying for shipping.

This rifle is less than 2 years old.  I don't have an actual round count but has less than 100 rounds through it as I only shot the expensive hornady ammo so it was used sparingly.  This rifle comes with a bi pod and an EGW 20MOA elevated one piece base.  There is one sling attaching point on the buttstock and two on the foregrip.  The metal is like a matte black and is in great condition overall, no nicks or scratches.  ALWAYS cleaned after shooting as I enjoy taking care of my firearms just as much as shooting them.  Also stored in a dehumidified safe.

It is very difficult to find anything concealable in that round and especially not for around $400.00. I found something wrong with every conceal carry .45 until I came across this one I and my wife together have fired 300 rounds through it and it functions flawlessly. Reports on this gun is that it will always function flawlessly and I don't see that being. It is solid (all metal except for polymer grip pads). It can be carried hammer down in double action, cocked and locked in single action. I'm selling it because it is what I gave the wife as her carry pistol and she (don't laugh) wants something pink... I agree... not my first selling point but at least she wants to carry. I don't intend to charge markup for it which is usually the case.
