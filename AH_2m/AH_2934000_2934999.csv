1911 Magazine, .45 ACP, Full-Size, 7 Round, Lo-Profile Steel Base Pad, Black

  For the past three decades Wilson Combat has produced some the worlds best, most reliable magazine for the timeless .45 ACP. Considered a top tier magazine, they've been proven to be some of the most durable and reliable magazines in the industry. 

  Made form the highest tensile strength heavy duty spring wire, these magazines are able to remain fully loaded for prolonged periods of time without becoming fatigued and resulting in long service life. The springs are specifically designed to produce sure feeding and to prevent side-to-side movement of the ammunition within the magazine. 

  The magazine body is made of .027"" aircraft grade certified 17-7 PH stainless steel and heat treated. This process produces a precision magazine which will not hang-up when changing magazines, and the feed lips remain intact and don't crack even under severe duty use. 

  FEATURES:
 • Increased Reliability

• Resists Corrosion

• Thickest walls in the industry

• Maximum Durability and Service Life

• Fiber-filled Nylon Self-Lubricating Follower Provides Smooth Round Feeding

• Maximum Tensile Strength Heavy Duty Spring

• Enhanced Feeding and Positive Slide Lock Operation﻿

• ﻿Lo-Profile Steel Base Pad means easy Maintenance and Versitile Base Pad Options

• Rugged black MELONITE QPQ nitride surface﻿ treatment provides enhanced surface finish and lubricity; will NOT crack, peel or rust﻿

• Witness Slots on both sides for rapid round-count checks

• Extended skirt on follower prevents creep when magazine is empty

• ﻿Enhanced base pad provides sure grip when reloading providing faster reloads

Here's all you ever wanted to know about a Kimber Gold Match, from Kimber

                                         Kimber Gold Match Details


Kimber machinists and inspectors, along with computerized measuring machines perform over 200 inspections during the manufacturing and assembly process. Any part found to be out of tolerance is discarded. Recently, the manager of our Customer Service Department assembled a pistol from discarded parts and used it in IPSC competition. He won the first match fired with this pistol and still uses it today.

Equaled only by custom pistols from America's finest pistolsmiths, Gold Match models are the finest 1911 pistols ever manufactured. They combine the features of the Custom Target with a stainless steel match grade barrel, premium aluminum match grade trigger, extended ambidextrous thumb safety and double diamond rosewood grips. Finished in a deep polished blue or stainless steel on the flats with satin finishes on the curves, they look as good as they shoot.

Barrels are machined oversized, then fitted by hand to the slide, frame and barrel bushing. This ensures competition-winning accuracy. Still, the incomparable quality of each Gold Match is the result of state-of-the-art manufacturing. For example, Kimber is the only company with the technology to make forged frames from start to finish on computer driven machines. Many pistolsmiths purchase our finished frames and slides due to their unequaled quality.

During manufacturing a frame is mated with a slide. They travel through the factory together and are continually evaluated to make sure every part added is perfectly matched. Following final assembly pistols are mounted on a machine that cycles the slide hundreds of times in rapid succession. The follow up inspection assures that the critical fit between slide and frame meets exacting standards. Then we test fire each one and conduct a final inspection. Kimber follows this testing procedure for every pistol.

While Gold Match pistols are designed for competition, standard features make them ideal for carry and defense. Corners are rounded and blended to prevent snagging. The rear of the slide is relieved so the sight sets low, encouraging the pistol to point naturally. Dependability, the single most important quality in any defensive situation, is second to none. A Gold Match is quite simply the finest full size 1911 pistol you can buy.

Gold Match - All the features of the Custom Target (Details) along with highly polished deep blue finish, match grade stainless steel barrel fitted by hand to spherical match grade barrel bushing, extended ambidextrous thumb safety, select hand checkered double diamond rosewood grips, new premium skeletonized aluminum match grade trigger.

Stainless Gold Match - Identical to the Gold Match, with frame and slide machined from the finest stainless steel forgings. Highly polished finish on flats, satin finish on the curves. Available in .45 ACP and .40 S&W, and by special order in both 9mm and .38 Super. The world's finest production 1911 pistol. 

Barrels are machined from solid forgings on specially designed computer driven machines. Locking lugs are cut with assembled pistol mounted in special fixture for a perfect fit in this critical area, ensuring unequaled accuracy.

All Gold Match and Custom Shop pistols (Details) include the Kimber extended ambidextrous safety and the new premium aluminum match grade trigger. Hand checkered double diamond rosewood grips are standard.

For unequaled accuracy, Gold Match models have stainless steel match grade barrels fitted by hand to spherical stainless steel match grade barrel bushings. Full length guide rod, Wolff springs and dovetail-mounted sights are standard on every Kimber.

Kimber adjustable sight is standard on Target, Gold Match and Super Match. Steel-on-steel click adjustments are responsive and strong. Rebated notch and serrated blade deflect unwanted light."

The Urban Go Plate Carrier is the most cost effective complete and ready to go plate carrier package on the market that offers rifle threat protection. Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates, MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Right Hand Only, Universal wrap design fits Full Size to Sub Compacts), MOLLE Double M4/AR15 magazine pouch (4 mag capacity), and MOLLE Double universal pistol magazine pouch (2 mag capacity). 

We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice.

The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates.

We think everyone should be able to afford body armor and took that into consideration when building this package. In addition to being functional and effective, we aimed for high value and our Urban Go Plate Carrier package delivers.

Barrel is fluted and cold hammer forged, with a target crown helping to maintain barrel harmonics preventing barrel vibration and throwing off the trajectory of the round.

The upper receiver is forged with a Picatinny rail and three rails on the sides and bottom of the fore-end for easy mounting of scopes, sights, lights, lasers, or grips."

Safely moves fixed sights right or left in their dovetails without deforming slide or sight. Specifically designed for use with factory and aftermarket Tritium night sights, which are too fragile for the traditional hammer-and-punch sight installation method; works equally well with iron sights. Thumbscrew securely locks the slide so it’s fully supported in the rigid, machined aluminum body. Separate slots in the screw mechanism engage the sight and firmly, yet gently, concentrate screw force to loosen sights from even extremely tight dovetails. Hardened steel handle provides plenty of leverage, while self-lubricating, oil-impregnated Oilite® bronze bearings and extra-fine threads ensure smooth, precise movement. SIG fits rear sights on all SIGs except SIG-PRO.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask, I am a gunsmith and licensed FFL dealer. Hopefully I will be able to answer your questions as you see fit.

Installed on gun but never had the pleasure of shooting it.  On the back is part number 301519 and it is made to fit Synthetic Stock Shotguns: Fits Models 870, 1100, and 11-87 (1997 or newer), including Super Magnum models from 1999 to present. Designed for 12 Gauge only. 

Here is a small part of what Remington has to say about this pad on their website.  ""The world’s most effective recoil pad. So potent, in fact, it single-handedly helped our Model 870 generate up to 54% less recoil than our leading competitors’ autoloading shotguns with factory pads. Its millions of tiny Super Cells absorb and release energy over a longer time period to create a more comfortable shooting experience than was ever before possible with conventional materials.""  This is not even close to the pad that is probably on your shotgun.  It is super soft and recoil absorbing.  If you upgrade to this you will be very happy.  

Please email your phone number to purchase or ask questions as I do not respond to 1st time emails due to the latest creative spam wanting my email address.  Questions like is this still available/how much to ship etc do not get answers.  I will ship 1st class postage at cost if needed.

Add everything up and you will see you can't build this for close to $800. Buds Gunshop price on this gun is $485.13. I am asking $800 with way over $500 of additional items. Will take $375 with nothing on it or with it.

Can ship directly to buyer if in state. Or do a face to face in East Tennessee."

This one has the 7.5” barrel and Pachmayer Grips. There is at least one owner prior to me so I have no idea how many rounds have been fired through it.

The cylinder has been lightly polished that really offsets it from its matte Field Grade finish. However, it has some handling marks including a couple of small scratches on the starboard side of the frame top strap and forward of the ejector housing on the barrel. It is a tight locking gun that reflects well on the FA reputation. Rifling looks to my aging eyes like it has seen very little use. The trigger holds 4# on my RCBS trigger pull gage. I can provide more photos if required.

There is no box or any other paper work. The instruction booklet can be downloaded from the Freedom Arms web site. Only the gun is offered in the sale price.

I am not a dealer. I do have the ability to accept a credit card through my business but there is a 3% up charge for that and must be completed prior to taking delivery of the firearm. I am willing to do some driving to complete the transaction with a serious buyer.

To complete the transaction you will need to provide cash, a valid Minnesota photo ID (drivers license), and either a Minnesota permit to purchase or a permit to carry. I will in return provide a bill of sale.

I prefer to be contacted by email. If you provide a phone number and best time to contact you I will call as soon as I can.

It has been shot sparingly and used for rifle training for my son. He has since moved on to an AK-47 like dad and since we don't own an acreage to snipe varmints it is for sale.

 It comes with everything pictured. Factory 10 round mag and an additional Remington 25 round mag. Both feed perfectly. More importantly that is 453 rounds of CCI Mini-Mags, in my opinion the best .22LR you can get short of crazy expensive match-grade stuff. You get the gun with the scope, the mags, and enough ammo to start a caddyshack grade war with any rodents. Cash price is 200 firm. Budsgunshop.com (best prices) has this gun for $204 then add an FFL transfer, ammo (good luck finding it), and the extra mag. My cash price is a very good deal, I don't believe in trying to hose good people over.  No tax or background check it is a private sale.

The barrel and upper receiver are of an unknown manufacturer, the BCG, handguard and muzzle brake are Young Manufacturing.  I've had about three hundred rounds through it and everything works fine I just think it would be better for a bigger man.

Not looking for $.25 a round. Looking to get my money back & maybe a tad extra for waiting in line for hours only to get this stuff that I don't use. Open to offers, not going.to split up.
I'm starting to a agree with background checks on ammo cause some of these people emailing are just plain stupid.
examples: 
1. ""I'll buy it all for $20 cause it expires soon."" -really???
2. "" I gots 150 for u. u drop off?"" -  you could offer me twice that but you seem too stupid to use decent grammar & probably shouldn't own a gun. Plus save your money, buy a car.
3. A special thanks to those who like to try and give me a run down on what I paid for it. I have the receipt, thunder bolt was $27 & some change, the CCI was $43.17 that was with tax included.  So why in the world I sell these below what I paid? 
4. The best one: to the guy who came to the house to buy and I refused to sell. Here's a piece of advice.  Don't drive around with 5 kids in the back seat with no belts on. I can only imagine what kind of safety issues you have with firearms in that house cause you can tell you don't give a damn about those kids driving around in that POS while smoking.  Truly feel bad for them, they don't have a chance.

I reserve the right to sell to whom I chose.  So if you're trash, rude, just a plain dumbass,  or have an Obama sticker holding your bumper on, please feel free to pass on my ad.

The AAC Brakeout Flash Hider Muzzle Brake combines the best features of AAC's Blackout flash hiders and Blackout muzzle brakes into a single, high performing unit. The Breakout's rear muzzle brake chamber is open on both sides and on the top for reduced perceived recoil & muzzle rise, yet closed on the bottom for minimal environmental disturbance when shooting from the bench or prone positions. The 3-prong front end incorporates elements of the Blackout flash hider's effective design to minimize muzzle flash. All Breakout flash hider muzzle brakes are machined from high strength aerospace 17-4 stainless steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish. 

This 51T Brakeout works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

I have for sale- Two boxes (40 rounds) of new, never fired, empty 303 British WW brass cartridge casings.  Also for sale is one box of once fired 303 Norma brass which I have found to be the best brass for 303 reloading.  The British made their 303 military rifles with slightly oversize chambers so that dirty cartridges could be chambered and fired under battlefield conditions.  However, this allows the 
brass to expand excessively and shortens the life of the brass.  Norma brass holds up better after several reloadings better than other brands.  I also have ten rounds of once fired 303 brass in good condition and should be good for at least one or two more reloadings. Fired brass has been de-primed and ss pin cleaned. I have been very careful to make sure there are no ss pins remaining in the cases and all primer pockets have been checked to be clean for proper primer seating, but some may have stains that do not affect seating. Note: these cases have not been sized, just de-primed for cleaning.  All cases have boxer primer pockets.  I am also including a partial box (23) of 303 British jacketed bullets.  20 are Sierra 180 gr. .311 Spitzers. The other three are pulled bullets. 1 is a Sierra 150 gr. Spitzer.  1 is a Hornady 150 gr. Spitzer and 1 is a Hornady 174 gr. round nose.  I am selling these cases and bullets together and will not separate.

I am able to deliver this to the Bakersfield or Kern River Valley area for no charge. I will also ship this brass for the actual cost of shipping. It should not cost much since this is not loaded ammo or primed cases.  I can only accept cash, money order, certified bank draft or PayPal. You may text or call me at 76o-417-1o27 if you prefer. If you do not want the cartridge boxes, I will ship this in a small Priority Mail flat rate US Post Office box for the going rate of $6 anywhere in the country.

I have for sale one Rossi matched pair combo, a 12 gauge shotgun and .22 lr rifle. It uses two separate barrels, swappable and held on by the fore grip. It's in great condition and has a six position ATI stock for adjustable fit. It fires extremely well, single shot at a time, and is an all around perfect bug out or truck gun.

I also have the original butt stock and the soft case for it. Included.
Tennis shoes not included, sorry. Asking $350.00, I think that's a fair deal considering it's versatility. Flag and surrounding area only, I won't ship it. call or message me, 712 212 5089"

I put about 70 rounds through it. It's a flawless shooter. I'm remodeling my home so I'm running low on funds. Need to sell the gun. I really don't want to but I need the money. It's a 96a1 so that means .40 cal with an accessory rail. Never had a single issue. Only shot factory ammo through it. VZ grips, which thin out the overall grip. Everyone knows how thick the factory grips usually feel. Also installed VZ screws. Still have the factory grips. This gun comes in a set with a surefire X 300 ultra and a custom made Bravo Concealment OWB holster. Holster does not fit the light, pistol only. Comes with 3 factory magazines. So you get the original box, gun, 3 mags, weapon light, and custom holster. Ready for the range. The pistol is pretty sweet. Shoots like a 9mm. Gun is in impeccable condition. These are hard to find sometimes. Definitely a gun collector must have. Awesome performance. Basically it's the civilian version of the army's m9a1. Please no trades.  I need the money. No bullshit offers either. Price is pretty firm. I paid $750 for the gun, $80 for the holster, $75 for the grips, and $230 for the light.  Have to have a CPL or a purchase permit."

If you shoot competitively, the Beretta PX 4 (full size 40 cal) greatly diminishes snappy recoil due to its rotating barrel and solid build. This improves accuracy as the shooter doesn't get fatigued from constantly controlling recoil. The ergonomics are phenomenal as the Beretta naturally points flat and true. After several practice rounds I have experienced zero FTE/FTF or any other FT's. The DA trigger pull is like butter and the transition to SA doesn't require much thought.
Sights are adequate but can be upgraded to something more competitive.
Highly recommend this Beretta for competition or HD."
