Comes with OnTarget JH400 Red and Green Dot Scope & Russian insignia ammo pouch. Selling as is. No trades or returns. 

Someone once asked..""Why have a Mosin?"" The answer is, ""Because sometimes the bad ones hide behind things."" This is one pwerful rifle. A 7.62X54R will rock your world.

Monte stock is a $75 value and the OnTarget JH400 Red and Green Dot Scope another $75. Picatinny mounts for scope is an extra bonus. So keep in mind when considering purchase. Also this is a clean ready to fire rifle. Beware those cheap Mosins that may (probably) have rim lock interupter problems or whose ejector is worn down and won't consistently eject rounds. I can verify good clean feed and eject works perfect on this weapon. You can buy $120-$150 ""cheap"" Chinese Mosins elsewhere but not in a Monte stock with OnTarget JH400 Red and Green Dot Scope installed and I've not seen ANY with Russian insignia ammo pouch.  What good is a rifle that jams after first round??? This is a RARE bargain at $300."

     I have only shot five rounds through this gun for some reason the bolt will not close all of the way (about 1/8th of an inch shy), then rear pin can be removed from the lower receiver and once the bolt is physically pushed the rest of the way in it will fire fine and eject the shell but then the same process is continued. I am not sure where the problem lies, but I am no longer willing to spend anymore time and money on this project to fix it. Selling for $2,000 that's what I have into it, look up the items listed and see for yourself. Please no lowball offers. Thanks."

This gun sells for over$600 plus tax so you looking at $630 at least(gander mtn charges $699)  , I'm asking $525 firm since it only has 100 rds through it. This is a great weapon and I love it but the fiance says some most go. If you havent held one of these you are doing yourself a disservice , it melts into your hand. The XDM addresses many peoples concerns with the glock. First , it has a steel guide rod instead of plastic, Second, you do not have to pull the trigger to break it down for cleaning.I forgot to mention it also has a match grade barrel so its very very accurate. Must be va resident and sign bill of sale. No BS offers or people wanting to waste my time. Thanks for looking.

Looking to sell this .357 Magnum S&W Model M&P 340. It's one of the ones they've made in recent years without the internal lock. It's in excellent condition, as it's never been fired and has just been sitting in a nightstand safe since I bought it new earlier this year. This being a no-lock gun, they're much harder to come by than the standard M&P's with the silly internal key lock.

These are awesome CC guns. It weighs in at about 13.3oz! The frame is a Scandium/Aluminum alloy and the barrel & cylinder are both stainless steel for added durability. The ""hammerless"" construction makes this the perfect pocket carry or IWB gun. This is one that you'd have no excuse ever leaving at home. It's also got a U-notch rear site with a Tritium Big Dot front site (all factory-original).

The gun would include everything it came with new, box/papers/fired casing/etc. It took me a while to track this down and I can see that I'll have a hard time finding another one, as S&W only made a couple runs of these no-lock guns and they don't appear to be starting another run anytime soon (if ever?!)...a bit hard to come by, especially unfired. I know I'll probably regret selling it, but another S&W has caught my attention and I haven't even fired this one...so I figured I'll pass it on.

Looking for $850obo. FTF in S. Everett. Some form of good guy card will need to be seen.

It also has a lot more capacity than your typical .45acp with 14 +1 in the chamber.  The frame size of the FNP is very easy to carry.  FN Herstal is one of the premier firearms manufacturer, and is trusted by many branches of the military including some special ops communities.

I do not have the box or the instruction manual, but you can download a manual from their website.  It is very easy to disassemble however.  I took this as a partial payment so that is why I am selling it.

This version also comes with a lower Picatinny rail to add extra accessories. Our stock system works on most SKS models and is made of the highest strength composite.

The mag body, made of high strength composite, has horizontal grooves cut into it for an enhanced gripping surface.

That, plus the fact that this mag is made in the U.S.A. so it counts for three compliance parts, you could say we’ve really thought of everything.

Ruger’s first striker-fired semiautomatic pistol is now available in a compact model with a money-saving accessory package. THIS .40 S&W pistols deliver outstanding performance at an affordable price. The durable glass-filled nylon grip is mated to a stainless steel slide outfitted with adjustable sights. Ambidextrous manual safety and magazine release. Reversible backstrap and magazine disconnect. Double action only.

Available:



SR40: BLACK slide on a black synthetic frame. Chambered in .40 S&W with 15+1 capacity and a 4"" barrel.

HIGH -VISIBILITY 3-DOT SIGHT SYSTEM: Rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable and front sight is
windage adjustable. 
UNIQUE REVERSIBLE BACKSTRAP (FLAT OR ARCHED) that allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel
of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools.
AMBIDEXTROUS THUMB SAFETY AND D-SHAPED MAGAZINE RELEASE are easy to reach and actuate.
INTEGRAL ACCESSORY MOUNTING RAIL provides space for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. 
OTHER FEATURES: Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9, the SR40’s custom slide design reduces
recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors. 

Ruger Introduces the SR40 
October 12, 2010 
Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR), is proud to announce the Ruger® SR40™ pistol, the latest extension of the SR-Series, striker-fired line of pistols. The SR40 now provides a large caliber option in one of the slimmest and most ergonomic full-sized pistols on the market today.

""The SR40 represents the next logical step in striker-fired pistols from Ruger,"" remarked Bob Gates, Ruger’s Director of Law Enforcement, Military and International Sales. ""The outstanding ergonomics and value of the SR9® are now available to officers and civilians in the effective and proven .40 caliber chambering. An added bonus is the surprisingly light recoil, which makes the SR40 easy and comfortable to shoot.""

The SR40 is built on the same high-performance glass-filled nylon frame as the SR9, offering all the great ergonomic features that made the SR9 a success: a slim, narrow frame with a short trigger reach, reversible backstrap for an arched or flat configuration, and fully ambidextrous controls. The through-hardened, stainless steel slide on the SR40 is .060"" wider than that of the SR9; the added mass of the slide reduces slide velocity during cycling, reducing recoil and improving service life.

The SR40 weighs 27.25 ounces (with an empty magazine) and ships with two fifteen-round, flush-fit magazines. A loading tool is also provided, although an anti-friction coating applied to the magazine body greatly reduces the force required to load the magazines to full capacity.

The SR40 features a 4.1"" barrel length, fully adjustable three-dot sights, and an integral accessory rail. The SR40 offers modern safety features such as a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator, striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, and a frame-mounted ambidextrous manual safety.

The Slide Fire Solutions SSAR-15 SBS (Standard Battle Stock) Bump Fire Buttstock is the latest iteration of the company's groundbreaking SSAR-15 OGR Original Bump Fire Stock, incorporating the same performance, reliability, and superior craftsmanship of the OGR with a new look designed to appear similar to many of today's popular, modern battle rifle stocks. The SSAR-15 SBS allows the shooter to safely bump fire their AR-15 from the shoulder, effectively and legally simulating fully automatic fire, and allowing for an unprecedented measure of control that is severely lacking when attempting to bump fire a rifle in the traditional, ""from-the-hip"" manner. 

The SSAR-15 features a shelf that positions the shooter's index finger in a fixed position in front of the rifle's trigger. To fire, the upper receiver is moved forward with the support hand pushing on the forend, thereby bringing the trigger to the shooter's finger and discharging a round. The rifle's recoil causes the upper receiver to move rearward, allowing the trigger mechanism to reset. When the right amount of constant forward pressure is applied, the rifle will continue to fire as the trigger is brought forward and depressed by the shooter's stationary index finger, causing the gun to Bump Fire. With a little practice, the shooter will be capable of delivering accurate single shots, bursts, or even full magazine dumps on demand using the SSAR-15. 

The SSAR-15 is designed for installation onto any Mil-Spec Diameter AR-15 Collapsible Stock Receiver Extension Buffer Tube. Installation involves removing the factory pistol grip, replacing it with the included Interface Block, and sliding the SSAR-15 onto the buffer tube. No permanent modifications or gunsmithing required! Each SSAR-15 assembly includes the SBS Buttstock, an Interface Block, Hex Key, Instructions, BATFE Approval Letter and Lifetime Factory Warranty. Made in the USA.

Big Al (“Scarface”) Capone. “Baby Face” Nelson. “Bugs” Moran. John Dillinger. “Machine Gun” Kelly. “Lucky” Luciano. “Machine Gun” McGurn. They were some of the biggest business tycoons and henchmen our country ever knew. J.Edgar Hoover. Elliot Ness. Melvin Purvis. The “Untouchables.” They battled in the biggest domestic combat episode in our nation’s history since the Civil War. Fortunately for law enforcement, General Thompson’s weapon was on their side; only a fraction of the Thompsons in that era were ill-used.
Each Custom Built
These special Thompsons are custom built to museum grade with superior gunsmithing:
•Steel surfaces are mirror polished and matte finished for distinctive, artistic contrast—exhibiting custom bluing to presentation grade.
•For beauty, distinction, and to enhance investment value, genuine 24-Karat Gold is custom plated to Jewelers Grade-Heavy thickness across the trigger, front and rear sights, Cutts compensator actuator knob, and both sling swivels.
•Historical information, dates, and embellishments which reflect the era are deeply etched in bas relief and selectively plated with 24-Karat Gold to Jewelers Grade-Heavy thickness across the receiver.
•Custom-made medallions, also 24-Karat Gold plated, embellish the pistol grip and the shoulder stock.
•The official Thompson logotype and “Bullet” trademark appear in 24-Karat Gold plating on the frame and pistol grip medallion.
•Even the sling swivels are 24-Karat Gold plated, and these are fitted with a deluxe leather sling
30-Round Magazine! 50-Round Drum!

Your legal (in most states) Thompson is provided with a massive 30-round magazine. The 50-round drum magazine is also available (now holds only ten rounds). Both magazines are legal to own. This Thompson, like its famous forebearers, fires .45 ACP ammunition, revered by both law enforcement and military personnel, so it could be used to protect your home and family. Each is numbered between 001 and 500 with the prefix “RT”, for “Roaring Twenties.”

Display Case

A custom-built, luxuriously lined Display Case with lid to protect your firearm from dust and unauthorized handling.  Suitable for wall mount or tabletop display. 



For undercover and concealed carry, musical instrument cases were occasionally adapted to carry Thompsons. Appropriately, such a case has been created with this Roaring Twenties Limited Edition and is not available at this time. Foam lined for protection, the clasps include a lock for security."

This is a used Sig Sauer P229 in excellent condition chambered in 357 SIG with 3.9” barrel, 12 round magazine, night sights, tactical rail, stainless steel slide and aluminum alloy frame with Nitron finish WITH THE DAK SYSTEM. IT comes in a Sig Sauer factory padded hard case and trigger lock

SIG recently released an improved version of the double-action only (DAO) pistols; this version is called the DAK (for Double Action Kellerman, after the designer of the system). The DAK capability is available in 226, 229 and 239 models. When firing the pistol the first trigger pull is only 6.5 lbf (compared to 10 pounds for the standard DAO). After the pistol fires and the trigger is released forward the trigger has an intermediate reset point that is approximately halfway to the trigger at rest position. The trigger pull from this intermediate reset point is 8.5 lbf. If the trigger is released all the way forward, this will engage the primary trigger reset and have a trigger pull of 6.5 lbf. To engage the intermediate reset, the trigger must be held to the rear while the slide is cycled, either manually or by the recoil of a round being fired. The United States Coast Guard has adopted this firearm as its PDW (Personal Defense Weapon), replacing the older M9 pistol.[5]

Been getting interesting responses which precipitates this new update. Tire kickers that try to offer a Gypsy low ball offer before even looking won't be responded to. I don't want to trade a gold watch, a sausage making machine or a case of beer and a puppy. I sell fireams. People meet with me, look at the weapon, are qualified, and exchange cash at a bank if interested. I am NOT going to throw in a couple range targets, trigger guard, ear plugs, or anything else for that matter. Really?

All DPMS with a few Magpul upgrades. This is an ""F"" serial number, forged lower.  
Factory (no ""K"" in serial number) assembled.  Test fired from factory. I haven't fired any rounds through it. Bought at gun show and immediately upgraded to Colt the next day. Appears new with a few very light scuff marks from show handling. Comes with soft case and 2 Pmags of the windowed variety. No sights, flat top.
