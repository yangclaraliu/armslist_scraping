Has the M1902 rear sight with windage adjustment and neat little flip up peep sight

I'm no gunsmith,but heres what I consider an overly critical description of condition-

Has very little blue left,but most collectors prefer that over refinished.
Action and mechanicals are smooth as butter,as these are known to be.
Rifling is deep,looks great,to me.
Doesnt have pitting,frosty to dull shiny bore (I have yet to even clean this rifle)
My problem with this rifle is the stock.It was customized LONG ago,by sanding out the finger grooves and recontouring the buttstock (Which actually makes it a very comfortable grip,just not ""correct"")
Has a neat old WW1 era ""A"" company infantry badge embedded in the butt

If I were a hunter,or if I could afford an original military stock,I would keep this rifle.
I have 1 brand new box of Remington 180 grain Core Lokt that goes with it.
I am selling for less than I paid 3 weeks ago. $225 cash takes it!
Or will trade for other Military rifles or handguns.
Also interested in 762x39 and 9MM ammunition.

These holsters are constructed similar to a kydex holster, but the leather front and back will not wear on your firearm over time like kydex or plastic. Available with two Galco clips or one G-code clip. Very comfortable and will work for appendix carry, 5 o'clock, or even small of the back. All holsters have a short sweat guard to keep the firearm from rubbing.

The horsehide is a more dense, tighter grained leather making it more moisture resistant than other types of leather. Customers that live in hot humid climates or tend to perspire more prefer the horsehide because of the leather grain properties. Leather is treated with Neetsfoot Oil and a clear finish and look fantastic. 

Holsters are available for various other gun makes and models, and custom orders are available on request. Holsters start at $50 for subcompact and compact."

Up for sale mine S&W Shield in 9mm. LNIB condition. Comes with everything like from factory. Less then 150 Rds fired. BUT MOST IMPORTANT is APEX Trigger enhancement kit  already installed and trigger is A LOT better then from factory. Now you can shoot that gun accurately. Trigger pull and reset just excellent. This trigger kit was not cheap at all (about $90). I would never sell this gun but need some cash. On one of the pictures you can see a price i paid for it.
Price is $420 firm.

Available with two Galco clips or one G-code clip. Very comfortable and will work for appendix carry, 5 o'clock, or even small of the back. All holsters have a short sweat guard to keep the firearm from rubbing.

The horsehide is a more dense, tighter grained leather making it more moisture resistant than other types of leather. Customers that live in hot humid climates or tend to perspire more prefer the horsehide because of the leather grain properties. Leather is treated with Neetsfoot Oil and a clear finish and look fantastic.

After I had the upgrades put in it, it became my pride and joy. Sadly, I am needing to sell it because I need money to pay for my last semester of school out of pocket. I work at one of the largest gun ranges/firearms stores in the Mid-south, so you can rest assured that this gun has been professionally cared for and pampered. 

I am 100% confident that this gun will sell itself without me writing an essay on it. If you know anything at all about CZ’s, then you know who Cajun Gun Works (CGW) is, and how superb their quality parts are and how phenomenal their upgrades make stock a CZ. The Pro-package is the top tier option at CGW, and you can read up on what all they do in this package at cajungunworks.com. So, I really don’t know what else to say about this amazing piece, other than just give you the facts on what you’re bidding on: 

-	Firearm has had the CGW Pro-package upgrades installed and internals polished to mirror finish
-	Pistol has also had the Flat Mainspring Plug (replaces OEM lanyard loop) and the Flat Mag Brake from CZ Custom installed (so CZ mags free fall)
-	8.4lbs DA trigger pull (very short pull thanks to CGW), and 3.4lbs SA trigger break - tested with electronic trigger scale
-	Incredibly short trigger reset (again, thanks to CGW upgrades!)
-	Gun has had only about 800 rounds put through it (approx. 400 before and 400 after the CGW work)
- Firearm is in overall near-mint condition
-	Night sites are still extremely bright and appear to be 100%
-	Comes with 2x MecGar 17rd mags (flush frame fit) and the 2x OEM 18rd extended CZ SP-01 mags
-	Comes with Fobos Roto-paddle kydex holster
-	Comes with spare CGW 13# recoil spring
-	Comes with CGW sear cage slave pin, and CGW starter punch for tapping out pins for future work
-	Comes with all OEM parts that were upgraded/replaced
-	This gun will out-shoot all but the most accurate shooters on the planet at extreme pistol distances, and the recoil is next to nothing. You just have to shoot one to believe it!

Paypal strongly preferred, but I will also accept cash in person, or certified checks and/or money orders by mail if you want it shipped to an FFL.

Please email for pics, and feel free to email me with any questions, I can usually reply immediately. I know this gun inside and out, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have!"

Product Detail:
The SU-22 rifle is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered SU-16 rifle and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The SU-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

Up for sale mine S&W Shield in 9mm. Like new condition. Comes with everything like from factory. Less then 150 Rds fired.

This trigger kit was not cheap at all (about $90). I would never sell this gun but need some cash. On one of the pictures you can see a price i paid for it.

This rifle is missing the 10rd box magazine and is priced accordingly.  You can find these on GunBroker, GunAuction, eBay, and other placed for under $200.  An SVT-38 or SVT-40 magazine will work in an SVT-40, only 38's work in 28's though.

This 1941r Tula also has a Tula bolt and the rifle has never been refurbed by the Russians and has the original non-plum bolt too! Internals are great and so is the bore! Another amazing ppart about this rifle is the lack of any import stamp and that it has an original SVT stock and not AVT. Also, it has the early swivel front sling and six port muzzle brake!"

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

From the HK site:
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
From the HK Site:
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

From the HK site:
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
From the HK Site:
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Windlass Steelcrafts¨ is only creating a limited run of the Sword of Malta, so this is one that you do not want to delay adding to your collection. The sword has been named for the legendary Siege Of Malta, when nearly 5,000 Maltese men and women and approximately 2,000 soldiers won one of the bloodiest and fiercely contested battles in history. It certainly contributed to eroding the idea that Otteman was invincible.

Hand-forged from high-carbon steel, the blade is cut and perfectly balanced for a solid thrust and a deep cut. The Cross of the Brotherhood has been carefully carved in the steal pommel, a symbol of devotion and prayer by the soldiers. A solid steel crossguard is complemented by a grooved wood grip, which has been wrapped in genuine stitched leather and rubbed to a deep luster. Thick leather cloaks the wood scabbard, decorated with steel fittings. The sword and scabbard have been designed to allow it to hang at a rakish angle. REDACTED will trade for other weapons pics out certificate of authentication still on scabbard will cut a coke bottle in half intact see youtube

Yes, I realize they are used mags so I'm not including that full amount in my asking price.  This Stainless Steel .22LR Browning Rimfire pistol also comes with the TRUGLO fiber optic front sight with multiple colors for your preference.  Last but certainly not least, even though most center fire ammo is now fairly easy to obtain, 22LR rimfire is still not very easy to get your hands on, but is definitely improving.  Again, you can see the 5 10 round clips are all full of Golden Bullets and I'll throw in what's left in the 225 rd Golden Bullet box.  If you're considering purchasing this and just can't pull the trigger, shoot me an email via this add and we can talk about me throwing in a little more ammo.

This warranty does not cover damage to the sound suppressor and/or host firearm resulting in whole or in part from criminal or negligent use, improper or careless handling, modifications, defective, improper hand-loaded, or reloaded ammunition, or neglect. This warranty does not cover damage to the sound suppressor or host firearm due to improper installation of the Flash Hider, the Sound Suppressor, or an improperly threaded barrel.

 Bowhunting.net review
 For a youth or novice bow, the Edge surpasses all I've looked at. Most of your beginner bows on the market are made from poured Magnesium, which is heavy especially for a youth shooter. The Edge is molded from 6061 aluminum. That in combination with the carbon limbs only weighs 3.3 lbs. The brace height on this bow 6 ¾"" and the bow is 32 1/2 "" axle to axle. The shorter bow with a large brace height ensures that it will be forgiving with a small frame shooter. To tell you the truth, this bow is manufactured with as much quality as the Diamond Liberty. 

 The Edge is a dual cam bow. Now here is the awesome thing on this. This bow is just not a bow that you buy and your child outgrows it within a year or so. The Edge has an adjustable draw length of 18 to 28"". This way the bow can grow with your child. There is no need for a bow press to change the draw length on it either, which will save you money and time from running to a local pro-shop to get it adjusted."
