Only shot with virgin brass and a starting load of 62gr H1000 powder with 130 grain Nosler Accubonds. I properly broke in the barrel after EACH shot for the first 10 shots using coated Dewey rod, breech bore guide, WipeOut solvent and accelerator. Next cleaned after 5 shots...was shooting 1/2 inch groups at 100 on the second string of 5 and held off on final cleaning till after Elk Hunt. For the hunt, I wrapped the stock in black Coflex medical wrap to keep perfect (works great and inexpensive way to save your stock) almost any horse supply store (e.g. D&B) will carry for around $2 a roll.

I've got a very nice Smith and Wesson M&P 15 Optics Ready AR15 Bundle for sale or trade. The rifle has plenty of upgrades. It will come with magpul flip up back up sights, quad rail, oversized skeleton charging handle, led flashlight/laser front grip (The flashight is a cree led-very bright constant/strobe and red laser, both have their own push button on/off switch at your thumb, can use flashlight, laser or both at same time) I have an extra 4 position adjustable stock I can include as well


It will come with 12 mags. A couple are c products, some thermolds, couple msar, magpul pmag and a 100 rd beta drum (real beta not a cheap knock off, comes with case 2 graphite tubes and speed loader) I have plenty of ammo to include as well, somewhere around 400-450 rds.


Next is a bumpfire stock very much like a slidefire stock but better. It's made by a company called Fostech Outdoors. It is all aluminum. Not cheap plastic, very well made. Please do some research, the stock is over $500 alone. It is not a plastic stock. Also has a 1in rubber recoil pad on it making it very comfortable to shoot.


Last but not least is a nice Smith and Wesson M&P dual backpack rifle case. Has plenty of room for extras. You can put 2 rifles, couple pistols, hearing protection, glasses, extra mags/ammo, targets, etc. Has 2 nice padded straps to carry the case like a backpack if need be. It will hold a good bit of weight and still be comfortable.


Still have time to pick up a nice Christmas gift for yourself or someone else.  Don't have to sell/trade and will not be giving the package away. Make an offer or let me know what you have to trade. Only interested in firearm trades. I like 1911's, saiga 12's, 50 bmg, 22lr, etc. Might take a partial trade with cash depending on what you have to offer. Thanks for looking."

Hailed as the ""Holy Grail"" of the AK's, there truly is no better.

PolyTech is well known, mainly for its ""Legend"" models—but what about a rifle even more rare then the Legend? A rifle you've probably not even had the honor to see in person?

That rifle is the PolyTech AKS-762 Bakelite. 

Manufactured in 1987 in Beijing China and imported only into the US. 400 units arrived before President Clinton decided Chinese AK's were more evil than the others (LOL). 

This rifle is a factory 416 build. Came from the factory with Bakelite furniture and a folding buttstock. Hidden inside that buttstock, is the original cleaning kit, which still includes all necessary tools for maintenance.

This specific rifle also has a spring-loaded firing pin, double hook trigger (that is the smoothest I've ever shot), and a curved magazine release. 

Rifle still has the outstanding finish that PolyTech is famous for—and also has a beautiful Satin finish on the BCG.

The folding stock allows zero play, and closes and opens easily.

This rifle will come with its original box, booklet, oil can, sling, cleaning rod and five (5) Tapco ""orange slab side"" magazines (that match remarkably well, might I add).

I can also include 130rds of premium (Winchester brass) 7.62x39 ammunition for a good trade/cash offer.

This is not your typical AK-47, they really don't make them like this anymore, seriously.

Interested in all AK pattern weapons, AR-15's, SKS's, bullpup rifles, ect. If it's badass, I probably want it.

Valuing my like-new (9.7 out of 10) setup at $2500 trade, and $2300 obo cash, with all included extras.

Below is a snapshot of my specific model for sale at a Cabelas in Idaho, without extra magazines or ammunition.

Don't need to sell or trade, but do want to change things up a bit.

U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4

MATECH BUIS Leaf Sight is current issue to US Military. This Windage and elevation adjustable flip-up rear iron sight is battle tested with a low-profile design. Folds down out of the way when not in use. Will fit under a Trijicon ACOG riflescope.

Elevation adjustable to 600 meters.
 Windage: 1/2 MOA 
 Elevation: 0-600m
 NSN 1005-01-484-8000 , PN# 12996812

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any .223 5.56  rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

My best friend inherited this gun, and he is not into guns at all. He wanted to get rid of it, so i told him i would sell it for him. It is a really good example of a 5'' limited race gun! It has some very minor wear here and there, but the firearm functions really well! Full disclosure... unknown round count, but i have no doubts that it is nothing outrageous. The previous owner used to shoot USPSA and only shot for a year or two with this gun, and switched to a 6''. I talked to STI about the gun, and they said on the market it should be able to sell for 3k.... i think they are a little proud. I dont expect to get that. Im listing it for 1500 firm

The engine has 209K on it while the transmission has 55K. All wheels are a 10-lug nut configuration. This starts easily and runs smooth! This engine is equipped with an engine heater for colder mornings. This truck sports a 216"" wheel base which gives this the unique ability to run a goose-neck trailer hitch in the proper location at the axle while still providing over 10' of free bed space while hauling the trailer. Once the goose-neck cover plate is reinstalled (2 bolts) the bed provides its full 15' of capacity. Along the sides of the bed are multiple points for tie-downs as well as mounting slots for stake bed sides. For those with bumper pull type trailers this is equipped for use with those as well.

For working at night there are 4 rear-facing flood lights for illumination. Recognizing that there is often a need for compressed air, this truck has a built in diesel powered Lombardini engine with electric start, running both an air compressor and an auxiliary 12Volt alternator. The air compressor fills a large air tank as needed while the auxiliary diesel engine feeds directly from the main fuel tank. As there are times when loading stability is paramount there are 4 individually controlled electric over hydraulic stabilizers to eliminate sway during any loading. In addition these stabilizers will lift the entire truck into the air for ease of tire changes and servicing.

This has a clean title in-hand. Trades or partial trades are considered. Such as a car, truck, jeep, ATV, Rifles, shotguns, pistols, ammo, skid-steer, etc."

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

483,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2477483,For Sale/Trade:  Canon 10 x 42 L IS WPImage Stabilizer. binoculars. 1600-2000 value,"Lakewood/Tacoma, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, December 21, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a new never used out of the box with everything set of Canon Image Stabilizing Binoculars.  Here is the specs below.  I will also include a couple links.the different sites that sell them.with there prices.  

Main Features:Entirely waterproof.Lenses that give Outstanding picture quality.Lenses equipped with ultra low dispersion elements.Largest exit pupil diameter (2.4 mm).Wide angle viewing from apparent angle of 65°.Entirely waterproof.Canon’s image stabilizer tech.Model: 0155B002My review of Canon 10 x 42 L IS WP Image Stabilized Binoculars:

The new canon 10x 42L has set new standards for all other binoculars in the same range. It has outstanding image quality, is highly durable and very compact, making it the perfect choice for any kind of field trip. The image stabilizers in these canon binoculars are very efficient giving a magnificent shake-free view, like never before.

The canon 10x 42L is entirely waterproof, dust resistant and shock resistant. Some users had a common problem; that canon should make its binoculars water ‘proof’ and not just ‘resistant’, because a large number of users go for nature photography in a canoe or a kayak. Therefore canon came out with 10x42L, making them its first water proof binoculars. So, these binoculars are one of the finest canon can offer.

The optics are fantastic in the canon 10x42L. It gives you amazing image quality, contrast, sharpness and brightness, making it ideal for bird watching, astronomy, sea-watching and nature photography. The large lens diameter and the exit pupil diameter help in giving extremely bright pictures in the lowest light conditions.

The amount of light incident on the camera is directly related to how dark or how dim your images are. Usually some of the incident light gets reflected from an uncoated lens, making the image dimmer and lighter than before. However, the super spectra coating on the lens of the binoculars enables it to avoid reflection of incident light. As a result, most of the incident light is used in image formation. This makes the image very bright irrespective of the surrounding conditions.

Most costumer reviews show that the canon 10x42L is a good buy. It’s probably the best in the range in terms of image stabilization and image quality. So go ahead and buy one for yourself. The average price for these binoculars is $1500 to $2000. But flip through a number of websites before buying them because some of these websites give huge festive discounts.

This ammunition is high-quality and factory-sealed for long-term storage. It is in its original spam can, inside its original wooden case that is still sealed with metal buttons.

""Yugo M67, brass cased, berdan primed, some of the best surplus 7.62x39 ever made.""

This ammo is packed in boxes of 15 each inside the sealed case.

Since BHO signed an executive order prohibiting the import of military-grade arms and ammunition earlier this year, there will be no more of this high-quality, sealed-for-longterm-storage ammunition for your AK-47/SKS imported to the US.  There used to be dozens of these crates listed for sale everywhere just over a year ago; now there is only one other on Armslist, and none anywhere else.

We're sitting on a couple of these; but with the holidays coming, we'll part with one -- and only one -- if it's sold before Christmas.  We'll take the best offer we get before midnight Monday, December 23rd.  If you want to low-ball us, feel free to make an offer; but be aware that we'll sell right away to the first person who meets our asking price -- no obligation to inform low-ballers that they've been cut out.

Portland OR or Vancouver WA preferred.  Can meet locally in either state. If shipped, you pay actual shipping.

This is a brand new in the box, unfired, never loaded, collectible Colt weapon.
It has the nearly impossible to find RESTRICTED rollmarkings located on the receiver.
Of course it is 5.56 caliber, and I will include 100 rounds of new FMJ ammo.
This gun is a monolithic upper design, and is a very high strength weapon.
It has factory flip up sights on it, or you can mount optics of your choice as well.
It will come in the original box, with the colt mags, books, and I will include 2 new pmags.
I have extra ammunition should you wish to purchase some with the weapon as well.
I will also offer additional Pmags new in the wrapper for a reasonable cost as well if you desire more of those to enhance your purchase.
I am a private collector/hobbyist/trader so no taxes, fees, or extra charges will apply.

ALL FTF firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

I'm the original owner and purchased this pistol new in the mid-1990's. It's had just less than three 50 round boxes of ammo fired through it and they were all by me.  

Pistol was meticulously cleaned after firing and then returned to a dehumidified safe. 

I'd put overall condition at 98%+, and I believe you'd be hard pressed to find a better one. 

This particular pistol is chambered in the .30 Carbine rifle round so it puts on a quite an impressive light show when fired. I assure you that you'll be the ""talk of the day"" at your range or shooting club after emptying a clip from this one.

If yours has an issue with something not functioning it is only good to me as a parts gun which means generally $25.
Most are loose, have 1/2 the finish worn away, pitted barrels, rust, chipped grips - these fall into the parts gun category as well.
It's OK if the cylinder spins free as many did not have a stop.
If yours is functional and not too ugly it might be worth around $100.
If it looks new and has a box it might be worth around $200.
Typical calibers are 32 S&W and 38 S&W.

The BSS are rare Sporter models. 28"" barrels are choked M, F - 26"" barrels are choked IC, M. These guns are built super strong and still tight as a bank vault. The deep dark blue on the metal is fantastic. Both have single selective triggers, gold on the 28"" and silver on the 26"" They're marked ""Assembled in Korea with Japanese made parts"". Wood is 95% +, very nice condition for these forgotten SxS.

The SKB is virtually new. The factory grease is drying up. I let the new owner clean it up. SxS owners who hunt favor these SKB over other manufacturer due to its lightness, easy to swing and shorter 25"" in barrel. The barrels are choked IC, M. The silver finish and engraving make this gun extra special and desirable.

The Model 23 is, what can i say, a Winchester. It is completely original with factory choke tubes. I added a Briley skeet choke to complement the IC choke for skeet shooting. The gun comes with three chokes, IC, M and skeet. Factory butt pad is a little hard now due to its age. A few handling marks on the stock. This gun has a single selective trigger.

I bought it new about 2 months back.  It has never been fired since it left the factory but as with most 870's when you disassemble it you can tell it has definitely been fired.  Everything about it seems to be in great working order and I have added a 6 shot side saddle to it.  The finish on it is not very sturdy and I did scratch it up a bit when I took it apart after bringing it home to clean it.  Most of the scratches are under where the barrel/ magazine clamp sits.  For some reason I had a really hard time getting the mag cap off the first time.  That sucker was on tight, thus the minor scratches even despite me using folded over faux leather stuff the teeth of the wrench I was using. I am only selling or trading it because I got a nicer shotgun for Xmas. Price depends on cost of shipping to your FFL.  I will knock it down for the scratches and for your FFL fee.  Would consider trade for a rifle.  If interested email for pics and more info."

Been fired 3 (just 3) times, cleaned, and reboxed!!!! This is the Camo/SS model. The Electra is the most innovative muzzleloader to ever hit the market. This is the gun that revolutionized muzzleloading. It is the first of its kind to use an electronic ignition, making it the most-reliable, fastest-loading and easiest-to-clean muzzleloader ever made. The patent-pending ARC™ electronic ignition eliminates the need for a primer. The ignition is completely sealed from the elements and requires no flash hole, ensuring superior reliability no other muzzleloader can duplicate. No parts other than the barrel ever have to be cleaned because of fouling. The ignition is instantaneous, and since there is no pressure explosion, as there is with primer ignitions, there is no accuracy-robbing displacement of the charge. This allows a full, consistent burn of the powder charge at the bottom of the barrel. The trigger pull is incredibly clean because the trigger is actually an electronic switch. One 9-volt battery (included) will reliably fire the rifle at least 500 times, and the battery will last up to 600 continuous hours (25 days). All Electras are equipped with a premium Bergara barrel, for tack-driving accuracy, and Hi-Viz TRUGLO sights. I'll accept Money Orders, Cashier Checks, or will invoice through PayPal (+3% for fees). Shipping via USPS, UPS, or FedEx as soon as good funds are received (usually next business day).

1. Qty 250 (10, 25 round boxes) Hornady Critical Defense ammunition is the pinnacle in self defense ammunition. The Hornady Critical Defense line of personal defense ammunition is loaded with the patented FTX bullet, these bullets offer expansion even through heavy clothing including denim and leather. Patented FTX bullet delivers superior controlled expansion and large, deep wound cavities over a wide range of velocities. Clean burning and stable propellants reduce recoil in lightweight handguns, and perform consistently in all temperatures. Minimal muzzle flash protects night vision. Feeds reliably in all pistols. Shiny silver nickel plating prevents corrosion, and is easily visible in low light situations. Bullets are cannelured and crimped to avoid bullet setback. The most effective, consistent, and reliable self-defense ammunition available today!

2. Qty 100 Rounds (2 50 round boxes) 9mm Luger 115 gr FMJ PMC Bronze. 
Enjoy uncompromising quality and performance. All PMC cartridges pass rigorous inspection at our electronic powder-check station, which instantly and accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by as little as two-tenths of one grain, the system stops, and the cartridge is discarded. No other ammunition manufacturer can assure greater uniformity and reliability than PMC. These valued characteristics run throughout our entire line.  These rounds are seated with a 115 gr FMJ bullet. Our Full Metal Jacket cartridges incorporate a lead core bullet enclosed in a heavy copper topcoat, resulting in little to no expansion and deeper penetration of the bullet. Our PMC-FMJ provides smooth, reliable feeding in all types of semi-auto handguns."

It is stamped ""U.S.CARBINE cal. 30 M1"" as produced by the Inland Division of General Motors in January of 1945(also stamped on the barrel behind the front site). It is NOT a lend-lease import! This rifle, though otherwise authentic and original, has an early REPRODUCTION PARATROOPER STOCK. It is a Paratrooper model as it is equipped with an early reproduction side-folding stock. There is an authentic G.I. oiler snapped into the stock. The stock locks snugly in the open position without any slack or jiggle. The folding stock does not seem to fold up flush with the wooden stock when fully closed but I don't know if it is supposed to. There is a nice finish on the stock and the deep patina on the metal shows its age - the photos don't do this firearm justice. I have never fired this rifle but I have cycled a full magazine of dummy rounds through it without a problem. Rounds loaded and ejected smoothly and easily. Rifle appears to function properly all around. The magazine is marked with a ""U"" and there is an ""M"" on the magazine release button. The side of the rear site is stamped ""I.R.CO."" This rifle is equipped with a bayonet lug on the barrel band. The bore/rifling in the barrel, feed ramp and chamber are smooth and shiny.
