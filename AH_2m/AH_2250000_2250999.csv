The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their official backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

The collectable nature of this one keeps me from shooting it. I was going to keep it but I keep finding goodies to spend money on. It would be a good addition to a WW2 collection or conversation peice. 

History: The way I understand it, when the Nazis took the FN factory in Belgium, the engineers fled to the UK with the Hi-Power plans. The Nazis like the gun so much they started issuing them to Axis forces. Meanwhile, a Canadian manufacturer (John Inglis & co.) was contracted to make Hi-Powers for allies. These pistol, originally intended for China, were designed with 500meter tangent sight and a shoulder stock that doubles as a holster.

This one is a Mk1* with 80% finish, matching numbers and subtle import marks. Has the cut for the shoulder stock/holster, and small internals appear new. One original magazine and one after market."

This is essentially a new rifle. 20 rounds through it. Never shoot it, time for it to go. I added a sling and will include a 100 round box of American Eagle .223 ammo and a generic metal 30 round mag. It also comes with the original 30 Round PMAG. Very nice basic rifle from a great manufacturer.

I got this to carry as my ccw, and thought it would double to make a good shooter for my girlfriend. Took her to shoot and the recoil is just too much for her. (She has tiny hands and not a lot of grip strength) I still feel it makes a fantastic ccw, and probably good for a more experienced female shooter too.

Just to give you a heads up this looks like an AK but besides the same cartridge there is nothing else similar. It is a short stroke piston so it runs cleaner then a AK, it has a milled receiver, it is more accurate then most AK's, it locks back on the last round fired, it weighs 1lb less then a AK...... It truly is a awesome rifle. I don't have to get rid of it so don't give me any bull$hit offers. I just want to see what's all out there and I want to see if something catches my eye.

MDT zero turn riding mower. For the last 4 years it has sat in the garage. This week I drained the gas, cleaned the carb, changed the oil and filter, replaced the air filter and put a newer battery in it. The spark plug is good, belt is good, and hydraulics are good, and the blades are sharp. It has an electric start and runs and cuts as it should. Starts easily and moves fast. It does NOT leak, smoke, or make any funny sounds (no more than it should). Has a front light and good seat. This things moves so fast you could use it as a golf cart to get your mail (if you have a long driveway) and will easily cut your mowing time in half.

Don't let the price confuse you, it's a great mower but I can't store it. I've seen them retail at dealer's webpages for $1200.

The 4.25mm Liliput is a centerfire cartridge originally produced in Austria for self-loading pocket pistols made by Erika before World War I. In 1920 the Liliput pistol was designed by August Menz of Suhl to use the cartridge. The cartridge became best known by the Liliput name used on German ammunition after Austria ceased production. The cartridge headspaces on the mouth of the case. It was the smallest centerfire cartridge in production in the 1930s.[1]

Gun is 4 years old this season. Has an estimated 6,000 rounds through it. It's well-used but has been maintained regularly. I usually shoot a case of 3"" steel (250 rounds) in duck season and an additional 1,000-1,500 rounds of 2 3/4 clay rounds during sporting clays, skeet and some local 3 gun competitions/yr. Has been cleaned/lubed regularly with Slip2000 (no cheap RemOil crap). 

Gun has had no major failures of any kind. Last year I had to remove some carbon from the magazine tube follower because it was causing the follower to ""stick"" in the magazine tube. Took some 200 grit sandpaper and scraped the carbon off the follower. Problem fixed. 

The gun was originally finished in Realtree APG. This past summer, I decided to paint the gun rather than pay the $300 to ship/have it dipped in Max-4. I painted off all major parts, took my time and the paint job looks like it was professionally done. I have since done several of my friends guns after they saw mine. The paint has 3 coats of matte acrylic sealer on top of it so it won't flake and chip off as easy. Paint job looks very similar to the Gore Optifade Marsh pattern.

Gun comes with the original Benelli plastic case, manuals, Benelli choke tubes and 2 Patternmaster Code Black tubes (Goose and Improved Cylinder, $80+ each). I use the IC choke on clays, decoying ducks, etc. and save the Goose for diving ducks, geese and other long range shots. 

I'm not terribly motivated to sell this gun. If there's no interest, I'll simply keep using it for the next several seasons. Lowball offers will not be considered. I can email more pictures if needed. This is the only pic I have of the gun with the current camo pattern (blends into the marsh/woods much better than Max-4)."

They merged with the NC State Highway Patrol quite a few years ago, so all former DMV officers were sworn as State troopers from then on and the DMV became obsolete. This example of one of the 96's is in pristine condition and has never been fired to my knowledge. At least I know that I haven't fired it since I acquired it around 2007. It has remained double-boxed in my dehumidified safe since purchase, only taken out to be shown to a few select individuals. It is gloss black with gold inscription and gold accents such as the safety lever.
