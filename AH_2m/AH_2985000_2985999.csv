This rifle is not transferable to civilians in several jurisdictions, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. Photos are representative, but buyer will receive the same grade rifle from the same agency. Agencies, dealers, and collectors may take any number of additional and very similar rifles we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. From its tour of duty with the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department comes this attractive, serviceable specimen of one of the best AR15 type rifles ever made. Manufacturer is Armalite Inc. of Geneseo, Illinois. Armalite and Mr. Eugene Stoner, of course, were the original manufacturers of this genre of rifle. Construction is aircraft grade alloy with steel barrel, bolt, and internal parts, with A2 polymer buttstock and steel lined handguards. Barrel is 16 inch 1:8 double lapped and chrome lined, with elevation adjustable military post front sight and cage type 4 slot factory muzzle brake on a 1/2x28 threaded muzzle. Rear sight is M16 handle type dual aperture, windage and elevation adjustable. Receiver is classic A2 military configuration with forward bolt assist and integral deflector. Magazine is factory Armalite alloy body and floorplate. From this rifle’s US100,000 range serial number, it was manufactured around the Millennial Year and issued under Sheriff Richard Pearce’s administration. Right side of receiver is correctly stamped, Restricted for Government or Law Enforcement Use Only; and Magazine bears similar markings. Surface detractions are moderate to extensive, principally edge whitening and scouring on its receiver sides and buttstock. We rate it as Good, perhaps Very Good, 70 to 75 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. We estimate this rifle was fired fewer than 500 times for annual qualification. Replacement pricing on current production Armalites ranges well over $1,000 apiece in our area, and there are none to be had with A2 buttstocks. We’re offering the Fresno County M15A2 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates 	for only	$ 589.00.  2% Discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & not credit card. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, Chicago Cook County IL, Aurora IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or New York. Colorado civilian buyers may sub a ten round metal or 15 round polymer magazine for the 20 rounder.

Specifications:

    Manufacturer: CZ USA Dan Wesson
    Item Number: 01909
    Caliber: 9mm
    Action Type: SAO
    Overall Length: 8.75 in
    Barrel Length: 5.0 in
    Barrel Type: Match grade
    Weight: 2.42 lbs
    Sights: Adjustable rear, fiber optic front
    Mag Capacity: 9+1 Rounds
    Magazines Included: 9 Round Magazine
    Accessory Rail: No
    Notes: Pictures are of a previous model I had in stock, the current one up for auction has not been out of the box. The front sight may be red or green pending what Dan Wesson is installing at the time. Also the serial number will be different than what is pictured.
    Features: The PM9 is the only Government size Dan Wesson model chambered in 9mm Luger. We have offered this model in limited quantities in the past and always have demand greater than production capacity allows.

    This gun features our Clark style rib on top of the forged slide with an adjustable target sight in the rear and a popular fiber-optic sight in the front.

    The slide also features front and rear cocking serrations. The frame is forged stainless with an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI front strap checkering.

    We have polished the flats to a soft-brushed finish and sandblasted the rounds for a nice contrast.

    We have installed Double Diamond cocobolo grips to finish it off. With the low cost of 9mm ammunition and lack of recoil, this is the perfect model for getting acquainted with the 1911. This model shines both at the range and in competition. (9+1 capacity).

I bought this rifle then the .270 XP-2 (with the accutrigger) model came out the following week.  So I decided I needed a .270 too.  Then my wife decided I needed to pick one.  So I took the NEW scope that came with the .270 (Weaver Kaspa 3-9 x 40) and put it on this 30-06' and I'd like to sell it for about what I have in it for just the gun ($275 plus  shipping and FFL I paid to get it) comes to $325 (or best offer).

The Kaska scope (which sells for $100 new BTW) comes with it for this price (free) since I don't need it and it might help sell this rifle to someone who wants to beat a WalMart deal

I'd like to sell to a sincere buyer nearby who can meet on a weekend in KC, Wichita, Topeka, Lawrence, Hutch (central eastern Kansas in general)... or within about 30 miles from Emporia, KS about any day of the week.  I'd be interested in certain trades (pistol, bullets, stainless shot-gun ammo) but would prefer the cash at sale.

I will not ship this rifle as I live where its hard enough to just receive parcels-- much less ship them.  Thanks and please reply with a name and number, for a reply in kind."

Photo specimen represents the original variant of Kel Tec's High Capacity 9mm Compact, the P11, blue steel slide with black polymer grip frame. The P-11 is the pistol that propelled Kel-Tec to respectability and even stardom in our Industry. It works, it’s garbage-mouthed; it will feed anything from Russian steel case ammo to the finest Remington Golden Saber on the market. The P-11 is accurate, too, note the similarity of the barrel’s muzzle collar to the Smith & Wesson 5906. Though not as flat as its descendant PF9, the P-11 is still a thin-enough pistol with lots of firepower. Manufacturer is Kel-Tec CNC of Cocoa, Florida. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts, assembled into a polymer frame with polymer magazine release for right hand shooters; and .280 smooth faced combat trigger. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Dimensions are: barrel length 3 inches; maximum height 5 inches; overall length 6 inches; frame thickness 1.05 inches; weight empty with magazine in battery 17 oz.; 3-dot sight configuration. The P-11 is, of course, double action only. It has a hammer, but the hammer never stands. Herein lies its safety feature: in addition to the firing pin block safety that prevents firing if the pistol is dropped, the only way the pistol will fire is by a stiff deliberate pull of the trigger, long travel double action pull with pressure of 8 to 10 pounds. The Kel-Tec is good pistol. Out of several hundred we have sold over the past three decades, we have sent fewer than 20 back to the factory for repair or service. This small pistol, however, may not be suitable for people unfamiliar with automatics. New gun owners and arthritic folk with weak grasp capabilities should stick with the simple, safe, double action revolvers. This one comes with its original Mec-Gar factory issue 10-shot magazine. This Kel-Tec will accept any Smith & Wesson 59, 669, 6900 or 5900 type magazine, even the 20 rounders. We're offering the P-11 in the photos, or one of its identical mates for only $ 259.00 2% Discount if payment is by USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts.

Item Description

CZ-USA Dan Wesson Pointman 9

Specifications:

    Manufacturer: CZ USA Dan Wesson
    Item Number: 01909
    Caliber: 9mm
    Action Type: SAO
    Overall Length: 8.75 in
    Barrel Length: 5.0 in
    Barrel Type: Match grade
    Weight: 2.42 lbs
    Sights: Adjustable rear, fiber optic front
    Mag Capacity: 9+1 Rounds
    Magazines Included: 9 Round Magazine
    Accessory Rail: No
    Notes: Pictures are of a previous model I had in stock, the current one up for auction has not been out of the box. The front sight may be red or green pending what Dan Wesson is installing at the time. Also the serial number will be different than what is pictured.
    Features: The PM9 is the only Government size Dan Wesson model chambered in 9mm Luger. We have offered this model in limited quantities in the past and always have demand greater than production capacity allows.

    This gun features our Clark style rib on top of the forged slide with an adjustable target sight in the rear and a popular fiber-optic sight in the front.

    The slide also features front and rear cocking serrations. The frame is forged stainless with an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI front strap checkering.

    We have polished the flats to a soft-brushed finish and sandblasted the rounds for a nice contrast.

    We have installed Double Diamond cocobolo grips to finish it off. With the low cost of 9mm ammunition and lack of recoil, this is the perfect model for getting acquainted with the 1911. This model shines both at the range and in competition. (9+1 capacity).

Bought this at a gun store about a year ago, don't want to sell, but have bills to pay, so I figured I'd see if anyone on here wants it. Alloy lower, steel slide. The slide has a few (two on each side) bare spots from holster wear. Comes with two magazine(s), Pro-Tech Outdoors nylon holster/mag holder, and 100 rounds of steel cased 95 grain JHP's from Barnaul.

Very, very light, easy to forget that you're carrying. Has a heavy trigger, but this can be fixed in ~10 minutes with a new mainspring. There's also a heavier recoil spring available (both from Wolff) that will help tame the recoil and make the gun last longer. If I was keeping this gun, I'd do both of those mods"

 This is one heck of a deal, no way you could build this setup for this price. I religiously clean all of my weapons, so you won't be getting a clunker.

 Gun has chrome-lined H-bar barrel, and chrome lined BCG. The recoil management on this gun is amazing! I have shot many AR's in different configurations, and this one has the least recoil of any I have ever shot. Cabela's tactical rifle case will be included. $1200 OBO

 I also have +/- 500 rounds of mixed .223 / .556 that I will sell with gun for $.30 per round. All brass.

A little history: I just took this rifle out to the range and it is really fun to shoot, I'm just hoping to change up my closet a bit and i don't reload so ammo is harder to get a hold of. the cleaning rod was slight bent when i bought the rifle and i found out after the fact that it had rusted in the bolt. it took a lot of elbow grease to get the rod out to fully disassemble the rifle and clean out the cosmo but i did.

I have a nice rifle for sale. This rifle also has a muzzle break on it. It seems to have had a bayonet at one time, but the metal has been polished smooth where the bracket was. It does fire and function without any problem. I have several, so do not need this one. Please do not try to move me on the price. I am firm there. I do not know the country of origin. I just am not that familiar to be able to tell. Thank you for looking. God bless.."

The is chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 16 inch barrel and standard A2 flash hider. One unique aspect of the Rhino Arms AR-15 is the addition of a reinforced magwell (easily seen in the pictures) which makes the rifle tough enough for extremely hard use, though i've babied it myself-- approximately 400 rounds have passed through the chamber (it runs steel cased ammo as well as it does brass). I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be. I purchased the rifle new in 2010 in stock configuration and proceeded to add the following accessories:

Stag Arms 6-position retractable stock
Blackhawk ergonomic Grip
Blackhawk quad rail
Magpul AFG2
Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight

It is silver.  The optics are in good condition but the previous owner scratched the outside in the mounting area.  It has a duplex reticle

A nice feature of this scope is that the objective lens is adjustable to change the focus, with markings from 25 and 200 yards.  You can focus a little close than 25 yards, that is just where the first mark is.

Another nice feature is the target turrets.  You can use your fingers to remove the turret covers and adjust for windage and elevation.  The turrets are clearly marked in white on black.   There are tall hash marks at whole numbers and short hash mark at the halves.    One click is a half mark, which works out to 1/2 inch at 100 yards.  There is a label to remind you inside the turret cover.  The scale runs from from 0 to 28 in even numbers. The barrel of the turret is marked like a micrometer so that you can count how many turns you make.  The count goes from 0 to 3 turns in whole numbers.

I will be in town for the NRA meeting. I can deliver it then or meet you in Louisville, Lexington, Cincinnati or points in between.

Back and better than ever, the NEW Ruger® Red Label over-and-under shotgun represents American gunmaking at its finest. Known for years as a top choice of American hunters and clay shooters for its world-renowned rugged construction and handsome American styling – the Red Label returns. Newly redesigned, the shotgun now features refined inner workings, a new center of gravity and reduced recoil, making it lively in the hand and even more pleasurable to shoot. These improvements make the new Red Label shotgun the perfect choice for hunting upland game, waterfowling, sporting clays, skeet or even just informal clay target shooting with family. Built by American workers in American factories, the Ruger® Red Label shotgun is another 100% American-made product from Ruger.


Features:

*Automatic, two-position tang safety/barrel selector provides instant visibility and accessibility.

*Finely polished, stainless steel receiver is corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws.

*Reliable, single mechanical trigger that allows for firing the second barrel without recocking and features rebounding hammers for easy opening.

*Sleek, compact locking system is considered to be among the strongest ever built for over-and-under shotguns.

*Precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged barrels made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel feature 2″ forcing cones and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more uniform patterns.

*1/4″ dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib with brass bead front sight is stress relieved, contour-grounded, precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished monoblock.

*Beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American Walnut stock features a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr® buttpad is mounted on the 14.5″ length of pull stock, which features a 1.5″ drop at the comb and a 2.5″ drop at the heel.

*Five steel-shot compatible, screw-in Briley® chokes and wrench included, featuring two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one improved cylinder choke, plus a premium-quality Briley® choke tube wrench.
*Also includes: custom molded, semi-soft case; safety lock.

1- Smith and Wesson SD9VE
2- Stainless steel magazines 16+1 capacity 2 of them
3- Trijicon RMR RM05 Dual Illuminated (best handgun optics in the world) 
4 - Slide milled for an RMR or Delta point 
5 - 10-8 performance Suppressor front sight
6 - Apex Tactical Trigger Spring Kit to reduce trigger weight, and polished sear and firring ping for the smooth travel 
7 - Custom stipple job on the frame to add texture to grip

I started out to create a value built of the more expensive Bowie Tactical Concept M&P line so the stippling and sights were taken from those designs. Also the SD9VE is design just like the M&P with a simpler trigger mechanism. This gun has less parts than a Glock thus making it very reliable, It's been properly broken in and has shot flawless, Only reason I'm selling is to trade up. 

Asking price for the gun and the Sight together  is 450.00 OBO contac Leo by text or call if can't text at REDACTED Thanks. Will not separate optics from gun

It's a great gun, very clean and very well maintained.  It's only seen around 100 rounds through it.  I wanted to try something different since ergonomics are better than what I'm used to (glock), and it's just an awesome looking handgun.  People's biggest complaint about glock is it's ""2x4"" grip but, it's what works for me.  The XDm has had hornady critical duty ammunition through it without an issue and this ammunition seems to cause guns to have failures to feed due to the rubber insert.  I had the internals polished to get rid of the grittiness in the trigger that you get with some brand new firearms.  This comes with 4 magazines, 3 flush (11 Rounds) and one high cap with X-Tension (16 Rounds).  Since this wasn't my EDC, ammunition did not sit in the magazines all day every day, only time ammunition was in the magazines was when it was at the range, which I only used the high cap for range time, but the flush magazines were still tested to make sure there were no issues with them.  This also comes with the original case, speed loader, lock, all 3 interchangeable backstraps, holster, double magazine pouch, and brush.  I'm asking $500obo."

From The Remington Site:

Custom-grade accuracy is now within reach of virtually every hunter. Using the expertise that's dominated bolt-action technology for more than 50 years, the engineering team started from scratch and combined their most advanced, accuracy-enhancing features to create an all-new platform. This sleek, hardworking tack-driver is even built differently.

Crafted in our newest manufacturing facility using proprietary methods that create the tightest tolerances from rifle to rifle, by the most efficient means possible. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice are the striking lines of the new stock design. Inside, it's a true performance-enhancer, with a dual-pillar bedding platform that free-floats the barrel for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. The black synthetic stock contains a high nylon fiber content which gives the stock superior strength and rigidity. Also helping deliver those inherently tight groups is a precision button-rifled barrel. For shot control, it's equipped with the crisp new CrossFire™ trigger system that's user adjustable to suit your preferences. The 783 features a steel detachable magazine with a steel latch. Standard calibers have a four round capacity and magnum calibers hold three rounds. Like with all Remington bolt actions, expect a lifetime of rock-solid reliability. From the next generation in a legendary bloodline.

Key Features:

    New CrossFire™ trigger system, factory set at 3 1/2 lbs. and user adjustable from 2 1/2 to 5 lbs.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.

will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."
