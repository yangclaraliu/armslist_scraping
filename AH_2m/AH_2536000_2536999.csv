The Colt Trooper Mark-V is the predecessor to the King Cobra and is less expensive then both the King Cobra & the Python.  Mark-V's have exactly the same trigger and hammer system as the King Cobra, Anaconda and Diamondback.  This revolver is equipped with Target Grips, Hammer and Trigger.  This Colt has had a little trigger work done so it is quite quick and smooth with a SA pull right at a 2lb and just under 10lbs in DA.  The timing is very good and is exactly what Colt designed it to be for a Trooper Mark-V which is exactly the same as the King Cobra.  Hey S&W guys... The lockup of the cylinder is not the same as a Smith so don't expect it to be.  (It's not bad, it's just different).  The only real difference between the Mark-V and the King Cobra is the exterior finish (Mark-V's didn't come in a Stainless Finish).  Mark-V's don't have a full length lower barrel lug either but they do have a vented top rib like the Python.  As with all higher-end Colts this revolver has adjustable sights.  I'm selling the 4"" revolver, which is in excellent condition,  for $775.00 (Firm).  No Trades please.  My asking price is fair as 2 have sold on Gun Broker for over $900 in the past week and those buyers have to pay shipping and FFL fees.  Call/Text Rick 5O5*6IO*529I"

This is my daily carry gun. Sadly I lost my job and can't pay my bills or buy my soon to be 9 year old presents for his birthday Jan 21st.  I have job interviews lined up and I'll be in the market for another one when things stabilize, but as tough as it is I gotta let this one go. This is my favorite handgun ever. I sold my S&W Shield before this one because I love it so much. Comes with the Springfield accessory kit (speed loader, plastic molded holster, molded mag holder), a 12 round extended mag and standard 9 round mag with a pierce grip extension (allows for that extra control of the pinky finger on the grip and still super easy to carry concealed).  Also including my leather IWB concealment holster ($60 value) that is made for this model and fits it like a glove, and is now conditioned  perfectly so it's supple enough to draw quickly and tough enough to grip tight.

This was a ruger factory assembly mistake of at least 3 and 10 or less made. What happened was the blue bearcat got a stainless barrel anda  blue sight placed on it.

I have been in contact with ruger several times over the last 2 weeks and talked and emailed them. The ruger person validated how many were made and assured me at least 3 , mine and the two serials up from mine, and ten or less before the assembly line was stopped and the stainless barrels were removed from the line and the correct blue ones put back in.  

This is new in the box. I frog greased it and have showed it to local dealers and persons I know. There has been a rugerforum dot com thread about it discussing this so a web thread is available for you to read.  

email me with cell and best time to call to discuss

send me some offers you ruger collectors

i would think if there are 3 and up to 10, the value should be at minimum three times the price of them to start, since i know at least three were made, and who knows the value."

them add the vented rib on the barrel, a nice extended butt stock, a top of the line poly choke system and a quick safety (See in pictures) for a quicker safety switch. This model 12 has the upgraded wood stock on it that has a beautiful finish and slick lines with only a few minor handling marks. I would rank this Model 12 at a 9 out of 10 on condition.

This is hands down the highest quality Ak47 on the market. Do the research for your self. This is NOT Romanian or Wasr like most AK's for sale. These Mak90's are rarely sold due to their build quality and collectability. I have meticulously owned this weapon and have always kept it well oiled. I keep my firearms stored in a moisture controlled room to assure no pitting or rust will accumulate.

This 4 1/2 lb. revolver is a real behemoth with a 9"" barrel that'll hurl a .44 caliber round ball out at over 1100 fps! Without going through an FFL, you get six shots of serious firepower - followed by a lot of cleaning ;)
My reproduction cap & ball will be sold with the following accessories:

1 near-full box of round balls (about 80 I'd guess)
1 nipple wrench 
1 opened tube of bore butter
1 unopened tin of 100 No. 11 percussion caps

All you need to start shooting is some powder!
I've gotten a lot of good use out of it and taken as many hi-resolution pictures as I can to show its condition (armslist limits to 3 pics/4MB). I never shot it with 60 grain loads and always took care of it, of course, it is a used black powder revolver. It has some light scratches that you can see in the picture but it's in good condition and I really would like to hold onto it.
This isn't one of those cheap knock-offs made of soft metals - this is an Italian made Uberti which costs $439 new (http://www.uberti.com/1847-walker-revolver). I'm selling mine with all the accessories for only $295!
If you have any questions, feel free to contact me. I'd be willing to drive up to an hour to deliver it to a public place, where we can meet. No deliveries to NJ - know your local laws.
Firearm sold as-is, buyer assumes all responsibility.
You won't find another little set-up like this for less than three hundred dollars. It's a lot of fun, it's accurate, throws out a ton of smoke and has minimal recoil due to it's weight.
Good luck!"

I am selling my never fired Colt Carbine.  It has been in the safe for about a year, only taken out for bi-weekly dust removal.  Honestly, I just do not have time to shoot anymore and can use money for other action items on my list.  Here is the setup
- 1 New fired Carbine
- 12 NIB 30 Rd PMag magazines (mix between window and no window)
- 600 rounds Remington Ammo
- Ammo box

Carbine specs:
- 1:7 twist
- MaTech Flip up rear sight
- 4 position buffer tube and M4 stock
- Bayonet Lug and flash hider
- Lightweight Barrel
- Cleaning supplies that come stock with the rifle
- Stock strap

I am not price gouging.  I consider the gun in it's condition worth $1200.00 (going rate for this firearm that I have seen).  Considering that 600 rounds amounts to 24 boxes of ammunition at $13.00 a box (which amounts to $312.00), Cabelas ammo case ($10.00), and 12 NIB Magpul's  ($100.00).  It is not garage sale prices; but, as far as I am concerned fair prices.  There is not 1 ding, nick, blemish on the rifle.  Also, there will be no spec of dust on the rifle when you get it.  Everything will be cleaner than you will every find at a dealer.  I believe that you must take exception care of every investment you make, and I am certain that you will see that in this rifle.

No trades are welcome unless they are NFC Championship Tickets (of course we are going to kill the Saints); but, I am pretty sure that is am offer I will not receive.  If it is a trade, straight across or don't bother.  

If you wonder why I am selling it is because I have a very limited list of adventures I would like to raise funds for without dipping into the family budget.  Things like season tickets renewals (or better seats), non firearm related safe (since I am selling my Franklin), 2014 RAM additions, Stihl equiptment, and more stuff I am sure you do not care about."

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan.

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan.

Got it at Walmart for about $240 could have got it at Cabela's for $220 but I'm throwing in a $35 case and $80 recoil pad witch by the way is pretty much a necessity for shooting 3"" shells   
I've put around 75 shells through it of every type I have I even put some ice slugs through it  (don't worry it doesn't have any rust)  I put it threw enough stress I'm confident it won't break under normal wear tare and use. 
I'd prefer to ask $275 which would be a fair price but I need the cash soon so my loss is your gain.  :-) 
By the way this gun works great for cut shells that's why I got it and one of the reasons I love it. With the sights on it it it's far more accurate with them than any other shotgun I've tried before.  

If you don't know what a cut shell is you should really find out. Awesome is the only word you must try them to believe how awesome they are.  :-)

If you are a shady raving murder or bank robber or something like that don't bother trying to get me to sell this to you I'm generally pretty good at telling if some one is a creep. (Jest don't think of the saying ""Takes one to know one"" about here  lol)

I purchased this upper and ammo for a build I was doing. Only reason I'm selling is because I've decided to change up my build. This upper is new and I have only had it for about 3 months. There has never been a round shot through this upper. All ammo was recently purchased. 

FYI.....I don't have to sell the upper or ammo. I am willing to negotiate a little. So don't try to low ball me on price. This AAC upper is high quality.

PLEASE - PM me for more info. Have some pictures of the rifle, will get case and other things tomorrow.

I am putting my Rock River Tactical Operator AR15 up for sale with pictures to follow tomorrow. Everything is in 9.5/10 condition. Marked down .5 for being used. All EOTech equipment has original hard case, rifle has Rock River hard case also. 
This is a great package, and will only sell complete. I will be putting pictures up tomorrow. The pricing on the RR rifles are specific to how you configure them when you purchase. This one was $1425 with all the upgrades, but I know...Never get back what you put into it... So, I put an average price for a standard configured one without any upgrading. Also, the magnifier, although only used about 10 times, is last years model. The new ones are almost $600, as were these but I put $400 as a current price. Anyone that knows these magnifiers, know they are the best on the market!! Same with EOTech.

Complete Bad Ass Setup
a) Rock River Operator Rifle w/ 1 30rd Magazine - $1200
b) EOTech 556 A65 w/ side mounted controls - $575
c) EOTech 3x Magnifier - $400
d) Magpul MI Sling - $50
e) Harris Swivel Mount Bipod - $110
f) Hardig Storm (Pelican) Case - $220

Total $2555

Will sell for $2,200.

These are current pricing without the obvious tax. I will also include some ""extra's"". GG&G Sling swivel mount, Scope Coat for Magnifier, RI BUIS, Small jar of frog lube (all that has ever been used on this rifle) and anything else i have in the case.

It is almost like brand new.  It shoots great and, obviously, it is a very high quality carry pistol.  It comes with a flush fitting 13 round magazine as well as the form fitting extended 16 round magazine from Springfield.  I have sold many firearms here and everyone always tells me that the firearm they purchase is far nicer than I described.  Literally, I ran 100 rounds through this pistol to break it in and make sure everything works fine for it to be a carry pistol, cleaned it and put it away.  I've never carried it.  However, included is the XD ""gear"", which includes a Springfield holster, Springfield double magazine holder and Springfield loading tool.  Obviously, the lock, manual and very high quality Springfield original case are included as well.

If you are not familiar with the Springfield eXtreme Duty pistols, just Google them. (the XD in the name is for 'extreme duty')  These pistols are well known for being ultimately reliable, extremely durable and very accurate.  I have collected firearms for many years and I would say that this pistol compares very well with a Glock 26 except that you get 13 rounds (as opposed to 10 with the G26) along with the option of having 16 rounds with the included higher capacity magazine.  Some people have strong feelings either way, but having shot both, they seem to shoot pretty well the same to me.  I simply have way too many firearms and am reducing the size of my collection."

The ""Baby"" of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms this popular firearm came back to the US market. Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."
