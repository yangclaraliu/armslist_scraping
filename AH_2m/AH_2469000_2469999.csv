http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sig556-swat.aspx

SIG556® SWAT Like the SIG556, the SIG556 SWAT features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by SIG’s sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG556 SWAT features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The high performance flash suppressor provides enhanced flash reduction and features an ACME type thread for compatibility with select industry sound suppression devices. The flash suppressor retains a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The vented tactical quad rail forearm is machined from aircraft grade aluminum alloy and hard coat anodized for durability. The quad rail features four integrated steel Picatinny rails for mounting a wide range of accessories. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength carbon steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The rifle comes standard with the flip up combat front and rear sight system. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The rifle features the MAGPUL CTR Carbine Buttstock. This buttstock is adjustable for length of pull and features a unique locking mechanism that friction locks the stock to the receiver extension for zero movement. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment. The rifle also includes the Grip-Light vertical forend grip which features a removable tactical LED flashlight and mounts directly to the quad rail forends. Select versions feature a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds.

SIG 556 Rifle Wins NRA Tactical Gun of the Year

Few semi-automatic rifles have captured the imagination of the shooting public like the SG 550 series. For years this legendary Swiss-made rifle has been restricted to law enforcement and military sales, where it has acquired a reputation for reliability, durability and accuracy. Now, SIG Sauer has developed a U.S. made version called the SIG 556 ... .” So stated Shooting Editor Glenn Gilbert in “Like a Swiss Watch” (December 2007, p. 46).

Both 556 SWAT and full-length versions feature the quality shooters have come to expect from SIG, including steel Picatinny rails fixed to the tops of their receivers and military-grade cold-hammer-forged barrels. But these are fully updated designs. Significant changes have been made to the lower receiver and the stock. The cast aluminum lower receiver retains the ambidextrous safety lever of the original 550, but the magazine well has been modified to take commercial and surplus AR-15/M16-style magazines. Further, given the crisp break and limited overtravel of its trigger, the SIG 556’s accuracy was commendable.

“The bottom line, simply stated,” wrote Gilbert, “is that the SIG 556 is an exceptionally accurate and reliable semi-automatic rifle whose performance is more than enough to justify its existence.” That shared sentiment among staffers resulted in the SIG Sauer 556 being named the first-ever American Rifleman Tactical Gun of the Year."

I want to get a .45acp or a 9mm, maybe a .357.

I would prefer to trade but fell free to make a cash offer. The pistol was $700, the 5 extra mags were $150 on a good day + $5 each for limiters and shipping, and the ammo is worth north of $120, that's $970 without tax or extras.  I was thinking $750 for everything.

This is a very nice pistol and everything I have is in new condition. The XDM is the Match Grade version of the XD line. The (M) stands for ""match"". IT comes with a match grade barrel, trigger, extended slide release and mag release, 3dot sights, all factory. They also come with 16rd mags, I have added a 1 round mag limiter to all 7 mags witch make them 15rd mags and legal to buy or sell. I got them from Magazineblocks.com if you want to check them out. They pop right in and work well, I did glue them to make it legal to buy or sell them. 

I really don't want to separate all this stuff. If you don't want the ammo, I would take $700 for the gun/gear/ and 7mags.

$375-ish in gun, and $375-ish in cash would be ideal for me."

The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. To ease assembly Seekins Precision eliminated the use of roll pins, hammers, punches and replaced them with custom screw in dowel pins. We installed an upper tensioning set screw, a set screw for trigger reset, relocated and retained the rear take down pin detent under the grip. Our ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. The unique magwell design allows positive mag changes and allows the use of most all mags including Magpul P-mag and Surefire high capacity mags.

The Legendary Model 1851 Navy Revolver

One of the most popular sidearms of its day, the legendary Colt 1851 was coveted equally by Northern and Southern soldiers. Time and again, Samuel Colt’s masterpiece proved itself in battle and earned its rightful place as a true American icon. There was little debate when it came to selecting this model as the perfect handgun to commemorate one of the most defining events in American history.

With its 7½-inch octagonal barrel and sleek frame, the Model 1851 Navy remains one of the most sought after and beloved firearms of all time. Each Civil War firearm available in the edition is a meticulously-detailed recreation of the legendary Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, created by the incomparable artisans of A. Uberti. For decades, their craftsmen have combined modern high-grade materials with time-honored methods of finishing to create exquisite, working reproductions of history’s greatest firearms.

Craftsmen decorate each Tribute in stunning 24-karat gold over blued steel, handsomely capturing this momentous occasion.
The left side of the barrel of this Civil War firearm features a 24-karat gold decorated banner, identifying the revolver as the “American Civil War 150th Anniversary Tribute.” Also featured on the left side of the Tribute are the crossed flags of the Union and Confederate forces. Complementing the overall design are lustrously, hand-polished walnut grips.

The right side of the barrel of this Civil War firearm features a famous phrase used by Abraham Lincoln during an 1858 speech “A House Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand.” Lincoln borrowed this axiom from the Bible as a warning about the mounting tensions between the Northern and Southern states. After his election to the presidency, Lincoln continued to cut through the differences that divided our nation and to remind us of what was necessary to restore and repair the broken union. Both sides of the 24-karat gold decorated frame feature a banner with the dates of the Civil War, “1861-1865.”
The centerpiece of the Civil War firearm is the lavishly illustrated cylinder, featured in 24-karat gold and meticulously decorated with an epic scene depicting a clash between Union and Confederate soldiers. From flags to uniforms to facial expressions, no detail has been overlooked in this breathtaking scene, reminiscent of the carnage during the Battle of Antietam. The September 17, 1862 showdown between the Northern forces of General George McClellan and the Southern soldiers under General Robert E. Lee was the bloodiest single-day battle of the war.
In order to display and protect your Civil War Sesquicentennial Tribute Revolver, it is housed in a luxuriously lined display case, including an engraved brass identification plaque and replica Union and Confederate buckles. One of a limited edition. #A85771 This item is #77 of only 1865 made."

Stock info:
Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic 12841. Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."

The previous owner was unsure of the round count but he bought it new and said he put probably less than 1,000rds through it before he went with a smaller carry gun.  I put about 200rds through it myself with no issues.

Includes all original items/paperwork/case and one 7rd Kimber magazine.

The barrel shows a little bit of superficial discoloring (which I hear is common on Kimbers), and the slide has a tiny internal wear mark toward the rear of it as shown in the pics.  Overall finish looks excellent except for the mild idiot mark the previous owner put under the slide catch.  Can only be seen from the right angle. 

Has factory Meprolight night sights, and will include factory grips as well.

Don't hesitate to contact me with any questions.  I will be happy to provide more pictures.  Must have FL Concealed Carry Permit.  Bill of sale will be signed.  No shipping.  Must be within the West Palm Beach area.  I will drive 20 mins to meet.

Now its time for me to take on some of the family history please enjoy .

Thank You

Rob Luft 



A little family history of my dad Eugene Luft and his cousins Carl and Harry Luft i remember meeting them as a teenager. 

The wildcat 30 Luft mag. came out in the late 1930s and rifles made for it up until the late 1950s. It is a 300 H&H mag case blown out, shortened and re-necked to give more power and better performance.

 A fairly scarce round, never caught on. Developed by the Luft Bros. Gunsmiths from Spokane, WA. The Luft brothers were gunsmiths in Spokane Washington and worked alot on custom Borchardt rifles in modern cartridges.

The Luft brothers also made a another wildcat, the 333 Express which was very similar to the 333 OKH.All of the old short magnums (Luft, Mashburn, Ackley, O'Neil, Apex, etc) were made from the 300 H&H or 375 H&H since that is all that was available back then. It's not that hard to do but now-a-days you have all the modern brass so why bother? I shoot a 30 Short Ackley Magnum as my HG at 1000 yard NBRSA and I use 300WM brass. The shoulder pushes back without much work and I then trim the extra .010"".

 Or if you don't like trimming you could start with 338WM or 7mmRM. The Norma 308M works too if you can locate the brass. All of the different brass has different inside dimensions, and therefore capacity, and you can control the final capacity of your Mashburn brass when selecting the parent case.

 Luft Brothers in Spokane, WA in the early 1950's to mid-60's. The Luft brothers worked on custom Borchardt rifles but chambered for modern cartridges.


for Ordering and line of all our products ,go to    www.firearms accessorydepot.com. or contact rob luft to place orders or contact me chuck@ 206-9533 and I can contact rob myself.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.

Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space

432,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2469432,For Sale:  1911 80% frame+extras,"Utica/Rome area, Adirondacks, New York",$ 300,"Listed On: Thursday, December 19, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"If you do not know what an 80% receiver is, then this listing is not for you.  This is not for the faint of heart either.  If you had a tough time with an AR-15 80% receiver, this 80% 1911 may very well be your undoing. 

This is the Ares Armor Rudius 80% 1911 frame.  I purchased it with eager plans of completing it, but alas it is just collecting dust in my possession.
It is brand new and I haven't touched it with a single tool (just a little Frog Lube to prevent my dust collection from rusting it).  

Seeing as I am feeling quite happy with my plan to get rid of some of my things, I will throw in the following as freebies: 
•	1 brand new MEC-GAR magazine for .45 ACP
•	1 slightly used thumb safety for a 1911 (like 20 rounds fired through that 1911 before I took it out. I promise)
•	1 slightly used non adjustable trigger for a 1911 (took it out at the same time as the safety... I'm a monster I know)

Now that I have you fully excited, I bet you are wondering what that dashingly handsome complete 1911 is doing in the pictures?  Well, he is not included in this listing and if I said ""sorry"" I'd be lying. That is just there to illustrate the size difference and hopefully your eye was drawn to the picatinny rail on the dust cover of the 80% frame that could be yours (very very sexy), also the 80% frame is significantly slimmer since the grips don't attach on top of the frame, they are in fact the frame (grab a towel and clean up your exploded mind off your screen).

Lastly since this is only a paperweight to the untrained eye, let me remind you that this can be raised up into different calibers and not just .45 ACP to make use of the free mag.  You could go wimpy 9mm, a little stronger .40, all American .45, or be a frickin weirdo and make it 10mm.


**The only flaw on the frame is from the manufacture: One of the connecting points in the polymer (where the trigger guard mates with the steel) looks like it may brake off, but that part isn't really important at all, so no worries.** 


If you think my price is too high, I'm just going off what I paid and this is at least in stock with freebies.  Check out the retail cost at the Ares Armor site.


Once again this is merely a paperweight since it is an 80% completed frame.  I will ship it directly to you, no need for an FFL.  God's speed.


FOR US SALE ONLY!!
I will not sell outside the US sorry folks.


Edit** It is from the first production run of the Rudius and is the original gen 1 grip**"

OUR TERMS and CONDITIONS;
Buyer must be 18 years old for long guns and 21 years old for handguns plus you must be legally able to own or possess a firearm. You must secure a current FFL in your State of residence and in your area for us to ship the firearm to. I will only ship this firearm to an FFL. I will need a legible copy of his FFL with dealer ID, signature and expiration date. If I can't read it or it is not clear and legible I will not ship the firearm. Please have them put the buyer/owners full name, home address, home phone number, and his information on the FFL for our records and so I can match the buyer to the FFL and to the firearm.

I am a Federal Firearm Licensed Dealer. You must abide by all Local, State and Federal Laws and it is YOUR responsibility to know your local laws before buying. Not my responsibility! There will be a 25% re-stocking fee if the firearm cannot be delivered as agreed on any canceled or returned item after payment.  Shipping will be paid to and from by you accepting the firearm and on any return firearm.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out. Your payment, by cash, Personal Check, Certified Check, USPS Money Order, and now we accept Credit Cards as well. I wouldn't recommend cash but if you must send cash, go ahead. Personal Checks must clear my bank and I will not ship until I get confirmation your check has cleared, usually about a 10 day wait after deposit. Certified Check must also clear but usually shorter wait time. USPS Money Order must also clear but usually very fast. All major Credit Cards are accepted, but you must call me to give me your CC information, number, expiration date, CCV and Name on the card. There is a 3% up-fee/surcharge on Credit Cards on the full amount including shipping but as soon as the funds show up in my account I will ship. Usually about 24 hours.

Your payment is due in our hands or account within 7 calendar days after you agree to buy.  NO excuses, NO extensions accepted. Call me or e-mail with your information. If you do not pay within the 7 days as agreed I will re-post this firearm.  Your call or e-mail will not change this.

We reserve the right to end this sale early at any time if there are no inquiries or e-mails regarding this sale.  If you want to buy this firearm please let me know ASAP.  The first person to contact me has the first right of refusal.  I will only take this firearm off the site when I have money in hand for the purchase.

If you don't want to lose your gun rights and you don't want more Government CONTROL, and you want to be able to buy guns and ammunition, and you want your gun stores to stay in business, - JOIN THE NRA!!!  Let's vote them out of there, and ""God Bless America""
If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales tax, on top of everything else.
