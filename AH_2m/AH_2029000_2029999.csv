LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

The service men and women of the coalition forces in the Middle East and Afghanistan require cutting tools that can stand up to the harsh demands of the desert. Our Carson Desert Tactical Folders have been developed specifically to blend into the desert environment.

M16®-14D Desert Big Dog has an aluminum frame M16 in desert camo. The contoured handles of 6061 T6 aluminum are hard anodized Desert Tan. The 3.875"" (98 mm) AUS 8 stainless steel blade, chosen for edge retention and durability, receives a highly corrosion-resistant Desert Tan non-reflective titanium nitride coating. It has a Combined Razor-Sharp and Triple-Point™ Serrated edge to cut through nets, webbing and vegetation quickly.

It also features our exclusive patented* AutoLAWKS™ safety, which automatically turns the folder into a fixed blades when the blade is opened and locked.

One-hand opening and closing is quick and smooth, the result of precision tolerances and lubrous washers at the blade pivot. The dual ambidextrous thumb studs with checkered surfaces provide instant access in any circumstance.

Its a 3.0 v6 with a 5 speed manual transmission. 144,xxx miles but very well taken care of. I only use 93 octane fuel and give it fuel system treatments on every 3rd fill up from empty (about 1 or 2 times a month)

 Its mechanically sound and runs very strong. I have no problem in taking it to a mechanic to prove it (at buyers expense). 

New tires all the way around with an oil change less than 200 miles ago. The engine has not been modified as of right now, but it will in the near future after I'm done with the cosmetic work. The only thing it has on it is an aftermarket N1 style muffler, it has a great deep rumble sound, its not too loud and not too quiet. 

It has an Infinity 4 disk cd changer / cassette sound system from the factory. 

Power everything (Windows, mirrors, convertible top, driver's seat.)

Glass rear window.

2nd gen Eclipse GSX 17"" Enkei wheels.

Very fast, 200hp 5 speed with the rare Fed Spec motor, no speed or rev limiter. 140 on the dash, but it does go beyond it. It will blow the doors off the average turbo Honda any day.

I bought it when it was in pretty bad condition, it was in a minor fender bender and have been fixing it all up, inside and out. It still needs some more work (minor cosmetics) I do something new to it every weekend if I have the time. Some interior pieces have even been replaced since the pictures have been taken. Needless to say I've put blood, sweat, and tears into making her roadworthy again. It does have a clean title. Its been my project for the track and this years jdm car shows, but I'm looking to get out the car scene and get back to the range. 

This is my baby, and I will not be low balled. $3500 cash obo. No test drives without the cash in hand.

Id much rather you come and look at it yourself, since the pictures suck, but more can be sent by request.

I'm leaving on a trip soon, thats why this is beening sold cheap. Just some fun money. But please dont insult with silly offers.  The gun on sale at Vances when I bought my first one cost me $720, plus taxs. So this is a very fair price. If it doesn't sell for $640, It will rest in my safe. I offer great prices on my guns I part with, not trying to screw anyone. But I gotta say, some people on here on are just plain trying to abuse folks.

Semi Auto 7.62X39 RPD Carbine The R.P.D. was the first machine gun designed to fire the 7.62x39mm cartridge. The R.P.D. platform has been issued by many countries including the Soviet Union, China, Egypt and former Eastern Bloc countries. The R.P.D. was also used by the U.S. SOF in Vietnam. DSA has modernized this battlefield benchmark with features such as a newly designed 7075T6 alloy lower and proprietary rail handguard. With these new features you can outfit your R.P.D.system with any M16 style adjustable stock, giving the end user greater versatility. The rail handguard allows the mounting of a variety of accessories, including optics, lasers, flashlights and foregrips. Compared to the old wooden handguards, a foregrip added to the new DSA rail handguard is extremely helpful in heat dispersion and improving overall effective operation. In addition, the DSA barrel is fluted and shortened. This reduces weight and helps keep the barrel cool. A very effective, proven design flashhider has also been added. These features have reduced the R.P.D. weight by almost 2 pounds.

No game too big.
Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.
Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.
Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide.
The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.
This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. 

A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W."

If you have a felony on your criminal record, you cannot buy it. I will check, so do not ask me to break the law. 
I am selling an explosive ordinance detonation suit (bomb squad suit).
It's model number is EOD-07B, size large, made by a Canadian company.
I am located I Sacramento and the suit is stored in town (but not at my house so plan accordingly).
Price: $2,500 obo
This suit was manufactured in 1997 and is flawless. I will link to a thread where I discussed its history and how I came to own it when I get around to it. 
It includes multiple layers (as in 80lbs of protection) for torso legs and arms. this does not include a helmet however, so if you have one already you may want to be sure it is capable of using with this particular suit before buying (as it seems like each piece fits together like a puzzle. 
Although it is around 15 years old, I have always kept it in its bag which is stored in a climate controlled, dry dark place. The craftsmanship is immaculate on this suit, all of the stitching is perfect and straight. The nylon type material that encases the armor looks like it would be easily scratched but isn't (anywhere). 
Though I cannot swear by it it could not have been worn more than a couple of times before I bought it (at a garage sale... It's a long story) about ten years ago. It ""smelled"" new at that point and still does as I have only worn it for a few hours at a Halloween party and again a couple times when I put it on for 10 minutes or so to scare the crap out of my girlfriend."

The magazine tube has issues,  it will let more than one shell out and jam up when you try to pump the slide forward.  The rifle extracts and ejects shell casings just fine,  and the gun functions perfectly if you drop a shell in the chamber and put one shell in the magazine tube.  It is a very functional and economical two shot woods rifle ( how many more shots are you going to get in the woods).  I have kept it for a back-up/loaner rifle for all these years, but with young children I now keep everything in a safe and a recent purchase is crowding this one out.
