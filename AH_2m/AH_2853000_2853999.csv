The optics are beautiful and crisp. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. The rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

Also, I am willing to sell the rifle and mounts seperate from the scope and rings for $625.00. My price is firm and Im not in the market for anything else.

Selling it because I wasn't aware this gun isn't designed for lefty's even though I seen videos posted from lefty's using it fine, I simply cannot. My index finger cant hit the slide release I have to switch to my right hand and do it easily with my thumb. A unneeded step I don't want to have to take with a carry weapon.

This gun is $450 + Tax or FFL fee.. leaving you at just under $500

I'll sell for $430.. no wait period, nothing. new, never fired. LIFETIME WARRANTY

Comes with everything.. Box, manual, lock, factory test fire casing,2 magazines.. 7+1, 8+1, barrel safety clip.

(P.S. You wont find a better deal, most people sell you their problems.. meaning they're selling it because something is wrong with it.. This always holds true, even in this case, but in this case the problem is that I'm a lefty and the gun doesn't have ambidextrous slide release. you won't find a new one cheaper and if you find a used one they're probably selling it because it has failures.)"

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after.

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike.

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind.

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today!

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices.

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine.

You know that our President recently halted the import of M1 Garands and has substantially reduced the supply of these rifles. 

The CMP Garands are usually okay, but how many of them are in the same condition as originally issued?

I love shooting this rifle.  The first time I shouldered it, I slung it up and blasted a clay pigeon laying on the ground at 120 meters, offhand.  

That said, I am trying to consolidate major calibers, so I am keeping the 308's and selling this rifle.

The rifle is tight.  Clean. In excellent shape.  

It is a shooter.  You could pay Fulton Armory a lot more and get one this nice.

The stock has a couple dings, but the mechanicals are superb, perfect function.  Patton was right, this is an amazing implement of war.

I'm selling it for $1100 and this is more than fair.  

I also have a fair bit of 30-06 ammo I am willing to discuss with the buyer of this rifle, a little over 1200 rds, some of it loose in ammo cans, some of it in en bloc clips, all 1200+ rounds military surplus M2 ball.  I'm not selling the ammo separately at this time.

I have shot about 1,200 rounds with 1 malfunction caused by an off brand 33 round magazineand before I get someone complaining about how many rounds i put through this thing you should know that a 9mm barrel has a lifespan of about 100,000 rounds before accuracy is affected, since this barrel is NiB-X coated it should last a lot longer. All metal contact points including the slide and barrel are coated in NiB-X.

• conforms to industry standard ASTM 2433C Type I
• has an as-plated hardness of above  Rc=70
• is coated by an aerospace-certified facility

Everyone asks how the damaged happened, so here is the answer: When my great uncle owned the gun he did work for someone and they owed him. They claimed to be a gunsmith but obviously not a good one. But my uncle had the bolt altered so it would work with a scope and the barrel converted to completely free floating. It is very accurate and functions 100% normal, all just cometic. He did also lightly engrave his initial on the opposite side of the hammer marks.

Hey everyone, 
I have a new and not used Duralast Gold 65-DLG Battery. This was a replacement battery from a truck that was wrecked and destroyed the original battery. So, this one was swapped and sat on the shelf. The manufacture date is 6/13 and it had the plastic cap on it until I took it off to check the battery level and trickle charge it a little. These retail at $145+ tax and core charge at local stores. This came off of a Dodge Ram, but it will fit tons of other vehicles. Just type it into their site to check if it is compatible. This should still be a new battery as it was stored inside and on a wooden shelf. I am looking for best cash offer or possible trade for ammunition (22LR, 7.62x39, 45 auto), and even possible trade for lower priced firearms. Just make me an offer via text or respond on here. Would need to meet in Norman as well.

A groundbraking advancement in Citori design. 
Today's Citori over and under line-up includes the original, legendary Citori (with many proven models and configurations) and the new 725 version (with low profile receiver, mechanical triggers and Invector DS). The 725 is a groundbreaking advancement in Citori design that goes well beyond aesthetics into the actual design and mechanism.

The new Citori 725 is the evolution of John M. Browning’s legendary B25 Superposed, now with the modern performance advantage of a low-profile receiver. The new 725 receiver is significantly lower than other Citori 12 gauge receivers, yet the 725 shares the renowned durability of generations of Citori over and unders with the same rugged full-width hinge pin and tapered locking bolt design. With a 725, you get the ""one with the gun"" feeling you want, with the long lasting durability you expect from a Browning over and under. And the features don't stop there. The 725 showcases an all-new mechanical trigger (FireLite) that offers unmatched feel and lighter pull weights than ever before. Inflex Technology has also been added to make shooting more comfortable. And the new Invector-DS choke system moves to a new level of performance. Experience the benefits these improvements can do for your shooting with a new Citori 725, only from The Best There Is®.

And finally for small bore shooters the 725 20 gauge has arrived. All the great features of a 725 and less. That is, less weight, less bulk, less, profile. But with a new benchmark in small bore handling.

For sale is a nearly new (around 100 rounds through it, never been cleaned) Mossberg 715T .22LR. It has a red-dot sight w/ multiple patterns and brightness which works very well. Also included is a foregrip w/ storage compartment. Comes with one 25 round magazine and the original iron sights as well. If you want a mag-lock w/ 2 keys I have that as well. Reason for sale is just looking to invest this money in other hobbies (already have too many). Price is pretty firm as I believe it's a decent price given the condition and accessories. I purchased all of these items new at Academy fall of 2012 (may can find receipts if you want). Picture does not show red-dot sight (has iron sights on) but does show foregrip. NO AMMO INCLUDED. 

NO TRADES FOR OTHER GUNS. Would take Infamous Second Son which I would value at $45.

Rounding out the case design, a silver-tone textured edged crown finds a home on the right side of the build.

Sunk beneath a protective sapphire crystal, a round bezel coordinating dial boasts luminous Tritium tubes index markers at all hour positions except the cardinal positions where you'll find coordinating Arabic numerals. A date window rests between 4:00 and 5:00, keeping you on schedule. Tritium tube accented hour, minute and seconds hands ensure your ability to read the time in any light. A Japanese Automatic movement drives your Deep Blue timpeice.

Finishing your look in style, your timepiece concludes with a silver-tone stainless steel bracelet. Securing with a name and logo etched silver-tone deployant clasp, the bracelet features a diver's wet suit extension, ensuring a confident fit no matter where adventure takes you.
