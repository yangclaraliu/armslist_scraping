Great shooting gun but the history is what makes it special.  This is a Thalman shotgun from Suhl, Germany.  Suhl is rich with the natural resources necessary to make it the capital of German gunsmiths since the 1300's. Suhl steel is known as being among the best in the world.

Ernst Thalman was the communist party leader fighting against Hitler for control of pre-world war 2 Germany. Hitler gained control after the burning of the Reichstag and Thalman was taken shortly thereafter and died in custody under mysterious circumstances.  When the Soviets took over East Germany at the end of the war, they were looking for German Communist Heros and picked Thalman out for martyrdom. Statues were erected, streets renamed and the famous Ernst Thalman gunworks opened in Suhl.  

This double was manufactured in the GDR before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  They are very hard to find because the tarriffs were very high and put the gun out of reach for most westerner's.

The stock is marked ""Suhl"" and the barrels are marked ""SUHL - MADE IN GDR"" and ""SPECIAL GEWERLAUFSTAHL"" (special gun steel).  Bore's are bright and shiny and she locks up tight as a drum.  Double triggers, full choke, 12 guage, nitro proofed.  Overall, just a beautiful gun. Comes with hard case."

It is all metal with aluminum alloy frame, stainless slide, and stainless barrel. It has an ambidextrous safety/de-cocker lever, a slide release lever, a magazine release, and a magazine disconnect which disables the trigger when the magazine is removed. It is thin, at barely an inch wide, making it a favorite for concealed carry.

The sights are Novak 3 dot low profile with white dots. One feature I like is the rear dots are close together which I feel improves my accuracy.

DS Arms STG58 Austrian FAL

Posted August 17th, 2009 by Michael O. Humphries & filed under Special Weapons For Military & Police, Special Weapons For Military & Police August 2009.

World’s second most prolific military rifle—over 50 years of combat-proven design!

ds-arms-stg58-austrian-fal
One of the more unique characteristics of many FAL-pattern rifles is a folding carry handle located on the forward portion of the upper receiver.

The FAL features a fully adjustable piston-driven gas system with a regulator sleeve. The gas system’s piston and spring are captured by a gas plug located in the forward face of the front sight assembly. Gas bled through a small port in the bore drives the piston rearward to cycle the action and the size of this port can be manually adjusted by turning the numbered gas regulator sleeve, located just forward of the handguard and just behind the front sight assembly. The sleeve can be adjusted with the use of a specially designed spanner wrench or the tip of a bullet.

Rather than a two- or three-position regulator, the FAL’s system features seven numbered marks with a total of 14 points of adjustment points, allowing users to adjust the gas system to permit just enough gas to cycle the action while minimizing fouling and unnecessary wear on the rifle.

In addition to the highly adjustable gas system, the FAL also features a somewhat unconventional locking system. Rather than employing a more traditional rotating bolt, the FAL features a tilting-block locking system where the rear face of the bolt body locks into recesses machined into the stressed-steel receiver just to rear of the magazine well.

Controls of the FAL are simple and instinctive with a non-reciprocating charging knob located on the left side of the upper receiver and a rotating safety lever located above the pistol grip. The safety has two positions: an “S” position for “safe” and an “E” position for “fire.” A paddle-style magazine release is located just behind the magazine well and forward of the triggerguard. A bolt release button is located just to the left of the magazine release lever.

Although the Austrian StG 58 was an FAL-pattern rifle, it did have some distinct differences from the Belgian original. One of the most prominent differences between them is the rifle’s muzzle device. Major Stoll, the head of the Austrian purchasing commission, designed the device itself. This unique design is a multi-purpose flash suppressor that can also be used for grenade launching and barbed-wire cutting. Threaded internally for a short length, the combination unit is designed to fit over the barbed wire and then twisted to capture it. When a shot is fired, the barbed wire is cut.

Other changes to the Austrian FAL from the original Belgian pattern included a straighter comb on the buttstock, a redesigned quick-release gas plug and a shorter gas tube soldered in place. In the general configuration of the rifle, the Austrians took some cues from the German G1 FAL variant, specifically through the StG 58’s use of steel handguards and a folding bipod."

It also includes BCG with charging handle, the bolt is matched to the barrel by compass lake. Barrel is marked CLE 1-8 4-00. I am the second owner of this upper the original owner stated that it has less than 100 rounds through it. I have not fired it. I came into possession of this as part of a trade. The rail shows minor signs of having a scope mounted and the hand guard has been slotted by a dremel in order to remove the screws, when the heads become stripped. The handguard is mounted up nice and tight. But I imagine most people would replace the handguard for a railed one. The price reflects these blemishes, which in no way effect the accuracy of this upper. A new one of these would cost you about $1200. I am selling this one for $825 face to face or $875 shipped, in light of the condition of the handguard. USPS MO or very discreet PP plus fees. As far as trades go I will expect you to ship first if you are not local.

Barrel finish is about 85-90%, receiver finish has the brownish patina typical of these pre 64s.  No rust inside or out on this rifle.  The wood is original and has marks of use; no cracks, chips or major dings. This rifle needs nothing.  It is still a great looking and even better shooter. She is ready for the hunt or range.
