I bought it for my wife as a carrier and she carried it and loved it, all the way up until I got one of the first Solo's around. Now she has my Solo and I am looking for another 9mm carrier. The 360 is in great shape with a very low round count, it does have a couple of holster marks from being carried. The Crimson Trace grips work great and are dead on. I have the original grips, a nice leather ankle holster, box, and docs. Please Email all offers to REDACTED and numbers can be exchanged, Thanks."

This pistol has been sent to Springfield for the safety recall and returned to me.  See the pictures below and you will notice the roll pin on the grip safety that signifies the firearm has been fixed.  I test fired it after receiving it back from Springfield to verify functionality and then cleaned it.  Firearm will come with the case and all XD gear it originally came with, two 5 round mags and a 7 round mag.

While this was off being fixed, I grabbed a G36 to carry while it was gone, figuring I'd sell the G36 once this was returned.  It turns out that I like the G36 more, so I'm selling this one instead.  Will sell pistol only for $550, but also have an assortment of RIGHT handed holsters that are up for sale as well if the buyer wants one or all of them.  They are pictured below.  First up is the N82 Tactical Professional holster (pictured right), which is $70 brand new, will throw it in for $45.  Second up is the Hidden Hybrid IWB holster (pictured bottom left), which sells new for $60, will throw it in for $40.  Last up is the Glocktech MIC holster (pictured top left), which sells new for $20, will throw it in for $10.  Anyone who carries knows that you usually end up with a whole bunch of holsters before you find one you really like.  Personally, the N82 Tactical turned out to be what I prefer, as it is the most comfortable IWB holster I have owned.  The MIC holster also came in very handy for those times I didn't want to mess with a holster and simply wanted to place the gun in a pocket.  I found the Hidden Hybrid to conceal the best, but it wasn't as comfortable to me and so I rarely used it.  Just not my cup of tea, though plenty of people seem to prefer them.

I don't know enough about Enfield Jungle Carbines to say this is for sure a Gibbs Quest Extreme Rifle. When I bought this I purchased it as a Gibbs rifle, after doing some research I can't guarantee it to be true. So I'm selling this as a Jungle Carbine. 
If this isn't a real Gibbs then someone went to a lot of trouble to try to duplicate this rifle. It has the right stock on it all the way to the brass butt plate with the survival kit that contains: compass, waterproof matches, fishing line, hooks. Nickel electrolysis coating, muzzle break, .303 British caliber.  
What I do know is that it has never been shot since it was remanufactured. The bore is crystal clean. 
Here is what I found out on the Gibbs website and my gun matches this description to a ""T""
An updated design based on the battle proven No. 5 Enfield Jungle Carbine, the Quest Extreme Carbine™ is a modern version of this popular rugged carbine. Each Quest is electroless nickel finished and mated to a durable, modern machined hardwood stock. The unique compensator/flash hider reduces muzzle jump and flash and provides solid front sight protection. The nearly indestructible solid brass butt trap houses a no-nonsense survival kit with Brunton® liquid filled compass, waterproof matches with striker, firestarter, snare wire, twine and fishing hooks. The Quest Extreme Carbine’s™ lightweight design makes it ideal for trail, camp, cabin or hunting vehicle. It’s the one gun you’ll reach for wherever extreme conditions call for a rugged, dependable carbine. Weight - 7-3/4 lbs., Bbl Length - 20”, OAL - 40”, Cal - .303 British.

As I've moved to black guns, this has simply sat in the back corner of the vault. I've had it for many years and its served me well.

It's in great shape overall as it was manufactured in 1997, but not new / collector condition as its been out in the field a bunch of times. The stock is in great shape but has the one mark on the bottom side shown in one of the pics. Other than that, there are a few small dimples from being moved around.

It comes with a matching silver Bushnell Trophy 3-9x40 scope and a classic leather sling on swivels.

Its sighted in at 200 yards on factory over the counter ammo, but I'd still take it to Ben Avery, etc. to get acclimated before your first hunt.

As for price, these are pretty hard to find for comparisons, but gunbroker.com seems to be the norm for values. There is an exact version without a scope for $625 + $30 S/H + $20 or so for the FFL transfer = $675.

Here is that current auction: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=374237325

Someone sent me texts from a MI number, and someone else called me continuously from a FL number.  The person I talked to over the phone clearly had a non-USA accent, and claimed that he had moved to Minnesota, but that he was calling me from his land-line (a FL landline in MN?).  The person who texted me from the MI number refused to take the rifle to a gun shop so that I could verify the condition.  They also wanted payment through PayPal (PayPal does not allow transaction for firearms, and if you do, they will not offer any buyer's guarantee).  The person texting me also gave me specs of the Leupold scope, stating that the model number is ""70 2-pc"" which is obviously not a correct model.  They also listed the rifle on Armslist as a semi-auto.

RARE Winchester Model 70 Featherweight Rifle 6.5 x 55. Winchester Model 70 Featherweight Rifle in the incredibly RARE 6.5 x 55 Caliber. It features a 22"" barrel, hinged floor plate, magazine holds 4-Rounds plus 1 in chamber, 3-position safety. It has a deep dark gloss blued finish on barrel, receiver and floorplate. This is one of the VERY RARE Winchester Model 70 FeatherWeight Rifles in the 6.5x55 Caliber! Features the Winchester red recoil pad. Made out of a gorgeous piece of walnut, the stock checkering with the graceful uncheckered ribbon in the pattern will make any rifle-lover stop to admire it. The barrel reads: Winchester Model 70 Featherweight 6.5 x 55 mm, Made in New Haven Conn. USA. The 6.5×55mm is a rimless bottlenecked rifle cartridge. The 6.5x55 is one of the great worldwide hunting cartridges. It offers excellent killing power, adequately flat trajectory, and moderate recoil. It is used for harvesting game including reindeer and moose deer and other medium-sized game. Sportsmen who favor the round load the combination of low recoil coupled with the cartridge's inherent accuracy and superb penetrative qualities. Because 6.5 mm (.264"") bullets have relatively high ballistic coefficients, the 6.5×55mm has seen huge successes in long range target matches of 328 yd – 1,094 yd. It is rare thing these days when a product actually lives up to the hype of its advertising, but the Winchester Model 70, ""The Rifleman's Rifle,"" has matched and perhaps surpassed the claims made for this fine arm. For more than half a century they have been called ""The Rifleman's Rifle"" because of its demonstrated performance, accuracy and dependability. The legendary handling and quickness of the Model 70 Featherweight is justly famous among hunters everywhere. This rifle is in beautiful condition with virtually no signs of handling or use. It comes complete with the scope bases and rings already mounted on it. The 6.5 x 55 is truly a versatile cartridge with the added benefit of being an incredibly RARE caliber in the VERY collectible Winchester Model 70 Featherweight. A real gem for the collector or the shooter in an awesome and RARE caliber, they don't come around like this often! A beautiful and rare addition to someone's gun collection."

562,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2293562,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD FREE 45-70 MAG. +P 350 GR. TSX-FN (2150 FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX﻿﻿,"azusa, California, United States",$ 60,"Listed On: Sunday, November 3, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=307

This is a super powerful 45-70 +P (or magnum) loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 350gr. TSX-FN long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as the typical premium 400gr. + lead core partition expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and has flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 1,900+ fps is very fast and is very powerful and for those who like the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX-FN bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit for many, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1,931 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22-inch barrel
1,914 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18-inch barrel

Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

It is all black. It comes with tritium night sights, ambidextrous safety/decocker, ambidextrous mag release, 3 15 round mags, case, and a kydex holster. Gun is in great shape I'd say about 98% condition. These guns are balanced and shoot great for a 45. I'm getting out of the 45acp cartridge which is the only reason I would ever consider selling this weapon. Selling the package for $850 or will consider trades. Will not trade for anything 40cal, black powder, or bows. This same gun with all its features sells new at Gander Mountain for $799+tax and background check. Mags cost $65 a piece. The Kydex holster runs around $100 bucks. I'd say $850 is very reasonable. Can text pics to serious buyers only."

I have a used .22lr MP5  that i am looking to sell or trade for the right items.  The gun is incredibly  reliable having never had a single jam misfire stovepipe etc.  Not once.  It does require high velocity ammo (at least that is what it is marked for).  I have read it will run standard fine but never really tried.  There is an adjustment  screw inside that is for fine tuning  different velocities.  I never touched it though.  I am selling because i recently finished another build of mine and want a .22 conversion for that.  No more room for this even though i love it.  I am somewhat open to trades for maybe a Glock 19 or 17.  Or a .22 cal AR15 conversion kit that is piston system compatible with mags.

However, if you have any questions please feel free to email me.

This model 870 is compact. Perfect for smaller women and young children because of the shorter length of pull and barrel.

This rifle is super tight when sighted in at 100 yards, and with 75-77 grain quality ammo, I've hit 10"" steels out to 500 yards (and I'm no marksman).
