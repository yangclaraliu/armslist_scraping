I am the original owner.  I've had it a little under two years.  I would estimate the round count at around 300 with no failures to fire or failures to eject.  I really like it, but I  bought it with the intent of using it for every day carry.  That didn't work out for me though because I couldn't find a way to carry it comfortably.  

It is a nice pistol.  This model has a thumb safety but does not have the magazine disconnect.  It comes with the original case, manual, three back backstraps (s/m/l), and two magazines.  Both magazines are 12 rounders and have the pinky extension on them.  I also have one flat magazine floorplate that is included.  I'll also include a Xgrip magazine adapter (the pistol is shown with the Xgrip installed in a full size M&P mag, but the full size mag is not included in the sale/trade).  

Ideally, I'd like to trade for one of the items below, but would sell it for $400 or best offer.  

Please email with an questions.  I live in Louisburg and work in Overland Park.  I also work up north of KCK a couple times a week, so I'm flexible on a meet up place for a trade.  I'm willing to drive a little for a good trade or sale, but I'd probably not going to go any further than 90 minutes from Louisburg."

Ruger 357 that also fires 38 Special ammo (its cheaper) in great shape.

This is historic old ... I got it from an very old man who was selling out a lifetime of great guns.  He'd had it since the 1970's, he said, and he got it used then.   

The holster is great and you can easily slide a belt through it.  It is heavy leather and fits this length of pistol barrel perfectly.  It was clearly made for this exact gun.

The gun is old so the bluing does show holster wear, but it looks and functions great.

If you want the SN to see exactly how old it is, or if you want to see it to judge for yourself ... fine ... email me.

Prefer FTF with cash, ID, and paperwork.   I can ship via my FFL for $30 to the lower 48 after payment clears.

Only trades I might consider are for Sig Sauer iron.

I am including one C-Products mag, these seem to be the best mags for the AR 7.62x39 round, never any issues when using these mags.  This upper will eat any ammo, Russian steel case or whatever, so it is affordable and reliable to shoot.  The receiver looks great, the rail has some marks here and there from use.  Other features included on the upper are, Daniel Defense sights ($140), Troy Claymore muzzle brake ($64), and the handstop($50), might be KAC, but can't remember.  The hand stop is not a pistol grip.  This upper would cost around $850+ to get the same set-up.

If you are considering a SBR or pistol AR-15, this is the caliber to do it in because this round looses much less velocity and energy compared to the .223 /5.56 round in the shorter barrels.  You can check online, but if I recall a 7.62x39 with 7.5"" barrel is still moving right around 2,000 fps vs. 2,400 fps out of a 16"" barrel, which is only a 20% or so loss.  I believe the 223/556 round loses around 1/3 of the velocity.  NFA rules apply, you can use as a pistol or SBR if you do the tax stamp first.  Sig does make the stabilizer than looks just like a butt stock and is perfectly legal.

$720 cash firm or $640 without the sights.  Might look at really good trade offers. Will ship for $20 more.

On trades, I have everything I need, but of course like anyone there are still a few ""wants"" I would like to have, I like a bit of everything.  Just let me know exactly what you have and what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, silver, etc. and we'll go from there.

STI, based in Texas, is well respected maker among 1911 enthusiasts.  

I purchased this new in 2012 and have fired approx. 150 round.  This pistol has always performed 100% for me; it has never failed to feed, eject, or fire.  In addition, it is a highly accurate firearm; I am attaching an example of a target I personally shot with this pistol (5 shot group, standing unsupported, from 10 yards using inexpensive full metal jacket ammo).  Frankly, it is the most accurate 9mm I own (and that's saying a lot).  This 1911 has a fully adjustable target rear sight, a fiber optic front sight, STI hardwood grips, and many premium extras as follows:

- Cylinder & Slide Short Solid Trigger (fitted specifically to this pistol)
- Evolution Gun Works (EGW) Steel Flat Checkered Mainspring Housing
- Wolf 17 lb. Hammer Spring
- Wilson Combat Stainless Checkered Front Strap (new in package; never used)
- Wilson Combat Hex Head Stainless Screws


As you can see, I have replaced some factory parts with high quality, premium aftermarket parts!  This was done out of personal preference; there was nothing wrong with the factory parts.  You will still get the factory trigger, factory mainspring housing, and factory hammer spring (and I can reinstall these in the pistol if you would like prior to sale).  This gun comes with an 8 round stainless steel Metalform 9mm 1911 magazine.  I am also including the factory case and all factory papers (even includes factory case padlock, bushing wrench, manual, and test fire cases).  The pistol has removable grip tape applied to the front strap of the grip.  I can leave this on or take it off; your choice.  The metal is fine underneath; I simply put this on to make the front strap a little ""grippier"".  

I am selling this not because there is anything wrong with this pistol, but honestly need to free up some cash for other projects.  

ADDED NOTE:  I will take $15 off the price if you do not want the EGW mainspring housing.  If you choose this option, I will reinstall the factory mainspring housing and spring just like it came when new in box.

Terms of sale:
- Face to face transaction in Peoria or Bloomington preferred, but will ship to your FFL for $35 shipping fee.
- IL buyers must be at least 21 years of age and possess a valid IL FOID.
- Cash accepted for payment; USPS money orders accepted if item is shipped.

These are made of steel and are very sturdy. The ears on each side that protect the front post and rear aperture are very strong. I cannot remember the brand name but I think they might have been Maytech? They are a matching set of nice quality sights that I bought new and have never used. Standard height front sight post, adjustable for elevation, and dioptic rear with the pivoting aperture that has the tiny hole on one side and the larger hole on the other for either long or short range depending. Rear is adjustable for windage and had a large easy to use knob, so no tools required to adjust. There are scale mark on it to show center and left/right adjustments. Nice positive clicks and detents when adjusting, and flipping up and down. Most sights with all these features cost twice this, and I can't remember exactly what I paid but I want to say it was about $45 each because the set with tax was nearly $100. They mount on any standard Weaver or Picatinny type rail, so they will work on anything at all that has a rail like that. The first $70 gets this deal, cheaper than a decent set of plastic flip up sights and these are metal. If interested and serious include a phone number in your reply. Only replies that include a phone number will be responded to, thanks."

""Other lessons involve proper techniques for using cameras in conjunction with night-vision gear. Simple but potentially serious errors include failing to turn off the camera’s autofocus-assist lamp, which can overwhelm night-vision users with brightness and reveal the unit’s position to the enemy. Cameras with night-vision lenses lack AF systems—they focus manually. And setting exposure for night-vision cameras can be tricky.""Tactical Solutions' Nightstalker II night vision lens attached to a Nikon D700.

Extreme

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three white LEDs, two infrared LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the infrared secondary LEDs are for use with night vision devices (NVDs) and provide an invisible light signature when viewed by the naked eye. Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body in Desert Tan. Attaches to any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) via an included ambidextrous mount with 20 preset positions that allow the light to be rotated 360 degrees when attached. Once either mount has been attached to the helmet, Helmet Light can be quickly and easily slid on and locked securely in place. Pressing a lever on the mount unlocks the light, allowing for quick removal for servicing or transfer onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest.

 Glock 17 RTF2 (Rough Textured Frame 2)
 The G17 RTF2 is the second pistol that GLOCK, Inc. has released with the new rough textured frame and slide serration pattern. The newly designed frame incorporates more than 4,000 raised pyramids on the front, rear and sides of the polymer receiver and has a newly designed crescent shaped serration pattern located at the rear of the slide.

This Glock features factory night sights, factory extended slide release, a Crimson Trace LG 416 Laser Grip, Talon Rubber Grips, a custom factory quad-ported barrel and slide (two ports on each side), a 22 pound stainless steel guide rod and spring along with the standard factory guide rod and spring, an extended ZEV Aluminum Magwell for ease of loading, 5 Glock Magazines (15 rounds each), an optional Sentra Base Plug (when not using the ZEV magwell) and finally, a Blackhawk Italian Leather Holster (Black) that fits the pistol perfectly.

This Glock was a Distributor Exclusive, purchased new from NW Armory for more than I care to say, has never been shot, just brought it home and put it in my safe.  This is about as good as a Glock can get in .10mm Auto, the gun looks awesome and definitely intimidating with the ports and all.

I can send pictures if anyone is interested, just thought I'd see if there was any interest in the first place before pulling her out of the safe and snapping photos.

I sell here also, and have bought here.  I try to price my items reasonable even ammo which is hard to get.  For instance I have 5 boxes of 380 ammo for $100.  That's just about what it cost when you could find it and before the shortage.  I understand some premium on maye 22LR or MAG but ALL other ammo can be found with some searching the net and at reasonable prices

Firearms are a whole different issue.  Some of these prices are CRAZY.  I mean I see people selling Glocks for $600.  Nothing extra, nothing special.  Just a Glock.  I can walk into any gun shop and buy any model (well maybe not the 42) for $550 or less and people want more then that for a used gun.  Oh, its been shot only 100 rounds.  Um, its still USED!!!  The Glock is used just to make a point, most listings for any gun are the same.  I agree some firearms go up in value, like maybe a limited run of something or a gun that you cant go and buy off the shelf but otherwise, its like a used car.  Worth less then new.  

If some of you people want to sell your items you have to be reasonable or else your wasting your time or most likely will only attract felons who will pay those crazy prices just to be able to have a gun, which is a whole different topic.  Anyways, just had to throw that out there after reading todays listings.

The Larue Tactical mount allows the user to remove the optic from the rifle and reattach the optic with the LaRue Tactical Return to Zero guarantee.  This optic is in immaculate condition and is only a few months old.  It was rarely installed on my rifle and primarily sat in a safe.  With the Larue mount you only zero in the rifle once and you then have the ability to constantly remove and reattach the optic to the rifle with a guaranteed return to zero.  The ballistic crosshair allows the user to engage targets at extended ranges without calculating for bullet drop.  This is a 3.5x optic with extremely flexible eye relief compared to the 4x models which have extremely limited eye relief.  Contact with questions.

It is a lemon in poor condition. I took it to the range ONE TIME for 60 rounds.

I have about 10 pictures I will email you upon request.

This mosin is in fair to poor condition with issues listed below
-Cracked stock
-Exposed bare wood/no enamel/no shellac on various areas of the stock.
-Worn bolt
-POTENTIAL trigger sear replacement needed
-POTENTIAL headspace disparity

With these issues, there is a much increased risk of catastrophic failure with this. This gun, with the above issues, is not in a safe firing condition and is not being marketed/sold as such, until the buyer can, whether by themselves, or another qualified person, have this inspected and repaired.

Why you would want this? Maybe as a cheap fix-me-up for knowledgeable and qualified gunsmiths, to part out, or to hang on a wall somewhere. The rifling is awesome and the barrel is generally great, with exception of a potential trigger sear issuse.

As a plus, this was from 1938, and all serial numbers match: Butt plate, bolt, barrel, magazine. All cosmoline is off.

5 stripper clips
2 ammo pouches

It Has the Octagon Barrel with Brass Site and has very intricate etchings surrounding the cylinder.  It is brand new and has only been out of the box long enough for these pictures to be taken. Barely handled and certainly never fired. It is beautiful.  Since posting this ad, I have learned that there are also several conversion kits available (kit including cylinder and firing pin) that allow this to be easily changed over to fire regular cartridge ammunition. With the cylinder and pin changed, it would function just as a regular revolver. 
The 1851 Colt Navy is indeed iconic and symbolizes the Civil War and Wild West like no other handgun; it was used by such notables as Wild Bill Hickok, Buffalo Bill Cody and Calamity Jane, the Colt Navy also served on both sides of the Civil War. 
2 days after my father ordered this, he changed his mind and decided he wanted a blackpowder Carbine rifle. The revolver had shipped already and it was too late to cancel the order.  $228.00 takes it.
It comes in original box with all original paperwork. The paperwork gives all details regarding what materials to use, how to load and how to clean and maintain."

 The Lee-Enfield is a Mk 3, also a very good shooter took it out just yesterday and shot a 3 inch 5 shot group at 100 yds. There is a slight crack in the stock that does not effect function and for that I am keeping the price low. I have about 100 rounds of Winchester .303 to go with the rifle. My dad is an Enfeld fanatic and says that while he can not identify all the markings, this rifle has been around and has definitely seen some action, but the bore/rifling are still good and the wood is still nice. The ammo alone is worth about $100. $300 for rifle with all ammo. 
 I have a marlin semi-auto Model 60 with 14 rd tube mag. Comes with scope and has stainless barrel. Used it or rabbit hunting. Comes with about 20 rnds of .22 Very accurate. $150.
