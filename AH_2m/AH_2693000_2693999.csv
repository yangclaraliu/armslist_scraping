This is an 8mm variant of the gewehr 88. It is my understanding that this particular rifle was used in the boxer rebellion... It is all original with lots of character, even has matching numbers... Very hard to find for a Chinese rifle. This rifle has only been wiped down, not cleaned so it retains all of its natural patina. It also comes with a bayonet and scabbard.

I am more interested in shooters I can have fun with, and I cannot bring myself to shoot this rifle as I'm afraid to damage a significant piece of history. I'm open to cash offers, but I'm more interested in trades. I would really like to trade for a night vision scope or goggles, or other firearms, but let me know what you have."

The Ruger LCP .380 ACP was originally announced by Strum, Ruger at the 2008 SHOT Show, and it has now captivated the .380 ACP scene. ""The development and introduction of the Ruger LCP is in direct response to customer demand,"" said Ruger President, Stephen L. Sanetti. ""We have not been part of this market, but the growing number of states authorizing the licensed carry of pistols for personal protection by law-abiding citizens, and continued demand by law enforcement for quality back-up guns, cannot be ignored. The Ruger LCP is a .380 Auto pistol with superior ergonomic design and handsome styling. It incorporates state-of-the-art polymers, aircraft quality aluminum alloys and high-grade precision steel components engineered for strength and maximum weight savings.""
This shape and size of the Ruger LCP is similar to a Kel-Tec 380, but unlike Kel Tec P3AT380s, the LCP offers legendary Ruger reliability and quality craftsmanship. The Ruger LCP is comfortable and affordable, making it a natural choice for a dependable back-up or personal defense carry pistol."

Over the years I’ve been known to buy guns in quantity and so I have a bunch of NIB that I never re-sold or gifted.  I think the below prices are fair and reasonable, and I have absolutely zero need to sell, I just think that someone else could give these a good home.  Here’s the first 10 I’m listing.

Beretta Nano 9mm NIB $400
Para Ordnance LDA Carry 9 NIB $950

FN 57, Blackhawk holster, 200+ rounds of ammo, 1 mag extension $1500

Bushmaster AR-15 A3 style - basically and A2, but the carry handle removes so it can be a flat top. Honestly here, I never liked this gun, shot it once and probably have less than 5mags/150 rounds down the pipe. I kept it around for awhile because it will accept my DIAS, but I’ve never shot it FA and simply get pissed every time I take it out of the safe and maintain it.   It’s not a bad gun and it was accurate, I just didn’t care for it in comparison to my other ARs. Make me an offer, if you are trolling and throw out a real low ball, you will promptly be ignored.  I have unopened in the bag PMAGS (no windows) that I will toss 5 in too for the right price.

Weatherby actions are not cheap to build on (well over 1k in a build including stock rifle) an this one is silky smooth. The ONLY reason I am considering a swap is because I already have 3 of them. It makes a really compact hunting rifle with some serious dropping power. Anyway, here are the details:

It has about 200 rounds through it, no issues whatsoever. I have shot 115gr, which functions flawlessly even though Kimber recommends heavier ammo, 124gr, 147gr, including various hollow points (primarily Speer Gold Dots and Remingston Golden Sabers). Some people have reported problems with the Solo, but this one has been great. Maybe because it's recent production?

I have an extra magazine for the gun and a DeSantis Super Fly pocket holster, as well as some ammo.

Taking a $424.67 loss at my cash price of $900.  I am not willing to lose more money than that on it sorry.  Crimson Trace Lasergrips are the best handgun lasers you can get and it has the receipt still so you can get your free lifetime batteries.  CMC magazines are among the best available for a 1911.  Everything in the pictures is included.  Text preferred at REDACTED but can also call and leave message or email.  I am a military vet and have an Oklahoma handgun license and will ensure a safe, public meeting for both parties.

If you are reading this it is still for sale.  Will remove when sold.  If you have guns to trade that are worth more then 900 but no cash I would consider them.  I also have a Mossberg 500A 24 inch slugster 12 gauge for sale that I never use.  It's listed on armslist also.  I will sell the gun with it's original mags and grips separate for $500 and all the cmc mags, lasergrips, and ammo for $400 but will not break apart further then that."

Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

I have only one Multicam Front/Back/Side Carrier manufactured by
""Tactical Tailor"" for sale the complete set plate carrier including the plates would be $400

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

It also has Ameriglo suppressor height night sights that co witness with the red dot. The frame of the gun has been stippled as well as the bottom side of the trigger guard and the trigger guard has been double undercut to get a real nice grip on the gun. It also has a polished trigger and ghost kit installed giving it a real nice crisp feel to it.

I have only put about three hundred rounds through it and it functions flawlessly. I have no problem hitting steel plates at 50 plus yards with this set up. 

 I would like to trade this gun for a Springfield MC Operator or TRP Operator 1911. I have just over 1500 invested into the gun so if you make a cash offer make it reasonable.

For the closest in concealment, the Inside-The-Waistband (IWB) leather holster gives you the deep concealment of inside the pants with a high inner body to protect your shirt or skin from the sharp edges and also to keep the finish of your pistol protected from moisture. Molded on the inside for extra retention, the top of the holster is also reinforced to allow one handed re-holstering. Inside the waistband (IWB) holsters provide the most comfortable and effective concealed carry method for most people. All parts of the holster and pistol that ride below the top of the pants (or skirt) are hidden, making it less likely that the covering garment will be pulled up and expose the holster. The shirt guard is to keep leather between the slide and your body, and to increase comfort and prevent your shirt from blocking the gun holster. The pants and belt hold the pistol close to the body for a flatter profile. This holster is made to fit belts up to 2"" wide and attaches by a metal spring clip.

Aiding in accuracy is the Samson Evolution hand guard, which is free floating and modular, allowing the attachment of rail sections or sling mounts along the hand guard. This also grants the shooter the ability to mount accessories as needed but not be burdened with a full quad rail. The trigger is a Geissele Super 3-Gun trigger, which was specifically developed for 3-Gun competitions, as the name implies. It possesses a great reputation for durability and has what Geissele calls a hybrid pull.

This rifle is a balanced blending of Sako-style performance, tasteful innovation and Italian design. It features a controlled-round feeding all-stainless action, match-grade free-floating hammer-forged barrel, adjustable trigger and detachable magazine with Total Control technology. The synthetic stock incorporates warm-feeling, nonslip rubber inserts. The FinSoft recoil-absorption system dramatically reduces felt recoil, especially in the shooter’s cheek. Aesthetically, the Sako 85 Stainless Synthetic is another fruit of worldclass Giugiaro designers, organically combining the lines of the stock with those of the barreled action."
