The panzerschreck itself has been repainted Normandy scheme, the original paint was painted over by the finish during the post war years, the finish painted it light grey and marked it with SA, when I received it the paint was flaking badly so I stripped it and painted it Normandy scheme. I know the paint job isn't the best but it was better to give it a couple coats rather then let it rust. The body and mechanical parts are in great condition besides the hole that was cut into the side as show below in order to demilitarize it.

Restrictions apply for some areas, so please read this ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE Magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Here is Tapco’s recent contribution to aftermarket accessories for the recently imported Zastava Yugoslavian 59/66 Rifles, SKS type; and these also work in the Norinco China and Russian rifles that came in 20 years ago and that are still viable and frequently traded. This is a superior product to the only thing we could get 20 years ago, the old USA brand conversions, despite the fact that the USA’s were steel and these are high impact polymer. By definition, this is a conversion, not just a magazine. A 59/66 or SKS owner will need to remove the rifle’s 10 shot magazine completely, then reassemble it with no magazine in order to install this conversion. Manufacturer is Tapco, in the distinguished city of Kennesaw, Georgia. Construction is High Impact Polymer, made by Tapco’s unique Intrafuse ® process. Cartridge follower is of identical material, very thickly made with no-tilt rooftop contour. Forward strut section is 8 port vented for lightness and durability. Spring and floorplate are steel, with military parkerized floorplate. Note that the magazine body has serrated construction for strength, and it is curved for trouble free cartridge feeding.

Rifle comes with 11 mags.  Three 42 round mags and eight 30 round mags.  Not willing to separate the gun from the magazines, so make sure you include their value in any trade.  I can include the optic as well but if you don't want it no big deal.  It is a PA fixed 3x CQB style scope for $150 on top of the mags and rifle.

Looking to trade not sell outright, I can do trades plus cash.  Guns I am interested in.  20 ga over/unders or side by sides, brands like Beretta, Browning, Caesar Guerini, and Fox.  Winchester Feather weight in 300 Win mag or 338.  Will consider other hunting bolt action rifles in 300 Win mag or 338.  C93's, 20"" A2 or A4 AR 15 rifles.  AK's in 7.62x39, Arsenal or kit builds with original import barrels.  No Yugo Ak's please.  Sig 226's or 229's (no DAK please).  FAL's.  Nor C&R rifles please.

This gun has been a safe queen.  I am in no rush to get rid of this gun, if the right trade doesn't come along I have no issue keeping it forever.  If you make a trade offer make sure and include what you think your gun(s) are worth plus any cash you plan on adding to the deal or what cash you expect in the deal (if applicable).  If you expect full retail for your gun, I will expect retail for mine.

I have two boxes of Federal 550 that I would like to trade for six boxes of CCI Mini-Mags. I paid a total of $48+Tax ($24/box/550) and if I were to find MM's at my place, I would be paying $48+tax ($8/box/100), so it is a fair deal price-wise.  If you don't care what you are plinking with, you are getting round-for-round PLUS 500 rounds.  I care and I like MM's.  I work mornings and can meet near Belmont area or Kings Mtn after 2pm."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are some never fired, never used California compliant factory Beretta magazines for the .40 caliber Beretta Model 96 pistols; and also for Kel Tec and Beretta long guns that use the same magazines. These were all pulled out of new firearms cartons in 2004, at the expiry of a certain Federal Statute. None of them have been loaded or fired, their only markings will be negligible frame contact evidence, or no contact at all. All of them are Factory Beretta, made in Italy and so marked. They are all steel construction 10 round magazines, not capable of modification. Each magazine holds ten rounds of .40 S&W caliber ammunition. Replacement pricing  on these in our area, when a person can even find any, are upwards of $60 apiece. Our Single Mag price is $35 per. We're offering them, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 each. Own 3	for only	$ 78.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

As the name implies, this Extreme Extruded propellant was developed for precision cartridges. As such, it is ideally suited for benchrest and small varmint cartridges like the 6mm PPC, 22 PPC, 6mm BR, 223 Rem. and 222 Rem.

Eddie Bauer Expedition, clean title in hand. 1998, The truck was on the road as a daily driver until this past December. Rides very smooth. 5.4L Trition V8 330HP Motor from a 2003 ford F250 professionally installed in 2009. Has 200K on truck but doesnt look like it. IM the 3rd owner of the truck, previous owner lives 2 miles away, first owner was his father. Has all options, 6 disc CD with premium bose stereo and factory subwoofer, all leather, all power, everything works. Sunroof needs a $17 part. Has some bondo on the floors but body is in great shape. Frame looks ok, shocks and springs look ok, brake lines fine, brake pads and rotors fine, has Michilin tires on 17"" rims, turn signal power mirrors, new windshield, new exhaust maifolds and gaskets, 3 new coils. New wheel bearings, 2 new fuel injectors, 

IT DOES NEED 2 coil packs installed. I have them but havent put them in. Its missfiring on cylinders number 1 and 3 from junk coil packs, and reading an upstream right side lean code from the 2 cylinders that arent firing. Could also use one new control arm bushing on the right front upper but not needed to pass inspection. Truck was inspected last year but since then we got a car thats better on gas. So I dont need the Expedition anymore. Book value ACCORDING TO MY INSURANCE COMAPNY is $2870, will take anything really over $2000 or best trade.

Features

Taurus Security System (TSS)s:
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Loaded Chamber Indicator:
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

This pistol fires good and packs quite a punch. I've never shot anything through it except wad and ball with pyrodex powder. I use .454 diameter lead balls on a pre-lubed felt wad and topped the chamber with Bore Butter or a tallow-beeswax mix on the ball to prevent fowling in the barrel from burnt powder. The most I put through in a single session was 30 rounds without any malfunctions. That's a lot for a black powder pistol in one sitting! It reloads quickly with the spare cylinder. 
This replica pistol is patterned after the original made with a brass frame to conserve the Southern Confederacy’s limited supplies of steel. Although designated as a Navy pistol, it saw heavy use among Army officers who favored the .44-caliber's  heavy firepower. It features a blued octagonal barrel, plain blued cylinder, tough, attractive walnut grips, and a brass trigger guard. 
I am including everything in the picture: holster, spare cylinder, spare cylinder pouch, nipple wrench, and the rugged black vinyl pistol transport case with plush interior. I've also got the original user's manual that I received with the pistol when I first bought it 10 years ago. It contains detailed loading instructions to prevent any mishaps, and cleaning instructions for maintaining the pistol itself."

Altogether the retail value for this is $1743, and that would NOT include mounting the scope mount, scope and sling adapter, or for zeroing-in the rifle.

You may ask, why is this rifle being sold? The reason is because I ordered a Tavor at the same time and believed it could be over a year until I received it. Amazingly, I received it only a few days after zeroing-in the MP 15. Therefore, for financial reasons, I am compelled to sell this MP 15. I AM WILLING TO BREAK-APART THIS PACKAGE--just contact me for the pricing (but the rifle MUST be INCLUDED in the sale).

If you are out-of-state, I will ship this to the FFL of your choice for $29.

If you possess a current Arizona CCW, I will not have to perform an instant background check upon you. If you do not have one, the background check requires 3 to 4 minutes. If you are an Arizona resident, I am compelled to collect the states 5.6% sales tax from you.

This 4.5lb 2-stage National Match trigger kit is for a stripped lower which does not already have a lower parts kit installed. This Rock River trigger kit with a 2 Stage NM trigger includes all pins, springs, and parts to assemble a stripped AR-15 lower receiver with the upgraded 2-stage RRA trigger. This product retails for $180-$200 (upgraded grips) from RRA.

This National Match two-stage trigger from RRA is an excellent trigger for your AR15 rifle. These are used frequently in Varmint and Long Range AR builds where a lighter 2-Stage trigger really helps accuracy and round placement. These triggers come pre-adjusted by Rock River gunsmiths as a matched pair and drop in all mil-spec lowers with no adjustment necessary for an easy drop-in install. Rock River 2-stage NM pins are .1555 in diameter and are not recommended or designed to be used with .154 pins or .170 Colt lower receivers. .1555 RRA Trigger pins will install in any standard milspec lower receiver without modification but may be noticeably more snug than the .154 pins upon install."

Colt 1911
serial number dates to 1918
This pistol has been professionally refinished and looks excellent. There doesn't look to be any pitting ever.
This 1911 was from a production run during WW1 when a huge number of pistols were made, so it is not unusual to see them refinished and made into shooters.
There have been a lot of improvements made to this one and it is obvious it was built for range duty.  
I was informed by the previous owner that this pistol was owned by a member of the U.S. Army shooting team, and was tricked out by a nationally known 1911 expert gunsmith who modifys  pistols for Camp Perry competitions.
As you can see, it has Bomar adjustable sights, trigger shoe, dimpled frontstrap & backstrap, and aftermarket grips.
Internally, I was told it has had a trigger job and other internal ""refinments"" to accurize  it and for reliability. 
I am almost certain it has an aftermarket barrel, I can't see any markings on it.
I have never disassembled this pistol or even fired it. It looks to be in perfect firing condition.

This is a beautiful gun. I've owned it for about a year and a half and it's always made me feel safe. I bought it because it's a premium top of the line handgun that some sects of the CIA, FBI and homeland security use. It's very accurate and comfortable to hold/shoot. It comes with the original box case, documents and 2 mags along with some hollow tips. I have a nice custom made crossbreed holster which ran me over $80. I also have a Miami vice galco shoulder holsters which cost over $120. I hate to sell this beauty but I lost $400 today and I'm flat broke. Looking to sell as soon as possible.
