16,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2028016,"For Sale:  Tactical Short Barrel Lower Recoil Low Flash 357 Magnum Ammo - 158 gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (1,100fps/M.E. 424 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 24,"Listed On: Thursday, August 22, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=105

Typical full power 357 magnum loads offer several tactical problems for use in self defense and duty applications, especially when used in the shorter/lighter revolvers that are typical of concealed, defensive and duty carry. First, the muzzle flash can be blinding, especially from short barrels. Second, felt recoil can be a life-threatening drawback if fast follow-up shots are required. Third, the level of report can be deafening and cause permanent hearing loss, especially if fired indoors.

All three Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel loads address the above problems and make the 357 magnum ideal for concealed, defensive and duty carry in smaller revolvers.

Muzzle flash:  These exciting new 357 magnum loads utilize a flash suppressed powder that will not blind you, should you need to drop the hammer in a low light situation. It is estimated that over 90% of all defensive civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light-that is when the criminal element is at work. Wouldn't it be horrible if you fired at an assailant, in the dark, to protect your family, only to find that you missed the bad guy and you are now blind due to your own muzzle flash? This is a scenario that has happened many times in the real world with the 357 magnum. Through the use of our non-canister, flash suppressed powder, the tactical problem of blinding muzzle flash is now greatly reduced with Buffalo Bore's new Tactical Short Barrel loads! 

Recoil:  Felt recoil is exacerbated by the use of shorter barreled, smaller framed, lighter weight 357 revolvers, typically used for concealed and duty carry. The new Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel 357 loads are not the normal full power ""barn burner"", 357 magnum loads we make and as such, felt recoil is substantially reduced, although they remain very powerful. Hence, deadly, and faster follow-up shots are more possible. 

Your ears:  Most folks don't think of the level of ""report"" as being a problem during a life threatening/defensive shooting and that may be correct for the actual moment of conflict. However, to lose some of your hearing for the rest of your life, following the shooting incident, is unnecessary and undesirable. Full power 357 magnum ammunition is deafening, even more so when fired from short barrels and even worse if you are required to shoot from an enclosed area such as a vehicle or indoors. Buffalo Bore's Tactical Short Barrel 357 magnum loads are not as hard on your hearing as full power ammunition. Although the use of hearing protection is still desirable, if possible, when using this ammo. 

For those who wish to carry a 357 magnum revolver for potential ""conflict resolution"", these new Buffalo Bore loads put an end to the ""tactical"" draw backs associated with our regular 357 magnum ammo. These loads are great for use in longer barreled firearms too.

Special Information Note: The below velocities were obtained from my personal, real world, factory stock, over the counter, (NOT TEST BARRELS) 357 magnum, revolvers. Also, note that the 6 inch Python, is considerably slower than the 4 inch S&W. This has nothing to do with barrel length. It is most likely a combination of differences in chamber/throat dimensions, barrel -cylinder gap, barrel internals, and forcing cone dimensions in the Python, versus the S&W. If the Python and the S&W had the same dimensions in their chamber/throats, barrel cylinder gap and forcing cone, the longer barreled Python would give much faster speeds. We have found that all of our Python test revolvers are much slower than our late model S&W revolvers of equal or even shorter barrel length.

We could have reduced the recoil, flash and blast even more by ""watering down"" these loads further than we did, but then you wouldn't have a real 357 magnum in your hands. So we looked for and found a balance between very powerful, fight stopping ammo that recoils and flashes much less than ours and some other makers, full power 357 loads. If we were to ""water down"" this ""Tactical Short Barrel"" 357 ammo any more, we would simply not manufacture it and suggest that you use our 38 SPL+P ammunition.

None of these loads caused crimp/bullet jump (in five shots) in my 12 OZ. Scandium S&W Model 340, but they did generate considerable felt recoil.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

I am selling a brand new, unfired Delton (DTI, Del-ton, Del ton) ar15 upper.  It is for 5.56 / .223 has a 16"" barrel that is light weight profile after the front sight block.  I just got it yesterday and after looking at it (my first midlength) decided I wanted the carbine instead.  I am just wanting to recover my costs (firm on the price).  Here is the description and picture from Midway:

This Del-Ton Lightweight Mid-Length A3 AR-15 Upper Receiver comes complete and fully assembled, ready for installation onto any mil-spec lower receiver. The forged 7075 T6 Aluminum upper features a 16"" Lightweight Contour Barrel, F-Marked Front Sight Assembly, 2-Piece Polymer Handguards with heat shield and an A2 Flash Hider. The barrel's 5.56x45mm NATO Chamber, M4 Feed Ramps and 1 in 9"" Twist rifling ensure reliable feeding and functioning with a wide variety of both commercial and higher pressure military surplus ammunition. The Mid Length Gas System offers the dual benefits of a longer sight radius and increased gas dwell time for a softer recoil impulse upon firing. 

The Bolt Carrier is machined from 8620 Steel for strength, incorporates a properly staked, chrome lined gas key, and houses a Carpenter 158 Steel Bolt that has been High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected (MPI) to guarantee a consistent, structurally sound part. This upper is an excellent choice for both the first time buyer and seasoned AR aficionado looking for a quality product at a good price.

The standard by which all contemporary sidearms are measured, The Sig Sauer
P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns
are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize
pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic
performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried
by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed
P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the
slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

Sig Sauer R516G216BPOD Sig516 Patrol AR-15 SA 223/5.56 16"" 30+1 Magpul MOE OD

One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves
ultimate refinement with the introduction of the SIG516 rifle. With its
chrome-lined, phosphated, military grade barrel and adjustable,
four-position gas regulator, the SIG516 incorporates all of the most
desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating quad rail
forend and barrel, and you have the most advanced, versatile AR-based rifle
available. The SIG516 Patrol comes with a Magpul MOE stock and MOE pistol
grip. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, it uses the SIG SAUER innovative
short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and
allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the SIG
SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of
the only rifles to pass NATO s  Over the Beach  test. A 16  chrome-lined
barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating
M1913 quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up
iron sights.

I have shot exactly 18 rounds thru this rifle to zero the scope when I mounted it, since then its been locked in a climate controlled safe. 
If your not familiar with the 300 blackout/whisper cartridge I will explain. Its a 30 caliber/ 308 style projectile with the same 223 casing. The advantages are more stopping power, use the same magazines as your 223 ar-15, uses the same lower as your AR15, same BCG everything, all you have to do is change the upper. So if you have another upper laying around you can use this lower on 223 as well. 

Included in this package are the following:

DSC 300 Blackout/Whisper upper with free floating chrome lined barrel.
PSA BCG Has the High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected stamp on it.
PSA Lower with Magpul FDE lower kit.
Daniel Defense quick detach slngle point sling mount

Leupold VX-R adjustable Illuminated Reticle 1.25-4 x 20mm. 
AR style flash hider.
Threaded barrel for suppressor, compensator, or different flash-hider.
4 boxes of Hornady V-Max ammo. 
Front pictanny rail for iron sights or flip up iron sights.

This is a bad ass 300 blackout/ whisper great for hunting, home defense, and target shooting. 
If you don't like the multicam padded form on the fore grip it will come off without sticky residue, it adheres to itself not the gun. I just thought it was comfortable and looked good.

For Trade towards one I have an H&R Model 949 - 9 Shot Revolver (dates back to 1967), chambered in 22 Caliber. I recently redid the grips on this gun as they were slightly chipped in the back - They look incredible now (the last picture is a quick shot of how the grips look now). Other than that this gun is in super nice condition, especially for it's age and it shoots phenomenally.

I got this gun about 3 years ago.  Since then I have brought it to the range twice.  Each time, I shot 100 rounds.  The third and last time it was used was in an IDPA match.  I forgot to write down the round count but it was about 125 rounds, so I will round up to the nearest 100 to make sure it isn't understated.  So, total round count for this 1911 is 400 rounds. It will come with 2 Kimber 8 round magazines.  If you are in Phoenix, I am willing to meet you in Casa Grande.

Cash only, No Trades
Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

 Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.
