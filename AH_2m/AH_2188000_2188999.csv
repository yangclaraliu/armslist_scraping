These are made by Armscor and are exceptionally tight with no looseness or frame rattle.   Is a mil spec GI model with a flat mainspring housing and spur hammer, but the beavertail is just long enough that I haven't had any problems with hammer bite.  I've run it with cheap mags and cheap ammo and have yet to have a malfunction of any kind.

I'm interested in trading for something full or mid sized in 9mm or .40.  Since its a 1911 it carries IWB very well, but I'd like to have something with a higher capacity if I'm going to have something full sized.
I'd really like a Beretta 92 or 96 or a CZ75, but I'm pretty open to other similar type guns.  I would also consider a Glock 26 or 19, or a Springfield XD in 9mm or .40
Pretty open so let me know what you have and the worst I can say is no, however no Tauruses and nothing aisde from 9mm or .40

Dont have to get rid of it, I'm just wanting to see if there's anything out there I'd like better, and I'm not interested in selling it.

The gun comes with its case and two mags, one with FMJ in it the other with HP's.

Length-31.5"" (stock retracted)

From Thunderbeast:
The model 223A is our full-auto suppressor for 5.56 mm NATO assault rifles. It is designed for extreme durability and high heat loads from full-auto and burst firing schedules. The 223A is ideal for short-barrelled rifle (""SBR"") format fighting carbines and M4/M16 pattern rifles, as well as AR-15's that will be used with a high rate of fire.

The 223A was developed specifically for the 7.5-inch Sabre Defence Industries Stealth SBR.

The 223A is made of 316 stainless steel and inconel and features a full-welded baffle core for durability. It has a length of 6.8 inches, 0.4 less than the 223P, to keep over-all length of the carbine relatively short. Muzzle blast concussion is eliminated and the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed over time. The 223A improves the accuracy of most rifles. It is sealed and requires no maintenance.

The 223A is ideal for fighting carbines including full-auto applications.

Caliber: 223 caliber, 5.56 mm NATO

From Zeiss:
Quick and resilient:
The sealed housing offers reliable protection to both optical and electronic parts. Discover the benefits of the automatic intensity regulation of the illuminated dot on your next driven hunt and experience for yourself the ultra-rapid target acquisition. The technology that lies within this compact reflex sight offers you significant advantages: the illuminated dot has a manual as well as an automatic digital control system - ensuring maximum security and precision in terms of function. Another smart feature is the combination of batteries and solar cell. This leads to virtually unlimited function and total reliability

Totally secure housing:
When you need something for the most challenging conditions, where you need complete reliability of your equipment, the Victory Z-Point is the right sight for you. The waterproof and dustproof aluminum housing offers reliable protection for the optics and electronics when tracking in dense undergrowth or in thick snow.

Tried and tested LotuTec® coating:
Keep your target clearly in sight whatever the weather. Water simply rolls off the tried and tested LotuTec® coating, ensuring clear visibility even in rain and snow. This innovative protective layer also makes it quick and easy to remove dust and dirt.

Hybrid power supply:
Depending on the light conditions, the power is supplied either by a CR 2032 battery or by the integrated solar cell. This ensures a reliable and long-lasting power supply, meaning that you can always rely on the secure function of your reflex sight.

Versatile mounting options:
Two mounting options are available, allowing you to mount the sight on your rifle directly and quickly. A Weaver version is available to fit on the rails available for most sporting firearms alongside a Picatinny versions for many civilian versions of military arms that are rail equipped.

Operation:
As with the Victory Compact Point, the sight is turned on and off using the large, easy-to-use function button. The brightness regulation of the illuminated dot is controlled automatically by the ambient light. You can use the manual override at any time, depending on the intensity of illumination you prefer in any particular hunting situation."

anything that has been upgraded I also have the original OEM parts that I can revert to, at your discretion.

i also have about 600 rounds of 9mm in various weights and projectile styles I would trade directly for other ammo if the calibre I trade into is different. Prices would be 80% on my side since I transferred everything to MTM cases for backpacking and no longer have the original boxes/trays, but still have the info I tore off the box.

everything pictured in the photo except for the box that it sits on is included in the 800 price point. i'll be happy to remove different items for a price difference. i am the original owner, still retain the original bill of sale from the store i purchased it from not even a full year ago (11 months)"

A steam generator wouldn't, because water and wood is plentiful around here.

I'm learning carpentry, blacksmithing and basic mechanics... but a steam engine is beyond me, so I need some help putting one together and learning how it operates.

The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

Shoots great with solid mechanics.  

1970 is considered one of the good years of Colt when they built each Python by hand.

This gun has been refinished at some point in its life.  I understand refinishing a python can drop its value and have price accordingly.  Non refinished 4” pythons are selling between $1,900-$2,800 on Gun Broker (go ahead, track a few).

I love pump action shotguns, and I especially love Mossberg 500.

This is an older Mossberg 500, New Haven 600AT. The stocks are actual walnut, not the birch they use today. The receiver has decorative etchings. The barrel was the infamous (and ugly) C-Lect Choke, that I had cut down to 18 1/2. The front sight is fiber optic. The action is very smooth. Its been completely striped, cleaned, oiled and reassembled. This would be great under the bed or in the field.  Comes with shotgun shell belt and 25 shells.

Walmart price $258 + Taxes $25 + Background $10 = $293 
and it doesn't even come with walnut stocks or 18 1/2 barrel.

My price is fair and firm at $240

Quite the mouthful, I know. This honey is an Officers-size 1911, with a 3"" cone-type bushingless barrel. The pistol comes with the following custom touches from the factory:
 Beavertail grip safety
 Skeletonized hammer
 Three-hole skeletonized trigger with overtravel stop
 Extended, ambidextrous thumb safety
 Novak-style Trijicon night sights
 Flat, checkered mainspring housing with Springfield Integrated Locking System (ILS).

The pistol still wears the factory cocobolo wood grips, and also has a polished feed ramp. It was bought new in October 2012, total round count is somewhere in the neighborhood of 200. It was my EDC for most of the summer, and shows some light, cosmetic only wear on the frame due to that. Most wear is on or near the trigger guard. It has been carried a lot, but shot very little. Comes with everything you get from the factory, which is:

Plastic case
 2 6-round mags
 Polymer holster (Right hand), and double mag pouch
 Disassembly tools and 2 ILS keys
 Streamlight X2/XML rail-mounted weapon light (the pistol does have a rail)
 Owner's manual and all paperwork.

I'll also include a 7-round Chip McCormick magazine with removable extended base pad, and a Cobra Gunskin IWB holster, right hand. The holster is well-used, but still has tons of life left in it.

Asking $950 for all of it. Not interested in any firearm trades this time, the only trade I will consider is an 80s Honda Shadow or similar cruiser-type motorcycle, valued similarly to the pistol.

Pursuant to current Colorado law, this will have to be an FFL transaction, and the buyer will have to complete a CBI check. It sucks, I know, but we've gotta stay on the up and up, especially in the current political climate.  I will pay transfer fees up to $35 at any FFL we can mutually agree on. My apologies for the lousy quality pics, I can email or text more/better ones on request. I'm in Lakewood, but am willing/able to deal pretty much anywhere in the metro area, and possibly beyond. Email me with questions or offers, and as always, thanks for viewing."

I have a Blackhawk CQC holster, and a kydex adjustable tension mag pouch. 
A TLR-1 tactical light, a standard barrel, and a threaded barrel.
I can also throw in 50 rounds.

The Marlin 336 is a 30-30 lever action rifle. Holds 6+1, and functions, as well as looks, good. I have a rail mounted on it, but have since used the rings and scope for other rifles. Also have a sling which holds 4 rounds, and a buttstock sleeve which holds 9, though I can find other uses for those if you can't.
Also have around 60 assorted rounds.


Reasons why I'm looking to trade:
I have a Yugo SKS which I love, and seeing as how 30-30 and 7.62x39 are incredibly similar, I can't really justify having both.

With the M&P, I'm slowly trying out every type of handgun I can. This gun is the most recent, and while it's accurate, and hasn't had any problems with the 100-150 rounds I've fired from it, it just isn't ""right"" for me."

The PPK/S .22 blends the iconic PPK design with the fun and cost savings of
the .22 LR The PPK/S .22 is identical to its PPK/S 380 brother, but you can
shoot 22LR rimfire ammo for pennies a shot and recoil is minimal. PPK/S is
the 1968 ""Sport"" version with longer grip, based on the legendary 1931
design. The top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare and rear slide
serrations make for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. The internal
slide stop reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic
Walther checkered grip panels. The double action trigger of the PPK/S 22
has a 17.5 lb. pull while the single action has a 6.6 lb. pull. The beaver
tail and magazine finger extensions improve shooting comfort. The PPK/S .22
is great for the whole family, a quality firearm to someday pass it on to
the next generation.

I've seen a lot of posts saying their gun is new, minus that box or three or ammo fired through it. Unlike other ads stating the gun is new, this one actually is. The magazines haven't been loaded, the weapon has never been fired. It hasn't left the case or my safe for that matter. With the enhanced hammer, grips, and front fiber optic sight... this is not your grandfather's 1911.

I bought this gun when the scare was on from Palmetto in Ridgeland for $864.  The Blackhawk accy's were another $50 and the extra mag was $11 so a little over $900 tax tag and title.  I'm not one of these people on here that still think AR's are worth a gazzilion dollars.  I am firm on my price.  If you want to save yourself $150+ dollars on the EXACT same gun you are gonna walk out the door from palmetto with in regards to being new, here ya go.

MSRP is almost $1400.00 This gun is in as good of shape as it was when I bought it.

Here's the Details from Sig Sauer

The all-stainless construction of the P220® Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long. As the next generation P220, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG’s new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite.

 I bought this rifle and decided to go with a bolt action instead. I Paid just at $500.00 for the rifle and also have 200 rounds of new factory fresh brass ammo (not cheap brands or reloads) to include in the deal. This is one of the best all-around hunting rifles made, perfect for any Florida hunting trip!

 I am really looking to trade for a nice 1911 rather than selling it, but if you want to buy it the price needs to be $700.00. This is less than what I paid for the rifle and ammo so I don't have much wiggle room on the price, please don't try to low ball me this is already a great deal and I am in no hurry to get rid of this rifle.

It has a couple of after market modifications done to it. It has a brand new free floating E.R. Shaw Bull Barrel with a 1/10 Right Hand twist. When ER Shaw installed the barrel they also Trued it to the receiver meaning that the barrel/chamber now sits perfectly in the receiver and lines up perfectly with the bolt face. I have put the barrel through the initial break in of firing one round then cleaning the barrel with Hoppes solvent repeating the process for 10 rounds. Also the rifle comes with a H-S Precision kevlar composite M24A1 stock that is equipped with an aluminum bedding block. The scope is nothing special. It is simply a cheap no name scope that I picked up from Gander Mountain. It also comes with the Bipod. This rifle will stack rounds through one ragged hole at 100 meters. However, I have not had an opportunity to push it out there on the range. That being said I would not be surprised if this rifle is capable of hitting a 1 minute target at 600-800 meters, and I am pretty confident that it can be done with this weapon in the hands of a capable shooter. Slap some good glass on this bad boy and maybe an aftermarket trigger and you have a true sniper rifle chambered in 30-06. With all of that being said, I by no means have to get rid of this rifle; I just really want to see if theres something out their that catches my eye. I estimate the value of this rifle to be worth somewhere between $1,000 and $1,200 after the mods I've done to it. If you'd like to make an offer, I'd be interested in pretty much all firearms, especially pistols, AR's, and other long guns. I can be reached by phone call or text at REDACTED ask for Jake. Worst I can say is no thank you."
