here are the specs:

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

However, it isn't that deep just the coating on the limbs turns slightly white when scratched.The scratch annoyed me so I covered it. The riser is in excellent condition and has no scratches or marring. The rest is a fur pad that has been replaced from the original. The strings are original and have after market vibration absorbers on them (the kind that are like a ball of rubber strings). The bow has a wrist strap that is new as well as a rubber stabilizer. It is a 62 inch model and is great for bowfishing.  I am selling it with a pair of deer hide tabs, a compression arm guard comes with it too. For whatever its worth six arrows come with it but are made for my draw length and I am around 5' 10"" so if you are close to that size they'll probably fit you too. The arrows have 125 grain field tips on them. A new quiver comes with it too. everything that came on it originally I still have (papers, vibration dampeners, bag wrench, etc.). It is ready to roll. I am selling it because I don't have enough time to dedicate to shooting traditional anymore so there is no need for it to collect dust. I am looking for $450. Call or text me at REDACTED anytime after 3:00 pm and I will send pictures. I couldn't get a pic of the scratch because I could only upload 3 pictures.

I ended up getting a different 9MM so I don't need this anymore.  I have shot one box of winchester out of it.  The magazines are brand new and the springs are extremely stiff.  This causes the first round to nosedive and get stuck. The gun will jam with a full magazine, but if you load it with one less round it works much better.  This gun hasn't jammed AFTER the first round, but just doing dry runs it would jam on the first shot with a fully loaded magazines 50/50. Some people online cut the magazine spring since its so stiff.  This isn't a gun issue, its a magazine issue.  Also this could have been because I was using hollow points. I have a hi point .45 and have had none of these issues.  This gun is stupid accurate. Basically I don't have time for it and am interested in getting rid of it.

It was bought 2/13/2014.  It comes with:
Gun
New Holster
Kydex 'holster' with hardware (for attaching the gun to the bottom of a wood desk or work bench)
3 x 10 round magazines
1 x 8 round magazines
1 x Safety Lock
1 x Ghost Ring Sight

The magazine safety was removed but is included. They put it in for certain state compliance but having it means if you drop the mag on accident you can't fire the round chambered.  

Sorry no trades.  I do western union money orders and ship to FFL only.  Local cash buyers I am willing to meet.

Everything here added up (after shipping, tax, ect) is over $275.  I am asking $190. So basically you get a new gun, with new mags, for less than the price of one of these at cabelas."

Grand total is $1,690. Like i said above, right now I'm looking for a quality 1911 plus cash or another gun. I may split the package up so just ask if you want the upper or lower. Trade value is $1,600 FIRM ""non negotiable"" since it is ""NOT"" new anymore and has been fired 90 rounds exactly. The BCG was checked for headspacing and gun was cleaned and lubed every 30 rounds for break in. Cash price will be $1,600 which you will offer $1,400 and i will say $1,500 and you will get me down $50 more dollars after you agree to meet me within 20 miles of my location. Haggling complete. So the haggling complete cash price is $1,450 within 20 miles of Alexander County NC."

In 1978, Remington came out with their most stealthy nylon rifle. It was called the Black Diamond and was black with white spacers but without the white diamond on it. The barrel and receiver cover were dark blue/black steel. As it’s name implies it has a black rather than a white diamond in the fore stock. Production of the Black Diamond lasted until 1987. In those 10 years there were very few Black Diamonds made. This one the blueing is wore at muzzle end on barrel and receiver cover shows small amount of wear. This rifle shoots great and and is very light."

My serial number was produced in April 1939. Overwhelming odds are that this rifle saw active duty in WWII due to the high demand in those early years. Think about it... my serial number is 1**40 and troops were not fully issued until serial number 400,000+

Here is the reason it is stamped CAI:

1. America left a lot of firearms in foreign countries after WWII.
2. The gun control act of 1968 gave the ATF power to regulate imports.
3. ATF then started requiring all firearms entering America to be stamped by the importer. This included American arms ""returning' to our country.
4. So your serial number and ""CAI"" stamp simply means that the rifle left the country prior to 1968 and returned after that. A virtual guarantee that it saw active duty in at least one and possibly several wars.

To that end, our firm offers comprehensive gun trust services for gun owners throughout the region and State.

A gun trust is a way by which you can protect your firearms.  Transferring your firearms through a will exposes the entire world to what firearms you own and who is to receive them, in addition, if the person to whom you will your firearms to is disqualified from possessing a firearm, your guns are seized by the ATF.

A trust eliminates this problem, and many others by ensuring that only you, the executor of the trust and your beneficiaries know who receives your firearms.  Additionally, if phrased properly (and it will be) your firearms can be ensured to transfer for future generations (even those who will be born after your passing).  A trust also allows all named beneficiaries to use and possess your firearms, which, without, could be in violation of the law and incur heavy penalties.

Please contact the Rogers Law Group today to discuss how we can assist you in protecting your firearms and keep them out of the government's hands.  Thank you and we look forward to assisting you soon.

The Fusil Semi-Automatique de 7.5mm modele 1949/56 or Mas 49/56 is the final variant that started with the Mas 40 though the Mas 40 saw very limited use because of the German occupation of France.  Then after the liberation of France from Nazi forces the variant was updated to the Mas 44 but again saw only limited use until 1949 where the final variant of the action was designed and designated the Mas 1949, of only 20,000 were produced.  7 years later in 1956 the barrel was shortened and forward grenade launching sight was added making the Mas 49/56 of which nearly 275,000 rifles were produced.  The Mas 49/56 was one of the last main issue battle rifles of a bygone era of weapons designs.  Basically the French equivalent to the FAL this robust and reliable tilting bolt direct impingement rifle chambers for the powerful 7.5x54 French even though France was part of NATO they were quite stubborn about using their own ammunition instead of NATO standard.  Most of these rifles were imported by C.A.I. in the 90's after they were removed from French reserve arsenals.  After importing them Century converted most of these rifles to 7.62x51 NATO standard since they thought it would appeal more to American shooters, but they did not modify the gas tube or the bolt to handle the higher pressure .308 cartridge resulting in one of the most commonly ruined rifle on the U.S. market.  Most of the .308 conversions are considered unsafe to fire.  Which is what makes this rifle very nice is that it was left in the original caliber meaning it retains its immaculate machining quality.  These rifles were used extensively and every 10 years or so the rifles in good enough condition were sent back to the armory to be rearsenaled, this rifle has two rearsenal marks, one from 1971 and one from 1981.  During it's second refurbish it's barrel was replaced as indicated by the fact that the barrel is dated 1976.  After its second refurbish I am lead to believe it was never re issued and simply sat in an arsenal for a while.  The man I bought it from bought it from Century with 2 others and he never fired it and neither have I so it is likely a round has never been fired through the barrel (it is absolutely perfect).  The rifle is mechanically perfect and functions flawlessly.  The stock is refinished from the medium quality military finish to a high quality urethane finish.  Comes with a rubber grenade launching boot dated 1962, and 1 10 round magazine.  I am not particularly looking to get rid of the rifle since I like it so much but I am more of a collector of Warsaw Pact and Combloc firearms so I am interested in seeing what else is out there and will trade it for the right deal."
