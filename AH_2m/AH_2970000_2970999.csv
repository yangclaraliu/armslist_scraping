It's ""Made In USSR"" marked on the middle hex. It's in a Finned Tula stock, the barreled receiver was put in this stock long before I got it, this the stock only, no handguard or barrel bands. The rifle has a nice smooth finish with no pitting and a really nice brownish-gray patina. No parts are matching. The bore has deep rifling present, dark, and light pitting in the grooves. the magazine floorplate has evidence of a previous scrubbed serial number. It has a balance of Tula and Izhevsk parts. If I remember correctly the trigger is a pre-1928 Izhevsk, but I'll have the check. This rifle has been well maintained by me, I've only shot 5 rounds out of her. There are three dings on the right side, one on the rear sight, one small one on the right hex, and one on the magazine, they look like they've been there a long time and most likely from military service (shrapnel? or other means). The stock is a really nice reddish-brown Finn capture Tula, with your normal wear, some one scratches covered up with the Finn tar/finish. The Tula star is present and various cartouches are easily visible as well, I can make out the ""19"" under the Tula star but not the last two numbers of the year. I really like the stock. It has the Finn finger splicing at the halfway mark or so. The markings on the barrel are a nice pre-war example of workmanship, they're still visible and present, it has a ""P."" stamp between Izhevsk triangle and the year, which I have been unable to determine the meaning of. The tang date is 1933 and is Izhevsk. The bolt is nice and smooth. I can provide additional, more specific pictures if needed. Feel free to ask any questions. I will upload pictures tomorrow."

Of course this price is just a joke and a little poke at Armslist for having the communist ""over-priced"" button on their page. Just having the ""over-priced"" button is simply communism. It seems to me that Armslist does not like a free Capitalist society and the way we do it in the USA by adding this button. Also, Anyone that uses it should just be ashamed! If the price is totally absurd to you just laugh and move on. That's what I do because I believe in a free Capitalist society. That's what this country was built on. Anything else is just communism. I paid alot more than I'm trying to sell it for on GB about a month ago. When I tried to offer it here for a fraction of the price I paid for it the listing was taken down for being over priced? I am just sad to see the once mighty USA go this direction. Mean while scammers run rampant here and their listings stay up sometimes for weeks and people get ripped off and get nothing for their hard earned money. I would hate to put this back on GB and have to ship it but I guess I may have to do just that.

This is one of the more aesthetically pleasing SKS rifles I have seen. Due to the fact that it is a yugo it has the grenade bore attachment and grenade launcher sights. The bayonet is attached and works great. Very few minor marks on the stock, and a beautiful (original) dark wood finish. There is a little wear inside the barrel as its a 60 year old firearm, but the rifling is still fully there. Some of the white paint on the yard indicator has faded. In the hands of a good shooter this beautiful firearm can shoot groups as good as an AK47 and hold its own against any other SKS despite the wear.  Most of the parts are matching, the gas valve was replaced one month ago. This allows it to cycle flawlessly.

I will include 4 10 round stripper clips and sling at no extra cost. For extra I can sell you a few boxes of 20 rounds 7.62x39 tulammo for $5each (I believe I have 100 rounds total). I also can sell you a cleaning kit for it.

Email me if you're interested. If you  a nice looking classic rifle that has history and accurately shoots cheap, hard hitting ammo this sks is for you. The only reason I am selling this because I am interested in getting into more competitive shooting and need all the money I can get to go towards ammunition and customizing my other firearms. Its priced to sell because I frankly don't see the point of over pricing a surplus firearm. The price is firm. 

If you are local and want to meet at Scotia range I would be happy to field strip it in front of you. Not interested in shipping. Will travel 30 minutes outside my current area to meet. You will have to sign a bill of sale. Cash only, must present legal PA ID."

There is a tiny chip in the frame by the larger pin due to a gunsmith using a wrong sized pin to give my pistol a full detail strip cleaning.

The pistol otherwise is in excellent condition. *I have taken this into account for the prices I am asking for below*

I am selling this because I have moved up to a .40 s&w

I am offering this at two different prices. 
$680 - for the whole package, everything listed. excellent deal considering all the extra magazines that come with it and night sights and all
OR
$550 - without the extra magazines, also a superb deal considering the trijicon hd night sights
you will get everything listed above w/night sights..etc minus the 2 extra 15 round magazines and 3 high capacity 33 round magazines. (you will basically get what came with the original packaging, 3 magazines+everything else)

At the above prices, I will be selling this at a loss. *The prices are with the tiny chip in the frame taken into account of course*
The Trijicon HD Tritium Night Sights alone were $160 installed, these sights make target acquisition almost instant and are very bright with the big dot front sight in both day and night.

This iconic rifle was manufactured by Springfield Armory around March of 1943. It is in very good condition with just a few handling marks on the stock. Like most M1s, the bore is dark but has plenty of rifling. I test fired this M1 and had no trouble hitting a 150 gong off-hand at a local range. There are no import marks on this rifle. However, the slide/operating rod is marked NM (National Match)! I have three other M1s and no room in my safe, so this one will have to go to a good home.
Face-to-face transaction in the Fresno/Clovis area only. No insulting lowball offers or suspicious requests to ship out of my local area will be considered or responded to."

Rifle comes with 11 mags.  Three 42 round mags and eight 30 round mags.  Not willing to separate the gun from the magazines, so make sure you include their value in any trade.

Winchester Feather weight in 300 Win mag or 338.  Will consider other hunting bolt action rifles in 300 Win mag or 338.  C93's, 20"" A2 or A4 AR 15 rifles.  AK's in 7.62x39, Arsenal or kit builds with original import barrels.  No Yugo Ak's please.  Sig 226's or 229's (no DAK please).  FAL's.  Nor C&R rifles please.

This gun has been a safe queen.  I am in no rush to get rid of this gun, if the right trade doesn't come along I have no issue keeping it forever.  If you make a trade offer make sure and include what you think your gun(s) are worth plus any cash you plan on adding to the deal or what cash you expect in the deal (if applicable).

This rifle was called the ""Filthy 14"" as the one tested was no. 14 from off a rack. It was a mid length AR-15 so the gas system was longer than a carbine and just as reliable as an A2.

I'm selling my AR that used the same upper internals as the legendary Filthy 14. Aside from the testing done at BCM, it is almost brand new. You are looking at an AR that has never been abused, never left dirty, and not had any rounds through it aside from the manufacturer's testing.

- 16"" Bravo Company Mid Length Receiver
- HPI & Mag bolt
- Iron sights
- PSA lower

No scratches, no dings... no rounds through it (other than BCM's test fires). This rifle is virtually NEW."

Gongs are made from AR500 and are rated for ammo at 3,000 fps and slower. A stand and all harware to hang it is included. They break down to make it easy to carry and store. Sizes go from 2""- 20"". I also make stands to hang multiple targets from. 
DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick. No tools are ever needed!
STATIC IPSC SILHOUETTE & STAND:
Silhouette is AR500 and 3/8"" thick and is also rated for all pistol and rifle ammunition @ 3,000fps or slower. 1/2 scale, 2/3 scale available. Target stands right at 5' tall. The legs remove to make transporting easier. 
ROUND STATIC STANDS
Round static targets are 3/8"" AR500. Sizes go from 4""-12"". The base accepts a standard 2x4 board that you supply. These are very light weight and easily portable. 


 These targets will withstand tens of thousands of bullet strikes. If you are building a shooting range, I can help you get the most targets for your budget! I can offer discounts on package deals. I can do custom builds to fit your exact needs. The sky is the limit to what I can build. We can customize a range to your exact specifications and needs! The fastest way to reach me is by text or call 931-312-912two

Every target from ULTIMATE TARGETS is made by American hands! No robots, illegal immigrants or communist mass production junk! Every target I build is made one at a time, with care, to ensure every target is built RIGHT! I guarantee all of my work. I've never had a target returned for any reason. You can buy these with the confidence that you will get a very well built target that will last you a very very long time for a fraction of the price of other companies.

763,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2970763,"For Sale:  Tactical Short Barrel Lower Recoil Low Flash 357 Magnum Ammo - 140 gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (1,150fps/M.E. 411 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box","Azusa, California, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Monday, April 21, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=106

Typical full power 357 magnum loads offer several tactical problems for use in self defense and duty applications, especially when used in the shorter/lighter revolvers that are typical of concealed, defensive and duty carry. First, the muzzle flash can be blinding, especially from short barrels. Second, felt recoil can be a life-threatening drawback if fast follow-up shots are required. Third, the level of report can be deafening and cause permanent hearing loss, especially if fired indoors.

All three Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel loads address the above problems and make the 357 magnum ideal for concealed, defensive and duty carry in smaller revolvers.

Muzzle flash: These exciting new 357 magnum loads utilize a flash suppressed powder that will not blind you, should you need to drop the hammer in a low light situation. It is estimated that over 90% of all defensive civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light-that is when the criminal element is at work. Wouldn't it be horrible if you fired at an assailant, in the dark, to protect your family, only to find that you missed the bad guy and you are now blind due to your own muzzle flash? This is a scenario that has happened many times in the real world with the 357 magnum. Through the use of our non-canister, flash suppressed powder, the tactical problem of blinding muzzle flash is now greatly reduced with Buffalo Bore's new Tactical Short Barrel loads! 

Recoil: Felt recoil is exacerbated by the use of shorter barreled, smaller framed, lighter weight 357 revolvers, typically used for concealed and duty carry. The new Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel 357 loads are not the normal full power ""barn burner"", 357 magnum loads we make and as such, felt recoil is substantially reduced, although they remain very powerful. Hence, deadly, and faster follow-up shots are more possible. 

Your ears: Most folks don't think of the level of ""report"" as being a problem during a life threatening/defensive shooting and that may be correct for the actual moment of conflict. However, to lose some of your hearing for the rest of your life, following the shooting incident, is unnecessary and undesirable. Full power 357 magnum ammunition is deafening, even more so when fired from short barrels and even worse if you are required to shoot from an enclosed area such as a vehicle or indoors. Buffalo Bore's Tactical Short Barrel 357 magnum loads are not as hard on your hearing as full power ammunition. Although the use of hearing protection is still desirable, if possible, when using this ammo. 

For those who wish to carry a 357 magnum revolver for potential ""conflict resolution"", these new Buffalo Bore loads put an end to the ""tactical"" draw backs associated with our regular 357 magnum ammo. These loads are great for use in longer barreled firearms too.

Special Information Note: The below velocities were obtained from my personal, real world, factory stock, over the counter, (NOT TEST BARRELS) 357 magnum, revolvers. Also, note that the 6 inch Python, is considerably slower than the 4 inch S&W. This has nothing to do with barrel length. It is most likely a combination of differences in chamber/throat dimensions, barrel -cylinder gap, barrel internals, and forcing cone dimensions in the Python, versus the S&W. If the Python and the S&W had the same dimensions in their chamber/throats, barrel cylinder gap and forcing cone, the longer barreled Python would give much faster speeds. We have found that all of our Python test revolvers are much slower than our late model S&W revolvers of equal or even shorter barrel length.

We could have reduced the recoil, flash and blast even more by ""watering down"" these loads further than we did, but then you wouldn't have a real 357 magnum in your hands. So we looked for and found a balance between very powerful, fight stopping ammo that recoils and flashes much less than ours and some other makers, full power 357 loads. If we were to ""water down"" this ""Tactical Short Barrel"" 357 ammo any more, we would simply not manufacture it and suggest that you use our 38 SPL+P ammunition.

None of these loads caused crimp/bullet jump (in five shots) in my 12 OZ. Scandium S&W Model 340, but they did generate considerable felt recoil.

This variant has a  Glock  style trigger system with a pre-loaded internal striker. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. The trigger travel is approximately 8 mm (0.3 in) with a trigger pull of approximately 38  N  (8.5  lb f ). The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last   As the duty pistol for law enforcement agencies in North America, Europe and Asia, the P99 has endured the harshest operating conditions a handgun will ever see. What’s more, its ergonomics and engineering have evolved subtly in response to feedback from agencies over the years. The P99 is truly a world class handgun for professionals who must trust their lives to a firearm."

And it is, indeed, New In Box--it has never been fired, only taken out and inspected.

Bought less than a week ago and did a demo for my youtube channel.  This Chiappa Little Badger in .22 magnum is very nice. The rifle shoots twenty two magnum and is very accurate. It has M1 style peep sights. I wrapped paracord around the barrel and wire frame stock. It turned out very nice. I am going to leave this on as the fit and finish of the cord came out very liking.

The gun comes with the canvas bag, the box. The rifle.

One thing to mention is gunblast.com Jeff Quinn has been wanting one of these for a long time and just got his copy last tuesday. I saw this one in the lgs the same day and picked it up right away. The trigger is very nice. The recoil is fun and the .22 magnum is a blast to shoot.  

The rifle will shoot .22 long rifle as well as attested by Jeff. I tried this feature out and it works very nicely just like he said. So you have a multi caliber rifle made for 22 magnum but will also round 22 LR. How cool is this. I tried three kinds of 22 magnum and six kinds of 22 long rifle. All round performed flawlessly.

The rifle folds in almost half to fit in a backpack or the included canvas bag.

The rifle has a quad rail for attaching a scope or other items of interest.  
This item is a single shot break open style like a single shot shotgun. The mechanics are top notch. The fit and finish is superb. Action is super sweet.
The weight of the rifle is three and one half pounds. The paracord had added a half pound. You can remove the paracord very easily but I think you will like how it came out.
email me with cell number to contact and best time to get with.  
My only trade on this would be for a ruger 1022 or possibly other .22 

I will even toss in the rest of the box of 22 magnum i did not shoot through it. Which is if i remember half a box.

The rifle is great fun and can be used for other things than a survival rifle. It is just plain good old plinking fun. I was shooting clays at 52 yards over the weekend and a jug of water for the youtube demo.

If you want to watch the youtube send me an email I will send you the link to it."
