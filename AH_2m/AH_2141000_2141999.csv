I have fired a few hundred rounds through the gun with zero failures of any kind. If you want a reliable 9mm this is it. There are no issues with it. I am only selling it to finance a 1911.

In my opinion this pistol has the most comfortable stock grip available. It is highly contoured with a textured finish. It comes with S, M, L backstraps and S, M, L left and right side plates so you can mix and match each part to fit your hand.  It also comes with an HK plastic case, lock and two mags.

In addition to the well placed and easy to use safety lever it also has a decocker on the left side of the hammer.

You must present a valid MA LTC prior to inspecting the gun.
Serious inquiries please respond with your phone number and I will call you. Sorry but too many junk emails.

I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. 

I also have cases of 7.62 x 54R ammunition made for the Mosin Nagant from Russia. I will sell a can of 440 rounds of ammo for an additional $100 with a rifle purchase.
Thank you!"

DESCRIPTION
Pistol Perfect is dedicated to a perfection level of clean, detail and protection to your firearm.
Guns need regular maintains for top performance and periodically the routine take down and clean is just not enough to keep your gun in premium condition that maintains its top performance and cosmetic appeal desired over time. We field strip and first air blast any loose particles and residue before wetting gun. This keeps residue from finding crevices and spaces to hide and build up as well as blasting away with no arasolized particles to create particles to still stick.  After thorough air blast to all parts a all surface safe degreaser is used to remove all chemical agents from gun metals and surfaces and hand cleaned free of all particles.
The gun is then given a very intensive detail cleaning to perfection as well barrel and all parts and surfaces. After, the gun is given application of frog lube liquid, with a light soft brushing and heated to 110 F and allowed for surface to absorb and then a light brush again prior to allowing to cool and retain protectant. A polishing cloth is then applied to again clean all surfaces as the heat allows absorbed residue to escape metal pores from friction of firing that heats gun and absorbs into metal and even further residue will be removed. Gun is then coated with premium Froglube Paste and again warmed to just heated (hot to touch) temp to to allow for a further deep absorption of protection into pores of surface while curing for an hour sealing protection into gun. A second polish cloth is used to polish the now smooth non greasy,  satin and condition felt surfaces and given light thin rub of liquid Froglube to friction points. The gun is assembled and given a detail with soft cloth by hand to get full luster look from gun, print free and unhandled shine. You will now have a pistol perfect clean that will not only protect and maintain gun but allows for smoother action and performance without greasy lubrications as the metal is given a deeper treatment that is notably smooth to touch and future standard cleaning is cut in half as simply wiping removes residue for many trips ahead to shoot.

Weighing just 13.5 oz. with a smooth and easy to control trigger, the Ruger LCR .38 Special Revolver is packed with technological advances for today's most demanding shooters. A great backup gun or conceal and carry choice, the Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) starts with a monolithic frame of aerospace-grade, 7000 series aluminum to fully support the lightweight, fluted stainless steel cylinder and barrel. This small frame, internal hammer revolver also features a polymer fire control housing for reduced weight and friction reducing cam fire control for a smooth trigger pull. Synthetic Hogue® Tamer™ grip provides a sure handle while reducing felt recoil. Replaceable, pinned ramp front sight and U-notch integral rear sight. Weight: 13.5 oz. Capacity: 5 rounds. 
When Ruger designed the groundbreaking polymer-framed LCR revolver, it did so with the intention of Crimson Trace Lasergrips® compatibility and availability right out of the gates. The LG-411 greatly enhances the defensive capability of the lightweight LCR with a seamless fit and quality engineering. It will hold zero continuously without fail. Ruger’s commitment to endorsing Crimson Trace® laser sights is further validation that after the weapon itself, a laser is the best firearms investment you can make."

Here's What I Got & I Apoligize For The Size Of The List In Advance But Have Alot Too Barter:
-(A Few Boxes Of) Black Talon Ammo In 9mm As Well As In 45 Auto, This Ammo had not been made For A long time and when it was taken off the shelves due ot their strength and penetration power which Let to them Getting The Name Cop Killers at the time even though it was BS in fact many Police Officer Friends of Mine Actually carry these Rather then Winchesters PDX1 Because they are still stronger rounds that is if they can if they can get their hands on em. All The Ammo Is In Brand New Condition & Have Had It Sealed In My Airtight Safe For Years So All The Ammo & Boxes Are In Like New Cond.

-(2 Boxes) Of Rare Halo Point 9mm Ammo, The Ammo Also Is Extremely High Velocity Ammo At Around 2,000Fps = Velocity To A Blue Tip Fn 5.7X28 Round Not To Mention The Round Is Only 50 Grain Bullet making It One Of The Best Carry Ammo Made.
But The Boxes Are Where The Money Is. They Stopped Making It & Changed The Ammo & Name To Something Else Because They Were Sued By Microsoft Due To The Ammo's Name,Photo. & Trademark On The Front Of The Box Being Extremely Similar To Microsofts Halo The Video Game Trademarked Logo. They Were Quickly Recalled And Customers Were Asked To Send In Their Boxes To Get A Brand New One.

-(I Have 3 Boxes Of) FN FIve Seven Red Box Green Tip Extremely Hard To Get Ahold Of Fn 5.7X28 Ammo & Well As

-(2 Boxes Of) What Is Known FN 5.7X28 Military Ammo It's Known As ""White Box"" & Best Of All That The Boxes Are still Sealed.

-(A Rare Match Grade) ""Ed Brown"" Commander Match Grade 1911 Barrel With everything needed for installed in Commander 1911 & I aso have a Ton Of other Ed Brown 1911 Parts As Well For 1911's As Well, Everything From Guide Rod, Specialty Grips, To Grip Screws To Sear, Ed Brown Hardcore Firing Pin, & More Internal Parts

The solid top receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and an off-set hammer spur is included with every rifle.  The Marlin Model 336Y is the perfect rifle for young hunters to take their first deer.  They will be proud to join generations of Marlin owners who have engaged in the deer

Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.  Thia survival rifle is a semi-auto rifle that easily disassembles without tools , and the 16” barrel and other components fold up into the plastic,  butt stock , which also floats (this is a great gun to stow on your boat as well!). The rifle has a crisp bore with great rifling, and trigger pull is smooth.  it also is a great gun to throw in the trunk or backpack, if you get stranded in the dead of winter it will get you a rabbit or something, and as I mentioned, it’s also a great gun to stow on your boat.

K-38 Masterpiece is a great find for the Advanced Smith & Wesson Collector! Made in 1967, the pistol almost looks like it walked out of the S&W factory yesterday. The 8 3/8” pinned factory barrel has an adjustable rear sight and a high partridge front sight. Built on the “K” frame, the pistol has a high-polish factory blue finish with gold-filled wording and logo, and a beautiful set of S&W “Goncalo Alves” wooden checkered factory grips with S&W medallions. It is an understatement to say this is an attractive handgun! If you look real close you will see faint turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s about it as far as finish issues, the gun easily rates 95-98%+ condition. The bore on this gun is MINT, and double-action trigger pull is very smooth. Back in the day, the K-38 Masterpiece was coveted by Competition Shooters, now Collectors love them, and you will not find a nice one than this one, this is the gun you want to upgrade to!

The performance-packed RifleHunter1000 features a 1000-yard range and
extremely accurate. 1 yard display readings on game, even if partially
screened by grass or brush. The newly developed Active Brightness Control
Viewfinder is designed to offer the advantages of both traditional LCD
(liquid crystal display) and an LED (light-emitting diode) display in order
to provide better visibility and contrast in varying light conditions. The
core of the technology is the latest LCD with automatic brightness control
to the LED illumination. Utilizing this new technology, Nikon has optimized
the viewfinder display to detect the brightness of the ground area mainly
within the field of view (being influenced to a lesser degree by the
brightness of the sky). By detecting the brightness within this viewing
field, the rangefinder presents the newly designed LCD and will apply
automatically controlled LED illumination to the LC (liquid crystal)
characters by detecting the brightness within this viewing field as
necessary for increased visibility.
