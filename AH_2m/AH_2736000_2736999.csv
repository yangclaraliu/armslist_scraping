It saw service in WWII and then later went through an Arsenal Re-Build and was re-barreled in 10/46. The barrel is marked (SA 10-46) All of the internal parts are that I can see are USGI and the mechanics worked fine during test firing. The ME measures ""3"" and the TE measures ""4"" which is well within good shooting standards. The wood has numerous marks from military service, but no major issues such as chips, splits or cracks. There is a ""rack number"" on the bottom of the butt stock which is conducive of rifles that were issued to the Dane's after WWII. This Rifle also has retained the early ""Lock Bar Sights"" that are quite rare to see on M1 Garands these days. It also has the ""Milled Trigger Guard"" which is conducive of early Rifles."

This is for collectors, not somebody that just wants to shoot.  This is a piece of history that should be preserved.  I would rate the condition at 95+.  All parts are 100% original to the rifle, nothing altered or changed.  The rear sling swivel has scars in the rubber and I have no idea why.  The original owner would not give me the box nor the sling and original mag. He wanted to keep it for his p.o.s. Olympic arms.  I gave up on trying years ago.

The Kel-Tec P3AT Freedom limited edition is engraved with the word ‘FREEDOM’ and is dated December 15, 1791, the ratification of the Bill of Rights...honoring the 2nd Amendment. Each firearm is individually numbered (this one is 3486) to ensure the integrity of the series. And only 5000 numbered copies plus proof will be available. This is a very limited once in a lifetime series and once they are gone it will not be repeated again.
The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge.

The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.
I purchased this gun in 2011, NIB, from a local dealer. I have carried it for two years. The attached belt clip makes it really easy to carry in your pocket or on your waistband. THE GUN HAS NEVER BEEN FIRED. It includes the original box, all original papers and everything  that came with the gun. I am also including a full box of Remington 380 Auto Bullets.
Must have Missouri I.D. and sign Bill of Sale. Call Jack REDACTED or respond via email. I am located in Webb City.

The matching serial #s put it at 1918-19. It also comes with the coveted .410 barrel, but since they weren't made till '21 it is not original. It also comes with a Lyman flip-up sight.

I'm no gun expert, but I'd put the bluing at 90%+ conservatively. There is very little rust pitting and few scratches. The rifle bore looks great. The .410 barrel has been hammered around the shoulder where it meets the receiver. I understand this was commonly done for alignment. The furniture has some light scratching, a few small gouges and general wear, but the finish is very good considering the age.

This is an old, used rifle, but it was well taken care of.

The Saiga-20 autoloading shotgun is designed for professional and sport hunting small and medium-sized game under different climatic conditions. The shotgun is equipped with a 20-ga barrel with chamber, providing for shooting shot or slugs, including Magnum, with a shotshell length of 2 3/4"" and 3"". The shotgun demonstrates high reliability and withstands the harshest hunting conditions. The shotgun is capable of delivering single-shot fire and is reloaded automatically due to the energy of the powder gasses, escaping from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder and the energy of the return spring as well.  The shotguns are developed on the base of the Kalashnikov assault rifle and demonstrate reliability under harshest conditions of servicing. Features: - Synthetic stock - 19"" Barrel Length - 41"" Overall Length."

The L15 Competition was designed for 3 gun action shooting. Taking lessons learned for the Lancer Action Shooting Team we’ve assembled a compact, lightweight, fast shooting rifle. The mid-weight 17” barrel combines compactness with precision offering 1 MOA accuracy. The L15 Competition is all about speed, the L15 lower with competition magwell allows for faster re-loads, the extra-long, free floating handguard enables a better forward grip and faster transition between targets. The rifle length gas system, Wheaton Compensator provide soft recoil and minimal muzzle climb, while the short, positive reset of the CMC trigger allow for faster, more accurate follow up shots.
The L15 Super Competition is an upgraded version of the L15 Competition. A custom profiled Krieger stainless steel barrel is added to the L15 Competition rifle platform for sub 1 MOA accuracy.

963,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2736963,For Sale/Trade:  FEG PA-63 pistol in 9x18 Makarov  + AMMO,"Waterbury/Stowe, Vermont, United States",$ 335,"Listed On: Friday, March 7, 2014",Handguns,Century International Arms                                                                                ,9mm Makarov                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For Sale: 1 PA-63 pistol made by FEG.  7+1 capacity, 3.9"" barrel, chambered in 9x18 Makarov, and imported by CIA.  This is a small, lightweight, and easily concealable Hungarian made military/police clone of the Walther PP/PPK line of pistols.
The simple blowback design and fixed barrel make it pretty accurate, and it fires a cartridge that is cheaper than .380acp and power-wise between .380acp and 9x19 Luger. 

It comes with 3 magazines, 229 rounds of ammo (178 Brass cased Fiocci, and the rest is steel cased Silver bear, all FMJ) and 2 basic BLACKHAWK! holsters.  One holster is IWB the other is an OWB belt holster. I'll also include an extra Wolf heavy recoil spring and couple of other small replacement parts.

It is super easy to take down and clean, and a very simple design. It has a combo safety/decocker.  There is some bluing wear on the muzzle, and some of the machining on the internals is a little rough, but the gun functions flawlessly, and is in good condition overall, especially for a 40ish year old milsurp.  The double action trigger pull is smooth and not unreasonably long and the break of the single action pull is excellent.  Recoil is snappy due to the light weight, but manageable.  I've put about 300 rounds through it, and carried it some, and it is an excellent inexpensive carry or backup pistol.  I much prefer this over a Kel Tec or something similar.

Just to clarify for people not as familiar with this  caliber; while this gun is technically a 9mm, 9x18 Makarov and 9x19 Luger are two separate calibers that are not interchangeable.  While it is unlikely you'd find Mak ammo at the local Walmart, it is pretty common at gun shops across the state, and can be found easily online, with the cheap steel cased stuff being comparable to cheaper 9mm Luger in price at about $15 for a 50 box before shipping if you shop around (current 3/6/14 price,) and slightly less if you buy in bulk.

Serious inquiries only.  Firm on price, lowballers ignored.  I'd be happy to answer questions only if they haven't been covered here already, and can provide additional pictures to a potential buyer.  Face to face cash transaction with a Vermont ID. Must be legally able to own a firearm and be willing to sign bill of sale."
