 Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 Rifles
 With four models from which to choose, the Bushmaster Dissipator Carbine AR 15 rifles are specifically configured to disperse hot gases and making shooting easier. With your choice of a Solid Stock or Tele-Stock, all models have 16” heavy profile barrels and are chrome lined in both chamber and bore for seriously long-lasting reliability. Chambered for the .223 Remington round, these rifles can also handle the powerful and popular 5.56mm NATO cartridge.
 Unlike other carbines, the Bushmaster dissipater Carbine AR 15 rifles have air vents and internal heat shields on the hand guards, which are constructed of a thermoset polymer composite. Seriously accurate and high-performance, even the most discriminating gun buff can appreciate the quality of these Bushmaster AR 15 rifles."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a BRAND NEW, factory fresh and hard to find Ruger LCRx .380 special revolver with their new SA/DA trigger. 

I have just one in stock, and have it priced to sell for just $419.00 (cash price). 

Ruger 5430 LCRx .38 Special Revolver, 5-Round, Single/ Double Action, 1.87 Inch Barrel 

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. announces the introduction of the LCRx™, the newest variation of the revolutionary Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR®). Chambered in .38 Special +P, the LCRx™ features an external hammer that allows it to be fired in single-action mode. 

“Since its introduction in 2009, the LCR® has become extremely popular with conceal carry customers seeking the simplicity of a revolver,” said Chris Killoy, Ruger Vice President of Sales and Marketing. “Customers have been asking for a traditional double-action version of the LCR® with an external hammer for optional single-action shooting. We were listening and have added a crisp single-action mode to the already smooth double-action LCR®,” he concluded. 

The newest LCR® maintains all the features of the critically acclaimed original LCR®. Its double-action-only trigger pull is uniquely engineered with a patented Ruger® friction reducing cam fire control system. The trigger pull force on the LCR® builds gradually and peaks later in the trigger stroke, resulting in a trigger pull that feels much lighter than it actually is. This results in more controllable double-action shooting, even among those who find traditional double-action-only triggers difficult to operate. 

The LCR® has three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. When originally introduced, the Ruger® LCR® revolver was one of the most significant new revolver designs in over a century, and it has since been awarded three patents.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a BRAND NEW, factory fresh and hard to find Ruger SR-762 AR-10 .308 win semi-auto rifle!  This awesome new rifle from Ruger features Gas Piston operation for cooler and cleaner operation.  It comes complete with 3 20-round Pmags and a zippered soft case.

Ruger 5601 SR-762 .308 Win Rifle, Gas Piston Driven, 16 Inch Barrel, 20-Round

The Ruger SR-762 brings the downrange authority of the .308 cartridge to the popular SR-556 family of two-stage, piston-driven, AR-style rifles. The SR-762 is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is an ideal rifle for those who appreciate the familiar and ergonomic AR-style platform. The .308 Win/7.62 NATO cartridge is perfect for hunting medium and most large-sized game and enhances the capability of the AR-style platform in defensive or tactical roles. The SR-762 retains the features of the original SR556 that make it a solid performer among AR-style rifles. 

It comes with a Manganese Phosphate/Hardcoat Anodized finish and a precision-filed, chrome-lined, cold-hammer-forged MilSpec 41V45 chrome-coly-vanadium steel barrel. It comes with a round, smooth-sided Ruger Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver that features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail. It also has a Hogue Monogrip pistol grip and comes with three 20-round Magpul PMAG magazines, a soft-sided case, and three finger-grooved rail covers.

We have tested kevlar sleeves and various “bed liner” products from herculiner, Line-X, and “generic” version.  TTM, LLC has come up with a PROVEN method for fragmentation protection!  By using a blend of Rhino Liner “Tuff Grip”, combined with a non-standard type of primer, TTM, LLC has become an “Industry First” for mitigating fragmentation problems associated with steel plates!

Check out the demonstration video and you will see how effective our solution actually is.  We are excited to announce our potentially “life saving” breakthrough!  We have tested our plates over and over again and we are extremely confident in our solution to fragmentation protection!

The strike face for our plates is marked embedded with our Spartan logo!  Both sides of these plates are coated, however, the back side only has a “courtesy coat” to protect against wear and rust.  The front of the plate  is lined with 1/4″-3/8″ of Rhino’s “Tuff Grip”, along with our unique primer.  Without this specific primer, the Tuff Grip is not nearly as effective and has broken apart during testing.

By purchasing, you will receive (2) Formed 10″x12″ chest plates.  Please select from the drop down is you wish to add FORMED (either 6″x6″ or 6″x8″) side plates.  

As with all of our Abrasion Resistant 500 Omega Armor products, we only use LAB CERTIFIED Abrasion Resistant 500!  All purchases of Abrasion Resistant 500 Omega Armor products will come with a lab certficate.  Remember, not all body armor is created equal!  Read our “FAQ” to find out more about Omega Armor!

I have a three month old Ruger American Rimfire rifle for sale. I can't say enough good things about this rifle. I'm only letting her go because I just bought the same gun in 22 magnum. These are the best value in 22 bolts around. It's almost embarassing that Ruger sold the 77/22 for the last 20 years at 3x the price! The Ruger American feautures beautiful actions, target crown, deep blueing, free floated action and barrel, Adjustable ""accutrigger"" kind of trigger only better. They use the tried and true ruger 10/22 rotary mags. They come with two different buttstocks which swap by only undoing the rear swivel stud. Great gun for the money. This particular one is the 22"" full size model in 22LR. I have Weaver #12 mounts on the receiver along with Warne Tactical optima rings. A brand new Nikon Prostaff rimfire scope. This is the newer model that comes with thumb adjustment knobs that stay put and a rimfire 50-200 yard bullet drop reticle. I also have a total of two 10 shot rotary mags and two Ruger bx25 25 round mags. A mag tricoupler is also included. I know you all love to haggle so there's a bunch of ways to do this. If you just want the rifle we can do that too. I have over $575 invested in everything, but again even at only 80 rounds I do understand that it's considered used. I'd sell the rifle, weaver mounts and a soft case for $250. Thanks for looking!

The Alessi holster in the last picture will go with the gun for an additional 50.

I bought the gun for my wife, unfortunately she lip wrists it on occasion and then cannot always clear the jam due to how stiff the recoil spring is. It has never jammed on me. The included belt holster is one I made, but never worked out all the issues with once it became clear that she should not carry the gun. It holds the gun fine, and you can tuck your shirt in with it. However it sits a little deep in the wast band and has some cosmetic damage from not being dry enough when I started to wax the leather. Due to how it is designed it would not be hard to fix how it rides in the wast band. It is made from hard rolled horse hide (which is what Kramer Gun Leather uses)."

As I have heard it, there were only about 500 of these ever brought into the country.
Rifle has a heavy barrel with a 1/7 twist, flip up night sights, chromed bore, an adjustable gas system, bolt hold open, and an AR style flash hider. Will come with 7 mags, two sets of furniture (original wood with custom pistol grip, and Hogue handguard set-does not come with US Palm grip), and a soft paratrooper case.
That was the good, here's the less good. The receiver is an NDS and was not finished to the same standard the Yugo parts were. It could probably use a cerakoting if you want it to look like a display rifle. Otherwise, it's a good shooter, very accurate with the barrel."

Korean War vintage, HAS NEW BARREL. Very accurate, has been shot less than 25 times with new barrel. All METAL is in EXCELLENT SHAPE. 

WOOD is VERY GOOD, no reals dents or scratches and is solid (no cracks or bad places). Wood needs refinishing only. 

This gun is set up to be a shooter, not a collector. I have had it checked out by a gunsmith, and it is SOLID. I have shot it and it handles and functions well. 

These guns routinely sell for about $1,000. After talking to some local gun shops, I believe this to be a fair price. 

Photos will be sent to interested parties. Just respond and I will send them.

The brass has not been processed beyond the cleaning phase. Some may be slightly tarnished, which I try to sort out, but the majority is beautiful. I will add a liberal amount extra just to make sure you are satisfied.

About 85%+ of this brass is LC headstamps, but cannot guarantee that you get any at all. All of the LC headstamps that I have inspected still have the original crimped primer still in place. There are simply too many for me to hand sort them all. All brass is bought as ""once-fired"", although I cannot guarantee that it is. If any appear to have been reloaded, I remove them. (For the record, I haven't found any yet)

Shipping IS INCLUDED in all prices. They are as follows

250 casings - $30 Shipped

500 casings - $55 Shipped

1,000 casings - $95 Shipped

I have several thousand available. If you prefer ALL LC heastamps, email me and I will have to add a [small] amount extra to make up for my time.

I accept USPS Money Orders, PayPal, or cash FTF (Located in Lake County FL). I will respond quick to an email.
