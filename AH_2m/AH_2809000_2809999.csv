125,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2809125,For Sale/Trade:  Rare Thames .32 Nickel Revolver,"greenville, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, March 21, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Rare Thames Arms, nickel finish, double action revolver. Last Pat. Sept. 30, 1902. Serial# 3591 on frame and cylinder. In .32 S&W caliber. Condition very good, top break, auto eject. Original nickel finish worn in spots but generally very good. Original case hardening still visible on the hammer and triggerguard. Excellent original grips. Very tight lock up and functions very well. Here is what I have been able to glean about Thames Arms from the internet: The Thames Arms Company was originallyincorporated as The Thames Chain & Stamping Company on August 28, 1896. On September 21, 1900 the name was changed to The Thames Arms Company. They sold exact copies of the Hopkins& Allen revolvers and therefore it can be believed that Thames Arms Company was created to sell Hopkins & Allen made guns to other than Merwin, Hulbert & Co. Anyway, Thames Arms Company figured already as of 1885 on some top break revolvers and on some solid frame XL revolvers of H&A. Therefore its origin was likely a trademark of Hopkins & Allen. One more argument is that they utilized the J. Boland (assigned to H&A) and G.W. Cilley's patents as well as of much other patents granted to H&A or its stuff."

Trader must be willing to meet in Cedar Rapids, so we can each try each others sight at the range, on my AR-15, using my ammo.

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back. Zeal will change your life.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull.

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back. Zeal will change your life.

Rifle is in 98% or better condition. Note: This is not the Standard Patrol Model or SPM16. New STD16's do not come with a rail system, fore grip or ambi sling adapter and retail for $1594.18. I've seen them advertised for around $1350.00 new online but they don't come with the upgrades. If you don't like the upgrades and just want the standard equipped rifle, I could put the original furniture back on it and sell the rifle alone for $1000.00.

The TDI Arms X6 is the World's First 6-Rail System for M16/AR15/M4. It provides a 100% secure fit that does not restrict barrel movement and adds 4 MIL-STD 1913 handguard Picatinny Rails and 2 Front Sight mini rails. 

The Aimpoint is not included. It is on another gun.

I love this gun but it's just another carbine length AR. I am open to offers for other AR's plus cash or may do a straight up trade if you have something I like.

My interests are mil-spec lower guns only. No plastic or carbon guns. I am specifically interested in a mid-length instead of carbine length gun with 16"" barrel with bayonet lug. I can also add cash, ammo, or mags if it's something I really like.

If you have something I like, this may be a good opportunity to trade up. I know the value of this gun in its current configuration is close to the $2K mark if you went out and tried to buy one new retail. So you have to ask if saving over $500 for a slightly used one is worth it to you. Your $950 gun may be more valuable to me if it's what I want. Please let me know what you'd like to trade. I am not a dealer. I am a private collector. No taxes, no paperwork, no documentation required. I will travel to you for the right deal. Please send offers for mil-spec AR's only. I don't want TV's, cars, jewelry, handguns, etc. Let's keep it in the same ballpark please."

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it.

I have been a professional dancer for the past 32 years and a shooter and prepper for the past 25 years and have used and been on every product and gimmick on the market. I found the very best product for nutrition, energy and overall health benefits about 2 years ago. It is called ""Zeal"".

   One of my students introduced it to me 2 years ago when I was getting tired during coaching sessions. I started using it and after a couple of days, I could tell a huge difference in how I felt. I had more energy and just felt more alive. I now teach 8,10, 12 hours a day and dance 4 hour sessions when we are at competitions with my students. All of our competitors are walking around drinking 5 hour energy drinks, sugar water and all kinds of other homemade drinks and they all have a hard time finishings the sessions. Do they know about Zeal, NO. I can't give away my advantage until I stop competing. LOL!

If you are prepping for a disaster or the Zombie Apocalypse, Zeal is the best whole food nutrient and will last for years. It will get your body healthy and ready and keep you in top shape for when it arrives.  

Zeal Wellness contains some of the most nutritious ingredients on the planet--many of which are missing from the average diet. Rice bran, aloe vera, goji berry extract and the ingredients found in our super oxide dismutase blend are among the nutrients in Zeal Wellness believed to be the keys to health and vitality. Zeal Wellness is an all-in-one formula designed to provide your daily nutritional needs. It is a synergistic blend of whole food concentrates that enrich, restore and protect your body at the cellular level. Zeal Wellness contains no artificial colors, sweeteners or preservatives.

I have been taking Zeal for the last 2 years and have not felt better.  It is the very best nutritional whole food wellness drink that I have ever tried and I am totally sold on it. 

If your interested in learning more about Zeal or would like to try it, check it out at: leeharpe.zealforlife.com or email me back. Zeal will change your life.

610,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2809610,For Sale:  RWS Model 54 Air king .177 with Hawk 4x12  Air gun scope 475. or trade,"South Martinsville, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 475,"Listed On: Friday, March 14, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This Rifle is in very good condition.Has had about 300 shots through it.It is a tack driver.

The RWS 54 Air King is a recoilless sidelever rifle based on the action of the RWS 48/52 series. By floating the action on rails, RWS takes the rifle's powerful recoil and significantly reduces the amount you feel. It also enhances accuracy, because the pellet exits the barrel before spring vibration is transmitted to it.

Our .177-cal. RWS 54 Air King has the TO5 trigger. The .22-cal. model has the TO6 trigger. Both are 2-stage adjustable triggers and have an excellent reputation.

The 54 is dressed up in a Monte Carlo beech stock with a raised cheekpiece. For better control, RWS added checkering to the grip and forearm. The changes in the stock configuration make an already-great gun even better. Truly, this is a competitor's dream come true! Loading is done through a sliding breech mechanism. Like the 48 and 52, this rifle can be used for field target, plinking, hunting, target shooting and spinners. This sidelever spring-piston rifle is popular among airgunners who truly want to win at whatever they do! To get the most accuracy from this powerhouse, mount a scope. It'll come in handy, whether you're shooting at field targets or quarry."

I am a Federal Firearms Licensed dealer. All sales are done in accordance with Federal, State, and Local laws. All prices are final/Out the door. I am available by appointment only. Please feel free to Call/Text/Email me for questions or to set up an appointment. I do not keep a large inventory on hand. What I do have can be made available upon request, or check out my other ads. If I don't have what you may be looking for in stock, let me know what you want. I do pay to order on any firearm that is in stock with my suppliers as well. This gives you the opportunity to get the firearm(s) of your dreams at much less than Retail prices. Let me know what you are looking for I will give you a price quote. I will assure you it will be much less than anywhere else.
Again ALL PRICES ARE FINAL/OUT THE DOOR. Taxes, fees, etc. are figured into the price you see. Please feel free to check and compare my prices with anyone else. 
Also I do consultations for personalized/built to order AR style rifles. I have found in my 10+ years of Law Enforcement firearms training and instructing that no AR commercially made is made to exactly what the operator really wants. So comes the expensive task of ordering extra parts on top of an already expensive weapon, Thanks 2nd amendment hating Liberals. So I decided several years back that why buy a fully operational firearm and then purchase expensive add-ons on top of that to get the perfect rifle for you, when you can get all the pieces ordered and assembled for almost as cheap as the stock rifle originally was. That is where I came up with the personalize AR concept. I will meet with you anywhere, within reason, and that has WiFi to discuss what you want in an AR style rifle. You have a choice all the way down to the springs of your takedown pins. After getting all the parts you want together I will assemble and test fire the weapon before delivery. I will keep you up to date via email or text message showing you the progress of the weapon. Most generally it would be finished within 24 hours of receipt on all parts. 
You cannot beat a deal like that for an AR style weapon.
I am a certified AR style weapons Armorer/Inspector/Assembler. I also am a Glock Law Enforcement Certified Armorer/Inspector, as well as a Law Enforcement Certified weapons Armorer/Inspector of shotguns; to include models from Remington, Mossberg, Benelli, Winchester, and Kel-tec.
My certificates are available for review upon request."

From Barrett:

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter"

Also I do consultations for personalized/built to order AR style rifles. I have found in my 10+ years of Law Enforcement firearms training and instructing that no AR commercially made is made to exactly what the operator really wants. So comes the expensive task of ordering extra parts on top of an already expensive weapon, Thanks 2nd amendment hating Liberals. So I decided several years back that why buy a fully operational firearm and then purchase expensive add-ons on top of that to get the perfect rifle for you, when you can get all the pieces ordered and assembled for almost as cheap as the stock rifle originally was. That is where I came up with the personalize AR concept. I will meet with you anywhere, within reason, and that has WiFi to discuss what you want in an AR style rifle. You have a choice all the way down to the springs of your takedown pins. After getting all the parts you want together I will assemble and test fire the weapon before delivery. I will keep you up to date via email or text message showing you the progress of the weapon. Most generally it would be finished within 24 hours of receipt on all parts.

(2) ASC 25 round desert 6.8 spc magazines 

Rifle has a low round count and is in excellent condition. The 6.8 round can fit into regular ar mags but due to it being a wider round it can only fit around 15 before the mag starts to bulge. The spc was developed by the military for special forces who needed more knock down power than a 5.56 but less than a 7.62. The round is excellent and the only down fall of it is that it's only been around for 10 years so the rounds aren't as cheap as a 5.56 but then again it's in mine and most others opinion a much better round! If u have any questions about it just let me know and I'll try to answer them the best I can?"

Its in great shape and has a chromed and polished slide and barrel. Been fired very little, comes with one Mec Gar magazine and its box. These guns can not be beat in size and weight, they weigh only 11 oz's loaded and is one of those guns that you WILL forget you're carrying in your pocket. Say what you will about Kel Tec's but the trigger is far superior to a Ruger LCP's, smooth and consistent all the way through.

I picked it up as a summer time pocket carry gun which I've had no problems doing with it, but I'd like to consolidate my caliber's and get something similar in 9mm. I'd like to trade for a Kel Tec PF-9, Gen 2 SCCY CPX-2, Beretta Nano, Taurus 709/740 or possibly a Kel Tec P-11 or Ruger LC9.  Might also consider a snub .38 special revolver. 

Can add 50 rounds of FMJ and 25 rounds of Hornady FTX HP's for 9mm ammo or for the right trade.  May add some cash for the right trade.
Will sell with the ammo for $260, .380 ammo isn't cheap so I'm pretty firm on the price.

I have my CCL, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers. Texts preferred as I sleep during the day but I will get back to you ASAP if I'm interested.

The smallest back strap is integrated in the Glock MBS frame reducing the
trigger distance of the standard size frame by approximately .08"". The
medium back strap adds approximately .08"", equaling the size of a standard
frame, and the large back strap increases trigger distance by a total of
approximately .16"". The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is enlarged and
reversible, which allows users to switch the catch to the left or right
side of the pistol with no additional parts. Internally, the original
recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The
dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the felt recoil while
simultaneously increasing the life span of the assembly. Additionally, the
Gen4 has a Rough Textured Frame (RTF) surface designed to enhance grip
traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back
straps.

I purchased it from 2nd owner, pistol is all original with an idiot mark (compliments of the 2nd owner) some small scratches on the slide from normal use. I'd rate this pistol a 99, only because it's used. I've shot the pistol a few times and can consistently place 10 out of 15 rounds in the X and 10 rings at 25 yards.. NO TRADES, local only.
