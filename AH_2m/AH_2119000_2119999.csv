It's not a pretty car, the paintjob looks like rhinoliner, and the top is faded, and plastic is cracked; however, the ragtop works, but the two rear sharkfin windows do not. However, it runs (though overheats and looses coolant), the transmission synchro is finicky for 4th gear and just a hodgepodge of hatred. The block isn't cracked, as I've drained and checked the oil for signs of water, and there are none. It's ugly, I don't like it, but I guess its perk is that it's pretty fast for what it is.

The stock is the correct high wood IO and ordinance bomb marking, high wood, ""Fat Boy"" grips, no circle ""P"" but con be found. Overall the carbine still rates 90-95% with a very crisp bore and strong rifling. Call Randy with any questions you might have, this will be the best Paratrooper you will ever see that is on the market and not in a collection or museum already! We believe this carbine would go for more than our asking price (plus Buyer’s Premium!) if it were to go to auction. The carbine comes with one original magazine and a green canvas GI sling, no other accessories"

http://www.nikonsportoptics.com/Nikon-Products/Scopes/6421/Buckmasters-3-9x40-Matte-BDC.html

- Graco Corporation Gracoil recoil reduction system. This is an aluminum butt plate system that utilizes a slide piston with adjustable tension to limit recoil. Adjusts from 14lb all the way to 70lb. This makes it perfect for the big kicking gun. These are more typical on large shotguns but Graco made this model specific for big cal rifles.
http://www.graco-corp.com/products/model-number-gc15r

- Muzzle Break fabricated and installed locally by Rich at High Tech Customs

This rifle is a big gun but shoots with limited recoil due to the butt plate and the muzzle break. I can shoot this all day without my shoulder hurting and I have used it for everything from antelope to big elk and it will take down anything. It's actually a great round for smaller big game like antelope. The high velocity round combined with a light bullet blow right through antelope without leaving a large exit wound like some smaller rounds like .243, or ,270.

The .300 win mag is a perfect round for all Colorado hunts. I have well over $1300 into this rifle and it is in good condition and shoots great. Reaches out to at least 600 yards.

First is an ArmiSport 1861 Springfield.  Never been fired by me, and I believe the previous owner only used it for reenacting.  Very clean, stock has been refinished to be more period correct.  The front sling swivel is missing its retaining rod, but I have the swivel itself.  The replacement part is about $5  Comes with bayonet with correct locking ring (Actual quality, not the indian crap thats so prevalent nowadays).  Great gun, I just never have a need to use it.  

Asking $750 for the musket and bayonet.  And ill throw in a repro (mainstream) .58 cartridge box (no strap) with tins

Second is a reproduction flintlock.  Maker unknown.  I got it at a show about  year ago and have never done anything with it.  Beautiful tiger stripe stock, Clean bore, Very nice action.  Frizzen could use a rehardening (throws sparks about 50% of the time.)  It does have a high touch hole, but the gentleman I bought it off of said he never had a problem with it.  

Asking $450

Buy both for $1100 and save $100

I am also willing to trade with $ for origional German Gewehr 98's and K98's  I would prefer non captured and no import marks but im willing to consider anything.  Im also always on the lookout for WWI and WWII german gear/helmets (in particular M16) and awards.  email me what we have and we'll talk."

http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/2009/10/healthways-plainsman-bb-gun-part-1.html

I wanted to title this report Americana, because that's what it really is. But when someone on the internet wants to research their gun, the model is the only thing they are interested in. Make no mistake, though--the Healthways Plainsman is Americana, as much as Dad's Root Beer and Buster Brown shoes.

Unlike the Daisy Red Ryder that everyone knows by name, the Healthways Plainsman is the BB pistol that almost everybody knows on sight, without knowing what it is. It's about as ubiquitous as the Marksman 1010 BB pistol, but most of you may have to think about it for awhile. And showing you a period ad may stimulate your memories.


A Plainsman ad from 1965. They called the gun semiautomatic because you just keep pulling the trigger to fire. Actually it's double-action.


I DID NOT go to Roanoke to buy a Plainsman! In fact, I have assiduously avoided the Plainsman for the past 20 years. Before that, I wasn't a writer, so my avoidance was private and didn't count. I have blogged Chinese spring guns. I have blogged Marksman BB pistols. I have even blogged Wamo cap-firing BB guns that have less power than thrown BBs. So, why was I avoiding the Plainsman? No good reason. I just was.

In fact, this is a great little BB gun that I actually shot in my youth. My favorite relative was Uncle Don. He was a man's man. Whenever we got together, he got out his guns and let me shoot. One summer I spent a couple weeks with him and Aunt Gert on the shores of the St. Lawrence River. There, he introduced me to his Plainsman. It shot fast and hard--two things a 12-year-old boy likes. I went through so much of his CO2 that he had to put the brakes on and get me fishing to slow me down.

But I never owned one of these pistols myself; and when the time came to get airguns, I went other ways. In this report, I want to discover what I missed--right along with you.

I stumbled across this pistol on Mike Ahuna's table at the Roanoke airgun show last weekend. It was in the box and included an owner's manual, sales receipt (without the year of sale, unfortunately) and several other papers associated with both the gun and with Numrich Arms (the former name of Gun Parts Corporation), where it was sold. I've seen plenty of other boxed Plainsmans--there was even one at this show--but the condition of this box and papers caught my attention. The gun sang to me!


The Plainsman box looks like a big smile to me. It looks happy, and it makes me feel happy to look at it.


The timeframe
I've found ads for the Plainsman pistol as early as 1960 and as late as 1969. With just a quick check, let's assume I missed some and extend that by a couple years on both ends. The owner's manual that came with the gun is dated 1957, which may be the first year of release. The earliest price I've seen in 1960 is $14.95.

On the late end of the run, there would have been new-old-stock guns for sale for several years after they stopped making them, so they no doubt were sold well into the 1970s. But companies like Daisy were putting pressure on the market with newer guns made of plastic and having the same features and more modern profiles. The final price I saw in 1969 was $18.95.

Who?
Pat Pending must have been a prolific airgun designer, because we see his name on so many guns from the 1950s and '60s. Seriously, that was a dodge used by many companies to avoid the costly fees and time spent in getting patents. Many of the guns that say Pat. Pending have nothing patentable in them. I'm not saying that's the case for the Plainsman, but I sure am hinting at it!

Description
The pistol is all metal with plastic grips. It resembles a Colt Woodsman in shape, though its grip is larger than a Woodsman grip. The trigger works with or without CO2 in the gun and has a smooth, light two-stage pull, though stage two is somewhat long. The gun weighs 29.3 oz. The smoothbore barrel is six inches long.


Plainsman on top and Colt Woodsman on the bottom. The Plainsman is a little beefier than the firearm.


The Plainsman uses 8-gram CO2 cartridges instead of the 12-gram cartridges of today. In its day, more guns used the smaller cartridge, so it didn't seem so strange. Today, however, you can buy these vintage small cartridges here at Pyramyd Air, so there's no reason not to shoot your vintage gun.

Adjustable power
The Plainsman comes with adjustable power. There are three power settings. A coin-operated screw at the bottom of the grip selects each setting, and the detents are stiff enough that there's no question where you are. Healthways didn't use velocity figures for their gun because at this time nobody had access to a chronograph. So, they stated power by what a BB would do to a tin can. Remember, when this gun was made, tin cans were actually made of steel. Don't confuse them with the soft soda cans of today. Think more of a stout soup can or a coffee can. On low power, where you got up to 100 shots, a BB would dent one side of a can at 15 feet. On medium power, you got 55 shots and the BB would deeply dent or pierce one side of a tin can at 15 feet. On high power, you got about 45 shots, and a BB would almost go through both sides of a tin coffee can at 15 feet.


Turn the screw at the top to the left (located at the bottom rear of the pistol grip) with a coin to increase power. There are three settings.


Healthways claimed an accuracy of 50 shots through a one-inch group (they say pattern in the manual) at 25 feet. That seems reasonable, and places it among the most accurate BB guns. I've seen accuracy like that from the Umarex Makarov, so I know it's possible.

The barrel is a thin steel tube, but it's encased in a metal housing that looks more substantial. In fact, everything about this gun looks and feels substantial.

When I researched this pistol, I learned that Healthways put out many different models. This pistol, for example, has a rifled counterpart that looks the same but uses nickelplated lead balls for ammo. And there's a single-action western model I admit to never having seen before, though I might have seen one and thought it was something else. It, too, had a rifled-barrel counterpart that shot lead balls. Finally, there's the Topscore spring-piston model that's fairly well-known, though I admit that I never shot one."

Zeiss Scopes

A century and a half of history backs the fine optical products Zeiss has provided from the city of Jena in Germany. Formed by Carl Zeiss and Ernst Abbe in 1855, Zeiss was the first company to design lenses through the scientific principles of physics and the wave theory of optics.

During the ravages of the second World War, Zeiss provided many of the optical products used by the German army - including periscopes, field glasses, and of course rifle scopes. A pair of Zeiss field glasses were famously used by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, and several hundred collectors claim to own that pair of field glasses.

With the division of Germany in the aftermath of the war, Zeiss split into the Carl Zeiss company in Oberkochen and the Schott Glaswerke in Mainz. Until 1990, the companies operated in a largely independent fashion, but within weeks of the reunification they united again under the banner of Zeiss Germany.

The innovations issuing from Zeiss attracted the most public and media attention in the scientific realm, with the creation of new telescopy and microscopy technologies, including major improvements to the electron microscope and instruments used in the space probe ""Galileo.""

Less noticeable, however, were the improvements Zeiss made to the military equipment - including some of the finest sniper rifle optics ever created, and excellent night vision accessories.

Zeiss scopes offer the same high-quality features you expect in a scope; O-ring seals, nitrogen fill for fogproofing, and truely waterproof seals. In addition, they offer the lifetime transferable warranty, allowing even secondary owners to retain the benefits of Zeiss warranty service.

When considering rifle scopes, Zeiss offers unparalleled quality; lower weight, increased fields of vision, and greater ranges of magnification are par for the course in every Zeiss product line."

This revolver is in excellent condition, very light wear on the cylinder and has a nice smooth action.  The rosewood grips contrast nicely with the satin stainless steel finish.  It also features a rounded trigger guard instead of the knuckle wracking square back guard found on many SBHs.  The barrel is 4 5/8"" (4.62) long and the revolver weights approx. 45oz unloaded.  The unfluted cylinder adds a little weight to help soak up the healthy recoil of the 44 Remington Magnum loads, though the gun has a nice natural roll when firing mag rounds which lessens the felt recoil.  It can also of course fire 44 Special rounds, which barely kick at all in this gun.  It has a low round count, about 200 rounds fired through it and it functions perfectly with excellent accuracy.  

It's a lot of fun to shoot target with and would also make an excellent side arm when hunting in areas where you might encounter a hog or, with a heavier load, it would make a great back up in bear country.  Ruger is known for making a great quality revolver, everyone always says they're built like tanks.  The Super Blackhawk's strength and durability makes it a great platform for handloaders.  According to some Internet research this gun was shipped in 2007 (not confirmed by Ruger).  Its a great shooting and a great looking single action gun.

The gun does NOT come with the ammunition in the picture (those are boxes with spent brass, and represent about half of all the rounds fired through the gun).  I will include a soft zip up pistol case with the gun.  $650 OBO cash gets you this great gun.  I really like this gun, but I prefer my SBHs in a little bit different flavor, longer barrel ect.  With that in mind, I'm really interested in is a SBH Bisley Hunter in excellent condition.  AMENDMENT:  I would also consider a Glock 20 Gen 4 or a Zestava, WASR or lower price project AK.  Let me know what you've got.  Email me with any questions you have or for additional pictures.  A low ball offer won't win this gun, but if you think you have a reasonable offer, message me, the worst I can do is say no thanks!

Buyer must sign a Bill of Sale, be able to legally possess a firearm and present a valid Texas ID or CHL.  Thanks for looking!"
