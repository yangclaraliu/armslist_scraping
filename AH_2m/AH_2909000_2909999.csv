Ruger's reputation for durability ensures you can load the hottest of .44 magnum rounds and fire them off without a hiccup until you run out of ammo or until your hand can't take it any more. This gun will outlast you. Comes with everything from the factory; hard case, lock and key, spent casing and owners manual. Along with the firearm, you will get a brand new Simply Rugged Sourdough Pancake holster ($120 value). As versatile as the gun, this quality leather holster can be worn OWB or IWB. The IWB straps are easily removable as is the hammer strap.

Good bore and wood, great shooter! Comes with 40 rounds of romanian 8mm ammo. Price is $650. Must pick up in Richmond KY, or can ship to your FFL on your dime. I would consider a PARTIAL trade on the SVT, which would be a nice MAK 90, a bulgarian SA 93, a Norinco type 56S AK or any chinese AK preban, or a 1969 or 1970 Russian AK parts kit with matching numbers. These are the ONLY trades I am interested in, thanks for looking and i can send additional pics to interested parties. Silly offers will be ignored"

The Egyptians had a ton of 8mm left over from when the Germans held N. Africa in the early 1940s.  Also included is the sling (aftermarket surplus) and a gas port adjustment tool.  The rifle uses a direct gas impingement system similar to the M16/AR-15 rifles, with the inclusion of a valve in the system that can be manually adjusted to control the amount of gas that is used to cycle the bolt.  The rifle has a detachable 10 round box magazine that can be fed by stripper clips.  The rifle will accept modified German 30 round magazines and a bayonet, though I have neither.

And no, It's not some airsoft junk,  it's the real deal.

When the situation is critical and lives are on the line, difficult conditions and awkward positions become your best friend and your worst enemy. Rapid reticle-to-target lock-on is a necessity, not a luxury - particularly when the target is moving, shifting, and evading your advance. The stakes are high - success is mandatory; this is why you're equipped with the  L-3 EOTech HWS. 

EOTech's holographic technology employs a laser to create a virtual image of a reticle pattern in the heads-up display window. The reticle's pattern is embedded in the window - there is absolutely no light projected onto the target plane. 

The HWS ensures significant gains in speed upon initial weapon presentation, and target-to-target shot placement. Seemingly effortless follow-up shots can be executed with unprecedented speed and accuracy. When deployed in CQB environments, the EOTech allows maximum peripheral vision by allowing the operator to take full advantage of a heads-up and both-eyes-open sighting technique. 

The EOTech HWS has been standardized by the DEA, ATF and FBI SWAT. Because the HWS employs a true heads-up display it is a leading choice of military units like Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. The HWS eliminates the blind spots, constricted vision, and tunnel vision that is associated with standard tubular sighting systems. It is battle-proven to withstand the abuse from harsh environments, high-powered weapon platforms, and the toughest military missions. 

The 552.XR308 HWS operates on a pair of AA batteries. The integral mount is compatible with Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny systems. The entire unit is submersible to a depth of 33.0', and its reticle is dedicated for use with .308 caliber ammunition - it offers hold-over dots for long-range shot placement. Additionally, The 552.XR308 is compatible with night vision devices (generations 1-3) - the holographic illumination system provides 10 brightness levels for use with NVDs.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 is available in three calibers – 9mm, .357SIG or .40S&W – offering you the choice that’s right for you."

A 13-year-old boy in Vernon, New Jersey was suspended from school last week after being accused of holding his pencil like a gun. Ethan Chaplin, a seventh-grade student at Glen Meadow Middle School, was twirling his pencil in math class when a fellow student suddenly yelled out, “He’s making gun motions, send him to juvie!”

Ethan was immediately taken to the principal’s office, suspended, and told he would not be able to return to school until he passed a psychological evaluation.

“I was shocked because I’m like, how am I not going to come back to school? I didn’t even do anything,” Ethan told News 12.

Despite telling school administrators that his classmate had been bullying him and was simply attempting to get him in trouble, Ethan says his comments were completely ignored."

GG&G Agency Single point attachment can be included if you want it. CeraKoted GI mag w/ MagPul anti-tilt follower in FDE. I'll throw in a Polymer mag as well.

The factory upper was changed out with a slick sided upper, the original gas block for a railed one (no idea why I did that), and the factory barrel shroud for a no-name free floating rail system. I wanted room for an angled foregrip AND the bipod.

These rifles are inherently accurate usually grouping 1-1.5 MOA with American Eagle range ammo. I used to shoot gophers/prairie dogs in New Mexico out to 200 yards in the desert without magnification. Round count is probably more than 500, but less than 1000. Weapon was field stripped each time I shot it and properly cleaned (even better than when I pulled armory duty). Barrel is 0.936"" in diameter, is crowned, no flash hider, non-threaded, 1:9 RoT. Very amusing to shoot at dusk.

This rifle is most as home shooting close and accurately, or further away with some magnification. It would be a great candidate for a Nikon 223 type optic or a Leupold Mark AR scope. Currently, I have a Burris Fix 5x AR-536 on it and it works fine. If you wanted a no frills predator or varmint gun, this one will fit the bill.

I'll consider trades, and I'll consider offers if you want it WITH the optic I have as well. I'll answer any written offer. Be local or close enough to make a drive reasonable."

603,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2909603,For Sale:  Noreen -- s 338 Lapua - Picatinny forend rail,"boardman, Ohio, United States","$ 2,500","Listed On: Sunday, April 6, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"NOREEN BAD NEWS .338 LAPUA !!!!

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.

The innovative Noreen Bad News 338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

Stepping up to the Sporter Series gives the piece of mind that the UL RSC (Residential Security Container) Rating against tool attack provides. A versatile DPX Storage System adds value and convenience.WHY CHOOSE A SPORTER SAFE?Sporter safes offer the quality, security and fire protection features expected from a Browning ProSteel gun safe at a price that is next to impossible to beat. A heavy 12-gauge steel body and rigid 1"" thick formed door with a Force Deflector Lock System. 2016 models include a 1400F/60 minute fire protection rating for additional peace of mind. The Cantilevered Modular interior and DPX door storage provide the most versatile interior found in a safe at this price - and above.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVERED MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine modules.
