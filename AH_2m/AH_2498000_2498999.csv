Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward."

I have a clean and clear title in hand 

The bike is a 1999 model Kawasaki Drifter 1500

The bike is not perfect, it runs and rides great but needs some cosmetic tlc. its spray painted a satin black which is faded, as mentioned below the bags arent finished and where i shaved the tail light on the rear fender the bondo/fiberglass is cracking so it would need to be gone over. the right grip is scrapped and the little knob on the front brake lever is broken of (fell over in my driveway)

Bike is full synthetic oil (engine and diff), has about 73k miles (not alot for these, they usually run 150k+)

It has been almost entirely blacked out (although faded), has a power programmer, vance and hines exhaust and k&n air filter. New agm battery and new rear tire jan 2013 (darksided it, rides fantastic and will last forever) Front tire should be replaced within a couple months of riding, not bald just starting to get there

I have added on a harley fairing outer in the front, it attaches to the headlight bucket and 2 supports to the 10in t-bars, i also have added flh harley saddlebag and custom brackets to hold them in place. I however have not finished fiberglassing over the shock to cover them on the inside but bag liners would do the same job, Also have not added hinges or lids yet."

NO EXPENSE SPARED! One year wait for these monsters direct from the Mastershop in Eckenforde Deutschland! We love the X5 competition for it's accuracy but wanted custom work and changes so had the Germans personally hand build two to our specs.. massive all stainless steel frame AND slide this monster is heavy! We had the geniuses cut down a 5"" steel competition slide to 4.5"" and mate the frame, build a massive beavertail upswept grip (larger than 1911), Checkered handgrip and trigger guard, complete melt treatment, magnum x5 funnel, xtended mag catch, ambi safety, combat no snag nite tritium sites (vertical combat), four 20 round custom mags, combat grips and wood presentation grips, fully adjustable trigger for length of pull, reset, and poundage factory set at 2.5 lbs w/ minimal reset, hand tuned competition internals and springs. Factory zeroed in Deutschland at 15 meters with 1"" groups. The rep of the x5 is as the most accurate semi pistol in the world; with these match hammer forged custom barrels these prove the point but at 4.5"" are a lot more manageable. All steel means heavy and negligible recoil. The slide say's P226 but is a misnomer.. these are thicker than a 226 and are not compatible. With custom internals and wider pistol recoil is completely sopped up. Waay to heavy to use as a carry pistol unless you wear a mackinaw, awesome competition pistol but really you would be better off w/ a straight factory x5... so what is the purpose? Only two made, beautiful pieces of art, more accurate than you will ever shoot, the most comfortable pistol you will ever pickup w/ perfect ergonomics."

Benefitting ""Lifting Up Lily""

It seems the older I get, more things become less and less important to me in the grand scheme we call life.

Theres no better time than the holidays for me to reflect on the people that are closest to me throughout my life, and the way my life may have turned out without them in it.

Nobody truly makes it alone.  It takes an entire family ... sometimes an entire community.

It is in this spirit that I find myself rallying to the cause of a complete stranger.

My FB acquaintance ... Lily Perkins (who is pregnant) ... has been diagnosed with a bone marrow disease.  The prognosis, especially for her baby is not encouraging.

Lily, however, has made the bold decision to avoid premature decisions regarding ending the pregnancy and will attempt to carry her baby to term and deliver.  Endangering her own life for the sake of her child - a brave move for a heroic parent.

Those of you who know me well know that I dont impress easily.  This one gets me!

Therefore I have put together a CONCEALED CARRY LICENSE SERIES OFF CLASSES dedicated to help support Lily and her family in her time of need.

All proceeds go to ""Lifting up Lily""

If you ever thought about getting you carry permit ... and support a great cause ... this is as good as it gets!

PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH EVERYONE YOU CAN ... THE MORE, THE BETTER.

TO REGISTER:  
Simply text your NAME & EMAIL  to REDACTED with the tag line ""Lifting Up Lily"" and youre in!!

Classes meet:

Description of the sight below.

The Elcan Specter M145™ is a fixed 3.4 power, 28mm Machine Gun Optic (MGO) that has been designed to engage targets accurately out to a range of 1200m.

PUMP ACTION SHOTGUN

I have only fired about 50 shells through it. it also has a trueglow sight on it. I originally bought it to go skeet shooting, but i never had been able to go. I am looking to sell the gun soon, to be able to buy a bow for hunting. I had purchased it for $375, I am looking to get at least $275 for it.

7mm Magnum Semi-Auto
Browning Bar Mark 2 Safari with the BOSS system. Excellent performing semi-auto 7mm Remington Magnum, likely the top performing one. Recoil is minimal (less than a 243) with the BOSS, but muzzle blast is loud. Detachable magazine. Gun has been kept in great condition (I am original owner) and has one small scratch on scope (that I painted black). Beautiful stock. Will only sell as a package because I have no other gloss finish guns for this scope and it matches this one perfectly. Its a Leupold 4-12x40 fine duplex that is unbelievably crisp and great in low light."

Info on the pistol below is from Wikipedia,
The Browning BDM was developed in 1991 by the Browning Arms Company, and unlike Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 Hi-Power model, was manufactured only in North America.

The pistol is a magazine fed, self-loading, hammer firing type which was designed with a trigger ""mode"" switch installed on the left-hand side of the slide (actually only a flush inlaid disk with a bisecting groove), toggling between double-action/single-action(DA/SA) pistol mode, and the double-action-only (DAO) or ""revolver"" mode—though, of course, other than the similarity of the trigger mode, the BDM has no resemblance to revolvers. This mode switch is what gives the handgun its name, with BDM standing for ""Browning Dual Mode"" or ""Browning Double Mode"".

Variants of the design lacked the mode operating switch, and so were either full-time revolver mode, model BRM (Browning Revolver Mode), or full-time double action/single action pistol mode, model BPM-D (Browning Pistol Mode Decocker). Finishes included blued, matte-chromed, which Browning advertising called ""silver chrome"", and a two-toned combination of a silver chromed frame and blued slide, called the ""practical"" finish.

The BDM and BPM-D variants have an ambidextrous slide-mounted safety/decocker lever, which when operated always returns the pistol to the hammer down double-action setting for the BDM variant or to the pre-cocked setting for the BPM-D variant. After the next fired cartridge cycles the pistol's slide, subsequent rounds are fired in the single-action mode, until the decocker is used to drop the hammer to the ""safe"" position. The BPM-D innovation was the inclusion into the action of the pre-cocked mode in which the hammer is partially cocked and the hammer spring partially depressed resulting in a first shot trigger pull that is shorter and lighter than in the true DA variants. The BRM variant lacks a safety/decocker lever, leaving the pistol in the hammer down ""safe"" double-action position after every shot, i.e. DAO.

The BDM and its variants utilize removable cartridge magazines, of the double stack variety with a capacity of 15 rounds of 9x19mm Parabellum ammunition. To comply with the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, BDM magazines were limited to 10 round capacity for civilian purchasers, although 15 round magazines were available for law enforcement use. After the 2004 expiration of the 1994 U.S. Assault Weapons legislation, 15 round magazines became legal and available in most states for civilian use."
