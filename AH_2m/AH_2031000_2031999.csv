The friend has moved so we are selling this. It may have been fired but if so it is hard to tell.

This is an Armalite, and not one of the new Henry versions. Metal finish is 100%, and the stock has a couple of very minor rub marks and a shallow scratch about 3/8 of an inch long. It is a sort of mottled camo stock, so I had to look very closely to find it.

If you have read this far, you probably already know what this rifle is. Originally developed as an Air Force survival rifle, it has probably starred as a ""sniper rifle"" used by bad guys almost as often as a Luger. The reality is that it is a practical truck or boat gun (it floats!), and is just a fun little 8 shot rifle. Rear sight is adjustable for elevation, and the front sight is adjustable in its dovetail for windage. With the barrel, action, and magazine stored in the stock, the whole thing is about 16.5 inches long. I can include a handful of .22 ammo so you can shoot it if you don't have any on hand. I have included a picture of it assembled, disassembled,  and with everything stored in the stock. It takes me about 45 seconds to store it or put it together.

This is not a Gas Operated Semi-Auto Recoil, but the prior ""Recoil Operated"" version, thus the ""R"" designator at the end of the model number.  This gun barrel was made to shoot 2 & 3/4"" and 3"" Magnum shells.

I bought this a few years ago thinking that I would fix it up, and never got around to it.  Basically, the previous owner put it back together wrong (internal springs and plungers were not aligned right) and shot it that way (once, oops), so the bolt and receiver were damaged.  
I do not think the receiver is repairable, but I am not a gunsmith either.  Some risks I'm not willing to take with a shotgun.  
What is still good, is nearly all of the other parts of the gun besides the bolt group.  Actually, the bolt ""Carrier"" still looks undamaged, but the bolt has a few splines broken off.  Firing pin looks OK too.
The wood stock and grip are nearly 100% of new condition.  
The vented rib barrel is still in pristine condition, and accepts all of the chokes made for it.   Was made to shoot 2 & 3/4"" and 3"" Magnum shells.

I bought a new trigger group for it back when I 1st got the gun, so that has been taken care of as well.
Comes with the original box.
I priced out just the barrel and the wood stock and grip and they were over $250 sold separately.

Asking $250 for everything.  

I own another A-500R for my own personal use.  It is reliable, and I love it.

http://www.guns.com/2013/08/22/breaking-safety-alert-for-all-smith-wesson-shield-pistols-video/

BREAKING: Safety alert for all Smith & Wesson Shield pistols…

Reports of distributors and dealers being told to halt sales of Smith & Wesson M&P Shield pistols are flying all over the Internet, leading many to believe a recall is pending.

Fortunately, it appears the problem could be limited. Smith & Wesson has posted a “safety alert” regarding a specific malfunction of the concealed-carry pistols’ triggers.

That being said, the flaw could affect any M&P Shield manufactured prior to Aug. 19, 2013, so it may be present on essentially every Shield ever made currently on the market.

“We believe this condition is largely limited to recently manufactured M&P Shield pistols. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are asking all consumers of all M&P Shields manufactured before Aug. 19, 2013 to immediately inspect their pistols for this condition.”

What’s happening is that in some cases, the pistols’ passive trigger safety is failing to engage even if there is nothing putting pressure on the trigger. Normally the safety would prevent the trigger from getting pulled except when it’s being handled.

In addition, pistols with a stuck trigger safety are not drop-safe.

“Smith & Wesson has identified a condition where the trigger bar pin could damage the lower trigger in certain M&P Shields in a way that may affect the functionality of the drop safety feature of the firearm, potentially allowing the pistol to discharge if it is dropped” explains the Smith & Wesson safety alert.

“Any unintended discharge of a firearm has the potential to cause injury, and we ask that you STOP USING YOUR PISTOL IMMEDIATELY UNTIL IT HAS BEEN INSPECTED AND, IF THE CONDITION IS FOUND, REPAIRED.”

If you have a Shield with this problem, you’re advised to send it back to Smith & Wesson for service. If you’re uncomfortable with performing the inspection procedure Smith & Wesson is asking that you take your Shield pistol to a local M&P certified armorer for inspection.

While the pistol does have a manual safety, the passive trigger safety has a long track record for reliability and safety, and is faster and easier to use in a stressful situation. Because of this, many people opt not to use it. For those people, the Shield effectively has no safety to speak of.

Of course, if you do have this issue with your M&P Shield, Smith & Wesson will repair it for you at no cost including shipping. They are expecting a five- to seven-day turnaround on all service.

The M&P Shield has been one of Smith & Wesson’s biggest sellers ever since they announced it. A slim, comfortable pistol designed for concealed-carry and backup use, the Shield has quickly risen to the top in terms of popularity, in part because they also have a great reputation for reliability.

Smith & Wesson has not explained what the root cause in the flaw is, it could be a missing spring or just improper fitment of the hinged trigger or trigger pin.

While this flaw does not affect their reliability in any way, it’s definitely a good idea to check your Shield’s trigger for your own safety and the safety of others."

Item Description: I have a Ruger SR9c I am looking to get rid of. I am looking to get a smaller carry gun and while this trusty beauty is not full size, it still is too big for me. It comes with 2 magazines (10 and 17rd with grip extension.) Also this is the model that came with the Crimson Trace Light, will not separate from sale. Gun will come with box of 9mm FMJ. 

Gun itself has had about 450 rounds through it with only 1 FTE. I now have to seriously get rid of this as some medical expenses have come up that I need to cover.

Practically new, I've only fired 4 boxes through it (200 rounds).
The 85FS Cheetah looks exactly like a smaller version of the 92FS (or military M9)
This pistol is light, fast handling, and ideal for personal defense. Its .380 Auto caliber is just right for those who prefer the light recoil and report of a higher caliber, smaller pistol. Very accurate out of the box, its ambidextrous safety is easily accessible by the thumb for right or left-handed shooters.
This is a high quality metal gun, none of that cheap composite crap.

CALIBER: .380 AUTO 
ACTION: DOUBLE AND SINGLE
OVERALL LENGTH: 6.8"" 
OVERALL HEIGHT: 4.8"" 
OVERALL WIDTH: 1.4""
BARREL LENGTH: 3.8"" 
SIGHT RADIUS: 4.9""

Included as a package with this sale:
3  magazines
16 boxes (50 rounds each) American Eagle .380 Automatic 95 grain metal case bullets. (800 bullets)
1 box (20 rounds) Federal Hydra-Shok JHP Personal Defense ammo (.380 Auto 90 grain)

The 80 series Beretta's, are a medium-sized blow-back design. All of the 80 series are DA/SA and the 'F' design added a de-cocker to the safety. The sights are clear and easy to use, and due to the size of this series, recoil recovery is rapid. Accuracy is substantially better than most .380's due to a longer sight radius and excellent trigger feel. Most people feel that the Beretta 80 series are the highest-quality .380 that has ever been produced. 
I bought this weapon because it perfectly matched my full sized 92FS but was just smaller and easier to carry concealed.

Price is cash only. I WILL NOT SHIP. Sales to OR or WA citizens only, and please have your driver's license or ID with you.

I can meet you in the Portland/Vancouver area

The Hogue grip feels like it is a part of your hand and the laser is bright and tight and accurate. I carry a 600.00 Springfield XD40 and would reach for this Hi-point as quickly as I would the Springfield. The original heavy slide blowback design of the Hi-Point makes them very reliable.

They carry a lifetime warranty with the Hi-Point company ..that is located in OHIO, I believe. They will honor the warranty regardless of whether you are the original owner or not, forever. No receipt required, send it to them, they fix it and send it back with any new applicable upgrades and a free magazine. The gun looks perfect and functions perfect.

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."

Lot prices start at $48,500 for 38 acres and can be very negotiable for the right buyer (neighbor). Overhead or underground electric power is on some lots and can be brought in on lots where it is needed. Land is located on CR 44 (Big Hollow Road), 3 miles N/E of Lake Hattie, 6 miles east from National Forest and just east of Wild Horse Ranch. This land is ideal for those who want to park an RV or build a cabin and enjoy beautiful vistas with very few man made objects within miles. Personally, we are using it for a bug out when the SHTF along with being a nice retreat to target shoot and enjoy the solitude. We would be particularly interested in having like-minded neighbors that would appreciate a place to stock up and feel secure if/when the SHTF. We can build a cabin onsite using classic log building techniques .. our prototype cabin built last summer is shown in the pictures. We also have a sawmill and logs onsite, along with general construction equipment to get your property easily and economically usable for your particular needs. Please note that drilling for water is a hit and miss ordeal in this area, but you can easily haul your own water just like most everybody else living west of Laramie, or have it commercially delivered for $90 per 1500 gallons. The City of Laramie also has two high volume water dispensing depots designed for rural residents. One depot is in Laramie and the other depot is at the water treatment plant which is 10 miles from the property. Bottom line is, hauling water and a cistern holding tank is far more economical and feasible for a getaway cabin. Water well, casing and pump is estimated to be around $20K and that buys a lot of water at $.25/100 gallons at the depots.I am a licensed civil engineer and have lived in Laramie 30 years. I have a local Laramie phone number and address. If interested, shoot me an email and include your phone number so we can talk about being neighbors. All pictures, with the exception of the ""big valley"" picture, are of the actual property available. The dirt road picture is of the private road that runs through the middle of the development. I look forward to hearing from you!"

 Blue book on these guns is $1,650-$1,100. The Carbines were made from 1968-1972 and only made 10,660 of the .243 caliber. Alot of them are in rough shape since they were a great youth gun and got a lot of abuse.
