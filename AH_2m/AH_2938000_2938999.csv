Bought it new. Shoots great and everything works. Only shot 100 rounds through it. Cleaned properly. Has the exterior hammer and shoots accurately in single action.
Wanting to sell because my girlfriend and I are getting our CCW and after shooting it a couple times at a gun range, she felt the recoil will be a little too much for her to handle shooting a hundred times for the CCW test. That's the only reason for wanting to sell it. Otherwise its a great gun! Comes with everything in picture.

Not mint, but definitely not junky.  A couple little cracks in the pearloid grips, but they'll probably hang together for a good long time.  A bit of scuffing on the edges of the slide, but no gouges or real damage.

Just an honestly used, nice little pistol.

I haven't shot it, and have no idea of its history or round count.  But, I've taken a bunch of pics - you'll have as good an idea as I do.

Having removed the slide to take pics and check condition, it looks like the little gun has been shot some, but nothing appears broken or worn out.  Everything seems to function just like it should. 

The only reason I'm selling this gun is that I'm just not really interested in it.  I had an FN 1906 that I really liked (and my daughter coveted...); but that's the difference in ""cool factor"" between a $125 gun and a $4-500 gun.   

Any questions, just ask - I'll be glad to answer or take more pics (hopefully I'll unpack my camera from all the boxes here and not have to settle for more cell phone 'fuzz-o-graphs).

Rather have cash than a trade, but wouldn't mind 6.5 Jap loading components and dies, Bullseye, Unique or Clays powder, .45, Makarov, or .355-357"" pistol projectiles, 1911, Ruger Mk I or II, G21 and Browning Hi Power magazines, or .22LR bricks (at a reasonable price).  Got something else?  Go ahead and ask - worst that'll happen is I won't be interested.

The serial number dates this one to 1975 manufacture.  It is all-original and appears to have been fired very little.  It's in great condition, with the only major flaw being the number ""615"" lightly inscribed on both sides of the gun.  It's a very light inscription, and might even be able to be polished out by a gunsmith without a refinish, but I'm not sure.  There are a few minor carry marks here and there...it appears to have been one of those guns that was carried occasionally, but hardly ever fired.  I've fired 50 rounds through it myself to confirm function and proper cylinder timing.  There are no mechanical issues.    

I'm asking $480 cash, which is what I have in the gun.  If this Detective Special were in  perfect condition, it would be worth about twice that."

Looking to get rid of this ammo as it is just taking up space as my .22 is picky and does not care for the winchester ammo. Purchasing/trading party must be of legal age!"

However if you were to get that you'd still be looking at $20+ for a pound of powder, $15 for the .454"" balls and $8 for the caps.

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

A coworker of mine was a Navy Corpsman, who got it from his Army buddy as payment for helping him paint a house. It was the friend's personal body armor when he was deployed in Iraq. The coworkers wife got pregnant for the 2nd time, so he was hard up for cash. That's how I got it. The vest comes with the 3A rated kevlar panels in front and back, but NO SAAPI plates come with it. Also has the kevlar shrapnel neckguard fitted onto it. Additional items are 5 pistol mag pouches fitted into the MOLLE webbing which fit any standard size double stack pistol mag. Also, 3 SMG mag type pouches that would fit an MP5/Uzi size mag, but I just kept 33rd Glock mags in them. When I was about 6' and 155lbs, this fit me comfortably as a small, but I've put on about 25 and an inch since then and small is too small now. It is adjustable to some extent, but my 180lbs leave a gap in the flank protection where the front and back armor overlap. I'm looking for 150 or OBO for the whole thing, but if you aren't interested in the mag pouches, I'm willing to take those off the price.

Made in the second year of production. Shaved bolt handle, and tapped receiver done at the factory. The way to tell the difference between original tapping and one done after is that original factory done did not mar the rifles model number. This is true m48, not a m48a, b, or Bo. This rifle has all milled parts. Only thing after market is low swing safety, timney adjustable trigger, and luepold scope mount. Original zrak mounts cost several hundred dollars, and are hard to find. The mount, trigger, and safety cost me over $200 on top of the rifle. You won't find a prettier example of a Mauser.

I am told that you can shoot .44 magnum out of these guns but I have never done it and this is the second one of these I have owned. Starline in Sedelia, Missouri makes brass for this amazing cartridge at a very reasonable price.

This one has the 8” barrel with the fluted shroud to make weight for the Production Revolver class in IHMSA competition.  There is at least one owner prior to me so I have no idea how many rounds have been fired through it but it does not appear to have been very many. I have fired about 50 rounds. Most of my hunting is with handguns but I seem to be gravitating to shorter barrels so this one is gathering dust in my safe.

According to my shipping scale the guns weighs, 4lbs and has some handling marks on it.  The trigger holds 3# but lets go before 3.5# on my RCBS trigger pull gage giving the clean break that the Wessons were know for. It has been drilled and tapped for a Burris Base and rings which are included in the purchase price along with a Hogue Monogrip, a set of Redding reloading dies (including a .44 caliber profile crimp die) and a barrel nut wrench that I made. I have some new Starline brass and a couple of Burris scopes that can be purchased separately. There is a 2X Burris in like new condition or a 1.75X4 Burris that has some paint missing from under the rings. Either scope can be added to the package for an additional $100.

There is no box or or original paper work. I have a copy of the large frame instruction manual that I downloaded from the internet that I can email or print out.

I am not a dealer. I do have the ability to accept a credit card through my business but there is a 3% up charge for that and must be completed prior to taking delivery of the firearm. I am willing to do some driving to complete the transaction with a serious buyer.

To complete the transaction you will need to provide cash, a valid Minnesota photo ID (drivers license), and either a Minnesota permit to purchase or a permit to carry. I will in return provide a bill of sale.

I prefer to be contacted by email. If you provide a phone number and best time to contact you I will call as soon as I can.

This is one you don’t see come up every day and when you do find one, it is usually the 14rd. model, not the 8rd., the 14rd. may or may not fit your hand comfortably because of the much larger grip size to accommodate the larger mags.  It has the fiber optic front sight, adjustable rear sight and comes in the box with ppwk and 2 – 8rd. factory mags.  Overall very nice condition with maybe a few boxes fired.  This model is no longer being produced, but here are the specs and stock photo from when it was being sold, retailed between $1,300-$1,400 and still holds it's value very well.  http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/para-ordnance-super-hawg-pistol-plx1445s-black-synthetic-grip-stainless    The only difference again is mine is the 8rd. model, which seems to be harder to find.

The optic is a Vortex Strikefire red/green dot.

It has a blem Aero Precision lower with PSA lower parts and buffer tube kit (I have a picture of the only blemish I could find on it, and it's nothing too crazy, I can email it to you). Has a Magpul trigger guard, Magpul MOE pistol grip, and a Magpul CTR 6 position stock. 

Like I said above, the only part on this rifle that isn't brand new is the trigger, and I can put a new one in if you'd prefer. To top it all off, the rifle will come with 4 brand new PMags in OD green, and 120 rounds of Federal American Eagle on stripper clips. 

The whole package is $750 firm. If it's not sold before the weekend, I'm going to keep it as I have a shooting day planned for Saturday. No trades, sorry. If interested, send me an email through Armslist or text me anytime at 316 737 82 eight five and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Thanks for looking!"

I got the Rhino described as unfired and that appeared to be the case when I went to clean it, but if it has been fired, it was very little.  I've yet to shoot it myself, but have read the recoil is very light because of the design, only selling/trading because I have several other .357 mags.  It was carried and has a some handling marks and a couple small spots in finish on the edges, you can barely see in the pic, I would still say overall excellent condition.

They came out of a box lot with no info on manufacture.  They mic consistently .308 and weigh between 127-128 grains.  In looking at the jackets I would not be surprised if these were done by hand or resized.   Regardless I suspect they're ""ancient"" and probably decent for plinking, especially in a 30-30 or reduced load .308.  Would prefer to move all.  I'm offering them for  $10/100 or take the whole lot for $65.  Would consider full or partial trades for other components."
