This a great rifle and a great shooter. Shot a deer dead on with it at about 320 meters this season. I have not zeroed it out that far, but have zeroed it at 200 m. The sniper stock makes it heavy, but because of that it has low recoil and very steady. I am willing to drive a bit, but not too far. We can always work something out.   $850.00 , OBO

(1,300 fps/M.E. 1,126 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box - Big Game up to 1000 lbs.","Azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Friday, April 4, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=50

Item 4B (300gr. JFN) is designed for super deep penetration at revolver speeds, but will mushroom and penetrate less deeply at rifle speeds. At handgun speeds you can expect a solid 3 feet of penetration in muscle and bone and at rifle speeds expect roughly 2 feet of penetration in muscle and bone. At handgun velocities, this bullet will act just like item 4A in living tissue. The greater velocities generated by the longer barrel of the rifle will cause the bullet to mushroom and that large mushroom will make a much bigger diameter hole in tissue, but that frontal area on the mushroomed bullet will cut down the depth of penetration.
You’ll note my below velocities form over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.
1.       Ruger Super Blackhawk with 6 inch barrel--------1330 fps
2.       Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch barrel-----------------------1334 fps
3.       1894 Marlin with 18.5 inch barrel---------------------1770 fps
Item 4B is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is NOT suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."

IWB holsters are now available in addition to our standard OWB products.

We can order kydex in any color you'd like; but we prefer to use .080"" or .093"" thick kydex because it is very durable. We don't want to worry about our products wearing out!

Standard options include: 
- Amount of cant (15, 10, or zero degrees are typical)
- Amount of curve applied to the holster (smaller waists need more curve, larger one's need less; most kydex manufacturers completely ignore this!)
- Amount of retention (Competition, standard or duty)
- Belt loop size
- Sweat-shield
- Color (at the moment black, grey, coyote brown, OD and royal purple are what I have on hand)

I will be placing another order for kydex and hardware this weekend so if you'd like a different color than what I have let me know! The color's I can order are listed here: http://www.knifekits.com/vcom/index.php?cPath=41_54_136

Typical turnaround time is 1 week if I have the colors you want.
I can deliver it directly to you if you are local to the Renton/Maple Valley area or I can ship it. Cost of delivery/shipping is included in the price.

IVORY BAN....BE AWARE
The current administration led by President Obama announced new regulations effecting the interstate sale of ivory. Plainly stated what this means is that very soon it will be illegal to ship ivory. What this means, if you want ivory you have to obtain it prior to the deadline. I am not absolutely sure what the deadline will be, but I am certain it will be sooner rather than later. Certainly within the next few months. If you have been thinking about ivory for any of your guns, now is the time to act. Once the ban goes into effect the chances are excellent that you will never be able to buy ivory again."

I lowered my price, and is now priced  below what I paid for it, and is much cheaper than what it is to order from anyone that I order ammo from online.  This can be verified by using ammoseek.  $0.5/round. The $0.06/round for buying separately is for the hassle of waiting for two people.  Im sure you can understand.

Cooper wrote: “The natural habitat of the general-purpose rifle is the field, the forest, the desert and the mountain -– not the shooting shed with its bench rest. To be really useful a rifle must be as short, light and quick to use as is technically compatible with adequate power and useful accuracy. What matters is not what the equipment can do, but rather what it will do in the hands of its operator under field, rather than laboratory, conditions.”

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.
