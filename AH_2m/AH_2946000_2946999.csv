Browning's pistol designs, the 1911 and GP35 or Hi-Power. 
Offered here for sale (not trade) is a fine example of a post war Hi-Power. This is a well maintained, fully functioning, original pistol with only one part replaced. Conservatively, about 90% + condition. This comes with one original, aluminum follower 13 round magazine. This has not been refinished or monkeyed with and has an intact magazine disconnector. It's been kept in a silicone gun sock when not in use and always cleaned and oiled after use. For me, it's functioned without flaws since the internal extractor (similar to a 1911) has been carefully tuned and replaced. Original extractor is included with the sale. Pistols of this age and quality are quite scarce and sought after by those who really like this pistol. As this is a tad below true ""collector quality"", yet in outstanding condition for it's age, you can still shoot it! Okay, here's what you really want to know: Price is $800, FIRM. NO-TRADES. Must have OHIO driver's licence, be willing to meet in Columbus or FFL to FFL transfer with you paying the shipping. You must be eligible to purchase a firearm and be willing to sign a bill of sale for my records. As always, you should have this pistol checked for safety by a qualified gunsmith before firing, however it's been flawless for me and I can offer no warranty, nor be held responsible should something go wrong. I'm not in the firearms business, just a shooter as I imagine you are as well. Please contact me if you're serious and I can try to answer any questions or arrange to meet up. Low ball offers/trade offers will be ignored, so please don't bother. If there's no interest, I will be posting on gunbroker.com in a few days."

For those of you who don't know, Mak 90's are sought after due to their semi collect-ability (none imported since '94) superior fit and finish, and thicker receiver and barrel, this being a straight cut receiver, is particularly desirable due it its compatibility with aftermarket parts compared to slanted receivers"

Some information I was able find online: 
The Model GZ (Modèle GZ), according to Josserand and Huon, was originally made in France, beginning on 1 January 1957, but the license was sold to Echasa (Echave y Arizmendi) in Eibar, Spain in 1962. I have a photograph of a French-made GZ, otherwise I might doubt it was ever made in France. The Model GZ is nearly identical to the Model G with the external hammer, but has distinctly different slide serrations. Some GZs have five broad, angled, square-cut slide serrations, while others have eight narrow angled square-cut serrations. Huon states that the GZ has an alloy frame. The Spanish GZ has an alloy frame, and was available in .22, .25, .32, and .380. The Spanish-made guns are clearly marked ECHASA. EIBAR (ESPAÑA) and MAB ESPAÑOLA on the left side of the slide, and some have MAB ESPAÑOLA on the grips as well. Production ended in May 1964."

NO New York City. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price, and with no additional shipping charges. This is Triple K’s 7 shot blue steel magazine for the excellent little PA-63 pistols, manufactured in Hungary by FEG, and imported by KBI and Century Arms spasmodically over the past 30 some odd years. The PA63 is very much patterned after the Walther PP, as the ad art photos show. Manufacturer is Triple K of San Diego, and recent production Triple K quality is top flight, ever since they retooled a decade ago. Construction is blue finished steel, with steel spring and heavy duty black polymer floorplate and cartridge follower. This magazine holds 7 rounds of .380 ACP caliber ammunition. Replacement pricing on factory PA63 magazines is upwards of $60 apiece in many areas. Our single mag price on the 2019M is $39.00 each. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $29 per. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE Magazines; buyers, however, may take any number we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Until the onslaught of pot-metal pistols like the current plague of Hi-Points began in the 1980s, cheap pistols were solidly and artistically made. Some of our photos show a sample that our photographer pirated somewhere. E.A.A., the old Eig Cutlery / F.I.E. Company continues part of that tradition of relative excellence today. These magazines fit the older Italian Made F.I.E. and Excam / Targa models E-22, E-22BW, and GT-22. They will not work in a Jennings J-22, or in a Walther PP .22, or in the cassette player of a 1974 Coupe de Ville. They will only work in FIE model E-22 Pistols, and Excam GT-22 Pistols. They are all steel, 10 Shot capacity, caliber .22 Long Rifle, never issued or sold. We found them in an old Midwestern warehouse, where they’ve been sitting since Excam went down the tubes 20 years ago and were only able to get a few of them. Manufacturer is Tangfolio of Italy, the original manufacturer of the good little pistols. Only the finger rest and followers are made of polymer. The pistols themselves work best with precision made .22 cartridges, like Aguila, Federal, or Winchester. In our experience, the E-22 type did not like Remington or CCI ammunition. Own one of these magazines for your old E-22 BW, and take some pride in that well made, formerly cheap pistol, because it excels its supplanter Jennings, High Points, and even Smith & Wesson 22-A for quality and workmanship. Single mag price is $24.00. We're offering these fine magazines in lots of 3 or more, however, at $19 each. Own 3 for only $ 57.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. Civilian residents of New York State are legally enjoined from loading more than 7 rounds into any magazine.

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE Magazines; buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Here are old stock factory magazines to fit the Davis Industries model P380 pistols like the ones showing in our photos. The Davis P380s, of course, were compact ancestors to the current production Hi-Point pistols. These magazines will not, however, fit the Hi-Point, because it is too short for those. This magazine will fit Davis Industries P380, Jiminez J380, Jennings Bryco 38, and identical pistols whose magazine well is exactly 3 1/8 inches from the butt to the closed breech on its under side. Take your magazine out of your pistol, leave its slide closed, and run a ruler up into the magazine well inside the grip frame. It should measure exactly 3 1/8 inches. These magazines will not fit a Beretta .380; will not fit an FIE .380; will not fit the slots on a Square D electrical breaker box. They will only fit the Davis P380 and its identical clones manufactured by Jennings, Bryco, and Jiminez whose magazine well is 3 1/8 inches deep, and that hold a magazine of this one’s dimensions: 3.35 inches measured on the perpendicular from the floor plate to the follower; 1.065 inches long on the outside; .450 inch thick; and that holds 5 rounds of .380 ACP caliber ammunition. Construction on these is steel body annealed to a pot metal floor plate, and with steel spring and an orange polymer cartridge follower as the photos show. These magazines were manufactured during the late 1990s. They have not been issued or fired or even loaded, but they have been stored together in bulk. Their bodies show some toning and tarnishing, and even some greasy residue in some cases. They are, however, all new but old stock. We were glad to find them in an old Southern Warehouse where they’ve been for over a decade. We have a Davis P380 that had not magazine, and some of our photos show it. Buyers will receive one of the magazines in the photos, or one from the exact same lot as the photo specimens. These magazines have been hard for us to find. When our present supply is gone, there won’t be any more. Single mag price is $35.00. We’re offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at $26 each. Own 3 for only $ 78.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

274,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2946274,For Sale:  .30 caliber barrel - Needs serious gunsmith work,"North side, Janesville, Wisconsin",$ 40,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 15, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For Sale – The sad result of a bad gunsmith job.  About 15 years ago, I purchased a Douglas barrel blank, and paid a local gunsmith to build a 30-06 on my FN Mauser large-ring action.  Well, he botched the sight installation, but the rifle shot pretty well, and I couldn’t do anything about it anyway, so I hunted with it for years.  Lately, I got the notion to re-bore and re-chamber to a larger caliber, so I sent it off to Oregon to a guy who specializes in that work.  When he removed the barrel, he discovered the original gunsmith had also botched the threading, leaving only 2 or 2 ½ threads to hold it on.  He advised that it was unsafe to shoot in that condition, and sent it back.  So, short version, we have a .30 caliber, 1 in 10” twist, 24 inch barrel, heavy contour (.75 inches at muzzle) that needs re-threading, rechambering, and maybe a new muzzle crown.  Not worth it for me to pay a gunsmith, but for someone with the tools and skills, this could easily make a nice .308 barrel.  I will ship anywhere in the US, but I’ll need your zip code to quote shipping and insurance.  Payment by USPS Money Order only, unless you’re local, and cash is king."

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
     This listing is for ONE magazine. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges.  Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #2018M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Czech Made Czeska Zbrojovka CZ-50 and CZ-70 Pistols chambered in .32 ACP or 7.65mm Browning Caliber, The 32 Automatic caliber. This magazine will NOT fit a Zastava Yugoslavia pistol, No Crvena Zastava; those are a different bird, a single action only Tokarev type pistol. The original CZ-50, CZ-70 is a very distinctive, Walther type pistol in double action. One of our Guns  _  America photos shows a comparison between the Czech Police Issue magazines with smaller finger rest and these, with extended finger rest. Any shoppers who are unclear on whether their CZ 70 is Yugoslavian or Czech should enter Go ogle terms Zastava model 67 70 Pistol Wiki or Czeska Zbrojovka model 50 70 and look at the photos. Construction is all steel body, springs, cartridge follower, and floorplate. This magazine holds 8 rounds of .32 ACP Ammunition. It will not accept .380 or any other caliber. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each	for only	$ 29.00.

Manufacturer: FN Herstal S.A. Caliber: 308/7.62 NATO Action: Semi-automatic Firearm Type: Rifle Flag |  Edit | Favorite 
FNH 17S units with 16"" chrome lined barrel (16k service life), aluminum receiver w/ 4 rails, flash hider, folding stock, collapsible, adjustable LOP, adjustable, comb, ambi controls w/ switchable charging handle, folding front rear FNH factory sights, five (5) factory 20 round matching magazines, Ranger edition laser cut case holds SCAR w/ folded stock and all accessories, rollers, matching FDE foregrip. The SCAR is delivered as a battle carbine with battle trigger which means they are horrific.. Special Forces unit armorers have replaced these units with Geissele units (select fire) from the beginning and cleaned up the interiors. That said Rangers are for the most part stuck with the factory units.. these upgraded SCAR units DO have Geissele trigger units installed; 2 stage with second release 2-2.5lbs enabling precision work. Shown with the Trijicon 6x issue ACOG. This unit is simply awesome with a BDC ballistic drop compensator out to 1200 meters.. target at 800? Put the ""8"" on it. 1200 meters away.. put the""12"" on target. Steel cap retention devices, distance/range use, red chevron, upper picatinny rail, fiber optics (adjustable) for day with tritium for night. Battery free, waterproof 100+ meters, dustproof. This system is an awesome platform but for room clearing 6x is too much

The laser has been mounted, but I have never fired the rifle with the laser attached. The most use it has seen is my dog chasing the laser around my house when I was testing it out. I have read mixed reviews on this laser, seems to be best used for home defense, close range work. Build quality seems pretty good to me, mounts up tight and the laser seems to not ""wander"" with bumping the rifle around. These are on sale on opticsplanet for $50 plus shipping right now, usually priced $117. 

The VFG is also brand new, installed on the same rifle, which sits in my safe. Folds up in either direction, and has the storage compartment inside. Not sure of the maker, but it seems like pretty decent quality. The 3 position pressure switch is taped to the grip, as seen in the pictures. I have seen similar grips sell for $20-$30.

My price is $50, and it is firm. I can travel within 10 miles or so of the Lake Geneva/Genoa City area.

Thanks in advance."

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY    
   This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are West German police surplus magazines for the Sig P-6 pistols, same as the Model 225, that we've all enjoyed for the past few years. Evidently German mothers teach their children hygiene very well at a young age, because all the German Police Officers had kept their pistols clean and well maintained. That is in sharp distinction to many of the firearms and equipment we run across, these are exceptional items. Manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Eckernforde, Germany. Construction is all steel, matte blue finish, and note the dovetailed construction on the backs of the magazines; note also the steel floorplates and followers. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm ammunition – 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. From the dates of the firearms we had between 2006 and 2009, these magazines were manufactured by Sig Sauer in Germany in the late 1970s and early 1980s. We test fired no fewer than 100 of the parent pistols ourselves, with no hitches at all on full metal case ammunition, or on Remington round nose hollow points. Please understand that we nor anyone else guarantees any magazine, new or used, to lock the slide back on the last shot all the time, and that is not a legitimate reason for a return, fewer than 10 percent of our test pistols failed to lock the slide after firing dry.  Stretching magazine springs is easy to do, and it is a routine part of good gun maintenance. Photos show specimens from the lot that we have, buyers will receive one of the magazines in the photos or their identical mates. We rate them all as Very Good, 75 percent vicinity finishwise, but we have included sufficient photographs for shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. All of these magazines are marked P6 / 9mm x19 on their floorplates, and some have white-ink marking from the West German Federal Police.  Our Single Mag price is $29 each. We're offering them in lots of 3 or more, however, at only $23 each. Own 3		for only	$ 69.00.  Not for sale to residents of New York City. 
Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Both are new, mounted on a rifle that sits in the safe. Never fired the rifle with either attached. The laser seems solid, and doesn't ""wander' like many Barska products. I have taken it on and off my rifle a few times, seems to hold it's zero pretty well. The VFG folds in either direction, has the 3 way pressure switch taped to it as seen in the pictures, and has the waterproof storage compartment accessible through the bottom screw in plug. Great, cheap additions to your ""tacticool"" AR or other carbine.

Shoots +p rounds.

Target sights.
Reason its so cheap is the timing or something is wrong. It works totally fine for 5 shots, and then on the 6th the the cylinder only spins partially, so you have to pull the trigger twice for the 6th shot. Pull the trigger 7 times for 6 shots. Not a huge deal for plinking and it's how I've been shooting it. 

They go for $350+ working perfectly. This has a lifetime warranty on it from Rossi. They will fix it for FREE. I just need the cash now and don't feel like waiting to ship it off and have it fixed.

Restrictions apply to higher capacity magazines in many jurisdictions of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. From a few years’ storage in an old Southern Warehouse come these serviceable and unfired blue steel magazines to fit Sig P228 pistols chambered in 9mm caliber. Manufacturer is Pro-Mag Industries of California and Nevada. Construction is blue steel body, steel spring, black polymer cartridge follower and matching floorplate. Each Magazine holds 13 rounds of 9mm ammunition. These will only fit Sig model 228 and 229 pistols chambered in 9mm that accept a double staggered magazine. They will not fit a 226, will not fit a 239, Will not fit a Smith & Wesson 469; will not fit the valve handle of a 19th century Italian Bidet. All these magazines are new and unfired in their original factory packages, only old stock. One of our veteran local customers gives the Pro-Mag an A, from cycling 117 rounds through it with no failures to feed, just one failure in 9 cycles to lock the slide open on the last shot, not really a consideration in our view. Replacement pricing on similar magazines often runs upwards of $50 a mag. Our single mag price is $29.00. We’re offering the Unfired Old Stock Pro-Mags in the photos, however, in lots of 3 or more, each at only $23.00 apiece, not sold onesy twosy for that price. Own a lot of 3 of these hard-to-get, serviceable magazines for only $ 69.00. Special, buy 10 or more only $21.90 per. Not for sale to civilian residents of California, Connecticut, Cook County / Chicago IL, D.C., Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, or any other jurisdiction where 11 round or higher magazines are restricted to Law Enforcement.

Shoppers please note that the magazine is not included in this listing, only the adapter. This listing is for THREE grip adapters assemblies. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-assembly price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a piece we installed a lot of back in the 1980s and early 1990s, Precision Gun Specialties grip adapter that makes a full size 5906 or 5900 type Smith & Wesson magazine fit the venerable 6906 or 6900 type Smith & Wesson Metal Frame Compact 9mms; they work perfectly on the older 469 and 669 Mini S&Ws as well. These will also fit the current production fifteen round Mec-Gar magazines numbers SW5915B and SW5915N. They will NOT work for Mec-Gar numbers 5910 and 5917, however. The tail pieces are different from the factory mags on the tens and seventeen rounders made by Mec-Gar, but the Mec-Gar fifteens are the same as the factory Smith & Wessons. No One regards the 6900 Smith & Wessons more highly than we do, but their compactness renders them less than ergonomic for protracted firing sessions, especially for folks like some of us with hands like Gatemouth Brown’s. These outfits have always been popular with law enforcement officers who carry them for backup in tactical situations, like drug agents who use the full capacity 6906 6946 type compacts and then have larger, but good feeling extra magazines. The adapters themselves are still manufactured by our old friends at Precision Gun Specialties; and they are relatively easy to install. We just remove the floorplate, install the adapter sleeve, and then slide in the PGS replacement floorplate. These adapters also work on 4000 series magazines, 4006 and 4003 mags, to fit into some variants of the 4013TSW and similar; the .40 compacts, though, have to be the ones capable of accepting double stacked magazines, not the single stacked ones like the old 4013 variants. It’s literally just a snap to put one of these on the longer magazines. Single adapter price is $23.00. We’re offering the adapters separately, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $16 each. Own 3 for only $ 48.00. For the Magazines themselves, please use Guns America search terms 5900 Robertson.
