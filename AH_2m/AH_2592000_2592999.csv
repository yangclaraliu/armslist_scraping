Kahr
CW380

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 offers the
ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to
the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size
Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet
is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938
easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in
finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO
trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the
1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes.

192,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2592192,For Sale:  Browning BDA 380,"Boulder / Longmont, Denver, Colorado",$ 600,"Listed On: Friday, January 31, 2014",Handguns,Browning                                                                                ,380 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Browning BDA .380

Includes two 13-round magazines (of unknown mfgr.), no box.

The Browning BDA 380 was produced under contract by Beretta from 1977 - 1997, with a few special orders since then.  The BDA for sale here was made in 1981, the year Ronald Reagan became president.  This pistol is in very good condition.  The crappy photos below don't do it justice.


These were pretty cool for concealed-carry guns in the 1970s, 1980s, and into the 1990s.  Since there are now smaller 9mm and .380 guns, the niche for something like this is either (1) somebody who just likes ""old school"" guns made out of metal instead of plastic, or (2) somebody who is extremely recoil-sensitive, since a ""larger"" .380-caliber pistol is usually easier to shoot than a small 9mm pistol, or a .380 caliber ""pocket pistol"" (this varies from person to person, since felt recoil is a subjective).

In Europe, the Browning BDA 380 was sold as the Model 140 by Fabrique Nationale (FN) to police departments, in an era when some police departments around the world still issued .32 and .380 caliber pistols as primary duty weapons. 

Per Colorado law, the transfer must be conducted at an FFL dealer.  The buyer is responsible for all transfer fees.

I'm not looking for anything specific, but if you have an item to trade, feel free to ask.  The worst I can say is ""No thanks, I'm not interested.""   I also have more pictures of this gun if you want to see.  Armslist only lets me post three, so e-mail me for them.


The Browning BDA 380 is based on the Beretta 84 ""Cheetah"", and uses the same magazines as the Beretta 84.  Mec-Gar brand magazines are available for around $20 from  CDNN, Bud's Gun Shop, Gun Clips Depot, Top Gun Supply, and 44 Mag.  Just be sure to look under both ""Beretta"" and ""Browning"" magazines on those web sites.

The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes."

I have a Sig Sauer Mosquito for sale in 22LR.  I bought this gun new in January 2013.  It is in fantastic condition and has only seen around 500 rounds.  It was cleaned each time after I went to the range with it.  It is a great little gun to learn and train on to get you ready for larger calibers.  The thing I liked about this gun is it very good size for a 22 semi auto handgun.  Most 22 semi auto handguns look and feel like little toys, this gun feels like a full size handgun for an adult.  I’m a fairly big guy and you can see how big the gun is in comparison to my hand.  It is 90% the size of the popular P226 which I had the intention of buying as well, but that never happened.  I have the original manual, case, lock, and extra parts.  The gun only comes with one magazine new but I will also throw in an extra magazine.  Mosquito mags are hard to find and expensive, they will cost over $45 with tax new.  I will also throw in over 400 rounds of hard to find 22LR ammo so you can begin shooting once you buy the pistol.  I’m looking for cash only."

What better way to spend time with a loved one than a permit to carry class. Our classes average 4-5 hours and we really strive to make it a great experience. We know your time is valuable, and because of that we teach you more than the state requires and include hands on experience so you can feel more comfortable carrying, you'll learn great tips to avoid violent encounters in the first place, and much more.

Your Minnesota permit gets you 23 states, your certificate also allows you to apply for Florida, Arizona, Maine, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan permits, increasing that to a possibility of 35 states.

This thing is AWESOME! It's shorter than an HK MP5 A2 but it's not an SBR so no NFA paperwork.

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a  last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped

firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.

The rear sight features a shape that works with factory Glock sight tools and also incorporates a small flat at the bottom of the sides allowing those at home to use. Punch for installation if you don't have a sight pusher.  Also features a .140"" u notch and matches the factory sight height so if you 17 shot great with factory sights it still will and replacing the front is a simple as matching the existing front sight height.  The front edge of the sight is contoured for one handed manipulation.  The striker block is just that but with rounded edges for smoother taker and more responsive trigger fee.  This post is a trial run before my web site launches to see if gun owners in central Ohio are interested in having these made in their back yard and want quality parts made by a shooter and not just another big company that doesn't make what you want or care.

Ruger's precision CNC-controlled machining process results in a superior slide-to-frame fit and smooth slide travel. The stainless steel barrel and bushing are made from the same bar stock, on the same machine, for improved accuracy. The SR1911's oversized ejection port and extended magazine release enhance competition performance. Its lightweight, aluminum, skeletonized trigger features an adjustable over-travel stop and provides a very crisp, no creep, light trigger pull with a quick, positive release, while its skeletonized hammer is lightweight as well and provides faster cycling.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models"

Got this from a fellow calgunner back in october. I've put around 500rds through without any issues. Rifle is amazingly accurate and the accutrigger is great for target shooting. Bought for the girlfriend and myself to use but she doesn't like bolt action so I'm looking for something new. Rifle has some signs of use as seen in the picture but nothing that affects function. Includes one 10rd magazine, redfield 3-9x scope, and 1,000 or so rounds of .22. The scope is missing a screw so I just use a thin screwdriver to alternate between magnifications. I believe OSH or any local hardware store will have a replacement screw for around .25 cents, but I do also have the original which I will include. Additional pictures can be provided upon request. As for trades, my list is as follows but feel free to offer up!

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm
caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300
AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round
capacity.

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are
not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides
an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.

The comfortable design of the all new XD-S™ feels so natural, it’s like an extension of your own body. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. A game-changer in the marketplace, the XD-S™ offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from the XD® line. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S™ offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a 9mm in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.
