But I live in a shotgun only county and she didn't know that I can't use a rifle here and the sales clerk sold her this, so since I can't deer hunt here with a rifle, I am selling this beautiful rifle and the 100 rds of new Hornany American Whitetail ammo that she bought to go with it. This is Marlin's top of the line model with checkered American black walnut stock with pistol grip, pistol grip cap, sling studs, and rubber recoil pad. This rifle still has the zip tie holding the action shut and comes with everything the she walked out of the store with;  owner's manual with mail in warranty card, hammer extension, and lock. The economy version of this rifle with birch wood stock and hard plastic butt pad is $449 plus tax at Bass Pro in Arundell Mills Mall and the Hornady ammo is $20 per box, and they they are out of stock on the rifle and ammo; my offer is a better deal on a higher end model and you can have it now with no tax, no paperwork, no waiting, no hassle, and this transaction is perfectly legal. Buyer must be Maryland resident and not prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms or ammunition; active duty military stationed in Maryland ok. Will meet buyer in a pubic setting during daylight hours for a FTF cash and carry deal, buyer must present current valid MD drivers license and active duty military must present copy of orders showing them stationed in MD. I am in southern MD, will drive as far north as Upper Marlboro or most anywhere in southern MD. Price is firm, I'm not desperate to sell, not interested in lesser offers or trades.

HK45 TACTICAL

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting.

THE BOW:
-HOYT Pro Medalist T/D, ""L# 3332/j.m"" Takedown recurve longbow in target length (66"" overall length, 24"" riser), with a very heavy pull (says 51# for H24, i can just barely draw it). riser is white (i think its the original paint, shows some wear) the grip is not removable (stamped ""hoyt 4R""), all the threads appear to be perfect, and below the grip is a round hologram ""HOYT"" sticker. the string is old and would probably need to be replaced. i've been told it might be an original TD, but i don't know the difference. i hope the details in the photos are helpful. an expert archer saw this bow and said it is excellent.

Has been ""Finn Matched"" when they re-arsenaled it, as well as fitted with the two-piece stock. The handguard has the early copper copper caps, and the bands are the ""button"" style, not screw style. The rear sight was restamped by the Finns as ""arshins"" as a unit of measurement meant as little to them as it does to me. 

I've had this M91 for over 20 years and have come to believe it needs to be in a collection with its' comrades, or at least in the hands of someone who wants something a bit different than a $200 1940s shooter. Nothing wrong with them, but this is different.

HK45 TACTICAL

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting.

It was cleaned right after and stored in a climate controlled safe. This is not the standard ""savage"" rifle, as this one comes with their Accu-Trigger, which allows you to adjust the weight of the trigger without taking it to a gunsmith. It has a very nice and crisp trigger. This is hands down the most accurate rifle I have ever had the opportunity to shoot (see target for final 3 shots at 100 yards after sighting it in.) Comes with everything it came with new and more. Has a Plano transport box. Also comes with 3 boxes of ammo in various grains (150, 150, 180) for various hunting scenarios and a Bushnell scope. I would keep it, however I don't hunt nearly as often as I would like to and I hate to see it become a safe-queen, as it is too nice of a rifle to just lay around.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Firearms:
- .22LR or .22MAG pistol (prefer with a bit of ammo).  Revolver or semi-auto is fine, but would really like a single-action revolver.

The ambidextrous lightweight thumbhole 10/22 stock is made of polypropylene with fiber additives for maximum strength. The stock comb height is designed high enough to comfortably and properly shoot with optics. The stock design also features a semi palm swell on both sides of the pistol grip, and a molded-to-fit hard rubber butt plate attached with screws. This rifle will be equipped with the Magnum Lite revolutionary patented graphite bull barrel, exclusive to Magnum Research. The patented uni-directional graphite fibers, parallel to the bore axis, results in a barrel with six-times the stiffness of conventional steel. The lighter barrel weights (from 13-16 oz, depending on barrel length) are easier to wield and dissipate heat up to 43% faster than steel. The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy. Other features include a .22LR Benz target chamber designed specifically for semi-automatics; full floating barrel for maximum accuracy, CNC-machined receiver from 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging with an integral weaver-type rail for optics and a black anodized finish. The MLR22AT has an approximate weight of 4.25 lbs, barrel length of 17 inches, and over all length of 35.5 inches.
