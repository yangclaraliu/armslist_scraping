This is a great mid weight tactical rifle. I have taken good care of it and properly cleaned it often (not so often that I caused any damage to the crown!) The rifle has 1500 rounds through it but because it is salt bath nitrided the barrel life is about 6-8000 rounds so It has just started shooting at its peak accuracy (Barrel cleans easy too!). The stock is virtually new. I got it and put it on and shot >50 rounds through it and it shot AMAZING. The stock is inletted for badger m5 bottom metal along with PTG bottom metal. The stock is pillar bedded and the rifle will shoot .5 all day with the occasional .25 moa group. I used this in a tactical competition and it never once failed me."

Rifle has good cant with the sights. Very accurate and has the AK reliability. I recently put about 800 rounds on 9/8 with no issues. Very clean internals, well maintained with FireClean product. 

***** VERY little mag wobble when loaded or empty mag. Real steal mags have less wobble (side to side) than the plastic mags. No front to back or up and down wobble at all***** 

This was very important to me as WASR do not have the mag dimples, so I made sure to get the best fit I could find. It locks up better than some of the Arsenal AKs I have owned. 

Asking $650.00 with flashlight, $600.00 even for the rifle w/out the flashlight. No trades please, I am selling because I need to pay for a car repair, and this AK sadly has to go. 

When emailing please put ""AK Sale"" in subject to weed out the spammers. No low ball offers. There is some wiggle room, but the end all price to cover my bill is $600.00.

This near brand new pistol (""BD"" date stamp on left side indicates 2013 build year) is excellent for conceal-carry. Often used by  SOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) personnel the USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

The price asked includes 50 rounds of 38 smith and wesson ammunition. That is a value of $35 alone. The reason the price is not higher is to reflect the damage to the grip and the wear on the gun. It is a great start for anyone who is interested in beginning a gun collection. You will not find many antique guns in this price range.

This is a Springfield Garand made in 1943. It is the Danish variety and has the highly sought after VAR barrel. The barrel is made in 1957 and is one of the only non original components of the rifle. It's throat gauge is less than one and the rifling is excellent, which means it's rarely been used. The stock has virtually no dings and matches the receiver. This is definitely a collectible model, although it shoots beautifully if you are so inclined (as I hope you are). The pictures do not do this rifle justice. I would prefer to sell this outright but I might consider a lesser value trade if an appropriate amount of boot is offered. Please contact me with any questions."

As for the CZ52 this firearm was manufactured in 1953 and refurbished by the Czech military in 1986, it is in pristine condition, fires flawlessly and I would trust it with my life on a daily basis. It is chambered in 7.62 x 25, this is one of the hottest rounds available in a handgun and will penetrate Kevlar helmets like a hot knife through butter! The gun has recently installed natural hickory grips with the twin tail lion stamped on each side, I do also have the factory grips in a dark amber color that are also very nice looking, also a bit slimmer which some may prefer. I cannot express how much I love this gun. The only way I see myself trading it off would be in a two for two gun trade. Its simply classic with a brutal round, and has been proven extremely reliable. These guns are drying up and this one is a fine example. Sorry for the bad lighting I will take another picture soon, or feel free to text me and ask for one.

NFA Ownership Frequently Asked Questions 
1 .Machines guns and suppressors are illegal 
While your state of residence may not allow the possession of such weapons; they are not unlawful under federal law. NFA 1934 makes the transfer of such weapons taxable, and created a registry of such weapons. 
No machine guns made after May 1986 can be entered in the registry creating a de facto ban on the production of new machine guns for civilians. This de facto ban does not apply to other NFA items. 

2. You need a license to buy an NFA item. 
No License is required. What you need to do is pay a tax on the transfer of each item in your possession. The tax is currently $200 for machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles/shotguns, and destructive devices. The transfer tax for Any Other Weapon is $5. 

Some states may have permitting or licensing requirements that have to be met prior to the purchase of NFA items, but there is no Federal ""Class 3"" license. That term is usually used to refer to a Class 1 FFL who has paid the SOT (Special Occupation Tax) fee to allow them to deal in Title II weapons and devices (NFA). 

3. I have to pay the NFA tax every year 
Another common myth; the transfer tax is paid once per transfer of the weapon, whether you own it for 10 days or 10 years. 

4. Owning an NFA item means agreeing to give up your 4th amendment protections of unwarranted search and seizure. 
This is an oft repeated myth. No one can search your home (or whatever location you used for your ATF tax form) without your permission or a warrant just because you own NFA items. 

5. If I buy an NFA item I’ll have to buy a safe to store it in. 
While you are required to maintain control of your NFA items at all times (and a safe to which only you have access goes a long way to meeting this requirement), there is no law that requires you to buy a safe to store your NFA items. 

6 .No one else is allowed to use my NFA weapons 
As long as you are maintaining control (which means you don’t leave the NFA items in the sole care of someone other than yourself) your friends and family are welcome to use them, as long as you are physically present
7. Why are machine guns so expensive?
In 1986, the United States government banned the future importation and domestic manufacture of machine guns for civilian consumption, and the already limited inventory of Class 3 weapons has since diminished substantially. At a rate now more accelerated than ever, these weapons are ending up in the hands of collectors who have no intention of ever selling them. The effect is twofold: Class 3 arms are growing increasingly scarce, and their prices are rising accordingly. Further Federal bans in 1989 and 1994 relating to semiautomatic clones of military weapons have spurred similar trends in that arena as well. Thus, the price of a quality, collector-grade Class 3 or semiautomatic weapon has spiraled beyond the comprehension of the average buyer. 
8. How do I register my nfa item?
You can own these weapons and possess them registered in different ways. We prepare and provide all paperwork. There are three distinct ways to register ownership of these weapons which we will describe here. 
Registration in your name:
This used to be the most common form of registration. Fingerprints, background check then Once the proper forms were prepared the applicant would go to their local chief law enforcement officer or other authorized official and request their signature on the form. Sometimes the applicant could get a signature. Most times the signature was refused. The application required a signature before the forms could be submitted to the BATFE for processing and approval. In the event the applicant could not get a signature they could not own NFA weapons registered in their name. This left applicants looking for alternate routes to own these weapons.

Corporate registration:
In the event an applicant could not get the required chief law enforcement signature, many people formed corporations strictly for the purpose of purchasing NFA weapons. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register ownership to the corporation. If the applicant already had a corporation they did not incur additional expenses forming one strictly for this purpose. The negative side of forming a corporation strictly to own NFA weapons is that this form of ownership comes with additional costs. Most states require an annual fee. In Florida the annual fee is $450  It varies by state. Over the period of ten years that amounts to $4500  (in the state of Florida). If you own two suppressors which cost a total of $800 or $900 this alternate form of registration appears to be economically foolish over long periods of time if the corporation is held strictly for ownership of NFA weapons. The annual corporation fee far exceeds the value of the NFA items and it continues to increase each year. 

Trust ownership:
Trust registration has become one of the most popular forms of NFA ownership. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register it to a trust. Other benefits include no fingerprint cards and no photographs. Skipping these two steps saves a LOT of time. This is NOT a loophole nor is it a ""short cut"". It is simply a way to take legal possession as the law was intended. Unlike corporations, trusts generally do not have an annual renewal or the fees associated with them. In the State of Florida, for example, there is no recording of a trust nor are there any fees required.  There are various options to setting up a trust."

Shotgun hunters have more options now than ever. Excellent choices such as this 12 Gauge 3"" Buckshot shell from Remington Express with 15 #00 pellets at 1225 fps, which is good for deer or other medium game or the unruly.

One of the great values in shotgun deer loads. A combination of heavy cushioning behind the shot column and a granulated polymer buffering helps maintain pellet roundness for tight, even patterns.

First is a near new about 300 rds fired CW9 with 3 factory mags, case, and a LoBo Gunslingers concealment holster. I got this gun thinking I was going to get a CCW permit, but things have changed. It's a nice piece, shoots good, very accurate, no scratches or wear. 

Second is a H&R Pardener 12ga pump, 26in, 2 3/4 - 3in shells, only 200rds fired, no feeding issue, has a couple light scuffs (closet rash). This is a good shooting gun also, but I just got a brand new Mossberg so I don't really need it.

Both of these are good shooting guns in good shape. I would just rather have a Mid sized or Full sized pistol since I am not getting my CCW ( I can pass a background check). I will trade one or both of these for something bigger. I am mainly interested in 9mm, .40cal, or .45acp auto's in good shape."

Gentleman,


        I really think you might be interested in this ammunition. Every Police department that sees it at a demo wants to switch to it. Please let me know if you’re interested in the ammunition or even setting up a demonstration for civilians and or Law Enforcement.

I am a retired Police and S.W.A.T./firearms instructor from Beaver County and have started my own ammunition company. In today’s world of ammo cost and availability, I had the pleasure of dealing with Liberty Ammunition Company and their cutting edge, state of the art ammunition. I have always been partial to Federal Premium Hydra-Shok and H.S.T. ammo, or even Speer Gold Dot, Remington Golden Saber and Winchester SXT Ammo for defensive purposes. After doing some tests and research of my own on this ammunition, it didn’t take long for me to see that this is without a doubt the most effective and lethal ammo produced today and should be used by all law enforcement. In an attempt to educate those involved in decision making and purchasing ammunition, I had put together a free demonstration with this company in hopes of bringing more civilians and law enforcement up to date with this revolutionized  ammunition and leaving their current ammo in the stone ages where it belongs .
I am positive that once you see what I have seen with this ammunition performance , you will agree that this is what you would want to put your life on the line with and protect your loved ones, and or all of your team members and fellow patrol officers to carry. Meanwhile at the same time eliminating more liability from your agency.

Here are my prices on Liberty Ammunition.

Civil Defense 9mm 50 gr. HP 2000fps $23 per box 20rds, Availability Immediate.

Civil Defense .40 Cal. 60gr. HP 2000fps $25 per box 20rds, Availability 30-45 days orders exceeding 750k rounds

Shotgun hunters have more options now than ever. Excellent choices such as this 12 Gauge 3"" Buckshot shell from Remington Express with 15 #00 pellets at 1225 fps, which is good for deer or other medium game or the unruly. 

When the biggest bucks somehow materialize out of nowhere you better be ready to make the most of it. Remington's buckshot lets you shoot with the confidence once possible only with a rifle. The reasons for choosing Remington are numerous. Some say it's unbeatable value. Regardless of the reason, we remain unwavering in our sprit of a legendary brand. One of the great values in shotgun deer loads. A combination of heavy cushioning behind the shot column and a granulated polymer buffering helps maintain pellet roundness for tight, even patterns. 

Muzzle velocity: 1225 fps. Uses: Deer, Medium Game, bad guys. 

Whether you are shooting for fun, hunting, or establishing good self defense measures, this product is one of the most widely used and respected loads available."

The Finnish is the top rifle pictured.  I wanted to show a comparison with the Russian which has a shorter barrel.  You will notice that the Finnish rifle has the improved sling attachments and a two-piece stock.  Also the Finnish barrels were produced to a higher standard in both material and tolerances.  Another difference you will notice is the front sight. The Finnish used a front blade versus the globe on the Russian.

There are many more differences and variations of the Finnish M91 and are considered rare versus the Russian due to how many Russians were produced. I am no expert concerning these rifles.  I do know this rifle is fun to shoot and does it well.  I do not believe the sling is the correct one but works.  I tried to research some to determine a fair price with no luck.  I do think it would make for a nice addition for anyone collecting the Mosin-Nagant rifle.

The Russian pictured below is not for sale unless a really good offer was made.  It is unfired and all numbers matching.  And the nice part about matching numbers is I have the bayonet with matching numbers.  Not often will you find a Russian with matching bayonet.

**Update I lowered the asking price from $350 to $250.  The rifle pictured actually has a darker stock than the photo displays.***

*** Update price reduction again $250 to $200.

I bought this rifle hoping to do some longer range shooting and maybe taking care of a few coyotes. But I only had the chance to shoot about 25 rounds through it so far due  to moving farther away from my range. It is a great setup for longer range shooting. The optics are crisp and clear with amazing adjust-ability. I really don't want to sell this rifle but i wouldn't mind getting some safety cash and getting some parts for other projects.

I would be interested in a partial trade for a glock 19 (gen3 only) or a M&P Shield (9mm) and possibly a complete AR15 parts kit or TEC9 clone (KG99). No other trade offers please. I have the original boxes for everything and I may have the receipts. The scope has a lifetime warranty but i doubt you would need it. 

make me an offer, and Im not trying to be a dick but a glock is not worth more than $400, i can buy them new for that price.

The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.
