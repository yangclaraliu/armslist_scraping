I know these are subject to a recall. If you would rather sell yours than send it back for repairs I may be interested. I am not looking to pay close to retail price. If I wanted to pay that I would just wait and get a new one that didn't have to be sent back to the factory. If you want to make a deal call or text me at 225-six 10-5000

THIS ARSENAL PACKAGE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING:

Model SGL21 Arsenal Custom Modified AK
Midwest Industries Forward Picatinny Rail Tactical Forend (installed by Arsenal)
Custom texturized Pistol Grip (not the standard AK style).
AK-74 flash Compensator (installed by Arsenal)
Redfield 4-12 Scope and AK scope mount with additional side rail.
Custom foldable (side folds to the left) adjustable cheek weld tactical rear stock (installed by Arsenal)
5 Magazines (4 polymer and one metal)
Tactical Carrying case that has pockets to hold 5 magazines
1000 Rounds of new Wolf FMJ (non-corrosive - poly coated)
Unique foldable rear, adjustable cheek weld bipod.
Original box, manual, AK cleaning rd, and additional standard AK stock.

RIFLE FACTS:  For those of you who know, Arsenal out of Las Vegas imports quality Russian made Saiga AK's and modifies them in a number of ways to make them more accurate.  As a result, their AK's are typically much more expensive than the standard every day models you see come in and out of stores.  This SGL21 is an awesome model that has less than 300 rounds shot through it.  The Redfield 4-12 scope is brand new.  The rear collasible adjustable cheekweld stock allows you to use various optics (plus optics heights) and then adjust your cheek position without having to stick on or screw on various height blocks.  The stock folds to the left (see photos).  The 1000 rounds of ammo are brand new in boxes and are preferred Poly coated (not lacquer).

REASON FOR SELLING:  I'm no longer doing much shooting at all and this setup will net someone an extraordinary setup at a bargain price.  I wasn't originally going to sell this Arsenal (I sold off my other AK's) because it is such a gorgeous model in more ways than one.  It is virtually in new condition with less than 300 rounds fired through it and then stored in a safe along with tactical carrying case.  I'm selling it approximately $500 less than I paid for all.

PRICE:  $1350 Cash - Please no personal checks or trades will be considered.

OTHER QUALIFICATIONS:  When I sell a firearm, I do this correctly.  I will need a copy of your drivers license and we will fill out a formal bill of sale that as previously approved by the local gun store and the police department.  If this is an out of state sale, I will ship to an FFL dealer only.  As an aside, I'm a retired Marine.

It has a mesa 10 shot shell carrier, 5 inch Picatininy rail, ghost ring sites, Nordic components 8 round extension tube and a Nordic components Barrel clamp with Picatinny rail for light attachments or added sling mount(included). Comes with a hard case and ton of 12 gauge ammo(Buck shot and slug)

The shotgun has barely had any use. I put ten rounds through it to make sure it works fine. It was specifically for home protection and not for leisure. I had it professionally stippled with very minimal texture. Interested persons will see it was done very well and will feel the benefit when holding it. Anyone who wishes to do research on this shotgun will see that nova's have a feature that allows the magazine to not feed when the button is depressed and the spent round is ejected. This allows for the user to do a slug change out without having to lose a round and seat the round in the tube in a time is life situation when you need a slug to reach out past 50 yards.

Lastly, Nordic components parts are some of the highest quality additions you can add to any shotgun. Milled aircraft aluminum and parkerized. The clamp and the ext tube is valued at 200 together alone. Everything in this package is all you need and more for your police or home protection needs.

Match trigger, barrel and adjustable target sights. Ambi safety.
Excellent condition with factory hard case, two mags, and everything that came with as new.

Mags are 10 rounders, and are the only thing that really shows any use as they have some small scuffs on the base-plates. Factory 12 rounders are available online.
Also have have the GG&G rail adapter and an Insight light/ laser combo, both as new and negotiable in deal if needed.
Internet values on this gun seem to range from 1200-1800. Given that this is like new, and has a couple of hundred dollars worth of extra stuff, I don't think it would be worth less. This is also the only one I have found that comes with the original HK hard case.
This gun is definitely for the HK collector, or the serious target shooter. Please don't offer trades worth far less thinking you will be able to flip this and make money. I don't need to get rid of it, just not much of a pistol target shooter and I'm sure it could go to someone who appreciates it more.

From his treatise “Springfield Armory Inc, M1A Serial Number Chronology”, Lee Emerson states the following;
""042201 to 063000. This is the serial number range that I refer to as the Golden Age of the M1A. The receiver design had fully matured by this time. The receivers were hand finished by the original designer and master craftsman, Melvin Smith. Springfield Armory, Inc. was awash in USGI parts during this period. Thus, factory built standard model M1A rifles in this serial number range were built with a very high USGI parts count.""

P938 Equinox

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

-Galloway Precision extra power firing pin spring added which allows reliable striker hits on any factory ammo as well as small rifle primers (harder but more reliable for hot loads) especially if you reload and run into pistol primer shortages you can shoot small rifle primers to.

-Professional Feed Ramp Polish and shaping for extra reliable feeding and now it feeds like butter by slow hand cycle or live.  Also deburred and polished bottom of extractor hook for more reliable feed & ejection.

-Has an adjustable rear elevation iron sight and I've moved left/right sight to center target

-Also has properly polished magazine release catch so loading & ejecting full magazine  loads and unloads without massive thumb pressure to release or to load a full mag the way it should be.  

Included is Center Point laser sight already zeroed for appx 7-10 yds.  Cheap laser but I've used 2 of them on .40's and they work so far and my other 40 had 400 rds on laser just like this one.  Adjustments screws lock tited for reliability but easily adjustable.

Comes with 2 high cap 15 rd Mags.  You get the extra $125-150 worth of custom work & added laser for a more reliable gun for no added cost.  This gun only has 100-150 rds thru it.  Bought in late spring 2013.  Only selling to get another toy.  Price is firm at $400.   REDACTED.   Tks.
