I have just returned to NY to finish packing up the rest of my things and to sell or trade what I cannot move or do not need. As typical in this state, nothing is easy.

I need to finish this up asap, and figured why limit myself to just craigslist in NYS?? Anyway, here is what I have:

Sony Bravia 60"" LCD HDTV with all the bells and whistles, 1080P, HDMI, etc. I paid $2500 for this television not 6 months ago. Possible partial trades, cash, etc. In like new condition, no issues.

Mac Tools Toolbox/Rolling Cart with assorted sockets, Gear Wrench brand wrenches, air tools by mac, Astro Pneumatic Sockets, Mac and Cornwell Screwdrivers, etc. It's ready to use, Vitamin C orange, stainless top with slide out tops.

Open to offers, need to move. I will not give it away. I was looking for $2000 for the box compelte and $1500 for the TV, $300 for the SS.

I will transport with me back to SC, but I stress if you are not serious, DO NOT WASTE my time. If I transport it there and you back out or blow off my calls, I am screwed and have nowhere to store it!

Paid 1500 for the rifle alone, add in the extra mags, bipod&stud, two stocks, mag latch, springs and you can see Im easily losing a couple hundred bucks

Only 400-500 rounds through it. If it helps the sale, I'll throw in a foam lined, hard plastic case for it too.

It now wears the M14 Big Red Birch (last photo) with all the metal from Fred’s. Condition category as stated by Fred “excellent-plus with excellent or better buttplate”; thats the best condition out of the issued stocks. I havnt weighed it but its certainly heavier than the synthetic/fiberglass, makes a great bench rifle. And it fits the receiver nice and tight much better than the fiberglass. Comes with issued/used extra upper handguard(I was going to have it dipped to match the camo or in woodgrain but never did).

The black fiberglass stock had a hairline crack when I bought it which is why I purchased the other stocks. Ive been told one can fix it easily enough and that the fiberglass GI stock is preferred to the commercial Mossy Oak, I dunno-you decide, I like the birch.

It has a Sadlak Tactical magazine latch and has Tubb’s Chrome Silicon springs(hammer spring isn’t installed yet but included). Original spring is included as is the original mag release.

Comes with 10rd and 20rd SA mags and two 20rd kits by Checkmate Ind.
Has a 'Harris Bipod' adapter stud made for M14 stocks and a Caldwell 6”-9” bipod.

I never intended to sell this rifle but due to unfortunate circumstances Ive decided to sell it. Get it before I change my mind. Meet in Sac.
No trades - cash only. Thanks."

Gun comes complete with all original paperwork and parts from Savage.  This is a brand new gun and has never been fired.  It has a blued action and barrel with a beautiful dark Walnut thumb hole stock, and has the  AccuTrigger type trigger.  This is a package kit from Savage that includes a 3-9x by 40mm 8 point scope with rings from Simmons, worth more than $75 by itself.  I have two of these rifles, thinking I could use this second gun but I don't need it.  My loss is your gain!  These are great guns, very accurate, and I have a number of friends that have them and we all love them.  It's the best bolt action .17HMR you can get, short of getting some sort of full on multi $1000's target gun.  Great for small varmint hunting or just plane fun.  Has a much flatter and longer trajectory than any other rimfire and is a great rifle to lean long range shooting, or just practice!"

Not a scratch on her, feeds and extracts like a champ both .223 & 5.56. Gun blast DOT c o m sums this rifle up best:

""The SU-16 has a few unique features that set it apart from the AR-15 style rifles available. Most notable is the light weight of the Kel-Tec, which is just five pounds and one ounce, without magazine. In use, the SU-16 feels even lighter. Another unique feature of the SU-16 is its folding buttstock, which , with the removal of one pin, folds up neatly underneath the barrel and receiver, reducing the overall length from thirty-seven and one half inches down to only twenty-six and one quarter inches for easier storage. In this position, the trigger and hammer are disconnected from the receiver, rendering the weapon incapable of firing until the buttstock is returned to its proper position. The buttstock on the SU-16 also has storage for two loaded magazines, in addition to the one locked into the magazine well. While the rifle is shipped with two ten-round plastic magazines, the SU-16 can also use readily available twenty or thirty round M-16/AR-15 magazines.

The synthetic fore arm on the SU-16 is a two-piece design which, when deployed from its locked position, makes into a handy little bipod for increased stability when firing from a benched or prone position. I at first thought this to be a frivolous feature, but it has proven to be quite useful in the field. The operating handle on the right side of the weapon reciprocates with the bolt upon firing, and therefore provides a built-in forward assist mechanism to aid in the chambering of a stubborn cartridge, if one so chooses.

The bolt head is of the rotating AR-15 style, and the bolt locks open when the magazine is empty. The magazine release is in the same position as on the AR-15/M-16 family of weapons. The gas system on the SU-16 uses a piston to actuate the bolt, and is of a simple and rugged design, much like the system on the AK-47 family of weapons.

The trigger pull on the sample SU-16 measured five pounds and three ounces, and was without any excess creep or overtravel. The rifle wears an aperture rear sight and a highly visible but well-protected fiber-optic type front sight, that is rudimentarily adjustable. The eighteen and one-half inch barrel measures three-quarters of an inch underneath the hand guard, then steps down abruptly to five-eighths of an inch just in front of the gas block, tapering to just over one-half of an inch just behind the front sight. The barrel is rifled one turn in nine inches.""

Yes you read that right...FIVE POUNDS in weight (my AR's feel like a boat anchor now when I take them out), AND the fact that it easily folds under:

""with the removal of one pin, folds up neatly underneath the barrel and receiver, reducing the overall length from thirty-seven and one half inches down to only twenty-six and one quarter inches for easier storage""

Makes it the PERFECT backpack rifle....with a nice little amount of firepower! ACCEPTS AR-15 PMAG's!! They fit like a glove! I wanted to DESPERATELY try and hang onto this rifle being that it took over 6 months before I was able to finally get my hands on one. As noted in the title, I searched (using various different plays on the search terms in an attempt to cover as many bases as I could) Armslist immediately prior to posting this ad and found NO SU-16's CURRENTLY FOR SALE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA. Folks that have 'em are hanging onto them for good reason apparently.

Reason for selling: Simple. I am a retired US Navy Chief and have decided to do the RV living across the US thing and am going from a 1500 sq ft 3 bedroom house into a 30 ft motor home. Having room/space will become a luxury, simple as that and I have too much invested in my other rifles, so unfortunately this one landed on the chopping block :-/

Asking $950 O.B.O and am willing to entertain PARTIAL trades (preferably handguns obviously in 9mm, .22LR and .45 ACP only) that have been as equally well cared for as what I am offering in trade. Not interested in abused guns please. Please feel free to make an offer as I am NOT an asshole and will POLITELY accept, or refuse depending. Prefer a WIN/WIN always.

Thank you for making it this far in my somewhat long posting, I felt this offering deserved it as it truly is a beautiful and very innovative firearm. Hopefully the pics do it some justice.

A pocket holster makes it's thin size totally hidden and it will not weigh you down during a long day.  It can fit in a purse and even get lost with the other stuff that women carry.  I carry a 380 concealed every day and no one has any idea that I have it and it is so lite that I forget that I am carrying it.  A great gun that is even used by police officers as a backup because of it's dependability.  It carries a lifetime warranty and is made in Cocoa Florida.

DESCRIPTION

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

Not a scratch on her, feeds and extracts like a champ both .223 & 5.56. Gun blast DOT c o m sums this rifle up best:

""The SU-16 has a few unique features that set it apart from the AR-15 style rifles available. Most notable is the light weight of the Kel-Tec, which is just five pounds and one ounce, without magazine. In use, the SU-16 feels even lighter. Another unique feature of the SU-16 is its folding buttstock, which , with the removal of one pin, folds up neatly underneath the barrel and receiver, reducing the overall length from thirty-seven and one half inches down to only twenty-six and one quarter inches for easier storage. In this position, the trigger and hammer are disconnected from the receiver, rendering the weapon incapable of firing until the buttstock is returned to its proper position. The buttstock on the SU-16 also has storage for two loaded magazines, in addition to the one locked into the magazine well. While the rifle is shipped with two ten-round plastic magazines, the SU-16 can also use readily available twenty or thirty round M-16/AR-15 magazines.

The synthetic fore arm on the SU-16 is a two-piece design which, when deployed from its locked position, makes into a handy little bipod for increased stability when firing from a benched or prone position. I at first thought this to be a frivolous feature, but it has proven to be quite useful in the field. The operating handle on the right side of the weapon reciprocates with the bolt upon firing, and therefore provides a built-in forward assist mechanism to aid in the chambering of a stubborn cartridge, if one so chooses.

The bolt head is of the rotating AR-15 style, and the bolt locks open when the magazine is empty. The magazine release is in the same position as on the AR-15/M-16 family of weapons. The gas system on the SU-16 uses a piston to actuate the bolt, and is of a simple and rugged design, much like the system on the AK-47 family of weapons.

The trigger pull on the sample SU-16 measured five pounds and three ounces, and was without any excess creep or overtravel. The rifle wears an aperture rear sight and a highly visible but well-protected fiber-optic type front sight, that is rudimentarily adjustable. The eighteen and one-half inch barrel measures three-quarters of an inch underneath the hand guard, then steps down abruptly to five-eighths of an inch just in front of the gas block, tapering to just over one-half of an inch just behind the front sight. The barrel is rifled one turn in nine inches.""

Yes you read that right...FIVE POUNDS in weight (my AR's feel like a boat anchor now when I take them out), AND the fact that it easily folds under:

""with the removal of one pin, folds up neatly underneath the barrel and receiver, reducing the overall length from thirty-seven and one half inches down to only twenty-six and one quarter inches for easier storage""

Makes it the PERFECT backpack rifle....with a nice little amount of firepower! ACCEPTS AR-15 PMAG's!! They fit like a glove! I wanted to DESPERATELY try and hang onto this rifle being that it took over 6 months before I was able to finally get my hands on one. As noted in the title, I searched (using various different plays on the search terms in an attempt to cover as many bases as I could) Armslist immediately prior to posting this ad and found NO SU-16's CURRENTLY FOR SALE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA. Folks that have 'em are hanging onto them for good reason apparently.

Reason for selling: Simple. I am a retired US Navy Chief and have decided to do the RV living across the US thing and am going from a 1500 sq ft 3 bedroom house into a 30 ft motor home. Having room/space will become a luxury, simple as that and I have too much invested in my other rifles, so unfortunately this one landed on the chopping block :-/

Thank you for making it this far in my somewhat long posting, I felt this offering deserved it as it truly is a beautiful and very innovative firearm. Hopefully the pics do it some justice.

A pocket holster makes it's thin size totally hidden and it will not weigh you down during a long day.  It can fit in a purse and even get lost with the other stuff that women carry.  I carry a 380 concealed every day and no one has any idea that I have it and it is so lite that I forget that I am carrying it.  A great gun that is even used by police officers as a backup because of it's dependability.  It carries a lifetime warranty and is made in Cocoa Florida.  Combine good looks, small size, small weight, 7 round capacity, lifetime warranty, reliability and a low cost makes it a very nice weapon for men  or women to carry. Check out the specifications on this great little gun.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I purchased it in August of 2013. Fired less than 30 times. My wife did not like it.  After we got back from the range I cleaned it, oiled it and put it in the safe. I only carry & shoot .45s so I do not have any use for it.   

Included in this package I will include all of the following:

1 -  LIKE NEW Taurus PT-709 Thin in the original plastic case w/ matching serial numbers
1 -  Original Manual + Warranty Card
3 -  7+1 Taurus Brand Magazines (1 is still sealed in the original packaging)
2 -  Pierce Grip ""Grip Extensions"" ""Pinky Extensions""
2 -  Original flat grip bottoms
1 -  Blackhawk! Belt Holster (Size 8) Fits the PT-709 perfect.
1 -  Adjustable Shoulder Holster that holds the gun and 2 additional magazines
1 - Trigger Lock (w/ 2 keys)
8 -  Rounds  Hornady Red Tipped 9mm Hollow Point
11 -  Rounds Barnes All Silver +P 9mm (Gun is rated for +P ammo)
8 - Rounds Tulammo FMJ
10 - Rounds CCI 9mm 54gr Varmin Load (Load 1 at a time manually)

Ammo is just what I have left over .  This is my last 9mm.  My wife is going back to .380s

The gun is in great shape inside and out. Yes, you might be able to find them online for $299 to $380 before taxes, FFL fees and shipping. Even Buds charges $372 plus taxes and FFL fees. And all of these are with 1 magazine. I am offering 3 Magazines for this gun. 
Magazines are not kept in stock in most gun stores. eBay is the best place to get them and can go anywhere from $45 to $60 plus shipping. Count the holsters , trigger lock, ammo, and the 2 additional magazines......If you do the math, you will see that this is a more than fair price.

Thank You

The pistol is War Trophy, with a Certificate - Headquarters United State Forces European Theater - issued to Lloyd S. Isaacs ser no 14102342, and a picture of this GI with his buddy holding a street sign ""Adolf Hitler StraBe"". This documentation makes the pistol an article of history. I will ship to C&R or FFL for $25 in the lower 48 FEDEX. email me if you would like other photos - I am often out of range so please call REDACTED for specific questions."

I shot about 100 rounds through it. I do have 22MAG federal ammo as well that I can sell with it, but that will cost extra. Those were 19 a box for 100. I can sell them for 14 a box. 

**the picture I posted is not the exact gun, I did this as a reference, I am waiting to borrow my friends camera to post high quality pictures** the damage on the gun in the post is NOT, anywhere on my gun.

It is pretty much mint, with a little speck size flaw on the barrel bluing. It is not a  dent, looks like the bluing just didn't stick or something. I bought it in this condition. The spek size flaw is literally the size of the tip of a needle. It is case coloured and was made in 1975 I believe.

I'm sure I'll get some emails from people who have never owned a Hi Point telling me how this gun is junk but honestly, back when I could afford ammo, it kept up with my other guns well enough. I haven't experienced any problems with it. (I was shooting winchester ""white box"" target ammo mostly). 

little more money than you'd expect to pay for a regular C9 since it is the compensated model. 
Only reason for that is that they are few and far between and in the end it is still a very affordable, decent, pistol.

Hey guys I am a small company out of the Northeast whom offers same day shipping and magazine prices that are cheaper then the rest. None of this Chinese made junk magazines that have been floating around. I offer American made magazines from Check-Mate industries.   The NE has been heavily impacted by legislation that has infringed on our rights as gun owners.  We as a magazine reseller have been most impacted nationally by these ridiculous laws.  We can only offer magazines with capacities under 10 rounds as CT gun owners can not have higher capacities.  We are offering these magazines at wholesale prices so we can keep our compliance meanwhile help our local citizens!

Comes with RRA carry handle, and complete BCG, just as it was received from Rock River Arms. 20"" barrel, chrome moly, HBAR, 1:9, Wylde chamber, standard BCG I believe, (don't think it is chrome lined, can't tell for sure), and properly staked. For what it's worth, I was told it had a very low round count, by the gentleman I traded with to get it, and that most of them were 22 LR fired through a CMMG conversion kit.

I'm very happy with this upper, and it would not hurt my feelings at all if I couldn't sell it, that being said, my asking price is firm. You can see on their web site what they list for new, $540.00. I'd like to get 495.00 out of this. This is a face to face transaction only in Jacksonville, NC.

 I see in the pics it looks like there is a mark on the hand guard on one side, that is just lens dust, nothing on the hand guard."
