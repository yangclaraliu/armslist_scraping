Based on the same principles as the Remington 700 series, the Model 710 uses a centerfire bolt action cartridge, a 3 lug bolt system as opposed to the Remington 700's dual opposed locking lugs, with a 4 round detachable magazine (or a 3 round for the 7 mm Remington Magnum and the .300 Winchester Magnum). All can be equipped with a bipod and sling, and comes equipped with a gray or olive drab rugged all-weather synthetic stock, and a mounted Bushnell Sharpshooter, 3-9 × 40 scope which is bore-sighted from the factory. The Remington 710 is a moderately priced rifle. With the synthetic stock and the already mounted scope, it makes an adequate gun for the novice shooter or hunter.
This particular model has been heavily criticized, however, because many of the internal parts were made out of plastic, therefore bringing about many questions having to do with the durability of the rifle.
The Remington 710 was significantly improved by Remington and renamed the Remington 770. The 710 model is now discontinued.

Most of it is Spartan, some of it is Sellier Bellot. All of its brand new in the box.
You would pay from $17-19 per box of this stuff online or in store(plus shipping and tax).

So $100 for 6 boxes of this ammo is a good deal, best I could find anyhow.

The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle."

For Sale is my Blued Kel-Tec PF-9 (MSRP $285) with a LaserLyte Red Laser Sight, Zombie Edition, which retails for $90.  The PF-9 is the smallest and thinnest 9mm semi-auto on the market and it is a great Concealed Carry piece.  The pistol grip has been fitted with a Pachmayr slip on finger groove grip, usually about $15.  Underneath the Pachmayr grips are recoil absorbing pads.  If you've ever fired a small pistol, you'll know they have more recoil than a heavier pistol and these pads helped tame down the PF-9's kick.  Both magazines have had the PF-9 finger-extension floor plates added to them to help extend the grip and control the recoil, retail $18.  I am also including an Uncle Mike's IWB holster and a nylon mag pouch that can be worn on your belt horizontally or vertically.  That's another $20+ in accessories.  Also included are the Kel-Tec Owners Manual and a black nylon pistol case $12. 

PF-9 Bud's Gun Shop MSRP $282 after S&H, Insurance, FFL Fees you're paying $350.00
You also get:
Two (2) PF-9 Finger-extension floor plates, $18.00
Pachmayr slip-on grip and recoil pads, $20
LaserLyte Red Laser Sight, Zombie Edition, $90
Total not to include tax and shipping I already paid, $478.00.  I am asking $103 less and Plus the case and single magazine pouch for that spare mag.  $375.00 takes it.  

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.  Included are two 7 round rectangular magazines with the finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

BEFORE CONTACTING ME, PLEASE READ:  Yes... there is another seller in Tampa with a PF-9 and his is selling for $100 cheaper.  His also doesn't have the over $150 in accessories that this one comes with.  If you want a stripped down model, buy his.  If you want the fully loaded Cadillac, then send me an email.  $375 Firm.  Not Negotiable."

It was purchased about a month ago and has since loosed about 15 bolts total, just enough to get a good zero on the scope. Barnett is one of the top manufacturers of crossbows, you can do the research if you have not heard of them before. This setup is rated at 350 fps and has a draw weight of 175 lbs. That is in the upper echelon of performance, you could hunt grizzly bears if you felt inclined. This package comes with the bow, a fully adjustable scope with an illuminated reticle (already zeroed), a rope cocker, a 3 bolt quiver, a few wrenches, string wax, and 13 bolts. The bolts are also made by Barnett, are of a high quality carbon fiber, and are all the same size and weight. They each come with a field point, no broadheads. I am however missing 1 field point, other than that it is a complete barely used package. The only reason I am selling is because I am looking to get into traditional archery using a take down recurve bow. I am not in a hurry to sell, so no lowball offers. The bow new is $500 and ten Barnett carbon fiber 20"" bolts are $70 so I believe this is a fair price. I do not check my e-mail. The best way to contact me is by cell phone, my number is 941-920- Nine two fifty three. Texts would be easiest. If the ad is still up the crossbow is still available, I'm good about managing my ads.

The SIX8 weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

I don’t know if these guns have ever been fired.  They are both in excellent condition.  The shotgun has some scuff marks on the underside of the shoulder stock, but that’s the only flaw.  If you are interested in these, I’d suggest doing some research of your own, as I’d like the buyer to be comfortably informed. For questions and inquiries please feel free to call Scott at 687-8026.  
Here’s some background information I’ve found about these sets:
Limited edition Winchester Coca-Cola Centennial Commemorative rifle and shotgun set.  30/30 Lever action Model 94AE XTR numbered 0960 of 2500, and Model 1500 XTR 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun. These are fairly scarce.  Produced in 1986 as part of an order of 2500 sets, actual production fell short of 2000, due to cancellation by Coca-Cola. The guns were warehoused after cancellation, and later distributed to Coca-Cola executives and employees. Stocks feature select American Walnut with deep-cut, spade checkering and semi-gloss finish, and 100th Anniversary Medallion. I do not have the original boxes/packaging.   .30-30 Serial # 0960 / 12 Gauge Serial # 86CC960.  This is the matching pair for set number 0960. 
These sets were ordered by a Coke VP to be given away at a Coke banquet. He ordered 2500 sets. During production of these sets, a higher-level executive in the organization found out about the order, and since Coke is very protective of their image, the production was stopped.  It is uncertain as to how many sets were actually made. This set is 0960 of 2500. The part of the order that was finished was later on sold to Coke employees only. The set consists of a 30/30 Winchester and a Model 1500 12 Gauge Shotgun. This listing is for the set.  $2200.00 OBO

Listing title is ""FOR SALE/TRADE: ACOG 4X ILLUMINATED CROSSHAIR RETICLE W/ RMR""


I emailed the guy, and told him everything that was obviously fake about it..
He just got pissed off at me, called me a few not very pleasant things, and told me he is keeping the ad up until he sells it to ""someone that isn't trying to cheat me""

Y'all, remember... He is the one selling a $40 knockoff ACOG for $1,000
WILL TRADE FOR:

Here's a list of the top 15 things I immediately noticed wrong about his optic...
15 Problems I noticed right away with this ACOG...

1. No bevel around the eyepiece on the rear
2. Painted white letters saying Trijicon instead of raised lettering built into the optical housing. 
3. No different colored o-rings on your turret caps
4. The ""wings"" to mount the RMR base to the optical housing are shaped wrong, they're supposed to be angled at 45 degrees, not flat 90 degree angles. (For structural support against impact)
5. The housing and the base are the same color. On real ones, the base is typically shiny, while the housing is more of a matte finish. They're supposed to be two different materials
6. That reticle doesn't exist as an option on real ACOG's
7. The screw holes on the base aren't even the same height... He manufacturer can't even drill a straight hole!
8. Turret caps are the wrong shape. No bevel, serrations are too long. No I letting for caps to seal up against the housing.
9. The housing isn't even close to the being right shape.
10. No pin through the front of the fiber optic connecting it to the walls
11. Fiber optic clear piece isn't perfectly clear like it's supposed to be
12. The walls that are supposed to surround the fiber optic housing on top don't cover almost any of if. These walls are to protect the fiber optic from being damaged if dropped. 
13. The RMR mount doesn't have the front ""legs"" on it
14. Turret caps don't have the steel cables on them to keep them from falling off
15. This might be the most important one... Nowhere in your ad did you specify a model. Anyone who is selling an actual trijicon ACOG will always add the specific model in because they know the best way to sell it is to put that as the title so other people can search the value of it. They also won't sell an ACOG worth $1,900 for $1,000... 

I can point out 10 more things, but y'all get the idea. Don't buy this
Here's some pictures of the real TA31F-RMR to compare for yourself, there's an obvious difference"

$2,000.00
I don’t know if these guns have ever been fired.  They are both in excellent condition.  The shotgun has some scuff marks on the underside of the shoulder stock, but that’s the only flaw.  If you are interested in these, I’d suggest doing some research of your own, as I’d like the buyer to be comfortably informed. For questions and inquiries please feel free to call Scott at 687-8026.  
Here’s some background information I’ve found about these sets:
Limited edition Winchester Coca-Cola Centennial Commemorative rifle and shotgun set.  30/30 Lever action Model 94AE XTR numbered 0960 of 2500, and Model 1500 XTR 12 gauge semi-auto shotgun. These are fairly scarce.  Produced in 1986 as part of an order of 2500 sets, actual production fell short of 2000, due to cancellation by Coca-Cola. The guns were warehoused after cancellation, and later distributed to Coca-Cola executives and employees. Stocks feature select American Walnut with deep-cut, spade checkering and semi-gloss finish, and 100th Anniversary Medallion. I do not have the original boxes/packaging.   .30-30 Serial # 0960 / 12 Gauge Serial # 86CC960.  This is the matching pair for set number 0960. 
These sets were ordered by a Coke VP to be given away at a Coke banquet. He ordered 2500 sets. During production of these sets, a higher-level executive in the organization found out about the order, and since Coke is very protective of their image, the production was stopped.  It is uncertain as to how many sets were actually made. This set is 0960 of 2500. The part of the order that was finished was later on sold to Coke employees only. The set consists of a 30/30 Winchester and a Model 1500 12 Gauge Shotgun. This listing is for the set.

American Western Arms lightning pump action rifle in 44.40.  I don't think this one has ever been fired, it looks mint and new and just has two extremely small dings in the wood on the butt stock.  Hardly noticeable and will not show up in a photo.  Factory engraved receiver with the AWA logo.  Very sharp looking rifle.  These retail for nearly $1000.  I will accept $700. 

2.  Smith and Wesson antique break top revolver.  I believe this is in .32 caliber.  It has a 5 shot cylinder. I have never fired it, just kept it because it appears to have never been fired.  I can't say for sure, but the bore looks mint and there is no slop in the cylinder at all.  Grips are perfect.   There is no model number on the pistol.  I am guessing it is from the early 1900's. $300. 

3.  Harrington and Richardson, Worcester, Mass.  Break top, 5 shot revolver in .38 S&W Ctge.  Excellent condition, about 95% blue remains.  Grips are perfect and bore looks outstanding.  I believe it is missing the tiny spring near the trigger that gets the trigger to spring back into position.  Other than that, it seems to function great.  Nice old collector!  $180.

cent auction !!!!!!! 100% NIB SCAR 17 FDE / TAN I just picked up. This is new production,Please note I do not have a retail shop and or exhibit at gun shows. With that, you will not have an on-the-shelf rifle, where potential buyers and tire-kickers have 'finger played' with the rifle over and over - pulling the trigger and charging the bolt ten times. This rifle has never been played with !!!!! No trial shots and minor scratches on the rail. It is all flawless. I can remove the 20rd magazine,he rifle comes with everything offered by F.N

Just learned, thanks to my wife, I have an adjustable gas block on the way for this so it goes with the rifle (this was the first upgrade I was going to do so this rifle won't be up for too long). I love this rifle and worked for approximately 2 years to get it and I found out that I am a bolt and lever guy, go figure. This rifle is in very good shape with a nick in the finish on the brass deflector, which is common as you probably know. It does not have forward assist. I believe I may be the second owner but I have no way of knowing for sure since I purchased it retail. It is a 308 and the barrel looks fantastic so it has more life left in it than I could afford to shoot. It is an AR so it is tough as nails. Enough selling, it will be worth it to someone to own. You either like these or not. I am looking to sell for $1,700.00 obo or trade for good bolt action rifle(s) and cash. Calibers I am looking at would be 223, 243, 270, 30-06 and especially 308 but these are not the only calibers that interest me so I will consider all offers. Would also consider Thompson rifles with multiple barrels/calibers (no ML barrels though). I am ready to let this go but I won't take a beating or rush a decision so feel free to make offers and please be patient. Anyone who has dealt with me knows I am fair and honest and I get bored quick so this will only be posted for a week or so since I have plans to start upgrading if not gone soon.  I will post a picture as soon as I can.

I have a new model Super with the 5 1/2 barrel in 44 MAG. Gun is used but in great mechanical condition. These are real heavy duty weapons. Perfect for a hunting sidearm and with the shorter barrel, a little more comfortable with the smaller sidearm holster. The only flaws are a small nick in one of the grips and some scratches on the bottom of the extractor slide housing. This gun is a great shooter and with it's action being single, it is very safe as a carry gun."

Huldra's 5.56 x 45 Upper is a standard mil-spec part that will work on any mil-spec AR lower. The mid-length piston system will give the benefits of a longer forearm by having a more ergonomic grip and longer sight radius for quicker acquisition and less felt recoil. The Huldra patented piston system runs cleaner, cooler and longer than any other AR. The piston parts and barrel are treated with the salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. The Melonited process gives the barrel higher lubricity, longer life and a uniform coating and resistance to build-up. The barrel chambers are speed polished to reduce resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber.

809,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2435809,For Sale:  Standard Pressure Short Barrel Low Flash Heavy .38 Special Ammo - 150 gr. Hard Cast Wad Cutter (850fps/M.E. 241 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 23,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 11, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=111

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo in the loadings whenever possible as over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20D utilizes a very hard cast 150gr. WAD CUTTER bullet. The bullet is made hard, so it won't deform or mushroom. It cuts/crushes a ""cookie cutter"", full diameter hole in human flesh just like it does on a paper target. It penetrates deeply (roughly 14 to 16 inches in human tissue) and its full diameter profile maximizes blood loss as it cuts and crushes (not slips or slides) its way through tissue. Although I've never been shot with a full profile wad cutter bullet, I must assume that the initial impact of that wide flat nosed bullet, is crushingly formidable. As a teenager, I took to the woods on a regular basis and killed many a critter with heavily loaded 38SPL wad cutters'. The effect of a full profile wad cutter on small game was obvious and amazing, compared to regular round nosed bullets. That flat nose, literally hammers living things. These bullets are hard and properly lubed and will NOT lead your barrel. Note my velocities from real world ""over the counter"" revolver s- NOT TEST BARRELS!

The main reason for this folly is the false notion that the Type 53 is of inferior quality when compared to its counterparts. Nothing could be further from the truth, but this very common opinion still seems to dominate collectors circles. The quality in manufacture of the Type 53 is quite high and the Type 53's place in history rivals any of the Model 1944's. In fact the combat use of the Type 53 may well be greater than any of the M44's. This article will be a brief introduction into the history and production of these little known and misunderstood carbines."
