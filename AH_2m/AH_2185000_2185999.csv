Rock River does not make this exact model anymore! They didn't make many, and they were all bought up recently. You are bidding on a very nice RRA CAR A4. It will ship in the original blue hard case.

You will find the ""RRA"" stamp on everything from the receiver to the stock, grip, etc! If you try to build this model using all these Rock River parts, plus Quadrail and Magpul Mbus flip-up rear sight and Pmag, you will have approximately $1400 invested, so bid on this one and get a bargain!

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

It has sat as a ""safe Queen"" and time to move it along to someone who will use it more than I.   Many firearm enthusiasts are of the opinion that the HK91 is the most rugged and reliable battle rifle ever built.   The HK91 is so rock-solid reliable, it is also known as the AK47 of the west.  Has the typical claw marks on the receiver from the factory HK claw mount.

Date code is IA which translates to 1980. It was imported by H&K thru their Arlington VA. operation, so this is a 100% HK rifle. It is also stamped on the receiver ""H&K Inc. Arlington VA.""Judging by the general overall condition and appearances of the magazine well, bolt carrier and barrel, I would say roughly 500 rounds through it but that is just a guess.  Other than that, no idea exactly how many rounds have been down the pipe but I would say a pretty low round count.

This rifle originally came from the factory with the black synthetic stock and accu trigger ($675). I customized this rifle for myself, but never fired it, used it, carried it. It is mounted on a walnut stained birch stock (that costs $170.00 alone) with the savage ""chief"" medallion set in the stock grip and comes with rubber recoil pad. The original stock synthetic trigger guard has been replaced with a low luster metal trigger guard (and also comes with another low luster metal trigger guard that will fit the synthetic stock if preferred, these metal trigger guards cost $25.00 a piece from the factory alone) and a 3-9x40 Bushnell scope with medium height rings has been mounted and the scope has been bore sighted. The barrel is completely free floated up to the receiver. The trigger guard and action screws have been appropriately torqued. It also comes with a new Savage (padded) leather sling with logo and rifle rings (worth over $65.00), and a black padded case with shoulder strap ($45.00). The original box and paperwork and accu trigger adjustment tool also comes with it. The trigger is set at about 3.5 pounds. This rifle is new, never carried, never used and never fired! ...All accessories that come with it are brand new!!

I also have 120 rounds of NIB (new in box) .243 ammo (it is visible in the 1st pic). One box of Remington 80 grain power soft point, two boxes of Federal 100 grain soft point and three boxes of Winchester100 grain power point. The ammo is worth over $185.00. It is brand new factory ammo, not reloads and comes with the rifle and extras also!

I originally customized this rifle for myself (fitted the action and free floated the barrel to the stock), but the economy being what it is I need to sell it (before I even try it). It is new, and you are getting all my work on it for free also.

I am only asking $575.00 for everything I just listed! I have over $1100.00 invested, not to mention my time. So someone is going to get a really good deal.

For anyone who knows anything about these this is more, than just an unbeatable deal!

Please only serious enquiries. I am losing allot of money on this (to say the least) already, so please do not ask for trades, or anything unreasonable.

The gunsmith told me that they only fired it to test the rifle but I have not put a single round through it. This rifle is very compact, light for an AK and is a Saiga (so quality hammer forged chrome lined barrel, bolt hold open, etc.). Saigas are made in the original Izhmash factory by the company that made the original AK in Russian(look it up). That means that the receiver and barrel (Hammer Forged Chrome Lined-highest quality) are as close to a real ak as you can get. I was planning on holding on to the rifle for a while but have some new life changes. Look it up, you will not get a russian made rifle with such a nice folding stock and the side mount for a scope rail and a tapco G2 trigger for this cheap. And unless you are a really really good gunsmith, you won't be able to convert it yourself with such a nice folding stock for this cheap either. Add 2% for paypal.

This is a beast of a gun, very sig like. A double stack 45 that holds 15 rounds with a very thin grip. Soaks up recoil like a champ, has a nice beaver tail, smooth DA/SA trigger.

Asking $500 firm. Don't link me sites that have it for less, after Shipping/FFL fees/Tax you can't get it for this price unless you're a dealer. And I myself paid $600 with tax at Gander Mountain because no other stores around Charlotte have it. Google, read and watch the reviews, it's a awesome gun. I'm just looking to fund another project is the only reason I'm selling. This is just the gun, case, and one mag as it comes new purchase.

 I was told that this gun fired off one mag about 25 years ago-And after seeing this gun I believe it, this could pass as never fired. After slowly, carefully stripping it down I've found most of the springs were just hardened stiff-and there was very little powder residue on the feed ramp. I cleaned it all out lubed it up and replaced all the springs with a set of Wilson Combat springs-a standard set-not competition springs. And that's it-everything else is original. As you can see the gun is flawless- If you didn't know better you would think it was never fired. Forget the fact that its not only a collectible gun-with a cool box-Its a mint Colt 1911 built in 1970-that feels and looks like a new one-and you can run it at the range-along with your other guns.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Despite its small size, the P224 maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.

will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.

Beretta PX4 Semi-automatic Double Action Full 40SW 4 inch(s) Polymer Blue 14Rd 2 Mags Picatinny Rail Ambidextrous 3 Dot JXF4F21

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

New Adjustable Sigths Kit
Other PX4 Accessories

8. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).
9. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
10. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. 11. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
12. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

Early 1980's production. Comes with one 6"" and one 8"" barrel. Has one magazine. Has nice factory original box, and paperwork. I have been watching these guns and their parts for a while now, and i can tell you that the barrels sell for right at $100 each, the grips around $30. a pair, the mags go for $25 or so, and the box seem to be worth about $40.00. Very collectable, especially in this condition with the box.  These are based off of the AR-7 survival rifle. Looks a lot like the old Mauser broomhandle pistols.

Please have valid MISSOURI I.D. and be legal to own a firearm. A signed bill of sale will be included. Can meet between downtown STL and the Festus area in a gun-friendly area. (Sporting goods store, shooting range, etc.) I do not take emails without a phone number seriously, and they will be treated as spam and discarded. I will remove the listing when it is sold."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."
