My serial number was produced in April 1939. Overwhelming odds are that this rifle saw active duty in WWII due to the high demand in those early years. Think about it... my serial number is 1**40 and troops were not fully issued until serial number 400,000+

Here is the reason it is stamped CAI:

1. America left a lot of firearms in foreign countries after WWII.
2. The gun control act of 1968 gave the ATF power to regulate imports.
3. ATF then started requiring all firearms entering America to be stamped by the importer. This included American arms ""returning' to our country.
4. So your serial number and ""CAI"" stamp simply means that the rifle left the country prior to 1968 and returned after that. A virtual guarantee that it saw active duty in at least one and possibly several wars.



I have 5 upper end contractor clips, and 5 mil spec 8rnd clips. I have recently added a Korean War Issue GI web sling to it as well.

                                             ***Note on ammo***
GP11 surplus ammo is not at all hard to find, and is match-grade in terms of accuracy. Usually you can buy it by the case for $0.60 per round online, or in most good gun shops for $0.75 per round. 


                                               ***General Info***
As mentioned in the title, I will be including a set of Lee reloading dies, a bag of NORMA brass (yeah, the good stuff. Trimmed and ready to go!), a partial box (18rds) of premium norma hunting ammo, and a bag of 100 Hornady 150gr .308 bullets (that's right, the 7.5x55 Swiss uses the same .308/7.62 projectiles that your 308Win, 30-06, etc. all use). If you need primers, I have one last box of 100 large rifle primers that you can have for a couple bucks if you need 'em.


                                              ***Rifle Details***
The rifle is in excellent condition. The stock has its knicks and scratches as is common for these rifles, but the bluing underneath the wood is *PERFECT* and the receiver metal looks great with just a little bit of wear. Also, all the numbers on this rifle match including the magazine, stock, and bolt. In addition, the rifle also has the original owner's name-tag with address on it. I looked him up and it seems his family is still around at that location (some folks have been able to contact the original owners of these things and have gotten pictures back of the soldier with the rifle. Pretty cool!). Also, it is possible to mount a scope to these rifles without drilling into the receiver! A clamp-on mount is made by swiss products and they are very popular and affordable. 

Anyway, I'm selling this to fund a new project, not because it is a bad rifle. I will be anywhere from Maple Valley to Everett tomorrow, so give me a call or text and I will probably be able to meet up with you at some point to make the sale. I'd really like to sell this tomorrow as I will be out-and-about!

If you have a trade offer, I may be interested but not if it is for something that isn't a firearm. 


                                            ***Cost Breakdown***
I think given the condition of the rifle, and the fact I will be including the reloading stuff, that $400 is fair. If you break it down that's $330 for the rifle, $25 for the dies, $22 for the bullets, and $23 for the ammo. If I sell the rifle, I need to get rid of at least the ammo at the same time as I have no other rifles in this caliber, and I can just ebay the dies. So for a minimum price, just the rifle and ammo, would be $353. 

**NOTE**: If you would like to buy it, but don't think my price is fair, or don't want the reloading stuff, please just make me an offer and I will let you know ASAP. There's no harm in asking me, worst I can say is no!

It has been barely fired, only 23 rounds through the barrel; was testing both Chip MctoCormik power magazines and a stock milspec magazine. The Springfield Range Officer is built upon the same machining process there is to a Springfield TRP, right down to it, they both have the same barrels; however the price difference reflects on the differences of amenities and features such as front strap checking, cocking serrations, accessories rail, etc. However the accuracy, form, and function is still up to standard as the flagship, also it gives a clean platform to begin customization. As much as I love to dump more money into my Range Officer, that has become a problem for me, it has since become a safe queen and all I really do now is find some way to spoil it after a paycheck.

I bought myself a PPQ, I'm just content with that and have decided its time for me to part ways with my Range Officer. I'm going to miss this all steel fine piece of craftsmanship, but its been taxing on me and my personality to own it.

Due to health reasons unable to go. It was built on a brand new barreled action from Weatherby in 2012. AI hand crafted a Super Fancy piece of Claro Walnut and gave it a custom contrasting grip cap and fore end. They also installed there custom all steel free float chassis system and gave it 8 coats of there hand rubbed oil finish. A master engraver at Colt Firearms did the Beautiful wrap around Flure De Lure Checkering and Thumb Strap. Its amazing and flawless. She also hand engraved the floor plate as well. The blank alone was 800 before any work and the checkering was 700. Has amazing figure and fiddle running the full length of the blank. This rifle will kill the 338 Lapua and cut holes thru 1/4 inch steel plates at 600 yards like butter. Comes with one of only 200 made NRA limited edition slings that were only sold at the 2013 Dallas Safari Club Show and a Weatherby 3by9 Supreme Scope. 4300 invested. Thanks so much for looking.

I have a beautiful Ruger 10/22 magnum that has been a safe queen. I bought it thinking I would use to hunt predators at night, never happened. this gun literally does not have a mark on it. Shoots awesome, cycles cleanly, and has had very few rounds threw it. I believe it is the single extractor model. Scope is not included but the rings will remain on the rifle. Again there are no marks that I can notice either in the stok or on any part of the bluing or metal. Very nice example of the .22 mag in this Ruger. Shipping will be fixed at $40.00 to the lower 48 only. I will need a signed copy of the FFL destination sent to me before I ship rifle

This is an older model that is fairly hard to find these days.  It was my dad's varmint rifle that didn't get fired much.  Has been sitting in his safe for many years.  It has the original detachable magazine.  Wood is in really good condition although it has a couple minor knicks.  The metal is in good shape but does have the start of some oxidation near the muzzle, but it is minor as well.  Bore is shiny.  I would rate the gun around 85% condition.   

FTF transaction only with an Ohio resident 21 years or older.  You must be legally permitted to own this type of firearm and willing to show ODL or Ohio CCW license.  Will not ship.

Do NOT email and ask if the rifle is still available. If the ad is up, then it is still available.  I am not interested in any non-firearm trades."

The PT709 is a single stack, 7+1 round 9mm semi-automatic pistol.  It is just over six inches long (6.24″), four and a half inches high (4.52″), and an amazing one inch (1.04″) wide.  It has a steel slide with a polymer frame which adds up to a diminutive nineteen ounces. 

The PT709 is a striker-fired weapon with an interesting single-action/double action capability.  When a round is chambered, the trigger pull is always about 5-6 lbs in single action mode.  However, if a round fails to fire, the PT709 allows a second pull of the trigger in double-action mode (about 6-7lbs) without racking the slide.  It offers a true double-strike capability on a dud round without cycling the slide.  The PT709 has a nicely positioned thumb safety and a trigger safety like that of a Glock which allows for it to be safely carried with a round in the chamber.  It also has a firing pin block to prevent the weapon from firing unless the trigger safety has been pressed.  I like that safety redundancy in a CCW.

Besides the trigger safety there are other Glock-like features of the PT709 Slim, namely the way it’s disassembled.  Rather than removing a pin to free the slide, the 709 has a set of take-down latches on either side which free the slide.  A slide-lock release is just ahead of the thumb safety on the frame and the magazine release is nicely placed on the grip and easy to access.

I used a new Satern 20"" 416 stainless med heavy barrel that is fluted under the hand guard, it is threaded 5/8""-24 for muzzle devices. This barrel has Saterns 5R point cut rifling. It is .875"" under the gas block and .800"" at the muzzle end. This barrel uses rifle length hand guard and gas port location. The gas block is clamp on type unit from Badger. I used a new Mega side charger upper with the extra heavy wall thickness and beautiful anodized finish. The carrier is a new Young Machine national match side charge, that I sent out to WMD for Nickel Boron coating. The firing pin is a matching Young machine stainless piece. The bolt is from AR performance and uses a special extractor just for the Grendel round. I polished the bolt face and bore. The hand guard is the standard black anodized light weight aluminum vented free float tube with knurling and a sling mount. I confirmed the headspace of the ARP bolt to the barrel chamber using PGT go no-go gauges and it is perfect. Included is a new BCM Mod3 Gunfigfighter charging handle. Thread protector is also included. This upper has 15 rounds on it, and functions perfectly. This upper shoots .5""-.7"" 5 shot groups using Hornady 123 grain SST ammo #8152 purchased from a local Academy for $24.99/box. This kind of accuracy is pretty impressive from Factory ammo. This upper is in mint condition. I am very impressed with this upper, and its excellent accuracy without using a custom hand load. Hate to sell it, tax time is coming so it has to go.
