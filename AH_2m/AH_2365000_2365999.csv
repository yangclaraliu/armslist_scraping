I have an almost full (45 rounds) box of .38 special, 158 grain JHP's and an HK #36 speedloader that I'd like to trade.  The speedloader works for most 5 shot revolvers, Taurus M85, S&W J frames, the Ruger LCR and others, I was using it with a S&W Bodyguard .38.

I'm looking for .40 caliber glock mags only, I have a Glock 27 so any size is fine, though I would prefer G22 or G23 mags.

Depending on how many you have and if you are the type that reloads I also have a fair amount of .38 special brass (somewhere between 200-400 cases, I'll have to check) that I can add.

Phoenix iwb holster information 

This holster is currently in use by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation.
________________________________
This holster is a mix of todays most popular and comfortable iwb holsters. It has features taken from Versa Max, Dakota Defender, Summer Special, N82 Holster and the Crossbreed. 

I have been working on this holster for about 2 years. It is designed for comfort from the ground up and has a smaller footprint than most, but has a larger back to contour to the users body without having the double layer of leather that at times can poke at you when you least excpect it. 

This is the IWB holster I now use when I carry inside the waist band.

Features 
________
1: Medical grade Neoprene backing with sweat wicking material that provides padding and comfort for the user as well as a sweat blocker that stops sweat from getting to the weapon. 

2: Wide loop attachment points to distribute the weight of the gun onto a larger area but without having a much larger holster body. 

3: Reinforced mouth for ease of reholstering.

4: Thiner body than most iwb holsters. No sharp edges to poke you. 

5: Sweat shield with combat cut to allow a full grip on the weapon.

6: Flatter back with most of the weapon away from the body (not a completely flat back but close) for comfort. Holster holds gun tight to the body for better concealment. 

7: Pull the dot snaps for security.

8: Hand sewn with the saddle sitch for more strength than a sewing machine lock sitch can provide.

9: Cant can be adjusted from roughly 12 to 27 degrees."

385,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2365385,For Sale:  NEW Magpul CTR commercial stock + LaRue RISR cheek rest riser NEW,"LAX, Los Angeles, California",$ 85,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 25, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand New Magpul commercial spec CTR stock with LaRue Tactical RISR reciprocating inline stock riser!

Up for sale is a brand new combo package consisting of a Magpul commercial spec CTR stock and a LaRue tactical RISR reciprocating inline stock riser.

The CTR™ (Compact/Type Restricted) is a drop-in replacement butt stock for carbines using commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR™ also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes wobble for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. The CTR™ Stock includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

The LaRue Tactical RISR solves the age old dilemma that many owners have… It's a fact that some rifles need a cheek riser to get proper cheekweld and eye relief when using optics. It's another fact that standard charging handles require a lot of travel, making it impossible to charge a rifle without moving a collapsible stock all the way to the rear. The LaRue RISR solves these problems. The RISR is spring-loaded, and travels to the rear as the charging handle is moved to the rear. When the charging handle is released, the RISR snaps forward. Designed to fit the excellent Magpul CTR butt stock without modification, the RISR only takes a few minutes to install with a phillips-head screwdriver.

MSRP for the MagPul CTR stock is $100, MSRP for the RISR is $60, but our combined price for the pair is nearly half off! You can’t afford to pass this up!

(NOTE: Due to the many different manufacturers of commercial spec buffer tubes and the dimensional differences between them, we cannot guarantee a perfect fit on each and every buffer tube. For example, we know from experience that Bushmaster made buffer tubes are slightly larger than other tubes and as such the CTR stock is quite snug until the parts break in properly. However, most customers report that the CTR stocks fit most commercial spec buffer tubes without issue.)

Spike's Tactical Lightweight .223/5.56x45 caliber Complete Upper Receiver assemblies for AR15/M16 type Rifles. These rifles feature a 14.5"" Light Weight barrel with permanently attached DynaComp muzzle break for 16"" total length and Spike's 12"" BAR 4 Rail Free Float Handguard. Complete Upper receiver assembly.

Specifications:

Spike's Tactical M4 flat top upper receiver, Machined from a 7075 T6 Mil-Spec Forging with Mil-Spec Type III Hard coat Anodized finish, T-markings, Spike’s logo and M4 feed ramps.
Barrel is certified MIL-B-11595E CMV. Bolt & barrel are HPT/MPI tested, M4 barrel extension, Chrome chamber and bore, 5.56mm Nato chamber, 1:7 Twist, Magnetic particle testing on every barrel, Phosphate finish.
Lightweight (Pencil) Profile with Mid-length gas system.

Spike's Tactical 12"" BAR 4 Rail Free Floating Handguard.
Pinned Spike's Tactical DyanComp Muzzle Break.

The Spike's Tactical 12” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The 12” BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA.

The bolt matches this rifle and when I shot it it had no head space issues. 
I want $300 for this rifle and that is firm. The stock has a few dings and dents but a far cry from the ones available at Fleet Farm as of late. 
This rifle, though not pictured, will include a pig sticker bayonet.

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a  last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight.

    The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a two-tone or Nitron® (shown) finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom rosewood grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

I took this on trade the week of 11/18/2013 towards a rifle I sold.
I planned to keep it if my wife wanted it for herself or resell it.
She likes it but doesn't want it, so I am offering it to you for sale.

Handgun MUST BE TRANSFERRED via a FFL.  I will ship it but it will have to be transferred to my local FFL and then shipped to your FFL of choice.

I will easily ship to California.  This handgun is New York & California legal, I will have to look into New Jersey.

Will meet at your local FFL with in 100 mile radius of Erie, PA.  I will require a $100 deposit via PayPal if we are going to meet.  Reason being I am not going to drive for 2 hours to meet a buyer and wait to find out they blew me off and didn't call to say something came up.

If you do not want the hand gun after checking it out then I will refund your deposit, I can do this right from my phone.

This revolver is in excellent shape.  I am told by the original owner than it has had one box of rounds through it, so I am assuming he meant 50 rounds.  Either way we're talking 25-100 rounds depending on what he shot.

Nice compact but heavy (26oz) frame to help combat the recoil of the .357 Mag.

Remington 770 .300 Win Mag (Bolt Action) w/ Factory Scope and 3rd Detachable Magazine. I bought this rifle earlier this year.  It only has 6 (six) rounds put through it. No blemishes or malfunctions. It has been lubricated with GunZilla and stored in the box it came in. Scope (3-9x40) has been zeroed at 100m. This rifle is deadly accurate and I hate to sell it. The rifle chambers rounds effortlessly and I have had no malfunctions with it. Composite black body and stock with a blued barrel. Great beginner/expert rifle for someone who wants tremendous firepower. This weapon can take down any animal in North America. With the weapon comes 2x 20 (twenty) boxes of Remington Core-Lokt 180gr and 1x 14 (fourteen) box of the same ammo. It has only been to the range once and cleaned with care that a weapon deserves.

I took it to the range and fired one box (50) through it and snapped the photo that you see right after. I was thrilled with the pistol. It was extremely accurate and smooth.

I brought it home and preceded to do a basic field strip per the manual to clean it well. During reassembly I lightly scratched the slid and receiver when reinserting the slide stop. This was the first 1911 based pistol I had ever cleaned and apparently this is a common mistake for us newcomers. So much so that if you Google, ""1911 idiot scratches"" you'll see. This made me feel a bit better about my error.

Nevertheless I have decided to part with Colt. This would make an awesome carry gun! I have tried to provide good quality photos for you to judge. The gun is literally as close to new as possible and it has proven to have tight tolerances by firing 50rds right out of the box with not a single feeding or ejection issue.

I am also including a very nice leather pocket holster and a Tex Shoemaker & Sons single mag pouch.

In some photos it may appear that the bluing is uneven this is ONLY the lighting. The finish is beautiful and consistent. One of the best Colt bluing jobs I've seen in years.

CZ 03050 CZ 527 Carbine Bolt 7.62mmX39mm 18.5"" Walnut Blue

The Carbine is an intermediate range 'brush gun.' This handy rifle features
open sights, a straight comb walnut stock and weighs less than 6 pounds!
It's the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is
chambered for the popular 7.62x39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger
shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as
deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. Both cartridges offered in the 527
Carbine model are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage.
The barrel of the 7.62x39 has a .311 bore, contributing to its excellent
accuracy with inexpensive surplus ammo.
