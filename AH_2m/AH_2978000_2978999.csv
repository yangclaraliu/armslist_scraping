Never been mounted or used. Kept in box at all times. Retail price at Trijicon is $1550 and $1317.50 (green dot) at Amazon. Asking price $920+FREE SHIPPING.                                                                                        
The Accupoint 5-20X 50 Mil-Dot Crosshair Riflescope is Trijicon's longest-range scope ever. With advanced fiber optics, tritium aiming-point illumination, a huge 50-millimeter objective lens, and easy-to-use windage/elevation and parallax adjusters, the scope provides tactical shooters, varmint hunters, as well as law enforcement snipers the ability to accurately extend their range in any light. The scope comes equipped for any lighting conditions with a 3-inch sunshade. A 30-millimeter tube offers a greater range of mounting options and unmatched long eye relief of 3.8 to 4.1 inches, protects against the recoil of higher caliber rifles. And, the Accupoint's Tritium lamp operates entirely without batteries, eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field.

The Accupoint is Illuminated through the use of fiber optics for automatic light adjustments and a built-in self-luminous Tritium Phospor Lamp. The powerful scope provides a vivid crosshair Mil-Dot aiming reticle with green illumination without the need for failure-prone batteries. A dual-illumination system automatically adjusts the aiming-point brightness to existing lighting conditions for a faster and easier performance in variable light. A manual brightness override allows shooters to easily adjust the reticle to suit their preferences. A multilayer-coated lens provides superior light transmission with no distortion and unsurpassed edge-to-edge optical clarity. The scope is equipped with easy-to-use external turret controls for windage and elevation adjustment and a side parallax adjuster for enhanced accuracy at long range.

Backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against manufacturer's defects, the Accupoint riflescope is crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. Water resistant to depths of 10 feet, the Accupoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

The Accupoint 5-20X 50 Mil-dot Riflescope comes complete with a sunshade, a set of lenscaps, a lenspen, a Trijicon Logo Sticker, a manual, and warranty card. The Lenspen features a safe and easy to use retractable dust removal brush and a special non-liquid cleaning element, designed to never dry out. The die cut Trijicon Logo sticker measures at 3 x 2.75 inches and is made from durable red and black silk-screened 4-millimeter white opaque vinyl that can be applied to any flat surface for a permanent stick. The warranty covers the riflescope's metal structure and optics for lifetime and the Tritium Lamp for 15 years."

Up for trade is a USED Glock 23, GEN 3, with exactly 250 rounds through it. Pistol was purchased by me from the Marksman in May of 2010. It comes with the original case, two fired rounds from the factory, three (3) 13 round magazines, and night sights (sorry, no factory paperwork). Take a look at the pictures and you will see that there are NO scratches, dents or dings on this pistol. It was cleaned, lubed, and stored after every range visit. As is typical of Glocks, it has fired with every squeeze of the trigger with no FTF or FTE. Absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, just getting away from striker-fired pistols.

I would like to trade my G23 for something that shoots .45 ACP, 5.56mm, 30.06, OR 7.62x51 (NO STRIKER-FIRED PISTOLS PLEASE).  I have 150 rounds of UMC .40 cal FMJ and 27 rounds of Federal 180 grain HST JHP to even up the trade if your trade has more value.  I would really like to trade for an M1A and obviously would add cash.   

I am located in Lacey and would be willing to travel approximately 30 minutes in any cardinal direction, maybe a little further for the right trade.  FTF will be conducted in a public place of my choosing.  I am an honest guy that treats people fairly and I expect the same from those that I conduct business with.  If you don’t fit in this category then go bother someone else.  If you do not intend on fulfilling your part of a gentlemen’s agreement then go bother someone else. 

CPL and DL from the state of Washington is a must.  If you are military contact me and we will work it out.  I will require a peek at both (no pics) documents and will do a transfer of ownership for both parties that will go no further than my safe.

Send me an email through Armslist and I will respond ASAP.  More pics available upon request."

I've only put 100 rounds through this rifle, I sighted it in with ease, and I have no problems except for a $8 30rd magazine that I bought for it. I've mainly shot it with the standard two 10rd magazines that come with it and they have worked great. You get the rifle, the sight tool, the case, and the manual. This gun also folds in half for easy storage and it has a built in bi-pod (not the sturdiest). This gun is light and it packs a solid punch.

If you have a concealed carry permit I'll transfer direct. If you do not you will have to make the transfer through a local FFL holder. I know of a local hardware store that will do the transfer paperwork for $35. Buyer is responsible for any fees charged by the FFL holder. 

Due to repeated contacts asking, buyer must come to Clarkston, WA to purchase.  If you don't know where this is, you're probably too far away. If you still really need to know, please use google maps or something similar to find it (like the link near the top of the page provided by Armslist).  If you ask me how far away I am from you, I'm going to ask you to read this ad again.  I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but I've had many many people ask the same exact question, or just offering to come purchase, and after several emails they realize they are 6 hours away, thus wasting my time and theirs.

Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one. 
Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know.  Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top, maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm or other 1-6x optics.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,
.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Has about a 10"" threaded barrel (just need to dremel off the barrel nut). As I went through it I noticed that the action is tighter and cleaner than any of the other AKs I have owned. These are produced with unfinished wood furniture so it can be stained and lacquered to your liking. Look on you tube and other reviews- I have ONLY seen really great reviews on performance, reliability, and customization. I hate to let it go, but life has its ways of changing on us.

eliminates the problems of poor ignition of slow burning magnum powders.

Some of you sellers and buyers on here are well up to date (thankfully) with the state restrictions and ORC's which prohibit the sale of a ""handgun"" to any persons under twenty-one. 

Now read this next part carefully. 

However a lot of you don't know that it IS LEGAL to sell a handgun to any person under twenty-one years of age AND at least eighteen years of age IF he/she is a member of the armed forces or the Ohio National Guard or he/she is an appointed LEO in the state. 

Now the finale, for those that don't believe this, it was amended in 2009 by the state and below are links to the signing AND the ORC (Ohio Revised Code) section itself. Read up my friends.

it seems to like the 170gr corelokts which I can supply a few rounds of and brass aswell. its minute of deer out to 150 yards with the simmons 3-9 scope

524,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2978524,"For Sale:  Armalite AR10 12.5"" SBR/Pistol Upper Half","South Side, Jacksonville, Florida",$ 999,"Listed On: Monday, June 16, 2014",Rifles,Armalite                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a custom made upper half for Armalite B models (uses their excellent steel magazines) w/ a 12.5"" barrel.  It features the gas system of a Noveskie Leonidas, between carbine and mid length.  IIRC it gets like 94% of the power from the cartridge, >2400 fps even with 175 grain ammo.  Keeps your Suppressed OAL down

Aimpoin & mount NOT included.    

Obviously, I cannot sell a lower half w/ this upper nor can I knowingly sell the upper to a guy who has only non NFA AR10 rifle lowers to put it on.  But you can get a new stripped receiver for $228 on the internet +$25 dealer fee and do a pistol build w/ a sig arm brace.  You can just leave it as a ""pistol"" or you can later convert it to a SBR when you get a NFA Form 1 back from the ATF. 

That is a JP rifle lenght HG system.  I'll throw in a front sight rail and two 2"" accessory rails, I belive I have a 4"" rail too. It is painted OD green w/ Brownells Alumahyde. The HG is flush w/ the muzzle, but at least an inch of it can be ground off if you want to bring the HG back behind the shoulder to make clearance for a silencer mount or  whatever.  Shorter tubes can be purchased from JP for ca $80

The barrel was made from a brand new Armalite chrome lined 20"" Hbar that I had cut, contoured, drilled & threaded by Adco.  The barrel is .750"" from chamber to journal, then ca .740 to the muzzle shoulder, w/ standard 5/8"" threads.  I had this made b/c I wanted something lighter than the noveskie upper, and with a more durable chrome bore, and that I could put a heat sink on so that the barrel would hopefully never have to be changed.  

Here is a google search pic of the ""JP Thermal dissipator"" heat sink


Upper is standard Armalite w/ regular chaging handle & BCG w/ recent version extractor & spring.  Lookign at it, it has some scuffs from rubbing on uther guns in the safe, but not too bad. 

Gas block is a Palladin Machine three position: unrestricted, suppressed & off. Here is a pic that looks similar.  A norrow flat head screwdriver easily fits in the handguard slot to adjust.


I should mention have an extra standard barrel nut and a T barrel nut in case you need them so you want it for a different handguard system.  I might consider selling parts if I can't sell the upper, but I have the gas block staked every which way and everything secure on there real well, it would be a hassle to dissassemble it when it is secured together and proved functional.  New gas tubes are availible if you want to use a new gas block.

Was planning on shipping w/o a muzzle device.  It has a Troy Claymore on it but would probably like to keep unless you really want it.  I also have a loose A2.

I have 678 rounds through it in the nearly 5 yrs since I put it together.  It runs perceftly, even w/ the suppressor on there w/ the adjustable gas block. 

Ultimately, the gun is just heavier than I wanted by the time I got it all accessorized and I'd rather sell and use the funds for some lighter weight AR15 projects.  W/ slash buffer, commercial AR15 M4 stock assembly (w/o saddle), the 2.8oz muzzle device, a couple sling studs it weigs 7.71 lbs, w/o sights.  Loose the heat sink and it comes down to about 7.5lbs.  If one put a 7 or 9"" HG tube on there it would be noticably lighter as well.  As shown (w/o the aimpoint, the upper half weighs 5.50 lbs. 

I also have a bunch of new 20 & 25 rd Gen 2 steel mags I'll sell; let me know. $25 for the 20's and $35 for the 25s, a few are in the wrapper even.

I also have a JP offset handguard sights I'll sell. 

I also have extra 2"" accessory rail sections and 4"" accessory rail sections.

I've barely shot it, mostly function testing, proving it runs w/o stoppages w/ and w/o suppressor.  One shoot it from a rest one day @ 200 yards w/ a 3x9 and it did 3/4 MOA:"

Federal ammunition is some of the hottest, highest-quality ammunition available today, which is loaded to NATO specifications. Each Federal XM855F3 cartridge contains an SS109 bullet – signifying the fact that each bullet is a 62gr full metal jacket with a steel penetrator and a lead core. Each reloadable cartridge is non-corrosive and is suited for use in any AR-15 chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO.  This is the same ammunition used by the United States Armed Forces.

Online stores sell three hundred rounds of Federal XM855F3 5.56 ammo for $249.16 plus shipping, so those of you who wanna complain that this is ""too expensive"" can move along.  I'm only asking $180 PER BOX of 300 rounds, which is exactly how much I paid for it at Cabelas.  If you can get it cheaper elsewhere, feel free to do so.  I'm only looking to get my money back out of this since I sold my AR.

MUST meet in Fond Du Lac tomorrow (Weds) late afternoon or early evening.  I'm from 
south of Milwaukee up with my daughter to visit in-laws tomorrow, so I don't plan on making the drive again any time soon.

This rifle is the best semi-automatic rifle ever built on the .308 / 7.62x51 NATO AR platform (just my opinion of course but I've shot every top of the line .308 built on this platform and this has outperformed them all). S&W began manufacturing these rifles last year in order to compete with the Armalite and Colt AR10 series rifles. They have went above and beyond what was needed to ensure the reliability and quality of these rifles. I currently own 2, one of which is mine that I will never be selling, and the other I purchased for my wife who ended up deciding to stick with her 5.56 and pass on the .308. The rifle comes with an ambidextrous safety, mag release and bolt release which definitely favors the left handed shooter. Being a righty I thought it would bother me as I consider myself somewhat close minded when parts on rifles change but to be 100 percent honest it's really nice to have these availabilities on both sides of the rifle. You never really know what situation may arise where you need these extra features. They never get in the way when handling to fire and fit very nicely into the design of the rifle. I have added the Ruger RDS (rapid deploy sights) which are similar to the magpul BUIS but I personally like the sight picture a little better on these. And I'm by no means saying they are superior to the magpul sights because I currently have those on one of my other rifles but in this instance I prefer the Ruger set up. In all honesty the reviews speak for them self for this thing and I'm disappointed she doesn't want to keep it but it's got to go. It comes with the hard carrying case, 20 rd. P-mag, manual and lock. I paid 1550 plus tax and an additional 70 for the front and rear sights. I don't intend on losing my ass on a brand new rifle so I took 25 off what I paid and I don't mind sitting until it's gone. I'm easy to deal with and am willing to meet anywhere you'd like. All I ask is to take a picture of your ID so after you leave I'm covered. Thank you for your consideration and please contact me through email."

LOCK-N-LOAD® CLASSIC KIT

Price online $383.06
Item Number 085003
Weight	23.90 lbs
Quantity	1/EA


Four ways Lock-N-Load® Classic can improve your reloading:
1) SPEED

Lock-N-Load Technology lets you switch dies to a new caliber and begin reloading again in seconds. Automatic priming is hands-off and trouble free. The angled frame gives you easier access to your cartridges.

2) CONSISTENCY

Lock-N-Load Bushings let you adjust your dies once, then lock the setting into place, for consistent reloads every time.

3) PRECISION

The CNC machined die and ram openings create near perfect alignment of the ram and die, so cases are lined up properly with the dies at all times. This precision translates into greater accuracy. The strong, rigid frame also provides the stability necessary for precision reloading.

4) VERSATILITY

With Lock-N-Load, one press can handle multiple calibers with ease. There's no need to purchase multiple presses so you can leave your dies in place. Your dies will remain exactly as you set them, within their Lock-N-Load Die Bushings.

The Hornady Lock-N-Load Classic Reloading Kit comes with everything you need to turn out high-quality, accurate handloads. You get everything listed here, plus complete instructions. The Hornady Handbook of Cartridge Reloading is especially valuable, with hundreds of rifle and pistol loads for every shooting application.

I have an original WW2 Nazi marked p38 pistol for sale. It is cambered in 9mm and is a single/ double action firearm with a de-cocker. Has a 5 inch barrel with a nice bluing for the finish and original black grips.

Has at least 80% bluing remaining and is in good shape considering its age. Perfect working condition with nice bore and crisp trigger pull. All original parts with matching numbers. This is a non-import p38 with no import marks on it. 

The firearm shoots very nice, functions great. However, because of its old age and historical value I do not recommend shooting this pistol but rather keeping it for collection purposes. It is a piece of history.

The p38 is stamped ‘byf 43’ on its slide indicating it was made from the Mauser manufacturing plant for Germany in 1943. Also it has the Nazi ‘swastika under eagle’ proof mark on its slide and ‘eagle over 135’ proof marks declaring that this firearm passed regulations and was indeed issued to German forces during the second world war. Again, this particular firearm is all matching having the ‘eagle over 135’ proof marks on all its individual parts. 

The firearm will also come with its matching WW2 Nazi leather holster. The holster has ‘1943’ stamped on its back along with an ‘eagle with swastika over WaA706’ proof mark again indicating it came from the Mauser plant in 1943 and issued to German forces during the war. Interestingly, the holster has had its original belt straps removed for a leather strap that can be used for cross draw. 

Lastly, the p38 will come with two (2) 8 round magazines. One of these magazines is just a post war reproduction Walther p1 magazine. It comes in a parkerize finish. The other magazine is much older, is blued in finish, and appears to have the Nazi proof mark of an ‘eagle over 88’ stamped on it towered to bottom of the magazine. This seconded magazine is the one I got with the purchase of this firearm and I believe it was brought back with the gun originally after the end of the war. 

The story I got with the purchase of this firearm is intriguing. It goes that the firearm belonged to a German officer stationed to the east front against the Russians. It was told that this firearm was used and carried in the battle of Stalingrad. However, I do not know how true this story is, it might have been made up but is still a nice story to tell when showcasing this particular piece. 

I am asking $ 1,200 or best offer for the whole package: the p38, the holster, both magazines, a soft gun bag, and a padlock. Need FFL transfer for purchase. Feel free to offer I do not mind you checking out the firearm first before purchase, just please no low ball offers. Also, might consider trading for quality 1911 or Smith and Wesson 44 magnum. You can contact me if interested either through the email associated through this listing or my calling 951- three ten- 02 zero four.

Thanks, David"

It’s a hybrid between a Ruger Super Blackhawk .44 mag revolver and a Ruger New Vaquero Montado with a smaller XR3 style grip and special serrations found only on the Montado.   

The upper main frame is a Super Blackhawk stainless steel chambered in .44 Magnum with a 4-3/4 barrel and fiberoptic front sight.  The gun also has a special after market cylinder pin and custom lighter internal springs.    

The lower grip frame is a Ruger New Vaquero Montado, also in stainless steel.  The Montado was a special version of the New Vaquero and includes the older Ruger XR3 grip frame which is about the same size as the Colt SAA and smaller than the current Ruger grip frames found on most Ruger SAA guns.  The two frames mate up perfectly and work wonderfully together.  The gun shoots perfectly great!   Its especially comfortable for anyone with small to medium size hands and feels like holding a much smaller and less powerful gun than it is.  

If you’re wondering what happened to the Super Blackhawk lower grip frame and the Montado upper frame, they were combined and sold off to a friend so I no longer have them.   

Reason for selling this gun is that I buy guns to carry concealed and use and this one is more of a target shooter or bear gun.  Not something I would carry everyday.   I want to free up some cash to find another carry gun.  

With that in mind I have a few possible guns I might be willing to trade or part trade for. 

They are:

S&W Scandium J frame revolver (VERY interested in one of these)

Certain S&W J frame airweight revolvers.  Especially if moon clip capable. 

Rohrbaugh R9 

Certain Kahr models.   

S&W .44 mag models 3” barrel in stainless

Ruger LCR or LCRx, especially if it has a front night sight

Otherwise I’m asking $750 cash, OBO.   This is a one of a kind model that simply cannot be duplicated without great expense."

Just a very attractive and nice shooting 1911.

To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber!!!
