Since SBRs are 100% illegal in WA (can't even get a tax-stamp for them here) this is as short as you can go without the 'pistol' nonesense.

This AR15 is made from a Gas Piston PWS [complete] upper (only the charging handle was swapped out to a BCM Gunfighter) is the top of the line when it comes to Gas Piston ARs.
This is the upper:  http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=442&idcategory=44

Chambered in .223 Wylde -- it'll shoot .223 and 5.56 without a simple issue.  This upper is absolutely incredible.

Lower is from Spike's Tactical with a Geissele trigger.
I am the second owner.  Original owner had this made by professional gunsmiths at West Coast Armory in Bellevue.  He fired it one time.  I have since put exactly 110 rounds down her.  She shoots light and incredibly accurate.
Included is a Condor bag (rifle is so short I have to extend the stock all the way for both internal velcro straps to fit!), 4 Gen3 PMAGS, and I'll toss in 30 rounds.

This one is in perfect condition (I’ve owned it less than 2 months) and has an upgraded trigger by Apex Tactical.

If you read any reviews about the M&P everyone is quick to point out how gritty the stock trigger is.  In addition, people complain that there’s too much take up and no positive reset upon release of the trigger.  The upgraded trigger kit by Apex Tactical fixes all of this and includes a Glock-style trigger and safety, Forward Sear Set, and Reset Assist Mechanism (RAM).  The parts alone for this trigger job cost over $160 (I can show you the receipt if you’d like).

From Apex’s website, the trigger kit yields:
•	“Reduced trigger pre-travel and over travel to produce a feel similar to a single action fire control system.”
•	“A smooth trigger pull all the way through to the break.”
•	“Improved safety values through the use of a center mounted pivoting safety.”
•	”4lbs or 5.5lbs depending on which trigger return spring is installed with the kit.”

They have this to say about the RAM upgrade:
“The Apex Reset Assist Mechanism (Patent Pending) is a drop in part engineered to improve tactile trigger reset of your M&P pistol.  Along with improving the felt reset, the Apex RAM also serves as a failsafe in the unlikely event of a Trigger Return Spring breakage; keeping the trigger bar properly positioned under the sear and allowing the user to manually manipulate the trigger forward between shots.”

The trigger is amazing on this firearm now.  The only reason why I’m selling it is that despite acclaims of how great the grip feels I finally accepted that it just isn’t for me (I have long, slender fingers and a childhood finger injury that makes me pickier than most).

I currently have the 5.5lb trigger spring installed, but you could swap it for the 4lb one if you’d like.  I also have all of the original factory trigger parts if you ever want to re-install them.

In addition to the superb trigger job, this includes everything in the standard kit:
•	Blade-Tech® Kydex® Holster
•	Blade-Tech® Double Magazine Pouch
•	Maglula Uplula™ Speed Loader
•	3 Magazines (MA-Compliant 10-RND)
•	Cable Lock
•	Carry Case
•	Manual
•	3 different back straps to customize pistol grip

Why buy new when you can buy used and already have the trigger that you’re going to want anyway?  I’ll knock $25 off of the price if you don’t want/need the Uplula speed loader since I wouldn’t mind keeping that.  Otherwise, price for everything is $635 cash (no trades).  You must have a LTC-A to purchase (or even look at) this firearm.  We can do the transfer privately, or at a FFL at your expense.

Spanish Llama 9mm Para Semi-Auto. Spanish Govt. Model 1911 with Wood Grips.  Fires and Feeds reliably. The historic provenance of this model is its representation of a post-WWII, Spanish Government which sought to make its weapons industry compatible with Western weaponry production. In this case, the U.S. 1911, semi-auto pistol. This version of the U.S. 1911 represents Spanish post-war political and manufacturing policy, with a Spanish version of the U.S., 9mm 1911 incorporating classic U.S., Colt and Browning designs with unique Spanish European artistic design styling that makes this version of the 1911 both a collectable and novel rendition of the classic US 1911. Like its 45 ACP counterpart, it accepts NOT ONLY SPANISH LLAMA MAGS but U.S. 1911, 9mm G.I. Mags, as well as Colt 9mm and Chip McCormick commercial magazines. In our experince, Chip McCormick mags are the best and most reliable for this model."

Read below:

(I believe the lot numbers are stamped on the flap of the 50 round boxes.  If you have a brick you'll have to look at the individual boxes)


Remington has determined that two specific lot codes of Remington 22 Thunderbolt® ammunition may contain rounds with an insufficient crimp on the bullet. This issue is specific only to lot numbers: S22BB1237 and S22BC1237.  Handling or loading this 22 Thunderbolt® ammunition could result in the separation of the bullet from the shell casing.  In certain situations, this occurrence could render the firearm inoperable.

If you have recently purchased a box, brick, or case of Remington 22 Thunderbolt® ammunition with the specific lot numbers: S22BB1237 or S22BC1237, Remington will exchange this ammunition at no charge. For questions, or to arrange for exchange and replacement of this 22 Thunderbolt® ammunition, please contact the Remington Customer Service staff at: 1-REDACTED, Prompt #3.

Remington would like to apologize for any inconveniences or concerns that this issue may have created for our customers.  We thank you for your continued support of Remington firearms and ammunition products.

The worst part of buying one of these is having to clean all the grease off of it - but I've already done that for you. Basically, I never shoot this thing and I think a gun this cool should get a little more action. I bought this for 120 last Spring covered in grease.

As you can see, these retail for $550, and usually sell for $500+tax/shipping: http://dsgarms.com/ProductInfo/EOT552.2E_A65.aspx

I am asking $450 cash (OBO). I dont imagine this will last long as these rarely come up for sale used. I am only selling because I intend to sell my ACR and dont have another rifle to use this on."

(1,300 fps/M.E. 1,126 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box - Big Game up to 1000 lbs.","azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 20, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=50

Item 4B (300gr. JFN) is designed for super deep penetration at revolver speeds, but will mushroom and penetrate less deeply at rifle speeds. At handgun speeds you can expect a solid 3 feet of penetration in muscle and bone and at rifle speeds expect roughly 2 feet of penetration in muscle and bone. At handgun velocities, this bullet will act just like item 4A in living tissue. The greater velocities generated by the longer barrel of the rifle will cause the bullet to mushroom and that large mushroom will make a much bigger diameter hole in tissue, but that frontal area on the mushroomed bullet will cut down the depth of penetration.
You’ll note my below velocities form over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.
1.       Ruger Super Blackhawk with 6 inch barrel--------1330 fps
2.       Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch barrel-----------------------1334 fps
3.       1894 Marlin with 18.5 inch barrel---------------------1770 fps
Item 4B is recommended for all STEEL revolvers and rifles on today’s market. It is NOT suitable for scandium or aluminum alloy revolvers."

Semi-auto only, tactical style is preferred. Please don't low ball me. The trade should be as close to even as possible and I will not trade""down."" 

Thanks and I look forward to speaking with you."

It has had about 200 rounds shot through it and it is extremely accurate and reliable.  We were moving this past June and we found my wife's Ruger MKII target .22 pistol that we thought we had lost years ago.  Since she prefers her old Ruger for sentimental reasons we no longer need her new P22 we bought to replace it.

It comes in the original plastic case and has the lock, owner's manual, 2 extra front sights, an extra backstrap and tool, and both magazines.  It is everything the gun comes with brand new.

Included is 1000 rounds of CCI Mini Mags from my personal stockpile.  It is nearly impossible to buy .22 LR right now so I am including this ammo so that the new owner will have something to shoot and enjoy the gun with.  CCI ammo works perfectly in this gun and is the best .22LR in my opinion for plinking, target, and small game hunting.

I work 3pm-12am at the airport so I can't answer calls and texts reliably during those times.  I will deliver the gun and ammo anywhere from Choctaw/Yukon and Norman/Edmond when I am not at work.  I'm offering it for $400 cash and that price is firm this is a like new gun with all the accessories and ammo, I am taking a significant loss.

The guns I am interested in letting go are:

Well Kept Taurus model pt-25 .25 ACP pistol with gold accents and pearl grips. All steel frame, pocket sized. 10 round capacity with the break open barrel design for easy chamber loading / cleaning. Excellent weapon, and ungodly deadly with some magsafe ammo, which will make it shoot faster than 380 and bring it to just under standard .380 muzzle energy.

VERY good / Like new condition rossi break action 12 gauge shotgun, has had about a dozen rounds fired in its life. put a shotshell sling on this thing for $15 and you will find it to be an amazing hunting tool or home defense weapon. The ejector slings that spent shell out of the way so fast, you should never have a problem speed loading this baby. Beautiful wood stock, sling loops installed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PT738 .380 - I am not in a hurry to let this one go, it is a great and reliable pocket sized .380. The smallest and lightest of all of the pocket 380s. If there is something worth trading it for I might consider it. this is a very reliable pistol and i did a quick 6 round mag dump so u could see for yourself! http://bit.ly/16Ljk5N"

The SR-556E offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory
standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing
a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system
that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm
that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and
chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power
delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are
vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping
the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is
significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

This is the standard model. The frame is Germany and the frame in New Hampshire.

I've owned this pistol for 3-4 years and has seen light use (100-200 rounds per year). Very solid. I have with it a standard magazine plus three factory magazines still in the factory bag (unopened). Since this is my only .40 firearm I can also let go of whatever .40 ammo I have for it.

Also, I'm throwing in a leather OWB holster by UBG Holsters. Fits well.
