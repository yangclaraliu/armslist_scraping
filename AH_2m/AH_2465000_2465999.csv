The blueing on the revolver is in nice condition, it does show a bit of wear on the right side of the barrel shroud at the muzzle, on the front sight and a couple of scratches on the bottom of the barrel shroud at the muzzle and to the right of the rear sight base on the top of the frame. The 6” barrel shows some wear in the blueing on the right & left side of the barrel shroud and on the front sight. The stocks are in good shape but does have a couple of small chips in the wood at the bottom of the grip. One of the legs is broken off the ejector rod, it does not impair function but just looks a bit odd.

This a really nice gun and shoots really good, but you can have the chance to shoot and look at before you buy.

Smith and Wesson Model 586 no-dash first year revolver.  Six-inch barrel and a very nice blued finish.  Excellent condition, perfect mechanically.  

This revolver is built on the L-frame and is Smith and Wesson's answer to the Colt Python.

This gun is solid - it weighs in at 47 ounces and full-power Magnum loads are just another day at the beach.  

I hit 1-gallon tide bottle with it regularly at 125 yards off-hand every time I have taken it out to Buffalo Rock.  It is the equivalent of a six-inch rifle if you do your part.

I own both this revolver and a Python six-inch and it is a complete toss-up as to which one is a better shooter.  Either is amazingly accurate and eminently controllable.  

I am trying to consolidate my collection down to just a few shooters, and this one is not getting the love and attention she deserves, so she is up for sale.  I have both this grip as well as a Pachmayr Gripper for it.  

I am selling the revolver for $820 cash, FTF in Des Plaines IL.  I will also ship it to your FFL at your cost of shipping.

IL sale requires 72-hour wait from the time we agree on a deal, FOID and Bill of Sale.

Repeater… the “holy grail,” in a sense, of better air rifles. A repeater that takes all pellets. A repeater that sacrifices nothing in accuracy. A repeater that’s easy to load and doesn’t misfeed and doesn’t mangle pellets. A repeater that…well, you get the idea.

The RWS/Diana 300R hit the market a few years ago as an upper-tier gun in the Diana line. I’m not sure what it cost, but it I believe it was in the range of $400.

The 300R is a fairly heavy underlever springer with a T05 trigger and a 7-shot .177 rotary mag. It’s equipped with Diana’s standard iron sights — open blade front and a rear adjustable for windage and elevation. As expected for a Diana underlever, it’s on the hefty side, with a weight of around 8 lbs. All that’s pretty standard in the way of specs.

The upper is made by Bonesteel arms and the lower is made by North Eastern Arms.

NEA modular lower handguard rail description
Material: 6061 T6 Aluminum
Finish: Type III Hard Anodize
Direct replacement for the factory Lower handguard.
some marks are present where the handguard retention pin goes in (pictured). The wear cannot be seen when the handguards are installed
a NEA 2' rail section is installed at the 6 o'clock
two NEA 4"" with QD Sling Points are installed at the 3 and 9 o'clock

The upper handguard description
Co-wintess optic mount upper handguard
The upper handguard is designed to be the lightest, lowest mounting railed upper handguard on the market, mounts optics as low as possible, while still accepting all designs of mil-spec 1913 optic mounts.  Uses 4 set screws for fine adjustment, allowing it to retain sight zero, while still allowing for quick one-pin removal.  The set screws can also be used to compensate for slightly crooked gas blocks, common on many rifles.  The upper is deliberately designed not to meet flush with lower, this allows for lighter weight, better ventilation of hot barrel, less chance of hand pressure affecting zero, and the ability to look better with any variety of lower handguards.  Uses standard VZ58 takedown pin, plunger and spring(included) for proven quick takedown, with out the chance of pin popping past detent and becoming lost.

The ammo source is where I got these prices except for the bonesteel upper because they don't sell it. 
4"" rail section $35x2
2"" rail section $34
Upper handguard $100
Lower hanguard $129 (sold individually)
Total $333 not including shipping.

So I think that my asking price of 250 is fair. If you can get them cheaper, I encourage you to do so. I am simply trying to offload some of my unused gear

Semi automatic shotgun chambered 2 3/4"", barrel is plain beaded barrel choked MODIFIED but it has a polychoke added to it. I'm guessing that even though choke is marked CYL... you really can't choke out beyond MODIFIED since the end of the barrel is still fully intact and it was MODIFIED. Will still choke out from MOD to FULL. The poly choke install looks good, but if I turn to CYL...I can see the end of the barrel plainly so it's choked tighter than CYL at the end. Wood is good except there is a chipped toe that was glued back onto the buttstock. Bluing very good with some small blemishes...nothing major. Action is good and tight. Functions 100%, no problems. I can text photos....none downloaded yet for the internet. Asking $225 obo If not sold by Friday evening...carrying at the Niles Gunshow Saturday am.

Perfect condition and appears unfired! This is a rare Ak, and one of the best. It comes with 2-30 round mags, and a sling. These are highly desireable because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver. It is top of the line when it comes to AK's. Have any questions just ask. $1175"

I love the X5 competition for it's accuracy but wanted custom work and changes so had the Germans personally hand build two to our specs.. massive all stainless steel frame AND slide this monster is heavy! I had the geniuses cut down a 5"" steel competition slide to 4.5"" and mate the frame, build a massive beavertail upswept grip (larger than 1911), Checkered handgrip and trigger guard, complete melt treatment, magnum x5 funnel, xtended mag catch, ambi safety, combat no snag nite tritium sites (vertical combat), four 20 round custom mags, combat grips and wood presentation grips, fully adjustable trigger for length of pull, reset, and poundage factory set at 2.5 lbs w/ minimal reset, hand tuned competition internals and springs. Factory zeroed in Deutschland at 15 meters with 1"" groups. The rep of the x5 is as the most accurate semi pistol in the world; with these match hammer forged custom barrels these prove the point but at 4.5"" are a lot more manageable. All steel means heavy and negligible recoil. The slide say's P226 but is a misnomer.. these are thicker than a 226 and are not compatible. With custom internals and wider pistol recoil is completely sopped up. Waay to heavy to use as a carry pistol unless you wear a mackinaw, awesome competition pistol but really you would be better off w/ a straight factory x5... so what is the purpose? Only two made, beautiful pieces of art, more accurate than you will ever shoot, the most comfortable pistol you will ever pickup w/ perfect ergonomics.

It does not have a dust cover (just checked, they are $6 on Amazon), which is not necessary for those of you new to AR rifles, I can't remeber the last time I closed the dust cover on any of my rifles, lol.  The free float tube needs to be turned around as it is upside down now, but not a big deal, just how I got it.  This was an impulse purchase and really don't need it as I have other complete AR 15 bull barrel rifles already with different barrel lengths.

Full resolution pictures: http://imgur.com/a/5PJjm

Bought the gun new a few months ago and put less than 1000 rounds through it at the local skeet/trap range. I was going to get an 18"" barrel and use it for 3-gun but decided to get something else instead so here we are.

Gun comes with the original 3 chokes and choke wrench along with the stock shims. Does not include original box or packaging. 

The gun was only ever used for clays and then brought home and cleaned/lubed after every use. Never been on a hunt, never sat outside in the rain or in a small boat getting covered in mud. I had no issues with it cycling from day one (unlike my buddy's Remington), the comfortech is stock is soft shooting and it was a great upgrade over my old Mossy 500.

I'm located in Daytona but travel to Tampa regularly so I can meet anywhere along the I4 Corridor. I prefer face to face sales with cash, Valid Florida ID required, valid CCW preferred."

There are not many quality scopes that offer a 40x magnification and even fewer that offer the versatility of a 4-48x magnification, most will be 10-40x, so this one can be used for close targets and of course targets down the road a piece.

I took this in on a trade and am not sure if I want to do the ""AR thing'' anymore.
I'm not desperate to get rid of it, and haven't shot it.
If you look at the specs, they're sub MOA guns due to the Wilson Arms barrel and the 2 stage trigger is great. These have the. 223 Wylde chamber to handle 5.56 and. 223.
It had BUIS..maybe Midwest Industries.
I do not have the original stock or pistol grip.
It does have a short RRA quad rail and Tango Down foregrip. 

I do have some magazine repair kits and about 150 rounds available for the right deal.

I can send better pics on request. 

It has exactly 300 rounds downrange according to the previous owner and the BCG condition would match that assertion.

It is one of the finest combat handguns ever made with a superb single action trigger. The magazine release is a heel release. I actually prefer this for CCW since there is no concern of the mag release button being hit and releasing the mag. Comes with 2 mags and custom leather holster. The P7 is one of the fastest weapons to reload due to the fact that the grip safety also releases the slide and cocks the weapon making it ready to fire. The fixed polygonal rifled barrel lends to it's accuracy. Some say the most accurate 9mm made. The gas system allows for less recoil as well as assisting with the ejecting of brass due to ports in the chamber area. The gas system also retards recoil for a fraction of a second so that the movement of recoil does not start until after the round has left the barrel. The weapon will eject brass even if the extractor is damaged. The gas system also prevents limp wrist issues. One of the finest weapons ever! I will always keep one in the collection (also have a P7m13).  The weapons is in my name so the purchaser must be legal to own and willing to complete a transfer form. $1,200 firm.  Buyer must meet me in the Enumclaw area. Thanks"

Taurus 192015917 92 Std 9mm 5"" 17+1 Blk Poly Grip Fixed Sight w/Rail Stainless

After Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Brazil in 1980, the Taurus 92
9mm pistol was created to improve on the Beretta design. The
specially-designed drop hammer-forged ordnance-grade alloy frame won't
crack or allow the slide to come off, and a three-position frame-mounted
ambidextrous safety allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode and
also functions as a DA decocking lever. The Taurus 92 also features a
loaded chamber indicator, the Taurus Security System, a Picatinny rail, and
fixed sights.

TV, movies, music...it's all right at your command. Get ready for beautiful images and dynamic sound with ultra-easy control. The neoHD Media Controllers are completely different than ordinary AV receivers. Instead of more functions, more buttons and more complicated operation, their basic concept is simplicity. You can connect all the equipment that you use to enjoy audio and video, and operate them all with one simple remote control! No more bother with multiple remotes. The on-screen display has an icon-based interface that's extremely easy to use, and the sound system is also simplified—you'll enjoy realistic surround sound even from just two speakers. neoHD: one look tells you this is a new idea in home entertainment.

Then its time to start enjoying your music, games, TV and movies from any of the sources you've hooked up. Operation is refreshingly simple...even the basic design of the remote control is reassuring. All you need to do is touch a few buttons and adjust the volume. No complicated choices or adjustments are necessary. And you'll really like the clear and simple GUI (graphical user interface). You simply select Watch, Listen or Play using the cursor on the remote control, then choose your desired source. All the other menus, such as song lists, are also easy to view and understand.

Here is the description of the Lee kit...
At the heart of the Lee Precision Anniversary Challenger II Kit is the Challenger Press, a strong O-frame press with a larger-than-average opening angled at 30° for maximum hand clearance. Compound leverage easily performs full-length sizing on even the largest magnum cases. There’s a built-in, easy-to-empty primer catcher. Complete powder-handling system, including the precise Perfect Powder Measure. Case preparation tools include a cutter and lock stud to trim cases, an inside/outside case mouth chamber tool, primer pocket cleaner, and a tube of premium sizing lube. You also get one Breech Lock Quick Change Bushing. This bushing makes changing dies a snap and accomplish the task in seconds. Once mounted on your die, you'll never have to adjust the die again unless you want to. It saves time, eliminates guesswork and ensures the consistency of your reloaded product. You spend less time fiddling and more time cranking out rounds. To use the case cutter and lock stud a specific shell holder and case length gauge is needed for each caliber to be trimmed."

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45 first released in the 1995. The .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps) a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail better ergonomics and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30% improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition the HK45 combines the accuracy modularity reliability and minimum 20000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

Zev Technologies produces performance upgrade components for Glock® pistols. You can still count on your Glock to do what you need it to do - but now with dramatically increased performance and reliability.

The Basics

Tier 1 G19 Engineered by professional shooters to enhance the performance and legendary reliability of the Glock pistol. The T1 series is optimized for “the basics” and enhanced simplicity. Mission-critical elements such as the trigger, sights, and grip have been enhanced. The T1 is an excellent platform to build upon for future needs. 

Advantages

Improved trigger performance for reliability, speed and control.
Enhanced sighting for quicker target acquisition.
Overall greater speed, accuracy and control.

Tactical Enhancements

ZEV DUTY Drop In Trigger - Billet aluminum trigger system appropriate for defense, CCW, or duty usage.
ZEV Combat Iron Sights - Stainless Steel corrosion resistant contruction with durable black coating.
ZEV Extended Magazine Release - Allows speed reloads without shifting your grip.
The pistol frame is reshaped and textured for a more positive grip and improved index. High double undercut allows a higher grip with both hands improving mechanical leverage to counteract muzzle flip. A reduced backstrap hump makes the gun less grip sensitive and points more naturally. The CCW stipple texture is dehorned on the right and left panel so it does not print or scratch when concealed carried.

Feel free to email any questions or additional pic requests. Buyer must have KY license if in state purchase. Willing to ship out of state to your FFL of choice, just make sure they allow shipments from individuals and buyer covers actual shipping cost, UPS Next Day Air."

I took this in on a trade and am not sure if I want to do the ""AR thing'' anymore.
I'm not desperate to get rid of it, and haven't shot it.
If you look at the specs, they're sub MOA guns due to the Wilson Arms barrel and the 2 stage trigger is great. These have the. 223 Wylde chamber to handle 5.56 and. 223.
It had BUIS..maybe Midwest Industries.
I do not have the original stock or pistol grip.
It does have a short RRA quad rail and Tango Down foregrip. 

I do have some magazine repair kits and about 150 rounds available for the right deal.

I can send better pics on request. 

It has exactly 300 rounds downrange according to the previous owner and the BCG condition would match that assertion.

I took this in on a trade and am not sure if I want to do the ""AR thing'' anymore.
I'm not desperate to get rid of it, and haven't shot it.
If you look at the specs, they're sub MOA guns due to the Wilson Arms barrel and the 2 stage trigger is great. These have the. 223 Wylde chamber to handle 5.56 and. 223.
It had BUIS..maybe Midwest Industries.
I do not have the original stock or pistol grip.
It does have a short RRA quad rail and Tango Down foregrip. 

I do have some magazine repair kits and about 150 rounds available for the right deal.

I can send better pics on request. 

It has exactly 300 rounds downrange according to the previous owner and the BCG condition would match that assertion.

It is a great rifle and I've made a 700 yard kill shot while deer hunting with it. Very clean. I was a Marine so I know how to take care of my rifles. It is all stainless steel with accutrigger in a synthetic stock. A detachable box magazine that holds 3 rounds. And can easily be converted to 7mm with a simple barrel swap. Savages are great rifles to easily convert with a simple bolt face change or barrel swap or both. It is a great hunting rifle....you don't have to track anything! I don't need it because I have a great .308 and a .338 Lapua rifle so all my 30 caliber needs are covered. Scope rings come with it.
