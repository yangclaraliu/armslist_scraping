Description from Aimpoint is as follows :
Introducing Aimpoint Comp M2 Red Dot Sights.First introduced in 2000, nearly 300,000 Aimpoint CompM2 Red Dot Sights sights are now in use by many Armed Forces including elite Special Forces around the world. This Aimpoint Red Dot Sight, also known as the Aimpoint M68/CCO Red Dot Sight (when used by US forces), is the standard red dot sight for the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as well as the armed forces of many NATO countries. Due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision device (NVD), the Aimpoint CompM2 Red Dot Sight is ready for use around the clock. The Aimpoint CompM2 Red Dot Sight holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, the Aimpoint Comp M2 Red Dot Sight is completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2,5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. When the Aimpont CompM2 Red Dot Scope was released, it became the benchmark against which all other red dot scopes are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use this Aim point red dot scope.


Comes with 3 magazines. This is a great deal. It cost me over $1000 to build this.

Great rifle for pretty much anything. Only selling because I'm in a bind and need the cash
Since its a replica AR-15/M16, it's great for affordable training, since an AR-15 with this optic would be about $1500 and 5.56 ammo is much more expensive than .22"

Folks, I have gone through this assembly for months making it as perfect as I could. It functions like new in my yard on the test stand. I am not the first owner, and it was not in running condition when I acquired it. No detail has been overlooked and this is now water ready.
Motor will be run again before it gets loaded to leave my place. Upon request, I will: perform a compression test, AND, give a tutorial on how to change the flywheel key. I’ll show you step-by-step everything you wish to see, and even let you practice if you wish.This thing is big and heavy. Ten and a half feet long end to end, and 150-200lbs. It is not going to fit well on a small boat, certainly not in a car.
Pick up at my house in the Sumter area only…like I said, it’s heavy, and my family doesn’t like packing it around.
If you want to see it, bring the cash, a way to transport it, and a buddy to help you load it. Since the bill of sale has to be notarized, I suggest we do the title/money exchange at the bank of your choice in Sumter.
Partial trades will be considered. I'm looking for a newer, high-end crossbow package. Also, 8-15 hp  2 stroke outboards with electric start.

http://s77.photobucket.com/user/maikelldwong/library/CZ%20SP01

CZ75 SP-01 with custom work done by Cajun Gun Works (CGW), a reputable company in which emulates the CZ Shadow trigger's single action pull and reset.

The CZ75 SP-01 has been arguably regarded as the best steel duty 9x19 handgun all around. With a low bore axis and ergonomic grip angle, the recoil is very minimal and controllable. It has a very slim profile compared to that of a 1911, which in my opinion, is very comfortable compared to a SIG, HK, Glock and others; it has a nice durable black finish on it. It comes with a full 1913 railed dust cover for attachments, and it comes with Truglo night sights. The handgun has only been through a box of 147 grain American Eagle to test function, and there has not been any malfunctions at all.

I can almost guarantee you that a CZ75 SP-01 will not be coming to stores anytime soon, I tried to get my hands on a second one to hard chrome, but I've been told the wait time for the next shipment from CZ in Czech to Kansas City and then to distributors can be more than 8 months. If you're looking for a service pistol, while having the intrinsic value of rarity... look no further!

Custom work and accessories:
-Tru-glo night sights
-Shortened trigger reset (short reset system)
> The trigger breaks smooth as glass and reset travels by just a hair; must try!
-Smoothed/polished extractor, trigger bar, internals
-Milled down CZ Shadow hammer to fit on standard CZ slot
-S7 steel hammer pins
-S7 steel trigger pin
-S7 steel firing pin retainer pin
-Lightened FP block spring
-CGW disconnector
-CGW extended FP block lifter
-2x 17rd Mecgar mags
  > flush fit; these are the newer Mecgar mags with an anti friction coating that allows for a drop mag change, these have a very durable polymer follower.
-2x16rd Mecgar mags,
  > Has the option to hold more rounds through a different spring and baseplate kit from Mecgar
-1x20rd Promag

The gun will come with the stock parts and also the CGW extended firing pin/lightened springs so you can have different options; to further emulate the CZ Shadow's single action only trigger system.
As of now, I asked to have the stock firing pin and springs left in place for single/double action use."

http://s77.photobucket.com/user/maikelldwong/library/BCM%20COLT%20AR15

First off, I would like to make this clear, this is by no means a Frankstein AR-15.
This project has started off as a new Colt SP6940 Military specification rifle. I then sold the the upper of that rifle so that I may fund for the BCM Bravo Company upper, since have a cold hammer forged barrel was very appealing to me. Being that it is cold hammer forged, the barrel's durability is stronger and maintains its accuracy even when the barrel reaches a certain temperature that a normal barrel could not, however I kept the Colt bolt carrier group as hearing it is probably the best in the commercial/military/consumer market that does not include high end custom builders such as Noveske, Daniel Defense, or LaRue. Having still felt incomplete in my build, as far as ergonomics and unique features, I installed a Knight's Armament quad rail with integrated front flip up sight and it is aesthetically and functionally awesome! There are more accessories listed below and you can see in the pictures yourselves.

I have fired 60 rounds through this rifle. 
Bought 100 rounds for it to sight it in and have not taken it out since. 
2 of those 5 boxes were not fired and are included with this sale. 

As I realize that my urge to have something and to customize it, I feel that it is my time to move on to a different project, that doesn't have to exclusively be rifles. It was particularly amusing, but it is time for me to move on and put my efforts into something else to tinker with. 

I don't necessarily need a rifle, it has been a safe queen; I just end up putting more and more money into after seeing and knowing what else can I do to it. Time to move on before, I don't have cash for Christmas.

Why pay $20-30 MORE for their product if you don't even know it will work for you? You can own this one for far less. If, after trying it and finding out how well it works, you want a more expensive one, at least you'll be confident it's for you. BUT, I'm confident this one will work well if you like this style of carry.


This holster can be used ambidextrously and can accomodate an addtional magazine. Additionally, it incorporates an extra pocket where you can keep your ID, passport or cash. If you visit someplace where pickpockets or muggers are prevalent, this garment could be invaluable. Let the bad guy have your decoy wallet while your main documents and currency remain safe.

I am in need of a small conceal firearm. I would prefer it to be a 22lr as I have some ammo in that particular caliber, but would also be interested in other affordable calibers such as .380 or 9mm. There has been a lot of recent gang related violence in my neighborhood and I would like a firearm to protect my family. Money is VERY tight in my household. I am asking for someone to bless my family with a firearm that fits a budget that is already tapped to the extreme. I am sorry for even asking for any kind of a deal, but I truly can't afford to pay full price for a protective weapon at this point. I have some stuff of value to trade such as some silver coins and if need be some tools. I am only looking for a service firearm to protect my family until we can afford to move to a new area. If you have seen the news recently, there have been a rash of gang related violence incidents as well as random violent crimes in my neighborhood. I want to protect my wife and child as best as I can. I would appreciate any help you may be able to give me and I would love to pay you back in labor, money that I can spare, or goods I can trade with. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read my post. God bless."

DPMS Oracle AR15 .223/5.56 with Free Floating Barrel and 3 Mags
Selling my DPMS Oracle AR15 chamber in both .223 and 5.56, It's my first AR15 and it has been well taken care of with about 400 rounds through it flawlessly. I Bought it NIB from Cabela's in July 2013, this year so it's still almost brand new. No Failures to Fire, no jams, no failure to feed, nothing its been perfect. I've shot most rounds while standing at 50 meters(150feet) and held 1 inch groups with an EOTech 517. It has much more in it with someone who can push it farther than I can. Has been cleaned immediately after every shoot, and lubricated. It's a very good AR15 that I've taken care of and modified. All work was done at Hawk Tech Arms. 

16' Barrel with 1/9 twist and M4 chrome feed ramps. Barrel properly broken in, so 1 round fired and bore snaked, done multiple times for recommended break in.
Upper and Lower Receiver 7075 T6
Converted too 10 inch Free Floating Rail for improved accuracy and handling. Rail is heavy Duty Aluminum but still light in weight with rail slot markings.
YHM Low Profile Gas Block with Carbine Length Gas System
Hogue Black Psitol Grip
Comes with the original Metal Magazine and two Tapco Polymer Magazines
Original Box with Paperwork
Also comes with original parts taken off. The Bulky Gas Block that had a lower height than the Receiver, Plastic Standard AR15 Hand Guard(Carbine Length), and Hard AR15 Pistol Grip. I am FIRM on price $750, I'm already losing quite a bit of money, the AR15 and parts alone are worth more, then add in sales tax on all of it and labor cost to convert. I would like it gone but I'm not desperate to sell, it is more than worth what I'm asking and I'd rather hang on to it than lose more money. So if you are not a serious buyer move on. Must sign Bill of Sell and show ID. Thanks.

I built this pair of umbrella corporation rifles from UCWRG receiver sets. My financial situation dictates I let one of them go, but I can't decide which one, so YOU choose.

All of the polymer accessories are genuine Magpul MOE made in the USA, except the grips which are both the proprietary Umbrella Corporation grip 23.
Both are 16"" barrels chambered in 5.56 nato. On the dark earth rig its a del-ton chrome lined lightweight with f-marked fsb and mid length gas system. The black with red color fill is a melonite coated m4 profile with carbine length gas system and a YHM lightweight free float rail with ladder covers. Did I mention the umbrella logo on top of the upper receiver is also color filled?

 Both have 50 rounds of brass down the pipe (didn't even finish breaking them in), and neither experienced an fte or ftf.

 BOTH are running on Rubber City Armory black nitrided bolt carrier groups with full auto profile carriers and c158 shot peened bolts, and both include a 30-rd windowed pmag.

 Come exactly as shown, except on the black one you have the option of the Primary Arms 1.5-4x scope or an AIM 2.5-10x scope.

I'll get some more pics up later. Feel free to ask me any questions.

Prefer cash face to face, but will accept USPS money order and ship to your ffl of choice for $30.
