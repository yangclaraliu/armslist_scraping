HOW TO BUY FIREARMS ONLINE:
1.	Go to a local firearms dealer in your area and make sure the item you are interested in is legal in your state and that they will accept the transfer.
2.	Purchase the item you are interested in
3.	Have your local firearms dealer either email or fax a copy of their FFL (Federal Firearms License) to the seller (Hopefully that's us!). This is a very routine task for most firearm dealers so they should know exactly what to do once you ask them.

Once payment is received and your FFL has been received, your item can be shipped.

Not looking for anything in particular, but no long guns unless it's one heck of an AR build. Feel free to ask any questions. Round count is approximately 400rds down range with not one hiccup. I'm gonna go ahead and have the feed ramp polished this week. I know what this beauty is worth so all low ball offers will be ignored. It comes in the original blue Springfield box w/paperwork and all the gear from the factory as well. I have had several offers but nothing that has really grabbed me. Thanks!"

New 1911 slimline checkered grips offer the same stability as the standard grips with the added benefit of a thinner grip and a lighter overall weight. If you are changing out your standard thickness grips, please visit our Accessories page to view the choices of slimline bushings and screws that we offer. In the 1911 Standard Checkered Grip you will have the strength and durability inherent in the aluminum grip, combined with an overall checkered pattern. Checkering has been a generally accepted method of adding stability in the hand to a pistol grip, and this design does it beautifully.

The scope is digital camo also with target turrets and side parallax focus. The scope and the rifle stock camo colors are a little different, with the scope having more green than the stock. I have put about 60 rounds through the rifle and cleaned it religiously. Will shoot sub 1"" groups at 100 yards easily. I have  over $1300.00 in everything, the rifle ($700.00), the scope ($450.00)., mount and rings ($130.00), bipod ($60.00), and sling ($25.00).  I have the matching rings for the scope but they set it way to high above the bore so I bought lower ones. The scope also comes with a sunshade. I still have the box for the rifle and scope, and all paperwork. I just never shoot it and it's too heavy to hunt with. If you are interested, call me at 252-three four one-8219. Serious calls only.  I have reduced the price to $800 and that is my bottom price.  No trades, cash sale only (unless you have a nice drumset you want to get rid of!)"

ASP Friction Loc 26"" Expandable Baton  (F26B) has proven itself as a virtually indestructible tool that is easily carried and readily available. The Friction Loc Baton is constructed of 4140 seamless steel tubing is not commercially available in the United States. As a result, ASP must have a special chemistry or heat of steel poured in Germany and then pierced into rounds. This raw stock is then drawn by an American company into tubing that is fabricated to ASP specifications. As a result, ASP is the sole source of 4140 steel tubing for expandable batons. ASP 4140 is 25% stronger than more commonly available 4130 tubing. The Friction lock also features a Black Chrome finish which is a state of the art black finish for steel surfaces. It is a true black plating, not a paint. As a result, it is extremely hard and will not scratch. Black Chrome will not rust as do other surface treatments. It is exceptionally durable and does not flake or peel. Black Chrome offers deep, rich, black corrosion protection.

Was $600 plus tax and tic. 

They don't make many of these per year, it took me 3 months to find one, and was a 3 hour round trip to where I had to pick it up. I just have very large hands and prefer the grip on the GP100. This gun only goes around 31 ounces fully loaded and is a great back packing or trail gun. 

When I bought it I had also ordered a OEM leather holster from Ruger for $50. I already know I'll lose tax, tic, gas money, and time, but I don't have to sell this so no low ballers. 

$650 cash firm. If I don't get $650 cash for it with the holster then I will just keep it. 

This is for sale only unless you have a one of the items listed below.  You can email me here or text/call REDACTED. Pick up in Mt Juliet."

This is my last .40 I'm consolidating down to .45ACP and 9mm only. So I'm looking to trade it as a package. It will come with the pistol, hard case, paperwork, two larger back straps, cleaning rod/brush, 4 15rd mags one of which is marked LE/Gov only for you glock buffs about a $50 value. I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol. Due to this being my last .40 I am also adding 100rds of FMJ and 55rds of quality jacketed hallow points. I am putting the specs from glocks web-sight below. I'm valuing the pistol and one mag alone at $600 and $120-$150 for the extras, I will take $700 cash for the package. I also have another add up for silver coins so check out my other listings.
