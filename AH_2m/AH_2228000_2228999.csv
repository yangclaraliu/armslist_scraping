I thought this might be kind of fun, call it the kid in me but I love opening old boxes and discovering whats inside. If you are like me in that sense, perhaps my proposition will intreeg you...

Most Mosin Nagant fans know that there are a couple of places that you can order and have shipped to you a crate of 20 Mosins, but first off, who has the money and who really needs 20 of these classic rifles...

What I want to do is order a crate and have the group that is interested all meet to open the box together for the excitement factor.

Then depending on a first come first pick (The responses I get from this add) Each person will have 10 minutes to go through the crate and select as few or as many as they like. For example Joe emails me in response to this and says I want in on the project! If Joe was first to respond he will have the first 10 minutes alone with the crate meaning he can choose from all 20 rifles which have matching serial numbers on parts and the bayonet! When all 20 rifles are accounted for the box will be sold to whoever is interested.

So if you are interested let me know and I will start making a list, I dont really want to order a crate unless I have at least 12 serious buyers. So I cant guarantee that this is happening but I know a lot of people would love to have the chance to go through a crate straight from storage in Russia. 

Again the perks to this setup are that the guns have matching serial numbers including matching bayonets. Many times there are a handfull of hex receivers included, and less common early productions such as tulas!

If you are lucky enough to find a hex, i would ask $225 of course deals can be made though.
Tulas Im asking $200
These of course have a much higher value but I cant guarantee that there will be any so my prices wont reflect a double or even tripple value like the streets.
Everything else $175

Please let me know and I will get you on the list!
Thanks and good luck"

199,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2228199,For Sale/Trade:  2003 Saab 9-3 Arc 6 speed manual,"Springboro, Dayton, Ohio","$ 1,750","Listed On: Wednesday, October 16, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a high mileage Saab for sale 367,000 miles.  This car still runs great.  Exterior color is silver and the interior is gray leather.  I bought the car with around 45,000 miles and have owned it ever since.  I will start with the bad first.  The check engine light is on due to the secondary air injector pump and check valve not working.  This is a non issue as this only is emissions equipment that engages on cold starts to add air to the exhaust fumes creating slightly less pollution.  This has not worked for the past 100,000 miles and has not effected performance at all.  The other problem is the fuel gauge does not work, which has not been an issue if I fill up soon after 400 miles driven on a full tank.  Cosmetically the car has some nicks in the paint and  a couple small dings.  The front fascia is pretty scratched up.  The interior is smoke free and is in excellent shape except for the drivers seat has cracked a bit but not torn.  Enough with the bad.
Now with the good.  The car has many options including heated seats, aux audio input, traction control, moonroof, duel climate control.  I have done most of the maintenance over the years and know this car inside and out.  I have always used premium fuel and done regular oil changes with Mobil 1 synthetic.  For any perspective buyer I can go over in great detail everything that has been done over the years.  The tires are Michelin Primacy MXV4 with plenty of tread left.  I see no reason why this car can not go another 100,000 miles.  I would like to do it myself but I have too many cars right now.  If anyone is interested or has questions don't hesitate to ask.  I can send some pictures to those who are serious.  I really love this car it gets great fuel economy 29-30 mpg average,  pulls hard with the turbo and rare 6 speed manual, no rust (car has been in North Carolina) low maintenance if properly cared for, and is comfortable enough on long trips."

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Our Brand New, High End AR-10 Upper features the incredibly hard to come by, 16 inch 7.62x51 Nitride heavy barrel, (HBAR) making it much stronger and far more accurate than any other chrome lined barrel on the market today.  It's chambered in .308 Winchester with a 1/10 twist rate.  No detail is overlooked and each barrel is HPT and MPI inspected. They are made from 416 stainless, have M4 feed ramps, 5/8 muzzle break thread and finished in black with a carbine gas system.      

We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset.  We've found that when building for a specific person, it increases the attention to detail significantly and therefore, the finished product is second to no one and far superior than that of any mas-produced or store-bought brand out there. The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within 2 weeks of purchase.     

Our High-Quality, DPMS Style upper receiver comes in an A3 flattop configuration that offers plenty of flexibility in both open and optical sighting options. MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail has 17 cross-slots that accept popular AR-15/M16 accessories and scope mounts. Shell deflector and forward assist are machined as a single unit.  Our standard receiver features a Bravo Company Mod 3 charging handle, custom port cover, and forward assist.  Also standard is CMMG's .308 bolt carrier group making this a fully complete upper receiver that is ready to roll.   

The Complete TacticalARs.com ""Magnus"" High End Upper has a 12"" Carbine Free Float Rail System with precise fit to our upper receiver. Our proprietary rail system has been crafted out of 6061 T6 aircraft aluminum with a level III hard anodized finish and is mounted over our properly fitted micro gas block. All that you have left to do is Pin It and Win It!         

***** Please note that prices are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced for a limited time only in an effort to launch our brand on a national level instead of our current local presence.  That being the case, this listing is for a Complete Upper Receiver and actually DOES include a CMMG 308 Bolt Carrier Group and BCM Mod 3 Charging Handle but only for a limited time.  We also carry just about any aftermarket part available so if you need anything, let us know and we will give you our employee discount and free shipping with this order.*****"

The TacticalARs.com ""MINI GUNNR"" Pistol Upper is designed as a fully Mil-spec compliant compact series for law enforcement. Our (factory constructed) upper with 7.5"" barrel, pistol gas system, threaded Shark flash hider, combined with our 7 inch proprietary ""MINI GUNNR"" Rail System has been extremely popular.

We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset.

The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within a week and typically ship within 24 hours of purchase.

Vz58 aren't aks. They are much smaller, lighter, softer shooting than a stamped AK but built on a stronger milled receiver and can be fed with stripper clips due to open top design.  The czechs know their firearms and told the ussr pre cold war that they would not be converting to the ak47. The vz design was originally designed for a larger battle rifle round but shrunk to accomodate the ussr's desire for 7.62x39.

This is one of RIA's higher quality offerings. It switches from 9mm to the proprietary .22 TCM, which I hear is a very high performer, and will even pierce 3/16 plate. It comes with like 15 rounds in the mag. The magazine takes both calibers, to change you just need to switch barrels and mainsprings. It comes with two adaptors, you do NOT need to change. Works just fine. From what I hear this pistol is balls on with the .22, virtually no recoil, but very accurate at distance. Haven't heard anything about 9mm performance. It has a small scratch in the underside of the gun, as well as a weird sortve blemish on the left side of the slide. I dunno what's up with it, doesn't break the finish (no rust worries) but it is noticeable in direct sunlight. May be fixable. This pistol comes with EVERYTHING it comes from the factory with, including whatever paperwork I can dig up, and I have the other extractor in my back seat. In addition is has a Blackhawk holster with IWB attachment. Very cool, excellent retention, I love it. Besides AIWB, it's my favorite way to carry. Price is fairly firm, might take an offer.

This retails (lowest price) at about 200 dollars. It's almost new, has only a couple small scuffs. Sweet case to hold your pistols."

Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. COMES WITH PELICAN CASE, 2 10RD MAGS, THE NON-ILLUMNAITED LEUPOLD MARK 4.5-14X50MM SCOPE WITH BARRETT BORS ON TOP AND ZERO GAP ULTRA HIGH RINGS."

Moving to Idaho...tomorrow!


I estimate 150 rounds fired through the barrel, at most. I bought the weapon myself, and have owned it for years, but rarely used it. When I did it was always with shot, not slugs, and lead, not steel. I always dismantled/cleaned/oiled all components after firing, and its always been kept in a case, or displayed on my wall and kept clean.

It's been modified by me, but not to much. Details in purchasing items list below. Gun and knife both made in USA, I am the original owner/purchaser of all items mentioned (receipts can probably be found if needed). I also purchased and installed any modifications and accessories. If you have any questions or want anything a certain way, just mention so in your message.

Gun was bought as my dream defense weapon, sadly only to spend years looking beautiful but not being used (aside from occasionally fertilization rural areas with skeet and watermelon). Now I'm moving to Boise and must part with my baby. I'm motivated to sell quickly so can be reasonable on the price. I know I paid to much where I got it from, so I won't expect to turn any profit here :] However, I would like to sell the entire setup together so do hope for an understandable consideration for some additional cost. 

You will receive:

---Mossberg 590 12g ""Persuader"" (Ill double check the name), Legal and Registered. To be signed over private party, in Nevada, probably without need for checks or officialities (other than a bill of sale), unless buyer desires so. It has original full stock, standard horizontal pump, full length vented rib, barrel-flush magazine with capacity potential of 9 rounds and mag-tip accessory connection. Highly alterable (flashlights, bayonets, etc), and also highly modifiable, stock change/removal, rear/fore/dual pistol grips, etc. Quality parts are usually very available and affordable for this popular tactical police and home defense weapon, and all quickly installable with little specific experience necessary.

-Side-Saddle. 6-rd cap flexible claw holds. Bolt mounted on, its firmly in place, but also easily removable if desired. Its frame-stabilized above and left of the load chamber, instead of wrapped around or bored into the stock. This provides considerably heightened ease/speed of loading, complete divorce from holding/aiming commitments, and freedom from the stock alteration limits of that design. With my setup, even a removed, foldover, or otherwise compact style or stockless-body shotgun can retain this mighty yoke of grouped rounds, most already loaded, while the rest lie available mere inches from either hand as well as the loading point. Thus little-to-no focus needs to be shifted away from aiming and reacting before needing a 16th shell, due to how easy blind or peripheral counting and usage of these 6 can be executed. A bandoleer shell system lacks most of these traits as well, but certainly provides quantity, so if desired can be supplemented as well, using the existing sling lobes, with no extra parts or mods needed for install.


M9 Ontario Bayonet Knife (Black w/ fish scale serrations on the rear.  and wire cutter female piece in blade), as well as the knifes case with male wire cutter assembly and flint stone grooved seat on exterior (can be sheathed onto knife while on gun for single item carry or compact packing. 590 receives this knife on its mag receptacle without any alteration needed

Shotgun soft case, made of felt. Strong and durable enough to protect the weapons, ammunition, and finish, while large enough to fit the gun with knife attached. Color is incognito sand, and has strong zipper and two center handles.

I figured I would see if someone locally has a rifle that has been in the field, has been well preserved, and needs a new home. I am not looking for a safe queen, so I do not mind a few bruises. This will be a “working gun”. If you have one with some ammo, so much the better.

These were made by a couple of different companies, a dozen or so if memory serves me right. Sears Ranger 101.16, Savage model 87 (model A,B, C and so on through S) and on and on. All were all but the exact same rifle.

This holds 16 .22 LR rounds. 19"" barrel. 40 1/2"" long overall. The bluing on the metal is at 95% with a couple of very minor lighter spots near the barrel stamp/imprint area. See the pics for close up's. I'm guessing that it's from rubbing something during storage as it's in an unusual place. The stock on the right side has odd wear as well, the same reason I'm guessing. You would think that the 'use wear' would be on the left side of the stock where your cheek rests, not low on the opposite side that really doesn't get touched that much. If you follow my reasoning.

I have personally taken it down it 100% cleaned and function tested it for reliability afterward and it will eat just about any standard or high velocity round you put through it. It even cycled the craptastic Remington Golden Bullets that just about everything chokes on. HOWEVER, it did stove pipe/failure to fully eject a couple of times out of 3 tubes of them that I ran, but it still shot them ok for the most part. 

This rifle comes with the original Savage Springfield 4x15, model 1540B scope with the original 'PASSED"" (inspection) sticker. I honestly do not believe this old shooter was used very much at all, but rather spent much of it's life in storage. 

I ran a total of 15 tubes of various ammo through this and was pulling very tight 1 1/2"" groups at 50 yards. Had it not been for a 'flier' they would have been 1"" tight. (I think that stray round may have been my fault).

These rifles have the nic name 'The Gill Gun' for the ports on the side of the receiver and also called the 'Click Clack' for the sound of the action. The bolt does not move forward after the shot until you release the trigger, giving it a distinct 'click clack' sound. In my humble opinion these are just wicked cool old shooters that are nuts on accurate & a hell of a lot of fun to shoot. 

Questions, comments or 'I want it's' are always welcome. I am unable to drive any longer so you will have to come out to my place in Linn Creek to pick it up. The up side to this is you will have the opportunity to fire it before you take it home.

I have owned this beauty since 1988 and the last time it saw action was around 1993. It has been in my safe since then and only taken out twice a year to clean and lube it. This is an oldie but a goodie! I am not sure how old it is since I bought it used. I have everything needed to fire this weapon including a leather possibles bag, 50 lead sabbots, brass powder horn, brass powder measure, nipple removal tool, primers,10 quick loads, bullet starter and a little FFG powder.
All of the above mentioned extras are availble for an additional $100 as they are all top-notch accessories that can be used on other black powder rifles.

I will only accept cash (no money orders, checks, etc...) at the time of sale and cannot make any holds or lay-aways. May take a trade but but cash works best.

Up for sale is a Brand New NEVER FIRED Daniel Defense 300 Blackout model AR15 . 

It is the model V5, which is a mid-length carbine, possibly the most desired out of all the DD models. If your'e reading this, you probably already know about Daniel Defense. It's considered the Rolls Royce of AR-15s. Every single component, down to the smallest part, is of the highest quality, and rank at very top or near the top of the list for quality and reliability. 

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm

It is Brand New. Never Fired! Shows build date of 1/21/2013! These are extremely hard to find! Sold out almost everywhere. There's probably only a handful around the country up for sale, and this is being offered at a reduced price. The pics are cell phone pics, so not so clear. There are no marks or blemishes on the rifles. Tags and labels still attached.

What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting. 
For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4.5 to 5 lbs.

Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings. The entire gun is dressed in Mossy Oak Treestand camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field. We included a 4-round magazine, and the R-25 is compatible with DPMS 308 Win-type magazines and accessories. front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.
