The 4th Generation Glock ""Safe Action"" brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed, real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment.

Literally ZERO problems in those ~500 rounds I've fired it.

Instead, they use a #15 Torx driver, to tighten them.  You can then locktite them, & torque them, to 45 inch pounds.  When it comes time to remove them; no problem.

Consequently, your windage screws aren’t marred up, from using a flat blade screw driver, or a coin.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers.
This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

Insight M3X Tactical Pistol Illuminator 125 Lumen Weaponlight. Stock # M3X-000-A8. This model features the Universal Slide Lock mount that fits most pistols. 

The M3X Tactical Illuminator was built for U.S. Special Operations personnel and designed to perform under the most rigorous conditions and survive the harshest environments. Because of this, the M3X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof.

The M3X utilizes a Xenon bulb that delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is protected by the Shock Suppression System which is designed to handle the heavy recoil demands of today’s tactical loads. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included), the M3X has a run time of one (1) hour.

The ambidextrous rocker switch located on the removable backplate allows the M3X to be activated in either a Momentary On or Constant On mode. The rocker backplate on the M3X is interchangeable with any other backplate designed for either M3X or M6X models, giving you greater versatility of application.

L-3 Insight Technology Incorporated offers three options for mounting the M3X to your firearm. The patented Slide-Lock® system allows for instant tool-free mounting and removal by simply sliding the unit onto the rail and locking it into place with the spring-loaded latchbar. The Universal Slide-Lock mount fits most pistols and comes with two latchbars to insure the proper fit,

I am selling my Core 15 CXV along with all the accessories and ammo I have for it as a package deal. I purchased this gun in October and since then it has probably had about 200 rounds through it. I recently lost one of my jobs and am needing the extra money. If I wasn't in this position I wouldn't consider selling it, but my loss could very well be your gain! I have found that while Core is not a wildly known brand, their appreciation for quality definitely shows in their guns. Not only has it functioned flawlessly since the first shot but it also comes with a lifetime guarantee regardless number of owners or rounds through it. I bought and installed accessories that I felt were tailored made for a personal defense rifle as well as a sporting rifle. Between the upgraded grip/stock/fore grip this rifle is very comfortable to shoot and has plenty of places for even more attachments. Here is a list of the things I have for it.

Core 15 CXV Rifle (Lifetime Warranty) - $750
Nikon P-223 3x Scope (Lifetime Warranty) with NcStar quick detatch mount - $175
Magpul STR Stock with cheek rest and battery storage (Forest Green) - $85
Magpul Foregrip (Forest Green) - $40
Hogue Grip - $25
Hard Case - $30
Total of 3 Pmags and one traditional metal Mag (2 Pmags I bought extra) - $40

131 Rounds in .223 = about $150

How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragonov stock replacements. Their current SKS offering is $875.00. The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers an adapter to use AK47 mags. $575.00

638,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2626638,For Sale:  LE “AR” Tactical Trainer Stock for Ruger 10/22,"Raleigh/Clayton NC Area, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 170,"Listed On: Monday, February 3, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a stock that will turn your Ruger 10/22 into an AR Training Rifle. There is no gunsmithing needed to install the Ruger 10/22 action and barrel. All you need is a Phillips and flat head screwdriver. That is it. In five minutes you are ready to shoot.

This is the LE Tactical Trainer Stock, not the standard Tapco version. It has the Tapco “SAW” style pistol grip, six position collapsible stock and FOUR Picitinny rails on the front to attach anything you (want which is the big difference between the standard and Tactical Trainer).

This is also not one of the stocks that only takes the standard tapered barrel or the .920 Bull Barrel. It is made to fit both. This version also came with all of the optional accessories that you don’t find in all of the sets. It came with the removable top rail for optics, rubber butt pad, extra angled buffer tube, sling attachment and bottom rail cover that that completely reshapes the bottom of the fore end. 

I also bought two grips for this stock. They are both Tapco Intrafuse grips to keep with the look of the stock and “SAW” style grip. One is a stubby grip that has inside storage for batteries with a removable rubber bottom. The other is the full size grip / bipod combo. It has the same storage and rubber bottom as the stubby but is longer and also has a polymer bipod that inserts in the bottom.

I have put a lot of money in the accessories to make it feel just like an AR15 to use for training. Listed below are all of the accessories that this comes with along with the prices I paid for them as well as the link to the Tapco site: 

- LE Tactical Trainer Stock ($105) http://www.tapco.com/products/ruger/index.php?_a=viewProd&productId=139 
- Optional Rubber Butt Pad (came with Tactical Trainer set)
- Optional Tapco bottom rail cover (came with Tactical Trainer set)
- Extra angled buffer tube (came with Tactical Trainer set)
- Sling Attachment (came with Tactical Trainer set)
- Removable Fore End Top Rail (came with Tactical Trainer set)
- Four ERGO Rail Covers ordered to cover these rails with a grip installed ($25)
- Tapco Intrafuse Stubby Vertical Fore End Grip with storage ($25)
- Tapco Intrafuse Vertical Fore End Grip Bipod Combo ($40)
*** TOTAL COST NEW: $195

I did pay retail for this as I ordered most of it off of Amazon. The only place I could put my hands on it was Bass Pro Shop and they wanted $150 for the stock alone. If you don’t believe the prices are the correct… just run them on Amazon. I put a lot of detail in this description so you know EXACTLY what you are getting and what shape it is in. I am selling this because I just got an insane deal on an M&P 1522 and no longer need it. It is used but if I put a new one beside it you could not tell the difference. It is perfect. I am willing to toss in a Ruger BX-25 magazine that is $29 new if you buy the entire kit. The BX-25 holds 25 rounds of 22lr to help with that “AR” transition. I am asking $170 for the entire kit, including the BX-25 magazine. I paid close to $225 for all of this new and it is in that condition so I believe $170 is a fair price. If you do not want the magazine I will deduct $20 from the price and sell it for $150. The price is fair so please don’t send a low ball offer. I am not pressed for money so before I give it away, I will just toss it back in the safe.

If you are interested I live in the Raleigh/Clayton area but I also travel for a living between Winston-Salem and Wilmington on a regular basis so pickup should be easy. If you are interested please let me know and thanks for looking."

A gunsmith performed all the work on it, including barrel install, bolt turn-down, scope mount tapping and installation and final fit to the precision stock.

Below is what went into it, all at excellent prices and do not account for any type of shipping, taxes, etc.
Mosin ($100)
New barrel to replace the surplus stock barrel ($125)
Archangel stock (fully adjustable length of pull and cheek weld. Magazine fed)
Turned down bolt
Rock Solid Ltd Scope mount ($75) 
Also have 40 rds of factory Winchester soft points (deer/bore rounds) ($45) and some surplus stuff somewhere as well (Negligible value).

That does not include any gunsmith work, which cost over $200.

If you are not familiar with the 7.62x54r round, its bigger than a 308 and more devastating, and you can get surplus rounds for 22 cents a round (so 5 rounds for every one round of average/cheap 308).

If you put this whole thing together using the best prices you can possibly find on-line, you would spend around $700. I would like $550 cash or I LOVE trades.

This of course makes a great range gun, but the weight and round also make this an excellent hunting choice. Real attention grabber at the range, and the ammo is cheap enough to shoot it as much as your heart desires. From the 22lr ammo listings I see on here, might as well get something with some knockdown power!

Bore is of course very shiny with immaculate rifling. I can answer any questions you may have, so let me know if you have any"

Had an accident an fell a coupla weeks back right after I got this thrower. Doctor said the way my age an back is, that I had better quit Trap shooting after all these years an take up a different hobby. Decided to go with .22 semi-auto target shooting instead of quitting altogether.

$100 CASH--Local  pickup  only

I had just put this thrower together an hadn't throwed 25 or so birds from it. You have to try this to see how easy it is to finish the rest of the cock on it an how good the bird flys. 

I added a small set of wheels an axle (5-6 inch) to the front legs and a little handle on back to roll it around on, so you don't have to carry it where you want to put it.

Take the legs off, an it even fits inside the receiver hitch on your truck or car using the receiver hitch pin to hold it in. Then sit on it from there to throw the targets/birds if you want too.

Whether you are aiming for a springing teal, a ground-bouncing rabbit, a flushing pair of standards, or curling incomers, this automatic clay trap has the necessary components and features you need.

Modified trigger.

This pistol includes everything as pictured. Gen 3. Adjustable sights. It also includes 8 additional 17-round magazines and three 33-round magazines. All the magazines are Glock Factory Original. This will give you a total of 13 original magazines. The firearm itself is in very good to like-new condition. Used at the range only. No carry or competition use.

The firearm has a modified trigger from Glockworx. It is a drop-in replacement, so there are no permanent modifications to the firearm. It makes squeezing the trigger smooth as silk at about a 2.2lbs trigger pull. It also includes a smoother drop safety and skeleton striker. Housing has an adjustment for overtravel. Again, this is just a drop-in part. You can replace it with a factory stock trigger (not included) and housing and the firearm will return to a factory stock Glock.

Let's do the math. On the auction site, a 17L will sell for about $800. Magazines are about $25. The 33rd magazines run $35. The trigger from Glockworx is about $200. So, that's $1305 in materials, selling locally here for $875.

This is a private sale. All sales must be completed locally. You will be required to present your permit to purchase or carry permit and sign a bill of sale. Cash only. Item is located near Anoka, MN.

the scope IS NOT included. 
I would've taken the scope off for the pictures but i have it zeroed at 300 yds so didn't want to take it off, plus this gives you an idea of what a scope looks like on this chassis.
this rifle is VERY accurate and has very low recoil due to the weight and good ergonomics of the chassis. its also very easy to disassemble for cleaning. 
the rifle is in excellent condition, rifling is very crisp, action is smooth and tight and bluing is excellent. over its lifetime, its only had about 200 rds through it, ive personally fired 30 through it for testing and zeroing and was very pleased. the chassis is also in excellent condition with no damage or wear of any kind.  
ive had this rifle for a little while, and while happy with it, i rarely have time to shoot it or use it at all, so looking to sell or trade for something more useful for me but if i dont any good offers, ill probably just keep until i can use it lol.

Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights. This pistol ships with a flush fit 8 round magazine and a 10 round extended magazine. Combat ready and built to last.

This is a Sig Sauer 1911, .22 caliber pistol. It is an extremely fun gun to shoot and is incredibly accurate. I am the original owner of this firearm and have fired less than 100 rounds through it. The pistol is a great target gun that can drill in a tight groups for those who are experienced shooters or it can make a great training firearm for those who are new to the sport. It has very light recoil, which is great for new shooters. Also, the firearm has many interchangeable parts with the regular .45 1911 making it an ideal choice for someone who wishes to train shooting the 1911 platform without spending the cost of the more expensive .45 rounds. The firearm is in “like new” condition as I am the original owner and have not fired many rounds through it. 

 I have also polished the barrel and rails of this firearm (as I do with all my pistols) that has given it a great luxurious look as well as improved the functionality of the pistol by making the slide smoother to the frame and have removed the magazine disconnect feature on this firearm (can put it back in if you like) as I do not like them.

 The firearm will come with everything that came with it from the factory; case, lock, magazine, ect. It really is a fantastic firearm that is great fun to train with or target shoot with. I am asking $365 for the whole package and will even throw in some free .22 ammo with the purchase as long as you don’t haggle me :). Again thank you for looking at this firearm. You can reach me either through my e-mail associated through this listing or by calling (nine five one) 310- zero two zero four. Need to go through an FFL dealer to purchase. I hope to hear from you soon.
