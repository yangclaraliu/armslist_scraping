That is all. Nothing more.
Here is how this works. I have stock with no gun, you have a gun that needs a stock! It's just about the perfect situation. It's Destiny. You buy the stock for the low low price of just $15, I get to buy enough PBR to stave off the shakes  for one more day.
As the world turns...so are the days of our lives.  $15

I know you can only see half the stock, but the rest is there I promise. And in pretty-fairly much like new condition for a chinese sks stock. Ya Folla'?

Edit: Blast it all. In the way I over-worded that it kinda makes it seem the upper handguard is included, but just hiding its bashful face. It is not. It is not included because it does not exist."

The barrel will be cleaned, refinished and then coated. The turn around time will be under 3 weeks from the time we receive the barrel. It is usually even much shorter than that. We offer better pricing, better quality and a faster turn around than any of our competitors.

For those not familiar with Titanium Nitride it is unique in terms of firearm finishes as it not only gives a custom look to your firearm it also adds durability and reduces the friction on the coated part. This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, vastly increases the durability, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is the average coating only adds 3 micrometers of material, so it will not change the function of your firearm only enhance the look and performance of it. It is applied in a cathodic arc chamber which ensures a uniform coating. This is the same coating that is used by high speed cutting tools to give you an idea of its strength.

If you have any questions please let us know. Thanks for taking the time to look!

For those not familiar with Titanium Nitride it is unique in terms of firearm finishes as it not only gives a custom look to your firearm it also adds durability and reduces the friction on the coated part. This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, vastly increases the durability, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is the average coating only adds 3 micrometers of material, so it will not change the function of your firearm only enhance the look and performance of it. It is applied in a cathodic arc chamber which ensures a uniform coating. This is the same coating that is used by high speed cutting tools to give you an idea of its strength.

If you have any questions please let us know. Thanks for taking the time to look! 

Frequently Asked Questions:
1. What other colors do you offer? We offer gold, rose, carbon black and silver.
2. Does this include a barrel? No, this is for the coating of your existing barrel. Once you purchase, we will send you the information on where to send your barrel.
3. Can you coat threaded barrels? Yes we can, it doesn't alter the threads and actually offers them some protection.
4. Can you coat aftermarket barrels? Yes we can, in fact aftermarket barrels coatings are a large part of our business.
5. Can you coat my slide or other small parts? We can coat any part that is steel, stainless steel, or titanium. We do not coat aluminum. Contact us for more information.
6. Does this coat the inside of the barrel? If will coat inside the crown and chamber, the areas where most wear occurs.
7. Is there any difference in the colors hardness? No, they are all equally durable and in the 80-90 range on the Rockwell Scale. The Titanium Nitride is much more durable than the steel it coats."

This is the latest model from Streamlight, is the 2s model which has light/laser/laser+light functionality as well as strobe for the light.  300 lumen rated LED light, runs on two 123 batteries.  Had it on my G17, but will fit any hand gun with a standard rail, or on a picatinny rail of a rifle for that matter.

I have no real use for it, so I'd like to trade it off.  These run between $250-350 depending on where you look.  I'm looking for a small pocket gun of similar value for summer carry, something along the lines of a SCCY CP-2 Gen 2, Kel Tec PF9, or other similar pocket sized guns.  Looking for 9mm, but might consider something in .380 like a Kel Tec P3AT or Ruger LCP. Might also consider a snub nosed .38 revolver.

Feel free to call/text three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers.  Texts preferred as I sleep during the day, but I will get back with you ASAP if I'm interested.

Make: Sig Sauer

Model: P226 TacOps

Caliber: .40 S&W

Location (city or county): Brea @ OC Indoor Range. (Orange County, Southern California)

Price: $1200, or trade for your Glock 19 Gen3+cash.

Will ship (Y/N): No, Off Roster. FTF Only.

Other info: I have for sale a brand new/unfired Sig Sauer P226 TacOps in .40 S&W. It's a P226 model that's off the CA roster. It will come with three 10 round .40 magazines and the original case, original lock, instruction manuals, etc. Everything. The three magazines come with Wolff springs installed but original springs are also included. I'm also throwing in 300 rounds of Winchester white box .40 ammo in this deal. Since it is a TacOps and was never on the roster to begin with, it does not have a LCI and does not have a magazine disconnect. I will do the transaction at OC Indoor in Brea, CA, or will drive a reasonable distance to meet serious buyers. Please PM me if interested. Thanks."

Not all tz 75 has this feature this on is the pre 1988 Tanfaglio tz75 9mm which is the only cz clone made that parts are interchangeable with the cz75.parts are made in some of the same shops in Italy as the Beretta. this one was made in 1984 also has a large mag release. These are used as competition guns because these features super fast mag changes and slide releases. A modern day Tanfalio are 1200 bucks and up they are a hi quality well respected gun maker. This one is in near perfect condition with beautiful Italian walnut grips 2-15 rnd mags, very low rnd count, is like buying a new gun. I have also had the feed ramped polished and a new extra power exstactor spring installed. I read some where that they get weak over time so i replaced it, just in case.I have also owned Turkish made cz style guns and they are not even close to the light weight smooth action and way better trigger and ergonomics as the Tanfagelo thanks for looking"

I want to upgrade my home defense weapon to .45 ACP, thus need to sell my current one.
Very nice pistol with hand polishing on the SS slide. Bought new 10 months ago. Gun is very well taken care of. Exactly 200 rounds fired, not a single malfunction. Cleaned and oiled really well and was put in lock box by my bed. This pistol looks better than new!
This is a wonderful gun you can trust your life with, no joke. Pictured on it is a flashlight and defense strobe light. I just put it on, and has yet to see fired rounds with it attached. Light is $45 in addition to the $350 if wanted. Very lightweight, and extremely blinding lumen power.

Price is firm, cash only. Must have at least permit to purchase, no FFL or requirement to register though. Just want to cover myself by selling to a legit and legal buyer."

BlackHawk CQC SERPA Holster Matte Finish w/Belt loop and Paddle Product Info 
The BlackHawk CQC SERPA Holster Matte Finish w/ Belt loop & Paddle has a unique holster design allowing you to forget old-fashioned thumb breaks that slow your draw and complicate re-holstering. The patented SERPA lock on the BlackHawk CQC Holster Matte Finish engages the trigger guard as you holster the pistol and won’t let go until you release it. The release is made using your normal drawing motion, with the trigger finger beside the holster body. As your trigger finger naturally comes to rest on the SERPA locks release mechanism, simply push the mechanism as you draw the weapon and it releases the gun for a smooth, fast draw. These gun holsters have no awkward use of a middle finger release or thumb break to interfere with a full combat grip, and the SERPA lock lets you draw your weapon quickly from the holster while establishing a full grip from start to finish. Unlike thumb breaks, which can sometimes be difficult to fasten one-handed, the SERPA lock allows you to re-holster quickly and securely every time, using only one hand. In addition, the BlackHawk CQC SERPA Holster Matte Finish w/ Belt loop & Paddle allows concealed carry with minimum weight and bulk. These carbon-fiber concealment holsters by BlackHawk are made from the strongest and lightest materials available, giving you a versatile holster with a unique design and a retention system."

For those unfamiliar with Smith models and nomenclature the Smith & Wesson Model 13 (Military & Police Magnum) is a .357 Magnum revolver designed for military and police use. It is based on S&W's K-frame platform—specifically, it is a .357 Magnum version of the heavy-barrel variant of the .38 Special Model 10 (originally called the Military & Police).  The Model 13-2, second change, was produced from 1977-1981 time span, and features a pinned barrel and counterbored (recessed) chambers.  
While issued in great numbers by law enforcement and security worldwide, few have made the transition to civlian life.  
The one in question retains approximately 80% of its original blued finish, with no corrosion.  The lock up is tight, and timing is perfect.  It has not seen many .357 Mag loads through the four inch heavy barrel, and the barrel throat is in great shape.  The gun currently wears a Pachmayr Gripper grips and a Brownell's extended Cylinder release latch.  Internally it is all forged, hand fit steel parts, NO MIM in this old girl.  Finally, with a recent spring upgrade she is ready for another 30+ years of use.  
While my preference is to keep it, I am trying to fund another new toy.  Overall, prices of classic Smith & Wesson revolvers are rising and the pinned and recessed ones are some of the most desirable.

Please Observe

I have very nice rifle for sale.  Only reason its for sale is that I want the exact same rifle only with the now available green laminate stock.  I am a laminate lover and have many laminate guns...none are better than Ruger's!  This gun has exactly 60 rounds through it.  I know this because I'm a freak about breaking in my barrels properly.  These 60 rounds have been slow and methodical, with a patch run after every three rounds.  I always go to 100 rounds before I move to a patch after every five rounds.  Nonethelss, this is very much a ""like new in box"" example.  It also comes with:

     - Box and all factory supplied materials (scope rings, steel mag, stock spacers etc.)
     - Your choice of additional Ruger brand polymer magazine: 3rd, 5rd or 10rd
     - EoTech 512 weapon sight: simply the best!
     - 40 rounds of Winchester S308M: a match grade 168gr sierra bullet --- Great Stuff!

Price as packaged is: $1000
     If you take away all the extras, its like I'm selling the gun for less that $500!

Well over $1500 spent so low-ballers will get no response just a laugh on my end. Email SERIOUS offers and I will get back to you. May consider trade for man toys a.k.a things that go BOOM but no junk. Springfield XD chambered in 9mm or .357 Sig with gear will get preference! Email pic if offering trade.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)
3. Ruger SP101, 3 inch barrel - 930 fps (303 ft. lbs.)
4. S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel - 979 fps (336 ft. lbs.)"

The F-105D all-weather strike fighter and the two-place F-105F dual-purpose trainer-fighter were also built before F-105 production (833 aircraft) ended in 1964.

The Viper PST (Precision Shooting Tactical) riflescope boasts features associated with top-tier riflescopes, yet comes in at a street price under the $1,000 mark. Matching reticle and turret measurements allow accurate, fast dialing of shots. The one-piece 30mm tube, precision-machined from a single solid block of aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum, offers ample windage and elevation adjustment. Born from an intimate understanding of riflescope design, forward-thinking engineering, and open ears to a market incredibly vocal about what it wants in a riflescope, the Viper PST series delivers the performance and features tactical shooters demand at an economical price. 

Optical Features:
Optically Indexed Lenses - Delivers optimum image sharpness and brightness with true reticle use for full ranging and holdover from edge to edge because of computer-controlled alignment during construction.
XD Lens Elements - Extra-low dispersion (XD) glass enhances resolution, color, and contrast.
XR Lens Coatings - Vortex XR proprietary anti-reflection lens coatings increase light transmission with multiple coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces.
Construction Features:
30 mm Tube - Provides greater strength and wider adjustment lattitude as compared to a 1-inch tube.
One-Piece Tube - Maximizes alignment for improved accuracy and optimum visual performance as well as strength and waterproofness.
Aircraft-Grade Aluminum - Construction from a solid block of 6061-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum delivers increased strength and rigidity.
Waterproof - O-ring seals prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the tube for reliable performance in all environments.
Fogproof - Filled with argon gas to inhibit internal fogging over a wide range of temperatures.
Shockproof - Lenses are locked in place, fore and aft, with machined locking rings to remain in perfect alignment and resist impact.
Hard Anodized Finish - Type-3 hard-coat anodization is durable; the low-glare matte helps camouflage the shooter’s position.
ArmorTek - Ultra-hard, scratch-resistant coating repels oils and corrosive salts on outer glass surfaces.
Internal Mechanism Design Features:
CRS Zero Stop - Customizable Rotational Stop (CRS) prevents dialing more than one rotation below your zero so you don't lose the zero when dialing large amounts of elevation corrections. Patent pending.
Tall Uncapped Turrets - Make range calculation and shooting adjustments fast and accurate with subtension marks that match the reticle .
Single Spring Construction - Fully constrains (without over-constraining) the optical system for predictable, improved accuracy throughout the range of elevation adjustment.
Glass-etched Reticle - Protected between two layers of glass (not made from wire) for optimum durability and reliability.
Illuminated Reticle - Electronic illumination aids in low light visibility of reticle. Battery included.
Illumination Control - Can be turned on or off with a single click between each intensity level—allowing access to a preferred illumination setting without having to progress through each intensity level. Positioned at 45 degrees off the left side of the eyepiece for easy adjustment without blocking view of the turret setting or magnification.
Convenience Features:
MagView Bar - Combines a fiber optics magnification indicator with raised rear-facing magnification references for clear viewing in low light conditions. Patent pending.
Radius Bar - Fiber optic turret rotation indicator provides illuminated and tactile point of reference for turret rotations. Patent pending.
Fast Focus Eyepiece - Allows quick and easy reticle focusing.
Side Parallax - Uses an adjustment mechanism on the left side of the riflescope to fine-tune focus to eliminate parallax shooting error.
