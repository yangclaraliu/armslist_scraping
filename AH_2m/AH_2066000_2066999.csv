Has brown shoulder holster w/ double mag holder, might include with transaction depending on price or trade.$525 or trade....note lookig for a glock 27 or a nice sks with extras. This is a Beretta with a rail so lights and lasers are easily added . The rear strap of the butt is straight rather than arched and the stocks on the Vertec are both flatter and more aggressively surfaced for a better grip. In addition, the trigger blade has been thinned, to better allow reaching by oneâs distal joint to fire the first round by the trigger cocking method. The barrel is also a few tenths of an inch shorter and terminates at the end of the slide.

In addition, law enforcement agencies requested an accessory rail to accept flashlights and laser sighting devices. This feature is becoming more the rule than exception, as departments attempt to limit their liability for errant shots by affording the operator both a way to positively identify oneâs assailant and provide a secondary aiming system."

Other issues include failure to feed and extraction problems.  

I will polish all friction points in both the trigger group and the bolt.
I'll reshape the nose of the firing pin and polish the stamped edges.
I'll polish the trigger return spring plunger and the mating surface on the trigger.
I will reshape the extractor and stone and polish it for positive extraction.
I will rework the bolt release so you can release the bolt by simply pulling it back. 
        Never again will you have to fumble with the finicky bolt release.
I will polish and radius the factory hammer and stone the hammer hook.
I will polish and reshape the sear for a crisp and light engagement. 
I will install an overtravel adjustment screw on the trigger.

When this is done you will have a rifle with a 3 pound trigger +/- a couple of ounces with all the original factory springs, safety checked and 100% reliable.  The improved trigger will improve your accuracy and enjoyment of the rifle.  

Other work can be done upon request, 

I can shim the hammer, sear and diconnector.  Shiming the parts makes disassembly and reassambly of the trigger group a real challenge for  those not familar with the process.  

I can drill an access hole at the back of the receiver to allow you to clean the rifle from the breach instead of the muzzel. 

I can install a recoil buffer to protect the bolt and receiver as well.

I can polish and tune the factory magazines for smoother operation and improved feeding.

All the above work is for a rifle intended for casual target shooting and hunting."

Unfortunately, it is more than I can handle after two wrist injuries.    Either need to sell, or trade for a .357 mag or .44 mag with a long barrel (tends to be easier for me to shoot comfortably).

It resides in a handmade stock by Paulson himself, and sports vintage Redfield sights. It is in the original 7.65x53 Argentine, unlike it`s thousands of similar sporters, which were converted to .30-06. In my limited experience, I`ve found that it is a lot cheaper than .30-06 too. The weapon has been used, and it shows. It has no Rust, just some patina on the Bolt face. Mr. Paulson is now deceased, and that only makes this Mauser worth more. Most of his work is in private collections, too. I had it priced at about $700-$750 by a friend who is very knowledgeable on this subject. It only needs a good bolt cleaning, although everything functions exactly as it should."

It also has a Simmons 3-9x40 scope that has really clear glass, and which makes for a nice, light rifle.

I took this rifle as a trade, and never fired it, but the bore is mirror bright, and the action and trigger are superb and more smooth than my Savage and Remington. 

I have one too many .300 WM's so would like to get this into someone elses' hands for hunting season this year.

To see pic. Click on listings by this user above this listing. 

Mine is new in box, unfired. No issues with it. Comes with all normal stuff and 2 mags. 

I prefer the Glock OD or FDE color.......the one I really want is like the desert sand color GEN 4, but I am open to any Gen 4. 

Might possibly consider a Gen 3 if the right deal. 

Mine is stock so yours does not need to have Night Sights but if it has a trigger job done by gunsmith, that would be great.


If yours has extras like trigger job, extra mags, extended slide release, pinky extensions, we should be able to work something out to make up difference if price is realistic with ammo trade on my side, cant do cash. 

Must be FL Resident and legal age, no felons......prefer cwp and FTF only near Clermont............please look it up b4 emailing me.


Im only able to drive 10-15 minutes to do this which would be the edge of Clermont. 

I prefer New with box gun, but possibly open to a very lightly used one. 

I would also consider trading toward an inexpensive AR. 
By inexpensive I mean under $1200 based on walmart pricing. 

I prefer Spikes, Colt, Sig, Bush, Windham, but open to see what you have. I have a few other guns I could trade and a bunch of ammo I can trade to even up the deal. 

Mostly 9mm ammo and 22lr. I cant add cash! 

Upper and lower must be same manufacturer please.

Here is the reply one unsatisfied customer got.

""Dear Mr Kelly Edwards,

I have received the following response from our Quality Systems Manager, following your email:

The Practice product you are referring to is an unusual product, it is not featured in the new product range and marketing materials because it is a very low quality cartridge which we donât aim to manufacture. Every cartridge manufactured by ELEY is graded and the quality specification decides whether its Tenex grade, Match, Club and so on. Practice cartridges is a byproduct â basically cartridges which do not make even our lowest grade become Practice. With increasing production technology and quality control, we donât produce high volumes of Practice â hence we donât market it. On the occasion where we do have some practice this is sold to distributors as a special offer.

3106-30252

Looking back through our Quality records, the lot was originally proofed as Target 17 in 2006. It appears to have been downgraded to our cheapest and lowest quality product (Practice) at packing.

The performance of this low graded product can be erratic but safe. The projectiles that fail to reach the target appear to do so because they have insufficient energy. Such performance is often seen (this comment really bothers me)with Practice and can be the reason for being graded Practice. Our recommendation would be to try our Target or Club grade ammo as there are better options for target practice.

Kind Regards

Kate White

I wouldn't mind picking up a gun for $50 and putting 10 hours of work into it. The bores must be fine though. Military surplus, antiques, beaters, all good. Looking for mostly small calibers, 17HMR, .22lr, .22WMR, 20 ga, .410, I am open to any offer. The price is key though."

You can see this in the photo, its hard to notice and doesn't appear to compromise the structural integrity of the wood. It is very sturdy and was likely a factory defect, not from mishandling. Ruger may even cover this under warranty if you look into it, their customer service is very good as ive been told. i haven't had the time to look into this though. There is also some wear at the break of the gun, but hardly noticable (ill send picture on request as i could only upload 3 photo to the listing). this gun has been well taken care of.

Common Questions!

Are you the first owner of it?

I built this bike! from a Canadian frame I purchased and a gpz1100b1 motor I brought over 13 yrs ago from the uk, motor was built 20 years ago while I worked at Z1 CITY in Kent, UK,

Why are you selling it?

Quite simply I have too! my wife fell ill and has just been diagnosed with chronic heart disease on top of her diabetes, Lyme disease, hyperthyroid and is unable to work, and money has been tight ever since! this is the last high value item I own and was always going to be the last thing I sold, that time has now come unfortunately.

Does it has any fault affecting it?

Like all 30 year old bikes every now and again something happens as of right now everything seems fine and once warmed up pulls like a freight train, tank has several nicks and chips and scratches and I never got round to painting it, just touched up where needed. it is not a show bike but mechanically sound and handles like a sports bike while still keeping the old school looks.

Can you send me general close up pictures?

sure not a problem, I'll have to borrow a camera though,

Can i have your contact phone number? Home phone: REDACTED,

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be e
lasily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nanoâs extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanoâs magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

The Nanoâs sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.

Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

In 1969 Marlin changed their serial number code from the first 2 characters being letters to indicate the year mfgd. from 69 on, the first 2 characters were the last 2 numbers of the four digit year mfgd., however, there were a very few that got stamped ""68"" before the 1969 productions started, this rifle is one of those guns. I have talked to several Marlin collectors who have dozens of these 336 lever guns and they tell me that a ""68"" serial number doesn't exist and the 1968 productions all have AD for the first 2 characters. No one can tell me how many of these were made but from my research, it's a pretty good bet that you can go through all guns in your collection and your buddy's collection and you won't find a single one.
