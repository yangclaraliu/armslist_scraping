 MODEL 700™ ADL VARMINT
There is a cost that comes with high performance; in this case, it’s a lot less than you think.  The Model 700 ADL Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700 action; the most solid, dependable and trusted action in existence.
Its 26"" heavy contour matte black barrel is perfectly matched to the most popular varmint calibers (22-250 Remington, 223 Remington, and 308 Win).  Plus, the ergonomically designed synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation.  The Model 700 ADL Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.
KEY FEATURES:
•	Legendary Model 700 action 
•	26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.) with a matte black finish 
•	Rugged synthetic stock with vented beavertail fore-end for faster barrel cooling 
•	Sling swivel studs included (two in the front) 
•	Blind box magazine"

I have only one Multicam Front/Back/Side Carrier manufactured by
""Tactical Tailor"" for sale the complete set plate carrier including the plates would be $300

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

I'm at a very firm price point of $500. Non-negotiable, especially if we decide to meet and it's brought up. I will just walk away and forget it. If you email me and interested in it, then I assume your good with the price. I can't stress this enough....it's a very fair price considering your getting a much needed grip sleeve ($15) and holster ($28) and ammo ($25) with the deal. 

Will only sell to CCW holders, and will ask to see it...I have one and will have no problem showing you mine.

I've put about 120 rounds through it. It is a Calico Liberty 1 carbine, it feeds from a unique helical magazine on top that holds 50 rounds. Spring for the magazine has a depress button to release tension for storage, then when loaded simply winds up 10 times and it's ready to go into the gun and fire. Internal design of this rifle is very similar to an MP5 as it is delayed blowback. Fairly accurate with some practice, fun plinker. Three position collapsible stock: closed, open, fully extended. Has front ""kelly"" grip installed. Grips are hollow and have removable caps on the bottom, the first grips cap fell off and I lost it, but I just ordered a new one plus a manual so if you buy it when they arrive in the mail I will give you the manual and cap free. The cap is purely cosmetic, doesn't effect function at all.

Here's a review: http://www.gunsandtactics.com/gear-review-5-11-tactical-field-ops-watch

I have not used the ballistic computer, but here's how it works (from the review): 
Input your known ballistic data (bore height, ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity and zero range), then add your environmental data (range, temperature, altitude, inclination) and the SureShot® calculator will give you a shooting solution in MILS, TMOA or SMOA. You can even get your solution in clicks for both windage and elevation.

Shockproof, scratchproof, water resistant (to 100 M) and with an anti-glare face, this watch also features a digital compass, chronometers and keeps time in three time zones. It also features an optional watchband for wearing outside of jackets and outerwear. It's a cool watch, and now you can get one that's just about new at a discount."

What I have is a 5.56x45 AR15 redx arms upper, redx arms upk a Wilson 24"" BBAR SS with a 1/8 twist. A standard aluminum knurled handguard  with a PSA PREMIUM BCG. A dpms lower with color fill and a dpms LPK. A magpul Moe fixed stock with storage compartment. A brownells rifle buffer, tube and spring. And a Ergo pistol grip. Mounted on top is a Nikon M-223 4x12x42mm I prefer not to sell with scope but for right price I will. 

Reason I'm selling is because its just to heavy to be lugging around coyote hunting and its too long to be stomping around in the woods with. It's a great shooting gun just need something smaller. I'll answer any question and will meet if short distance away. Otherwise I have a FFL who will ship. You can email me And if serious ill give number. 

Stuff I'd be interested in are saiga AK, saiga 12, possible Russian AK, SKS a smaller equal value AR15, mini 14/30 1911 pretty much open to all firearms. Just ask the names Damian"

I used to have a bipod and high-power scope on this rifle and had it set up as a MBR for long-range out to 600-800 yards. I got consistent .75-1.5MOA with this rifle. I've also taken two whitetail with it last fall, great hunting rifle. I have enjoyed this rifle but am moving on to another project. Cash is king, would also consider trades for .999 silver and will give spot price credit against the value. No other trades will be considered unless it's a Ruger Gunsite Scout 18"" SS and you've got some cash/ammo/silver on top. 

I'm basing my price on what I can find them for online and subtracting a little for the fact it's used, if you can find a better price, send it to me and I'll work with you. Thanks for looking, check out my other auctions. If you bought another one of my rifles I'd be willing to work with you on a nice package deal. Will respond to emails. Thanks!"

It has been refinished and is in great shape with about 99% finish remaining as re-nickeled. The revolver was made in the 1920s, but looks like it could have been made last year. This is a 3 inch barrel Hand Ejector which is on the I Frame. The I frame is just a little bit smaller than a J Frame. The action is crisp, smooth, and tight. It would make a great carry gun, trail gun, or a SUPERB ladies gun.  The grips are customized from a set of 1960s Chief's Special grips, and are well fitted and quite attractive.

The action is pre-war S&W quality - smooth as silk and the lockup is tight as a bank vault. I have six rounds of .32 S&W Long ammunition that will go with it, so you will be ready to go as soon as you get it. 

I have sold my Smith & Wesson collection mostly all off in the past few months to pursue other collecting interests. It is about a third the price of a new one, and is frankly better built and nicer.

Description from Rainier Arms: Drop-in bolt has a self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. Nickel Boron produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too—fouling brushes right off. Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws. Bolt includes extractor, ejector, and gas rings installed."
