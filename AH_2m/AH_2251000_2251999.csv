23,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2251023,For Sale:  Completely new P14.45 Para-Ordnance Stainless + Factory Extras,"West Side of Evansville, Evansville, Indiana",$ 995,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 30, 2013",Handguns,Para Ordnance                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"On March 30, 1981 a mentally ill John Hinckley Jr. attempted to assassinate then President Ronald Reagan only 69 days into his presidency with a 22 caliber Röhm RG-14 revolver he purchased at a pawn shop.  Hinckley fired all 6 .22lr cartridges from his pistol in 1.7 seconds hitting James Brady directly in the head, District of Columbia police officer Thomas Delahanty in the back of his neck, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy in the abdomen, and President Reagan with his 6th shot after it ricocheted off the armored side of the limousine and hit the president in his left underarm, grazing a rib and lodging in his lung, stopping only 1 inch from his heart. The 3rd and 5th bullets did not hit any people.

The 6th shot that ended up hitting Reagan pierced his lung and created heavy internal bleeding. Prompt medical attention not only saved his life, but allowed him to maintain control of his office despite Secretary of State Alexander Haig incorrectly stating that he was ""in control here"" at the time.  The police officer, Thomas Delahanty, recovered but had to retire due to his wound and Secret Service agent, Timothy McCarthy, who was protecting Reagan with his body, fully recovered.  Sadly, James Brady, the White House Press Secretary under U.S. President Ronald Reagan suffered a very serious head wound that left him paralyzed and permanently disabled.  

Hinckley got off, in my opinion, way too easily because he claimed that watching the movie ""Taxi Driver"" with Robert Di Nero and Jodie Foster nearly 20 times caused him to become mentally ill due to 'erotomania' and a liberal Federal District Judge Barrington D. Parker received thousands of letters protesting his 'acquittal' of Hinckley due to his insanity plea.  This all leads up to why I purchased this pistol shortly after it was manufactured in 1996.  Rather than work to change the legal system ""loopholes"" that allowed Hinckley to be acquitted due to a plea of insanity (and never took the stand at his trial at the advice of his attorneys), Sarah Brady made it her lifelong goal to try to remove firearms from the public.

Our next president, George H. W. Bush, was hammered by two things; not 'finishing the job' in Iraq and mostly for refusing to allow any Brady Bill, Brady Law, Assault Weapons Ban etc. to ever get passed.  Bush went on record calling for our government to ""Go after the criminal not the gun owner"".  Never before had Democrats used the proposition of new gun laws as a campaign tactic for the office of President of the United States.  Bill Clinton certainly did, with great success, putting Sarah Brady on the microphone to tell of the evils of guns.  Obviously it worked for Slick Willy who, previously with his extremely shady past, was not even considered a reasonable contender.  The public had successfully been turned on firearms!  Never mind that on February 28, 1993 Janet Reno, with Clinton's full backing, murdered Seventy-six people, including 21 children and two pregnant women, along with Davidian leader David Koresh in Waco, TX.  Clinton reasoned ""that was justified"" because they ""had guns""!  On November 30, 1993 Clinton got both houses to pass the Brady Bill and Assault Weapons Bill a year later leaving gun owners suddenly faced wide spread new laws greatly restricting firearms.  Clinton got re-elected despite turning the White House into the Playboy Mansion East and things looked dim for supporters of the 2nd Amendment.

All that is precisely WHY I purchased quite a few brand new high capacity firearms at that time while I still could and simply bought more safes to put them in so they could remain pristine in climate controlled conditions.  This Para-Ordnance P.14 .45ACP is a perfect example of what was (and likely will again be) targeted by the government.  I used the 'coupon' to purchase two additional high capacity magazines from Para-Ordnance, which are still in their original wrapper and included in this deal.  The firearm has positively never had a round chambered in it and likely has only been out of my safe once or twice prior to taking the pics for this ad.  I also spent well over $100, at the time, to purchase a 4th factory Para-Ordnance magazine that has a different footplate and holds 15 rounds, which is still in it's original wrapper and clearly marked as such by Para.  It's all here and any tiny marks on the pistol would be ones from the factory in getting to the gun store and to my safe.

Needless to say, there are very, very few 100% pristine high capacity .45 ACP 1911 style pistols still out there from the Clinton era.  I will sell face to face to another buyer in Evansville, IN or, for $40 plus the cost of insurance, ship to an FFL dealer.  Payment must be in cash or by USPS money orders.  No exceptions.  Now you have the full background.  Are you ready to own a piece of history?  Any questions, just ask.  Want more pics, just ask."

 The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Matte Blue.  In original box.  Technically used, but only about ten rounds ever fired through it, by me (we can count the rounds I have left to know exactly - it may be only five or six rounds fired).  I'm not a gun guy;  bought for protection while traveling, and as a statement of personal freedom and belief in citizen rights of self protection.  Due to health reasons I no longer travel, and my 870 pump is all the home protection I need, if that.  Comes with the remainder of the only box of ammo I ever bought for it, which is almost full.  Staggered-round magazine.   Trigger lock included, as well.  

I have kept the pistol clean.  Check out the reviews;  it is a fine weapon at reasonable cost.  Fits the hand very well, and extra-deep tang prevents web-of-hand injuries from slide.  Great hammer-lock design, with de-cocking lever.  It is virtually new and looks it, and shoots it.

Winchester only produced 196,400 Model 50s between 1954 and 1961, and very few (<50,000) examples of the Featherweight between 1958 and 1960, making this a rare and collectible piece. Winchester stopped production because it was too expensive to manufacture, and the profit margin per unit was too low.   A true “pre-64 Winchester”, the Model 50 is considered a well built and reliable shotgun – it has all machined parts and no stamped, cast or plastic anywhere. It is a short bolt blowback action with a floating chamber, and the first production autoloader with a non-recoiling barrel (the Browning A5 and the Remington 48 have recoiling barrels). The rare featherweight model replaced the steel frame and trigger group with an aluminum alloy; the Model 50 Featherweight swings and tracks quickly, making it a favorite with many champion skeet and trap shooters. 

This particular shotgun was manufactured in late 1959 and features a 28 inch full fixed choke barrel and walnut “field grade” stocks with factory hand-cut checkering. The action is fully functional; I had it out last autumn and shot a full round of skeet without any malfunctions. The stock is free of cracks, chips, deep scratches, or gouges but may have some light handling marks. There is no rust, pitting, or cracks in the metal. The bluing is 90 – 95% with some lightening around the base of the barrel. There are some light handling marks on the receiver, and one small ¼ inch scratch near the ejection port. The bore is near perfect. This gun does not look to have been used much - this is a NICE gun. I am only selling to thin out my shotgun collection.

Add this rare Winchester to your collection, or take it into the field next season!

Got it as a fun novelty gun just on the principle of how bad ass it is. Had my fun with it and moving on to future firearm endeavors. This is not a must go item, there is no rush on my part. I am pretty open-minded in trades.
The Governor fires .45ACP, .45Long Colt and 410 shotgun shells. It comes with 4 boxes of 410 6shot shells, one box of 410 PDX1 self defense shells, a few .45LC self defense rounds, a customer form fitting leather holster, 6 moon clips, two internal lock keys, and hard case. It is a pretty bad ass gun and very sleek/sexy. 
I am looking to get multi stripped AR-15 lower receivers. You can get them online at Palmetto State Armoury for $100 or less. This firearm is well worth at least $800 not including the ammo and accessories it comes with. I am looking to get 6 AR-15 stripped lower receivers. That is only about a $600 value. You do the math. 
But outside of that I am relatively open-minded but I am on an AR-15 kick currently, so tickle my fancy but do not waste my time. I know my AR-15s/parts/accessories/ect, I have built 11 in the past few months, currently working on one for my wife right now and need these 6 lowers for future builds.

At this time, I am considering the guns sold.  In the event that the offer falls through, I will remove this paragraph.  Anyone who has contacted me about these guns will be advised of the status of the sale directly.

Up for sale, I have a Beretta 1200 field gun.  It has a wood stock that still shines, but it has a few scratches and one faded area on the forearm.  It shoots well.  The action locks up well and cycles smoothly. The gun shoots accurately.  My younger son shot this gun last year during trap season.  He has upgraded to a trap gun and this one is sitting around unused.  It would be nice to see the gun go to someone who is going to put it to use,rather than sitting idle.

You won't get a better deal on a Beretta shotgun anywhere.  This gun is priced to sell   quickly so we can invest in the P&W press to keep up with the shooting. 

Since I already have the press picked out and the deal made.  I just need the money to close the deal.  There's a little room to negotiate on the price.  Selling sooner is better than later.  

I also have a Mossberg 500A 8 shot for sale.  If you'd like to make me an offer for the pair, I am very interested in discussing the possibilities."

I have a complete 1989 Force 125hp outboard boat motor with title for parts or maybe repair....It is complete with a good lower end, good tilt trim, good electronics (power packs, stator, etc) It has everything still on it including carbs, etc.....

The reason I'm selling it for parts is because it has a bad cylinder....This was a good running motor before it quit, so all the parts (beside the block itself) should work
These parts are expensive.....or you could rebuild it and have a nice engine for cheap...Also included is a wooden boat motor stand that it is mounted to

Might add better pics tomorrow, motor is in Holdenville, but might meet potential buyers if my schedule allows....THANKS

Cody @ 520-723-nine255

The material grade of these plates are Mil-A-46100 steel, the measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. (Ar500 is target material, not intended use for body armor). Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. If you do try to buy ar500, ask them if it stops a .30cal AP M2. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 hangdun...still no penetration. As displayed and shown in the photographs you will see the test shot target and the ones never before shot at. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've personally shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches and ETC to this"

Make an Offer!!!!!  Pre 100000 serial #.  This came from Springfield Armory with the following USGI parts already installed: USGI HRT bolt (worth ~$400), USGI TRW Trigger Group and Hammer (worth ~$300), USGI SAK chrome lined barrel (worth ~$300),and a USGI Winchester Op-Rod (worth ~$250).  It's hard to find these kinds of Quality M-14 parts anymore and they cost A LOT, and you still have to get the receiver and a Gunsmith who knows what they are doing.   I don't know if the fiberglass/synthetic stock is USGI or Springfield.  I added a Troy Battle Rail/scope mount, which is SOLID ($300); it also comes with the original rear sight, barrel band, and upper hand guard which the Troy rail replaced.  To aid with accuracy, I added a Smith Enterprises gas system shim kit ($15) and a Sadlak National Match Op-Rod Spring Guide ($50). This Rifle comes also comes with 5 20-round mags: 2 Check-Mate ($70), 1 Borg-Warner ($40), 1 Winchester ($40) and a cheap Promag ($20); along with a Blackhawk brand Harris Style Bipod ($60).  You do the Math, This is a great Buy; A Custom Build with these kinds of parts can cost you $2500-$3000 easily!  1300.00 OBO"

I have the CZ82, TWO 12 round magazines, box and military holster it came with.  These have polygonal rifling, chrome lined barrels, cocked and locked safety, and arguably better sights and grip than the Makarov.  Would be a great gun for you if you like the 9x18mm round but want it in a more comfortable and modern platform.

Im wanting to trade for a Makarov.  Not picky about country of origin, IJ-70, Bulgarian, German, whatever, but it must be in 9x18mm, not .380, and I'm only wanting a makarov, not a P-64, PA-63 or Wanad.

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savage_10FP

I have fired about 25 rounds of Rem 150grain Core Lokt PSP and have cleaned the bore after every round for the first 5 rounds, and every 3-5 rounds since then. I purchased the gun new from factory in 2008 and have babied it ever since. Shows no signs of wear or use. I lowered the accutrigger pull down to approx 2lbs so it has an excellent crisp break. 

This gun is mounted with a Schoenfeld 3-9x40 mil dot, illuminated reticle scope. Dont know much about it except that it seems to hold zero fine on rifle. I have been getting approx 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards with this gun and I believe it has potential to be a solid sub moa rifle with the right handload of ammo. 

 I am asking $650 for the gun and scope. I also have some .308 ammo for sale in another ad if interested. If you are interested feel free to call or text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking!"

I have fired about 25 rounds of Rem 150grain Core Lokt PSP and have cleaned the bore after every round for the first 5 rounds, and every 3-5 rounds since then. I purchased the gun new from factory in 2008 and have babied it ever since. Shows no signs of wear or use. I lowered the accutrigger pull down to approx 2lbs so it has an excellent crisp break. 

This gun is mounted with a Schoenfeld 3-9x40 mil dot, illuminated reticle scope. Dont know much about it except that it seems to hold zero fine on rifle. I have been getting approx 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards with this gun and I believe it has potential to be a solid sub moa rifle with the right handload of ammo.
