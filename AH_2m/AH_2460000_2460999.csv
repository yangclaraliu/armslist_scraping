Has maybe 500 rounds through it, only modifications are a cut safety (to lock bolt open for inspection, etc) and screwholes in the forend from a previous rail mounted bipod. 

This one is of the old-school slantback stock variety, much more sought after now that the straightbacks are being imported. This specifically was imported through Arsenal in LV, Nevada, which is the best importer in the US as any AK enthusiast is well aware. This is not a subpar Robarms variant, this is the real thing. 

I paid 1199 for it, only looking for 1000 back, a new safety and forend can be had for under 80 total so if you want it like new, take 80 off the price. I just got a German automobile which requires more TLC than my budget allows, thus, I need to sell this. 

Ohio CCW holders preferred, will accept Ohio DL with stipulation that I run a background check beforehand.  Would much rather the CCW do that for me though. 

Give me your best offer, but NO LOWBALLS. I've had people at ranges beg me to buy this for 1000, don't cut several points off of that and expect a response. That being said, never hurts to try though. 

Comes in original box, with cleaning kit and rod, as well as original manual. Will include my last 20 rounds of 7.62, the original 10rd magazine, and the knock-off Harris bipod as well as a Weaver 4x duplex  scope on a UTG mount (my brothers crap) to whoever gives me the best offer.

Would prefer to meet in Columbus, will travel within reason for a good offer. 

Trust me, for a grand, this is a steal. I've shot sub MOA groups with a 4x weaver on a crap mount. Cant imagine what it would do with a proper optic and TWS rail system.

Accuracy equal to the average Anschutz target rifle, and better than almost any USA target rifle to 50 Meters.  The only pistol with the barrel at the level of the index finger, to prevent gun rotation while the bullet travels down the barrel.  Probably the most accurate handgun ever made.  The sights are designed to allow the gun to be held canted as well as vertical.  The high sight position does require somewhat different aiming technique that most FPs.  

Use with any velocity ammunition is possible due to the muzzle brake and chamber strength.  10"" barrel.  Two weights included.  The weight bar serves to aid in sight alignment and keeping the gun vertical while aiming, and to set up countervibration to increase accuracy.  It also can be used to adjust the feel of the gun.

Left hand standard (large) grip, or rightr hand very large (really very large) grip available, your choice.  Includes OEM plastic case, and instruction manuals (one in English if needed, and original German with test target).

Not a concealable gun, but for transfer purposes, sold as if it were a concealable handgun.  All relevant state and federal laws are followed for transfer, in that regard, including waiting period for a handgun.  Generally legal in CA, but classified as an assault weapon in some of local or state laws.

More images or info on request.  

In the old High Standard terminology, this gun is a 100 XXX.  A thousand of these guns were made.  All were assembled, start to finish, by one person who currently is the director of technical services at Steyr.  Spare parts are available, but only from Steyr Austria."

I'm sure that as you read here, I've already clued you in that I really know absolutely nothing about what's out there these days; the cheap copies over ""real deals,"" etc.  Back some 40 years ago, saying that you're wanting to purchase a 1911 .45 seemed like a simple thing. These days, the variety appears endless; hence, my ignorance.

I know that Colt initially manufactured the gun for the military.  Now, I see a virtual sea of variety that I cannot say exactly what I'm really looking for except to say that I'm seeking as close to what I once knew some 40 years ago.  I hear that Kimber, Colt and Sig Saur are pretty much up there for well-made, quality 1911s, but that's about it.  So, I guess this is where you come in.  I'm certainly open to education...and all reasonable offers to sell to me.

Only OREGON PRIVATE PARTY sellers need reply to this post.  Of course, I'm willing to travel for the right piece and price.  I'd like to keep my outlay to between $500 - $1,000.

The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates (SAPI NIJ standard III), however, the new E-SAPI plates will increase protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation"

I will draw up a bill of sale.  I prefer to use a CCL for identification purposes, but it's not required.  I would also like to check the buyer through the Wisconsin CCAP system, so a real name would be needed to complete the sale.  I'll be happy to provide my info as well so you know I'm able to own and sell a firearm.

If I have to ship, I'll want a USPS money order, plus shipping.

I don't know how much it will actually cost to ship.  I believe that, in state, I can ship directly to the buyer.  Near as I can tell, out of state, I only need to ship it TO an FFL, I don't have to ship it FROM an FFL, so there shouldn't be any irregular costs associated.  However, until I can get it all ironed out, call it $840 shipped, minus the ammo.

If you want the ammo shipped, that will be shipped separate at extra cost.

ALBANY – Checking the backgrounds and recording detailed information about anyone buying ammunition, a key component of New York’s gun-control law, will not begin as expected Jan. 15, State Police officials confirmed Friday evening.

Several days after The Buffalo News first inquired about delays in the ammunition provisions, the State Police said Friday the agency needs more time to develop a system that will check the backgrounds of individuals before they purchase ammunition.

Additionally, a requirement that ammunition sellers compile and maintain an assortment of information – from the buyer’s name and occupation to the type and amount of bullets bought – also will not be kicking in on Jan. 15 as permitted under the gun-control law.

Officials did not say when the ammunition background checks might start.

“The State Police is working on technology solutions to be able to carry out this section of the SAFE Act so that the public, buyers and sellers are not inconvenienced or delayed in any way when they purchase ammunition,’’ the State Police said in a statement."

It has the large ring action so it would be a good gun to change the barrel to a heavy caliber. The bolt, trigger guard and assembly, and everything else is in good shape. The bore and rifling are still in good shape as well. All serial numbers match. It would also make a good low cost deer rifle or truck gun as is. Will take 200.00 (what I paid) or best offer.

What you are looking at is a Beretta M9 manufactured in early 1999.  This is a hard to find example of Beretta's famous US Military issued handgun.

This pistol is basically an unissued Military M9 that was sold to civilians prior the year 2000.  It features all the factory proof marks and also has serialized parts, factory metal guide rod, factory metal trigger, etc.

Here is a link that will describe in better detail what I am talking about.  This is NOT the same commercial M9 you can buy in the stores today.

http://militaryarms.blogspot.com/2012/05/civilian-m9-pistol.html

With this pistol I am including the original US Military nylon green holster that came with it along with (5) 15 round Beretta magazines and (2) 30 round Beretta magazines.  It currently has Hogue rubber grips that will come along with the factory original Beretta grips.  I will also throw in a snap cap for the new owner as well to practice dry firing.

I've been on here for a long time and I've had nothing but successful and enjoyable transactions.  I'm completely honest in my listing and I would rate this gun at 92% cosmetically and 100% mechanically.  It has some VERY minor holster wear from being shot.  This gun has had an exact round count of 1800 rounds through it which is nothing if you know this firearm.  Always lubed and cleaned after every outing.

Must be 21+ with a valid Illinois FOID."

I am selling this firearm along with the ORIGINAL WWII nickel plated magazine + 4 newer, post war magazines. The Magazines for this firearm hold 8 rounds. Three of them are made by walther post-war, and the fourth is a 10-rd magazine made by a modern manufacturer. The fourth mag is still new in box.  

i originally bought this to add to my collection of world war 2 firearms, but I've decided to sell a few pieces to free up cash for my upcoming wedding.

this firearm is in great shooting condition! It is safe to shoot, all parts were checked and inspected by an expert.  The rifling in the barrel is in FANTASTIC condition, considering the age of the gun is about 71 years old.

This is a C&R so it can be transferred in the State of California through a FFL. If you live out of state, I will have to ship this firearm to your FFL.

This is a fantastic deal. Magazines for this gun are hard to come by, and can go for $90 alone. And you're getting five of them plus the gun.  I will include the hard case in the deal as well."

7.62x39 Yugo M92 AK-47 Pistol for sale or trade. This is a new in box from the factory Zavasta M92 PAP Ak-47 pistol. Not an imported parts kit, never disassembled. This is the only way to get a real AK-47 pattern firearm imported directly into the USA (pistol form). 

Perfect for SBR tax stamp if you wish. Fun as is, controllable despite what it looks like. Put a 2 point sling on it and it's very accurate. Barrel is Yugo threaded with a muzzle nut tack welded on. Easy to remove to add flash hiders, muzzle brakes, boosters, or a barrel extension + stock if you don't want to SBR. 

Love this gun, but I have two. Thought I'd SBR one and barrel extension the other but after some thought one SBR is just fine. 

Will take some trades, but cash is preferred. 

2 magazines included.

I will post pictures of the actual pistol in a day or two.

Edit: Thought I'd add I'd prefer cash. I'd take a check or money order if you don't mind waiting for it to clear first but that seems inconvenient to the buyer. No problem shipping to an FFL for +$30

Edit 2: Added some (bad) pictures. I forgot to note that this is factory zeroed with factory proof mark on the front sight (very cool)"

Older production S&W model 65-2. Pinned barrel, recessed cylinder. Locks up tighter than any S&W revolver I have ever owned. Crane gap & forcing cone perfect. Heavy barrel model, with serrated combat trigger. Faint turn line. Sweet trigger both SA and DA. Got it years back from an older gent who bought it new -- said he put less than one box of ammo through it -- all .38 spec. Normally I think stories like that are BS, but I believe it on this one. 

Wearing the original number-matching walnut grips. Comes with original S&W box and paperwork, including the oil paper. 

This is likely the closest you're going to get a new pinned and recessed .357 magnum K-frame.

Re: the m65 -- it is considered by many the ultimate ""fighting"" K-frame -- to quote a wiser man than me: ""the m65 has everything you need, and nothing you don't."" No fancy sights to snag your draw, no shrouded ejector rod to slow your reload -- the essential duty weapon from back when the K-frame was the standard sidearm of american law enforcement, made the way they used to make 'em."

It was developed from the famous Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, featuring a 600 mm (23.6"") barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the 150 mm (5.9"") -longer Gewehr 98. The carbine followed a similar trend in weapon design at the time, that a short rifle gave away little in ballistic efficiency at combat ranges, but was easier to handle on account of its shorter length.

During World War II, the vz. 24 was produced for the German armed forces during its occupation. The rifle was also produced in nearby Slovakia, a German ally and puppet state during the war.

The vz. 24 rifle was widely exported and enjoyed usage during and after World War 2, noticeably by Romania, Iran, Guatemala, China and others. Many of the contract rifles made for South American countries were chambered in 7mm Mauser or 7.65×53mm Argentine.

My rifle was acquired just under a year ago, It is a blast to shoot great rifle I hate to sell it but its the season for heating bills and Christmas and I have recently been laid off.
