I have a CMP Field Grade (although this could very well be a service grade in terms of quality and wear/tear) Springfield Receiver (ww2 manufactured 1943) M1 Garand with a WW2 trigger guard. Stock is a P proofed military replacement stock and the barrel is a replacement Springfield 1953. (I have a sneaking suspicion this rifle was manufactured during WW2 and might have been in Korea, only to be re-arsenaled once it got home in the early 50s) Shoots well, I have not shot at paper, but out to 150 yards I have been hitting pop cans and such with the iron sights.

Muzzle reading of 3 and Throat of 4 from the CMP. I have since measured it and gotten 2 and a little bit more than 3. CMP measures rather liberal. Military specs for a service rifle are less than 10/10. 

Rifle comes with CMP authenticity papers, CMP carrying case, CMP paperwork, CMP tag, 14 clips loaded with Greek HXP ball 30-06- 112 rounds, and Ammo case (30 caliber). Sling, Cloth bandolier.

The Spectre HC was banned in 1994 after only a few thousand were imported, making it difficult to find and hard to put a price on. I can assure you that you will not find another Spectre for sale anywhere in the region - you won't even find anything on Armslist besides one magazine for the .40cal variant.

The Spectre HC is a civilian model of the Spectre M4, a full auto SMG utilized by Police and Military forces in Italy. The Spectre is a standard blowback firearm operating from a closed bolt; however it has some unusual features. The barrel shroud completely hides the barrel. The bolt is designed to pump air through the barrel shroud to provide additional cooling. The Spectre is hammer-fired and the trigger group is double action with a decocker. This allows the shooter to safely carry a round in the chamber and fire immediately as the double action trigger eliminates the need for cocking prior to shooting. A manual safety is provided. Weighs 6lbs unloaded, and measures about 14 inches in length. In other words a compact, high capacity SHTF firearm. Barrel is about 5 inches, effective range is 150m or about 500 feet.

- This sale will include -
$1200 - Spectre HC in 9mm, with one 30rnd mag, two 50rnd mags, a Pelican 1450 case, a speed loader, and a single point bungee sling. The 50rnd clips will come in their original boxes, and I can also provide the original box for the Spectre. I will also include approximately 50 loose hollow point rounds.

The M6A2â¢ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2â¢ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2â¢ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 âreal estateâ to mount your accessories.

The M6A2â¢ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2â¢ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2â¢ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 âreal estateâ to mount your accessories.

Since its introduction in 2003, Barnesâ Triple-Shock X-Bullet has earned a reputation as âthe perfect hunting bullet.â Now, Barnes has improved on perfection by adding a streamlined polymer tip.The new Tipped TSX features the same 100-percent copper body with multiple rings cut into the shank. It delivers the same gnatâs eyelash accuracy and âdead right thereâ performanceâbut with an added polymer tip that boosts BC and improves long-range ballistics. The tip and a re-engineered nose cavity provide even faster expansion.Complete penetration, virtually 100 percent weight retention and four razor-sharp cutting petals that doubles bullet diameter means the new Tipped TSX creates more internal damage than any competing bullet. Instant expansion and perfect penetration ensures cleaner, quicker kills. This is not loaded ammunition."

LWRC
M6A2 SPR
16"" Black

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from their REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12â in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features their enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

Note THE EOTECH IS NOT INCLUDED but can be worked into the deal. I also have a carbine-length Magpul MOE handguard and some pmags available if interested.

The Sightmark Laser Bore Sight provides the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in rifles of all types. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the rifle is aiming; itâs easy to sight in any scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the weapon being sighted in order to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark laser bore sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any gun. Itâs easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark laser bore sight is available in several calibers and gages for use with all the most popular rifles and shotguns.

Spring-Loaded, Dual Range Flip-Up Sight For Use With Or Without Optics

Rugged aluminum and steel flip-up rear sight regulates properly with A2-height front sights and can be co-witnessed through an optic. Dual apertures are calibrated for close- and mid-range targets, simply aim through both or fold the first one down and use the second aperture. Easily mounts to a Picatinny receiver rail; Locknut is retained by a safety wire, so you canât lose it. Non-snagging lever instantly releases the spring-loaded sight into the ready position. #40 Std. A2 is 1"" high from top of flattop when folded and has A2 apertures calibrated for 250-300 and 500-600 meters. Windage is click adjustable in increments of Â¾ MOA.

Brownells has them for $124 w/shipping.  I will take $75!!!  New, never used!! I bought two of these and went with an Eotech on one of my AR's so never used this set. I like these a lot, they stay put after thousands of rounds, stays tight and holds sight. Has dual Aperatures for close up and long distance, that is what makes em cool! And has what I called speed sight in notches on the top for fast acquisition of longer shots!!

The sale includes the rifle and sling as shown. For full price, I will throw in 22 rounds of the ammo shown. Two additional boxes of ammo can be purchased for $35 a box(this is a fair, pre-SH price on the ammo).

The new .223/5.56 DB15 pistol based off of Diamondbackâs A3 Flattop forged 7075 T6 Aluminum upper and lower receiver utilizing their reliable gas operated system.  The full-length, top-mounting rail (from the rear receiver to the end of the handguard) permits placement of multiple optics, lights, lasers and other accessories for total customization of the firearm.  The DB15 features a Magpul MOE+â¢ pistol grip built from a reinforced polymer body that incorporates a comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for extreme weapon control in unfavorable weather conditions.  The single stage trigger provides optimum trigger control for precision shooting.  The DB15 Pistol is available with a 7.5â or a 10.5â 4140 chrome-moly melonite coated barrel with a 1:9 rate of twist.  The Lightweight ventilated aluminum handguard dissipates heat quickly.  An abbreviated 5â buffer tube creates a more compact pistol and the Diamondback proprietary flash hider reduces muzzle signature.  The DB15 Pistol is offered in Black, Flat Dark Earth or OD Green with a durable Cerakote Finish.

The new .223/5.56 DB15 pistol based off of Diamondbackâs A3 Flattop forged 7075 T6 Aluminum upper and lower receiver utilizing their reliable gas operated system. The full-length, top-mounting rail (from the rear receiver to the end of the handguard) permits placement of multiple optics, lights, lasers and other accessories for total customization of the firearm. The DB15 features a Magpul MOE+â¢ pistol grip built from a reinforced polymer body that incorporates a comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for extreme weapon control in unfavorable weather conditions. The single stage trigger provides optimum trigger control for precision shooting. The DB15 Pistol is available with a 7.5â or a 10.5â 4140 chrome-moly melonite coated barrel with a 1:9 rate of twist. The Lightweight ventilated aluminum handguard dissipates heat quickly. An abbreviated 5â buffer tube creates a more compact pistol and the Diamondback proprietary flash hider reduces muzzle signature. The DB15 Pistol is offered in Black, Flat Dark Earth or OD Green with a durable Cerakote Finish.
