This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.

Ive owned an extremely high number of pistols and have yet to see a better trigger on anything other than a custom series 1 kimber. Very slim; posted below is a photo next to a zippo lighter for a size comparison. It has been praises by many experts for having a grip that fits the hand well without sacrificing concealability. I dont even want to sell it but i just received word of a deployment on short notice and need the money to move my daughter and wife back home before i go.

Sweet little bolt gun, and I'm really liking the way it shoots. The rifle I received has the REAPER camouflage stock, and while it does look neat, I have no use for it. I only target shoot, and was hoping that maybe someone here could make better use of it.

So the deal is trade your plain-jane synthetic ATR 100 stock for my reaper camo'd one. No cash exchange or anything. Just hoping someone could make better use of it. Also, would be willing to trade on a wood stock, although they are a little trickier to swap out.

Pics are of my rifle, and here is a link to the actual camo pattern: http://proveilcamo.com/ReaperBuck.html

I don’t know much about this parts kit, so what you see on the picture is what you get. All that is needed is a receiver and rivets, stock, hand guards and special tools or gunsmith.

I prefer a smaller profile sight as I feel like the bigger ones block out the target but some like that as if its blocked out its on target. Excellent carry gun and fun to shoot. Pull the slide and chamber a round and you are in SA press button on top and it returns to heavy anti stress DA trigger. You can bring it back to SA by slightly pulling the slide back like you would to check if you had anything chambered. Reliable gun designed by Walther and made by Walther except the Barrel made by smith. Same as The P99 by Walther. Gun is in excellent condition without holster wear and shot under 100 rounds if that. I tried all different types of ammo and critical defense hollow points and it loves them all. Awesome gun but I have too many guns of this size range and have a full size SW99 and a P99 so this one is what has to go before I buy my next tool. Bill of sale or bill of trade a must with oregon ID for my records only. Prefer concealed but DL ok as I will show my Concealed so you have your copy of where you got it as well.

Would consider trades for pocket guns in .380 or 9. 3 inch or smaller .357s. I would love a Beretta 84 style .380, CZ 83, Kahr p9, or something in sub compact I have not thought of here. 425 obo"

I only target shoot, and was hoping that maybe someone here could make better use of it.

So the deal is trade your plain-jane synthetic ATR 100 stock for my reaper camo'd one. No cash exchange or anything. Just hoping someone could make better use of it. Also, would be willing to trade on a wood stock, although they are a little trickier to swap out.

This is a sks that has been converted to a bullpup design. The SKS was original with matching numbers when I converted it and I still have the original wood stock that comes with it. The price is without the optics and forward grip, but If you want those we can discuss that. Comes with close to 300 rounds or so of steel ammo, two 20 round Tapco magazines, one steel 30 round magazine, and two extra mountable picatinny segments. I fitted this stock and fired it on several occasions to verify function. The gun shoots great and the bullpup design makes the overall length shorter than my AR with the stock collapsed. Just as accurate as any sks out there. You can take another 4"" off the barrel and still be legal as well if you wanted it even shorter. A fun gun for sure, but I built it more for the joy of building it and am now passing it to a home.

Rifle and scope are in like new, pristine condition. Barrel length is 24 inches.I’ve kept this rifle over the years as I have never had a factory rifle shoot three shots into one hole at 100 yards like this one does with commercial Federal Premium ammunition. Seeing is believing! Look at the target that I shot at 100 yards from a benchrest. Would not be selling if not for a job loss of almost 9 months. Whoever thinks the economy is picking up, better look at who is hiring…Burger King and McDonalds! Not exactly a career choice for experienced business professionals. Anyway, here is your chance to own a true one hole shooter at a fraction of a custom benchrest rifle cost. Those guys have been building and loading ammo at a tremendous cost to get their rifles to shoot like this Weatherby. The bipod and dog are not included in the auction! Please ask questions or request additional information prior to Buying. Rifle will ship intact in a hard plastic case. Must ship to a valid FFL. No sales outside the US. Shipment to a CA FFL will incur an additional fee of $50

I removed it from the packaging only to take these photos.

The advanced SureFire SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake, which fits M4 / M16 weapons and variants with 1/2-28 muzzle threads, greatly reduces both recoil impulse and muzzle rise so that the weapon tracks straight back to keep you on target for faster shot-to-shot recovery. Its patented Impulse Diffusion design minimizes side blast and rear-directed concussion effects. The SFMB-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command.

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning even after extreme use.

When used in conjunction with a SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SFMB-556-1/2-28 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing.

All SureFire SOCOM Series muzzle brakes have blind pilot holes at the 3 and 9 o’clock position to enable fine-tuning of recoil characteristics for individual shooting styles or ammunition characteristics. They also have blind pilot holes at the 6 o’clock position to enable indexing the adapter at bottom dead center, and to pin-and-weld on short-barreled rifles. All that is required is a basic hand drill and appropriate drill bits.

SureFire muzzle brakes are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment, and each is covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee.

FITS: M4, M16 and variants wih 1/2-28 muzzle threads

MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56mm/.223 caliber sound suppressors

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors and current-model muzzle brake/suppressor adapters and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.

Features

Is adjustable for length of pull and comb (cheek weld) this is an affordable option for an AR style stock without having to pay $80+ for an adapter and tube before you even buy a stock of your choosing.  I am willing to sell this stock for exactly what I paid for it. My computer messed up and reloaded my order page and ordered 2 of these stocks.  One I will keep to put on my Saiga 308. And the other one i just want what inlaid for it.  The stocks get here tomorrow so I can't take an actual product picture right now.  And when I receive it I will not take it out of the packaging.  I want whoever buys this item to receive a brand new in box and original factory plastic  stock with no possibility of it having been tampered with. I may take a picture of the stock I will be keeping just to show what it looks like on a gun.  By the way with the cheek riser unfolded it makes it look strikingly similar to the FN SCAR or remington ACR stock. Very attractive stock!  I just don't need 2.
For now I will put a few pictures up from the archangel website.
I paid $70 shipped. I won't ask for a penny more. I don't want to profit I'm just hoping to break even. So the price is $70.  I don't really want to haggle but feel free to make an offer. Worst I can say is ""no."" 
This is a deal for those that can't find them or don't want to wait for shipping I ordered these stocks from archangel manufacturing. If you go to their website you'll notice there is a 4-6 week wait on all orders for items in stock.  And I got the very last 2 they had. So they have to manufacture a new batch of stocks, package and log them, then fill orders in the order they were received. Which I'm sure is more time on top of that. So if you want this stock you can wait 3-5 months or pay the same price and pick it up same day. 
Like I said I'm not trying to profit. Just made a computer error and wanna fix it."

The Nano's extremely low profile, snag-free design makes it easy to carry
and draw from concealment. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis
the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is
simple to disassemble and maintain. The light, durable frame employs

techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex
wrench. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine
release button can be easily reversed. Modular structure, ergonomics and
ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

.38 cal., 5 shot, double action, folding hammer spur.

Merwin Hulbert offered very high quality revolvers which were serious competitors with the Colt, Smith & Wesson, and Remington large frame single actions during this era. Their guns are believed to have been manufactured in a separate section of the Hopkins & Allen plant. Most will have both Merwin Hulbert and Hopkins & Allen markings on the barrel.
Merwin revolvers have a unique twist-open mechanism. The latch on the bottom of the frame is pushed toward the rear, while barrel & cylinder are twisted clockwise and pulled forward. This design was intended to allow selective ejection of empty cases while leaving unfired cartridges in the cylinder.

The Colt is a 1960-1961 production based on the serial number and ends with the letter F falling in the Q model revolvers.  Source is from www.proofhouse.com.  I would rate overall bluing 85-90% due to some holster wear near the muzzle. 

The Heritage Rough Rider is shown with a shell collected from the factory dated 1/26/2007. This revolver comes with the 22 magnum cylinder and the nicer factory wood grips. Heritage Manufacturing is now owned by Taurus as of May 2012. Source is from www.taurususa.com.  Based on this info makes for sale an original Heritage Rough Rider.

I am offering the Colt for sale asking $425.00. I am offering the Rough Rider for sale asking $150.00. As a package deal only I will accept $525.00 and will include 100 rounds of 22LR.  I will not lower the price for the Rough Rider if bought separate. Some wiggle room on the Colt.  I believe this is a reasonable priced package deal, and this will immediately serve a fun day for a family outing.  And if you are buying the complete package I have extra 22LR up to 500 rounds for additional $25.00 cost.  So whoever buys this package will be guaranteed to spend a couple daya at the range enjoying shooting or teaching youngsters without trying to find 22LR. 

Sorry I will not sell the 22LR ammo separate.  It is intended to be enjoyed by the purchaser of the revolvers.

Last thing I would like to offer is a nice well worn leather holster, asking price $75.00.

This is the non-railed tactical, I see a railed version sometimes.  Has upgraded grips, Novak-style sights, ambi safeties, Lightened trigger, Commander hammer, and  palm-swell beavertail vs. the standard RIA model.  It is about 18 months old and has had less than 100 light target LSWC rounds fired, all functioned fine.  It has all docs/box that came with it originally, manual, box, papers, hang tag, etc.

I cannot find the original magazine it came with, so I have included instead of the original single magazine, two 7rd blue blued steel magazines. they are marked ""Colt .45 Auto"" however I do not think they are Colt OEM.  I have had them 20 years and rarely used them, they work fine and feed, lock back and drop free cleanly.  I know they are not the cheaper new Chinese copies that flood the web and guns shows since I recall when I bought them in Florida in late 1993.

It has some light handling marks in the Parkerizing on close inspection, very minor wear marks on high points on front sight and muzzle typical of Parkerizing, take down mark, etc. That's about it. No, one more thing. I thought the wood grips had lovely grain and good shape, but not finished very well. I have rubbed some slow-dried tung oil coats into them and they look better and will last much longer now. Ok, that's it.

Arsenal, Inc. remanufactures the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles. Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Arsenal, Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer.

Best Ak you can buy..

G-2 Trigger desc: Are you still using the original trigger assembly that came with your AK?  You probably think that it’s worked pretty well so far, so why upgrade it?  Well, if you’re not using a INTRAFUSE® AK G2™ Trigger Group, you’re limiting the potential of your rifle.  Our trigger group offers an improved trigger pull of 3-4 pounds and eliminates the painful trigger slap common with other designs.  We’ve created a “no fumble” trigger sleeve which allows you to assemble the trigger group outside of your rifle and then drop it in as one piece.  All of our G2 components are heat treated, manufactured out of 4140 tool-grade carbon steel, and finished in dark black oxide.  Upgrading your trigger assembly to the INTRAFUSE® AK G2™ Trigger Group, simply put, is the best decision you can make to bring out all the power your AK-47 has to offer.  To top it off, the G2™ counts as 3 U.S. 922r compliant parts.


Great rifle, When you install a mag it has no slop or play.. Very light and very accurate
with a nice trigger and good length of pull.
Not many of these out there.
Awesome dependable battle rifle.

Cash only, Prefer Face to Face. Will ship on your dime to your FFL.

No trades, Just cash,
