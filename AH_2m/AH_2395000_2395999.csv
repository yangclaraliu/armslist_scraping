For sale is an excellent Springfield XDs in 9mm, complete with extras.  I carried this for a short time, fired approximately 300 rounds, but I felt like I was talked into purchasing it over what I really wanted, and after giving it some time, I'm going back for what I wanted in the first place.   It was purchased new in the summer and repaired with the XDS recall in early November.  

Factory box includes spent case and all factory paperwork including post-recall repair card.  Replaced red fiber-optic front sight insert with green, but replacement red and green inserts are included.  Includes 2x 7-round magazines and 1x 9-round magazine with 2x grip extensions. (for each size grip back-strap, both also included)  Includes factory paddle holster and dual magazine holster.  (paddle holster was used for carry)  Includes cable lock and key, barrel brush, and chamber flag.  

In addition I'm including an excellent IWB leather/kydex hybrid ""Lil' Foxx"" holster by FoxX Holsters, with replaceable standard and ""J"" belt hook.

Cash FTF transfer only, within 60 min drive from Southport area of Indianapolis.  Would consider trades ONLY for Walther PPS (9mm), Walther PPK/s, or Sig Sauer P238 in similar condition or better.

The American Historical Foundation brings this opportunity to only 1,000 shooters, collectors and museums in the world. And to further proclaim the importance of this pistol, the Rattlesnake grips bear a distinctive Colt cloisonné medallion, featuring the famous Blue Onion Dome symbol of the old Colt factory. The base metal of this special Pistol is Stainless Steel, so its beauty will last forever. To give the Stainless Steel slide that “wet look” shine, the steel is brought to a glistening mirror finish, by experienced gun polishers.

FIRST (AND ONLY) COLT RATTLESNAKE™ This limited edition is also the first Colt Rattlesnake – and only the pistols in this edition are named that. This follows in the Colt “snake” tradition of the “Python®”, “Anaconda®” and “King Cobra®”. The slide is handsomely decorated on both sides with a Rattlesnake – ready to attack, its fangs extended, tongue twitching and rattle shaking! A special multi-finish technique is used to achieve this eerie life-like appearance. This includes deep etching and contrasting dull and shiny, two-tone 24-Karat Gold plating. Intertwined etched banners proclaim the pistol “Legacy Edition” and its status as “One of 1,000”"

Unlike most ARs the stock can be folded and fired in the folded position.

If you are not familiar with the SU-16, it is a lightweight rifle that uses AR magazines and is piston operated much like an AK-type rifle. They are fairly basic rifles from the factory that beg for lots of user improvement. This rifle is one of the most improved that you will find while still being easily converted back to a basic SU-16 rifle if needed.

This rifle has seen light range use, about 200 rounds total fired. Cleaned well after each use.

Here's what is included:

SU-16CA rifle
E pistol grip stock kit
Kel-Tec Compact Forend
Yankee Hill Vortex compensator / muzzle device
ATI M4 collapsible stock
Red Lion aluminum trigger
Kel-Tec Sling and sling mount
Folding stock adapter
Magpul AFG2 forend grip
Meprolight M21 with hard-to-find 12MOA triangle reticle (purchased in 2011, 9 years of tritium life left if you use the 11 year half-life as a rule)
 Original CA stock (w/ beveled hitch pin connected to the trigger guard with some 550 cord), 2 factory 10rnd mags, original forend, original muzzle protector, original trigger

I would like to sell the rifle with the M21 optic as it's zeroed for it and works very well. These are made in Israel and typically sell new for around $500. They use no batteries; the tritium element plus the light-gathering fiber optic provide all the power for the holographic reticle.

The vest, ammunition, magazines, and magazine loader shown in the photos are NOT included. If it is not listed above it is not included.

This rifle is currently set up for a left-handed shooter (reversed safety, sling on right side). If the buyer would like me to switch it to right-handed shooter please let me know"

This 14.7” rifles feature permanently-attached muzzle brake, making the true barrel length 16.1” 

The new M6-SL is a replacement of our base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date. 



The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots. 



The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight. 



The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a LWRCI Folding BUIS Rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post. 



The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does at an entry level price.
