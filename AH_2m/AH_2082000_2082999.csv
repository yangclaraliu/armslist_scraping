If you didn't already know, then these stocks very closely simulate automatic fire using the free slide of the buffer tube through the stock, the recoil of the gun, and a forward pressure provided by the shooter to achieve this, really fun. Bought it around November of last year, shot around 200 rounds with it, then couldn't find any more cheap ammo after December.  They currently sell for around $380 new, looking to get $250 for mine. May be interested in trades, let me know what ya got! Thanks"

 this Kimber Pro raptor II has been cerpa II coated ( its a non-stick finish like nickel boron except its got a gold tint to it) and all the controls ceracoated in black. zebra wood grips really make the colors POP. has Tru-Glo fiber optic night sights and polished barrel and ramp. shoots like a dream. best shooting .45 I have EVER shot, ( and I have shot A LOT of .45's over the years). has factory Mag, and a Wilson combat Mag. I really hate to sell it but I am REALLY wanting an M1 Garand. and not just any ole garand. I want one that's in great condition, prefer WWII vintage but doesn't have to be. I have been looking for one for several years and I can be picky about the details of it, so please don't try to convince me that yours is fantastic, I will see for myself. I know what I'm looking for. if you want to buy the raptor price is $1500 firm because of the condition, and extras put into it. if you want to trade, we can discuss it over the trade.
 you can text me at 615-886-8704 for fastest response. I don't check emails as often as I should. please text me some pics of what you got too..thanks"

The Bounty Hunter single action revolver has been sold in the USA for over 20 years. Made in Germany and available in 22LR / 22WMR, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and 45 LC, it is simply one of the best single action revolvers produced. You can purchase a more expensive, or a famous brand, but you won’t be getting a better single action firearm. The Bounty Hunter is a traditional 6 shot single action revolver with traditional resting notch, but it also has a transfer bar and recessed chambers for shooting safety. There are a lot of single action revolvers out there but none better than The Bounty Hunter from EAA Corp.

It was cleaned after every trip to the range and put back in the safe, this was my ""Sunday"" or dress clothes gun not used very much. Not much else to say if you have any questions just let me know.

One of the pics looks like there is a mark on the pistol but it was just dust.

I would like a local meet in forest city area but I do get to Shelby a few times a week and Asheville about twice a month."

It is a true closet queen....made several years ago, but I don't believe it has ever been fired.  I say this because you can see some of the factory cammo treatment in the barrel at the muzzle.  It seems that this would be blown away at the first shot.  NEF tells me that the metal is blued and then the cammo treatment is applied.

I have added new Choate stocks that have sling studs and that carry a lifetime warranty.  A Survivor buttstock and a conventional forend that fits well with the 22 inch barrel.  The length of pull is about 13 inches making it comfortable for an adult or junior shooter."

Description from SIG:
The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of .40 S&W, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols."

IMPORTANT... PLEASE READ:

I will try my best to update the listing as soon as parts sell in order to avoid confusion. There is a premium on splitting the lower receiver from the upper receiver, but there is a discount for buying the entire gun, or only buying the upper receiver. **If** the upper and lower halves get split up first (before the complete rifle sells), I will keep the sling (buy the complete rifle and get the sling). If you don't want the Geissele fire control group, you can easily install a standard/mil-spec trigger kit for about $35 from most major retailers (and it saves you a large chunk of change here, AND I can re-use the trigger, so we all win!)


In the picture you will notice an aftermarket SEI/Gemtech bi-lock mount / flash hider for a suppressor. This is not included with the upper, and it will be returned to the factory/A2-style birdcage flash hider. The aftermarket flash hider serves no purpose to you, unless you already have a Gemtech G5 suppressor and you want to burn an extra $100 on top of the prices listed above. Unless you state otherwise, I will switch the flash hider to the A2 format and keep my SEI/Gemtech flash hider for another rifle (as they are hard to find and expensive to replace)

If you buy the complete rifle (#1 or #2) or lower receiver (#4 or #5), I require payment IN FULL in either cash or postal money order the day that we meet at Maryland State Police barracks to do the transfer.

If you buy the upper receiver (option #3), I can ship to you for the actual cost of shipping, or we can meet in person to do the exchange at a place of your choosing. Again, cash or money order in the full amount.

If you buy the complete rifle, I can release the *upper* receiver group to you the day of the transfer, and when we meet again after the seven-day waiting period, I will give you the lower receiver and a hard-sided rifle carrying case. The “assault weapon ban” a.k.a. The Maryland Gun Safety Act of 2013 SB281/HB294 takes effect **ON** October 1st. If you do not sign MSP paperwork on or before Sunday, September 22, you can not take delivery of the lower receiver. Since our illustrious legislature has neglected to publish COMAR in a timely fashion, it is unclear if individual sellers, such as me, are allowed to transfer banned weapons after the ban date, even if the gun was purchased beforehand. To avoid legal issues, you must buy on/before the 22nd. SERIOUS INQUIRIES ONLY.

Lower receiver / complete rifle reserved for Maryland residents ONLY.
Upper receiver up for grabs

The Sig has been completely gone over by a Sig Armorer and all springs have been replaced with NEW factory Sig springs. The pistol comes in it's import box complete with two original factory SIG mags and two NEW factory SIG mags that are still in their wrap bags. Included with the P6 are a NEW set of factory SIG grip panels still in their bags with NEW grip screws. I wasn't planning to install them until I completed the refinishing project. Also included are extra roll pins and a new extractor that I purchased. There is nothing wrong with the extractor in it, but since it's an out of production pistol, I always buy replacement parts since they may be difficult to locate some day. As you can see in the pic, there are other spare parts that go with it. The pistol is ready for a refinishing or just as it is. The finish on it shows the usual holster wear that you expect from a service pistol that was carried a lot but shot very little."

This will be a very valuable gun for collectors since it's so hard to find and this was one of the last DEP made in Israel because they moved their production to the US. It will only appreciate in value.

I have taken great care of this gun. Always cleaned it thoroughly after range sessions. Never dropped or scratched it in any way. Never holstered it so there's no chance of holster wear at all (titanium gold finish is very wear-resistant anyways). This DEP is pretty much still in mint condition. It can pass as a brand new gun.

This wagon has a lot of miles on it (approx 200k, odo not accurate) and needs a little TLC. It would make a good in-town car or parts vehicle as is, or a great winter car for somebody not afraid to do a little fix-it work. I'm doing too much highway driving and I'm too short on time for it to make sense for me to keep it. Price is listed as $1000 but I don't really want to sell it, I'd rather trade you for a snow-blower, canoe, ammo, or some reasonable combination of things you don't want and I can use. It's a good ole car and cash doesn't need to be the reason the right person can't have it, but the deal has to make sense to me. Reply with what you've got to trade and let's see what happens.

The good:
-free of body/frame rot, only minor rust
-headgasket done Jan of '12
-transmission rebuilt and clutch done Aug of '12
-radiator replaced and new tires June of '13

The bad:
-thermostat needs replacing
-one tail light, one brake light, and one low-beam headlamp need replacing (this is the only set of repairs needed to pass inspection, current sticker good through Dec '13)
-back hatch latch is jammed
-I'm a pipe smoker, so if tobacco smoke is the worst thing you can imagine then keep moving
-fuses for seat heaters and lighter/power jack need replacing
-e-brake needs replacing (other brakes fine)
-the silly Subaru cup holder system is broken, you'll have to find another place to hold your Dunks
-the odometer/speedo sometimes loses connection so you either need to fix it or be ok with zen speed determination (I've been doing this for 3 years and haven't gotten a ticket, but I'm awesome)"
