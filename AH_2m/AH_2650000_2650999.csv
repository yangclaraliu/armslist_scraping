The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability. While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out! ""Have neer seen one like this"" the weapon bears No refurbishment marks or other countrys arsenal markings! The metal has not a mark on it is stone mint! The magazine follower, action etc have no wear! Mint bore. All matching. No refurbishment marks from other countrys !!
This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine. This rifle saw little to no action its entire life, maybe an officers or political gaurds weapon

The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was apreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle."

semi auto LRB ARMS M15SA lower receiver This mil-spec receiver is made from aircraft grade 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, same as currently used by the US military.  

Rifle Specifications:

    16mm deep ""low shelf"" mil spec receiver.
    16 inch M4 contour barrel.
    Forged A4 upper receiver.
    5.56mm caliber chamber will also shoot 223 rem.
    Threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi.
    A2 flash hider             (or pictured muzzle break)
    Forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug.
    M4 length handguards with full heat shields       (or pictured quad rail)
  The barrel is machined from chrome-moly high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32.
    The barrel and all external steel parts are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel.
    This barrel is of Mil-spec M4 contour (.750 under the front sight base) complete with the M203 groove in the front. This contour is the perfect balance between light weight, heat dissipation, and accuracy.
    The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.
    The barrel is mounted on a FORGED A4 upper receiver with built in Mil-spec M1913 Picatinny accessory rail. The correct rail numbers are engraved. It is made from certified forgings right here in the USA, hardcoat anodized IAW Mil Spec A8625, Type III, Class II, black per No. 37038, Table IX with a Mil-Spec nickel acetate seal.
    The upper features a forward assist, hinged ejection port cover, and built in brass deflector.
    Semi-auto BCG (Bolt Carrier Group) 
    The buttstock is the heavier wall, stronger M4 buttstock, not the cheaper carbine buttstock. This buttstock features 6 positions for maximum shooter comfort, reinforced honeycomb design for heavy duty use, and the correct M4 lock nut peened into place.
    All lower parts are semi-auto including the fire control group.
    Includes (1) one thirty round magazine with the priceless “anti-tilt” follower.

Not sure how much I'm willing to spend I just know AMT BACKUPS aren't worth much these days but are also collectors. They aren't PPK worthy, pricewise. Offer a price and I'll let you know if it's something I can afford. The caliber 9mm/40 I prefer over the 380 but if the 380 is only available then I'd take that.

In the first photo, on the left, you see an lovely pair in tasteful brown plastic. WWII sty-lee. These came from one of those Norinco 1911's from way back when that were made out of 5140 and chewed up all those milling cutters of gunsmits trying to open up the sight dovetails so that when you mentioned that you had one and how good it was for the money compared to that dismal colt 1991 a1 they would get one of those old fashioned looks on their faces and say ""Oh... one o them Chy-Nee guns, huh? We don't touch em.""  $5 beautiful dollars.

Next to that is a toothsome pair in walnut with checkering and flowery scroolly flourishes fit for the finest fourth of july, fourtyfive slugfest or Cinco de mayo singalong.
$6 dinars.

The second picture has a pair of black rubber Pachmayr slabs with steely liners for sweaty hands and cheap bulk reloads. $10

The last pair are the checkered walnut well worn ones and I hesitate to even offer them up but what else am I gonna do, smoke them? Now bear with me. Many years ago I bought a very early Colt 1911 in 38 super from an old fellow at the hospital I worked at while in college. It was an all original un monkeyed with 02xx serial number in about 85% condition and worth many times what I payed for it. I was poor, I was hungry, I loved a motorcycle, and I couldnt resist that stack of 100 dollar bills. I sold it to a philistine who brought a new pair of fancy figured wood grips with him when he bought it. He changed them right there at the kitchen table of my apartment and left the old ones behind. He said they werent befitting an ""Investment Grade"" firearm and he was out the door. So, here they are still. $20 I dont know how to prove their pedigree or if anyone even cares. I'm ambivalent. I dont believe in collector guns, or garage queens, or trophy wives. If you have an old Gov model that needs period grips I'd probably just give em to you.

Oh yeah, that odd grip at the bottom of the first photo is some indian hardwood left when I broke the other one off due to a stuck screw and stripped escution. It's a right panel. free.

And the way the pachmayrs look way small is some artifact of the light, angle and majic. It's really normal size."

I'm into this rifle a little over $2300 to build, it has had 3 mags shot thru it (60 rds). This is based on the Sr-25, DPMS compatible magazines will work in this. I will include one 20rd pmag with the rifle, more are available if wanted at additional cost. The barrel was properly broken in, I zeroed the rifle and then walked it out to 900 meters hitting a 8"" circle steel target in 100 M increments. That is the furthest I have shot this thing, I'm so pleased with it that I built my last monolithic upper using the exact same barrel and combo. Cash is king, but am willing to take partial trade in interesting offerings. I'm only selling to fund a dominator carb for one of my other toys.

The following features are listed on the the Advantage Arms website:                 

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

 1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
 The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
 The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
 Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

 4.  FINISH
 All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

 5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
 Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot."

According to the original owner he believed it was bought in 1971 by his Dad who bought it as a home protection piece and stated his Dad shot it very little as they were not into hunting and or shooting and said that he had only shot it a few times with his Dad growing up. I have shot it and it is amazingly accurate and cycles like its new the bore is very clean and shiny. there is a slight and I mean slight wear mark at the tip of the barrel where is was stored in a leather holster (which comes with it) and the cylinder has some of the same type wear on the very edges. Would make a nice keeper or an excellent shooter. A few of these have sold in gun stores with the shorter barrel for $350-$400 and another on this sight that was in about 75% condition sold for $275

This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.
ArmaLite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50.  The same great accuracy, but now even more Beautiful.

However I also have a fully built (every single hop up part available purchased) all carbon fiber and alloy team losi mini 8ight. will include everythingggg all extra parts with the r/c car and receipts. Not all parts are on car yet, some still in package so you will have to assemble 30% of the vehicle. Its really easy. I've invested well over $1000 with receipts to prove it, won 1st place at Jakes R/C in Topeka also. so basically I'm offering $1200 for a Glock 26 Gen 4. please call me at REDACTED if you're interested. thanks!"

LaserAim model 45 in 45ACP. 
This is a nice, barely used pistol. You may remember these from the late 80s - early 90s. It is not a 1911, even though it looks like one. The only part that it shares from a 1911 is the magazine. They are known for shooting the ejectors in to orbit when you disassemble them, but this one still has the ejector, it's in perfect working order.
It comes with the laser, it bolts on the front of the trigger guard, but I have not been able to get it to work, you may have better luck. It charges off of a 9volt battery. So it may need the rechargeable battery in the laser replaced. (looking at the web, it looks like you can get a replacement battery for the laser)

These are kind of cool and pretty rare."

These unique AR15 clones have a proprietary switch barrel system that requires no tools. under the monolithic rail is a slide lock. release the lock slide it forward to expose 2 cam levers. Swing the cam levers out to 90 degrees and pull the barrel and gas tube free of the receiver. Change the bolt or simply have a new carrier/bolt set up ready, install and done. Can be achieved in seconds. 
The truly unique part of the MGI Hydra is the lower receiver. The problem with multi cal AR15s always revolves around the magazine well. 7.62x39 ar15 magazines are renowned for their unreliability, Pistol calibers for their finicky magazine blocks, and limitations of calibers by the size of the mag well. MGI fixed that in this design. The magazine well slide into and locks on machined rails in the receiver. Yes...the magazine well is removable. The magazine wells take the ammunition's native magazine. The 7.62x39 takes AK mags, 9mm takes glock mags with no block needed. Everything from .22lr to .50 beouwulf is already available. Conversion Kits can be ordered directly from MGI and come with magazine well barrel and bolt specific to the caliber and the mag well specific to magazine used. They are also the only ones offering a .308/762x51 conversion in an AR15 (not AR10 frame) by using their mag well and magazine.....why have to carry several rifles or have to keep several on hand. One AR can do it all. Saves space and carry loads.
