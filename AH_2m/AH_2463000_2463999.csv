It actually shoots very well, and the only reason I'm selling is that I'm left handed and shooting a bolt gun is awkward for me.

From the manufacturer:

 Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length 
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved 
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours 
The XPS3 is Night Vision compatible, for non-Night Vision compatible units see the XPS2 sights.

Brand new wooden goat milking stands. Stands are offered in two different sizes. Full size stand is perfect for adult large breed goats. The smaller stand is a great platform for training young goats to become stand ready. The small stand is also ideal for smaller goats breeds, such as the pygmy and dwarf breeds. Both stands come with a feeding tray for holding treats and grains. Stands have pressure treated 4 by 4 legs and re-enforced decks. Constructed with screws only for long-lasting strength. Head catch fits either horned or de-horned goats. Great for milking, grooming, vaccinations, hooves trimming, and very useful at goat shows. The large stand sells for $100. The small stand sells for $75. I live only three miles off I-40 in Monterey."

654,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2463654,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD FREE 45-70 MAG. +P 300 gr. TSX-FN (2350 fps) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 60,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 18, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=306

This is a super powerful 45-70+P loading. It is externally identical to SAAMI spec. 45-70 ammo, but internally it generates FAR more power and pressure. So, our 45-70 ammo will fit/chamber into any 45-70 firearm. HOWEVER, its use should be limited to firearms that are built to take the +P pressures it generates.

Its use should be limited to the following firearms: All Marlin 1895 (1895 Marlins are simply 336 actions, with a 45-70 barrel screwed on to them) iterations made since 1972, all Browning 1885 and 1886 copies, Rossi Rio Grande, New England Arms Handi Rifle, T/C Encore, ALL falling block actions made of modern steel such as the Ruger #1 and #3, Shiloh, Christian and Pedersoli Sharps, all Winchester 1886 iterations made since 1915 and all Siamese Mauser bolt actions.

This all copper expanding 300gr. TSX long-for-weight bullet will penetrate about as deep as they typical 350+gr. lead core expanding bullet, yet it gives the benefits of a lighter bullet, which means it recoils less and gives flatter trajectories.

We were not able to develop velocities as fast as we’d like because the long-for-weight all copper bullet crowds the limited powder capacity of the 45-70 casing. Still, 2200+ fps is screaming and is powerful and for those that understand the benefits of the all copper Barnes TSX bullet, it is a worthwhile trade off. As an added benefit to many shooters, this reduced velocity also means significant recoil reduction.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating advertised velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

2215 fps -- Marlin 1895, 22 inch barrel
2201 fps -- Marlin 1895, 18 inch barrel
Many shooters do not understand why the 45-70 needs very little barrel length to obtain maximum velocities. As evidenced by the above velocities, ANY straight walled (not a bottle neck case such as the 06 or any number of casings that have a shoulder) case that uses relatively fast burning rifle powders, will generate all the velocity possible in barrels much shorter than bottleneck chamberings."

I picked up the 5"" Competition M&P and never had use for this gun.

Price is firm.  Not interested in any trades.  Must have WA CPL.  Still recovering from surgery, so I can't drive far; you'll have to come to me.

The gun is still available, if this posting is still up.  Thanks for looking."

Originally this started life two years ago as a Chiappa M4 .22 Upper and came with two 28 round mags ($300), but due to the poor quality of the composite upper I replaced it with an aluminum flattop upper receiver (""Split A"" for Anchor Harvey $120) in order to achieve the accuracy I wanted.

Barska Electro Sight Multi Reticle Red Dot Sight ($55)

This upper is a tack driver and has less than 600 rounds through it. The bolt was also sent back to Chiappa and upgraded with the new gen back plate. It comes with everything listed above, it's zeroed and ready to go! I have $635 into it and know I cant get that back out, so I'm letting it go for $450 OBO. I'm in a pinch and need the cash!
I have more pictures upon request.

Don't mess up your .223/5.56 by using a cheap bolt conversion kit!

The conversion takes less than a minute and is achieved with no permanent alterations to your firearm. Your lower can be quickly returned to it’s original caliber in just seconds."

Title in hand, Tabs are up to date.
Engine doesn't have exact milage because the odometer is broken. I bought it from a friend who's uncle gifted it to him. My friend got it with 65k on it. The engine was rebuilt.  Still runs strong and is really reliable. I use it for my daily commuter. 

I just recently changed the windshield wiper motor, PCV Valve, Thermostat, o2 Sensor, flushed the radiator, and rotated the tires. Clutch was changed last year.  There is absolutely nothing mechanically wrong on this vehicle. Only damage is to front left part of the hood, left part of the fender, and light. Nothing major.  No leaks of any kind. Doesnt burn oil. Lights works, Signal works, has working aftermarket deck and speakers, and 5% window tint.

Includes two factory mags with factory fresh springs, a new set of factory grips, along with the green hogue grips pictured, and original factory trigger (I have installed an after-market short trigger as you can see in the pics).

1980 date of manufacture. Has the normal cosmetic wear for these P6 police surplus pistols, especially on the front strap. I have put approximately 500 rounds through it in the 4 years that I have owned it, and have only had one FTF due to using a certain type of hollow point ammo. These were not designed for hollow points, but this one will shoot them as long as you use a lighter grain bullet with a more tapered profile. The sights are the standard black on black, but I have painted a dot on the front sight blade. 

I prefer FTF in the Raleigh area with your CCW or pistol purchase permit, but will ship to your dealer on your dime. Let me know if you have any questions."
