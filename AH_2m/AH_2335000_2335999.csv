It is in perfect condition, never used or mounted. I bought it intending to build a custom AR-15,, but, picked-up an HK-G3 at a great price! Rather than going ahead with the AR-15 build, I’m selling the lower and putting the cash into “clips and add-on’s” for the G3...

I paid “$250 cash” and that’s what I will take for it.. I’m not interested in trading, nor am I desperate for the cash, so “Please” no ridiculous low-ball offers.. Please contact me via email using the “contact seller"" link on this page.

General area, person to person pick-up only.. As per state law,, must be a Tennessee resident, 18 or over."

Ive had a love affair with 1911s since the first time I shot one when I was young! If you've ever had the pleasure you know what I'm talking about. You also know how easy it is to accumulate a safe full of them! THINNING THE HEARD!  Great for concealed carry, target shooting or just looking pretty hanging in the safe! Not too many rounds through her, maybe only 500! I have thin profile grips on the frame and originals, original carry case and paperwork. Lets meet up somewhere and punch holes in some paper!  Dropped the price 50 bucks, maybe the will entice some more interest.  One blemish on frame just above trigger below slide stop…. See pictures."

The original owner indicated that he had fired one box of ammo before placing this in his nightstand. Judging by its pristine condition I have no reason to doubt the statement. Also, this is appears to be a “New” model Vaquero as it begins with S/N 510 – xxxxxxxx and was produced with the revised cylinder bore process as the Ruger “Billboard” safety warning is under the barrel as opposed to the side… more aesthetically appealing in my humble estimation.

Repriced to $485 cash for the stock pistol - All additional pieces can be negotiated!

The most dependable slide action of all time in three advanced designs that will go the distance with deadly precision, whether your target is the crease behind a buck’s shoulder or a big red head. We’ve built the industry’s finest rifled slug guns for years, but our new 12-gauge Model 870™ SPS™ ShurShot™ Synthetic Super Slug advances deer-leveling technology to farther reaches and smaller group sizes than ever before possible. Even more so when paired with high-performance ammunition like our Premier AccuTip sabot slugs. 

Because barrel stability is key to extended-range accuracy, this shotgun’s barrel is of extra-heavy, 1"" diameter configuration and measures a full 25 1/2"". It’s also pinned to the receiver to control vibration for rifle-like, shot-to-shot consistency. Five longitudinal flutes keep weight and heat buildup to a minimum while bolstering barrel rigidity. Six Parabolic Ultragon™ rifling grooves with a 1-in-35"" twist optimize slug flight. But much more than just the ultimate accuracy-enhancing barrel design, this shotgun provides the rock-steady aim and outstanding pointability of our ambidextrous ShurShot pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubberized overmolding at the pistol grip and extended fore-end offer a sure hold in adverse conditions. For unmatched shooting comfort, we added the SuperCell™ recoil pad. The receiver is drilled and tapped, and the included Weaver rail makes adding optics a cinch. Sling swivel studs are built in.

594,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2335594,For Sale:   2012 Harley Davidson Fatboy Harley Softail 103 1690cc! Mint!,"Lehigh, Pennsylvania, United States","$ 13,659","Listed On: Monday, July 14, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Thanks for taking the time to check out my flawless 2012 Harley Davidson 1690cc Fatboy. This thing looks like it has less than 1 thousand miles on it. Title is ready to transfer to the new owner!

KBB Blue Book Value is $16,305.00 and I have the factory chrome rims and other accessories added on top of that value. I will not ship this bike because of ""scammers"". It must be picked up in person by the actual buyer. Sorry, can't take any trades as i'm moving or otherwise wouldn't be selling my pride and joy. I have this priced below retail and you will be hard pressed to find a nicer 2012 Fatboy or any Fatboy with the 103 engine for less.

I have a garage kept every night one owner 2012 Harley Davidson Fatboy Softail with the 1690cc 103 engine and 6 speed transmission. I bought this new at Keystone HD in Pa. Go with a 103 for the highway power, for riding two up, and reliability. The 6 speed allows you to cruise at highway speeds without over working the motor. This bike comes with the awesome factory HD chrome rims and other chrome parts. The looks this bike gets is something else. It has the look, growl, and runs as awesome as it is to look at. Rode my last Softail over 105k miles and the newer bikes are an insanely better design. This bike is very loud but that's the only way I would want it. You will notice cars looking for you when you have louder pipes. 

-8,105 miles.

Should be under factory Harley Davidson warranty until May or June of 2014. Bike was never crashed, dropped, or abused.

As you can see from my upgrades I never planned to sell this bike but relocation for a job is forcing me to sell my baby. If you always wanted the Terminator 2 Harley Davidson... Here it is with a larger engine, better breaks, more chrome, and a 6 speed. This bike has the rare silver pin striping. Not the ugly blue that most black Fatboys have.

I took this on many weekend trips on sunny days. Unlike the ultra low mileage bikes that have sat and let the moisture build up. This bike does not go out in the rain, snow, or sleet. This bike is set up right with everything you need nothing you don't. 

This bike was over 21 thousand dollars out the door. When factoring the cost of upgrades and 1k mile service you're better off buying used. Bike has over three thousand invested in exhaust and tune, LED lights, etc.  All work was done by High Performance Custom Cycle Shop in Allentown, Pa.

-HD Barrel pin lock on fork and ignition to make it harder to steal.
-HD Factory Chrome floor boards.
-Rush Chrome Slash Cut 2.25 slip on's. HD factory chrome cross over pipe. The large slash cuts actually amplify the sound. $380 + professional install. 
-Bike was HD tuned to run without baffles. Bike has a very loud and deep growl very unique. $400
-Lindby Chrome Crash bar that has rubber mounts to put legs on for long trips. $290+ install.
-Factory HD Chrome rims, chrome engine, many other factory chrome parts.
-Kuryakyn waterproof power port cigarette lighter outlet outlet to charge phone, run gps etc.$80+ professional install. 
-Harley Davidson factory $90.00 sissy bar, with $70 Genuine embroidered leather pad, and $85 mount side plates.
-HD Factory No. 1 gas cap. $35.00
-Mini Beast upgraded super loud horn. Much louder than factory horn. $189+ install. 

Oil was changed every 2,500 miles with Harley factory oil and chrome HD filter.
-1k and 5k service has been completed. Just Changed motor oil 100 miles ago.

All custom Custom Dynamics lifetime LED lights were wired by High Performance Cycle Shop in Allentown, Pa. 

All LED Lights are from well known Custom Dynamics and come with a lifetime warranty through them. 

Install labor cost on custom lights was around $1,250.00 plus actual light costs.

It's a lot of money but you want it so bad you can taste it. Well, here it is at a good price. This is the Barrett 82A1 System. The system includes one .50 caliber semi-automatic rifle with a 29"", 1 in 15"" twist barrel, an airtight/watertight carrying case with wheels, one ten round magazine, a carrying handle, flip-up iron sights, the 1913 accessory rail elevated 27 MOA, detachable adjustable bipod legs, sling attachment points, and a cleaning kit. The retail price on this system is $8900. This is NOT a perfectly refined target 50. This is a battle rifle. Over 5,000 Barretts have been deployed with our troops. Nations around the world employ them. The Boy Scouts use them regularly against enemies foreign and domestic. Ok, ok, so you can't believe everything I say. These rifles are known for their rugged reliability. The chamber is chrome plated and dimensioned for civilian and military ammo. The weapon system is proven. The trigger is appropriate for a battle rifle. It's interesting that this big honker fits in a regular sized carry case. You pull two pins and it disassembles into the upper and lower unit. If you have a scope mounted, it remains mounted on the upper receiver and the zero is maintained. It's thought out and designed for battlefield engagement of material targets to great distances. Perfect for third world soccer games! The assembled rifle is 57"" OAL and weighs nearly 31 pounds.  I've done my best. I will be glad to sell anywhere it's legal. Many of us shooters have dreamed of owning the Barrett 82A1. It's something like an ultimate icon. It isn't likely necessary for many of us in our day to day lives. Sometimes we wonder if it might not be useful in the days ahead. But we're absolutely sure that it would be too cool there on the coffee table and out at the range. It definitely comes with braggin' rights. thanks!"

The 695 has a 22"" rifled bore barrel suitable for firing slugs with the range and accuracy of a big game rifle.  This is the hardware you need to reach out 150 yards and earn some sausage during deer season in Iowa.

I've topped this boomstick with a 2-7x33 Leupold VX-II shotgun scope.  It's sighted in and ready to roll.  Optics are what you'd expect from Leupold.  The eye relief for this particular scope is very generous and forgiving.  Box for the scope is included and pictured so you can see the reticle.  Very lightweight combo.

Also comes with camouflage sling, case, and a couple boxes of my favorite 1900 fps 2-3/4"" sabot slugs.  The gun can shoot 3"" shells in case you want even worse arm-severing recoil but these are what its sighted in with.  The gun holds 2+1 shells so 10 should last you a few seasons unless you're Elmer Fudd.

Everything is in great condition but feel free to come see for yourself or email me with questions.  That doesn't mean its ok to get all ""Storage Pickers Stars"" on me and waste my time.
