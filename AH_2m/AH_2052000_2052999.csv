Henry Repeating Arms is the current manufacturer.
First designed by Armalite in 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.
Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.
This innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 2.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.
When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the AR-7 is ready for action.
The AR-7 has a sturdy steel barrel covered in aluminum and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.
Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments.
It is equipped with an adjustable rear peep sight and a blade front sight."

This package is for anyone who has ever wanted to buy one of these rifles in range-ready condition to see what they are all about. When this package arrives, you will be fully prepared to spend hours at the range breaking in this little gem!

This rifle features a straight-pull Steyr-Mannlicher bolt design and is fed by a 5-round enbloc magazine in a style similar to the M1 Garand, where the clip is metal and is ejected from the bottom of the magazine housing when the last round is chambered. 

All items included in this package have been opened and inspected; the gun has a smooth mirror-like bore with strong lands/grooves, no surface rust or pitting of any kind, and the stock bears many dings and scuffs evident in old military surplus rifles, but it still has rich color and a good finish.

All enbloc magazines have been inspected and only one or two of them have very minimal surface rust that can be dealt with using a little elbow grease in about 15 minutes. *9* of these clips are included in this package, and if you look around the net, these are worth $10 each, so if you feel like 9 is too many, you are free to sell some of them to fellow M95 shooters who are in need of some that are in nearly pristine order!

Included for free with this rifle (that's right, I said FREE) is a rubber recoil pad that is very snug around the butt of the gun, along with a sling that was designed for use with the M95 carbine, and finally a hard gun case to carry around the newest addition to your collection! (A $50 value for all included!)

And now, for the REALLY awesome part of this package. Included is a whopping *260* rounds of 8x56R ammunition! (That means you can reload this baby *52* times right out of the gate if you want to shoot everything!) The ammunition is a mix of modern loads along with old surplus ammo that is dated from between 1938 and 1940, with some being Nazi stamped and some being Austrian/Hungarian stamped. 

A total of 120 rounds are newly manufactured Prvi Partisan, the surplus totals up to 140 rounds.

Am willing to drive to meet someone up to two hours away from Winston-Salem area, but would prefer to meet somewhere between. NCDL or CCW permit will be required for Face-to-Face transactions and Bill of Sale will be signed by both parties.

If out-of-state resident wishes to purchase, then buyer will contribute $40 to total shipping costs and will pay FFL transfer fee on their end. I will pay remainder of shipping costs and FFL transfer on my end. FFL to FFL transfers ONLY for out of state buyers, please know your state laws regarding firearms of this type before contacting!

It has the model 2007 / 2013 square bottomed benchrest action, single shot,  with 19.5 inch bull barrel, mated to a laminated wood stock, fully adjustable for cheek weld height and length of pull.   This stock is no longer commercially available anymore, and can only be found on the secondary market these days, if anywhere, and was 950 dollars new (just for the stock alone...) back in the day.  I believe the trigger is their two stage model 5018, set at a only few ounces of pull, so very light and fast lock time.  The stock has the removable extension weight system applied to the front forearm, and there is a pin on the barrel for a bloop tube which can be acquired separately.   I am the original owner and have the original Anschutz factory test targets that came with the barreled action, and it lived up to its billing and easily used to put 10 rounds of ELEY Tenex into a rough circle at 50 yards in calm conditions.  While over 10 years old, like many of my ""toys,"" it is actually very lightly used and has only a few hundred rounds through it, at most, which is absolutely nothing for a 22 LR barrel.  The reason why this and so much of my stuff is so lightly used and in such great condition, is bc back in the day, when I was first getting into target shooting but didn't exactly know what type of shooting I wanted to do, I bought a lot of different stuff in different calibers.....and so my shooting time was spread out over many different items, as I just jumped from toy to toy.  I had 223's and 308's and 22-250's etc etc etc    In some sense, I was almost spending more time shopping and buying, than shooting..... So no single thing was ever heavily used.  And then I took a break from shooting while into other things, and didn't shoot for almost 6 1/2 years.  So everything just sort of sat in a ""time capsule,"" well cared for, but unused. Anyway, the scope on this rifle can also come along with the rig, or be sold separately. It's a Leupold 6.5 x 20 x 40 target scope.  Weight of rifle with scope is about 13 pounds.  I cant find any criticism of the rig, it's a great gun.  Only thing I might do if I were to keep shooting it instead of selling it, is perhaps glass bed the action (right now it's just a screwed down action torqued to Anschutz specs).  As recently as about 2008 when I last saw they were still selling these model 2007 / 2013 benchrest actions (they might be discontinued now, I'm not sure, I can't find them on the internet now anymore), they were going for over 2,000 just for the barreled action alone, not including stock or any accessories, for which I do specifically recall paying over 950 just for the stock.  So I'm asking roughly half of what I had into the gun, which I think is very reasonable given it was hardly used at all."

1 EVENT 2 SHOOT OFF COMPETITIONS!! WIN A 1954.11 (made November of 1954) TYPE 53 Mosin Nagant Carbine and BRING YOUR PERSONAL RIFLE & OUT SHOOT EVERYONE ELSE FOR 50% OF THE ENTRY FEE!

Details of both are below:

SHOOT #5
Saturday September 14th join us for the 5th Linn Creek Military Surplus Shoot Off. Starts at 12 noon!

You will have a chance to win a 1954.11 Type 53 Mosin Nagant Carbine (7.62x54r). I have personally cleaned and serviced this rifle from the ground up. I can say with 100% certainty, this is a very nice shooter and will be a welcome addition to any collection.

The shoot off general rules/info:

EAR PROTECTION IS MANDATORY! NO EXCEPTIONS!

The cost is $20 for each entry ticket or 3 for $50. 

Enter as many times as you like or can afford...lol. Cash payment at the time of the shoot. I am also open to trades of guns, ammo or any interesting military surplus/survival gear.

""What do we shoot for the event?"" 
Everyone shoots the same rifle.... The prize rifle you are trying to win.

""How does it work?""

It's very simple. after everyone has paid & gotten their tickets, shooting order will be a random draw.

You shoot 5 rounds at 100 yards, open sights with ammo that I provide. Military surplus ammo straight from the spam can. In this case 188 gr Bulgarian surplus ammo.

No practice shots with the prize rifle. You go in cold just like everyone else. 

You can sit at the bench (no shooting rests, sleds, props or whatever, just the rifle & your arms), sitting, prone or standing as you so choose. This is an informal shoot, so please, no hardcore rule umpires, we want to keep it casual & easy going. In event of a tie there will be a 1 shot 'shoot off'. In the event of any disagreements/disputes, my judgement is final. 

We will spot and show you where your rounds are landing. 

Best points score takes the rifle home. It's that simple. Shoot 5 rounds, get the high score & take the rifle home with you. 

Obviously, you must be present to win. 
*******************************************************************
***************BRING YOUR OWN RIFLE & SHOOT TO WIN**************
*******************************************************************

It's pretty simple. 

$5 gets you in. Bring 5 rounds of your own ammo, shoot it out of your gun at 200 yards. High score wins.

Any caliber rifle, scoped or not at your preference. At the bench, off hand, sitting or prone. Your choice, no rests or bi pods. 

As reported to me by a few friends that are attending, there are .22's, .243, 30/30 and 7.62x54r, 7.5swiss 6.5 carcano, 7 & 8MM Mausers and so much more.

Do you have a nail driver? Bring it, show off your chops & take a few bucks home along with the bragging rights!

Highest score with 5 rounds will win you 1/2 (50%) of the entry fees to the 'bring your own' shoot. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Feel free to bring a few weapons/accessories to trade and or show off. After the shoot off it will be open range time for anyone wanting to shoot. There is a 300 yd range, pistol and shotgun pits as well. 

The range is in Linn Creek on A Rd. Located between Camdenton and Osage Beach. After you are on A rd. you will travel about 4 1/2 miles to Garrison. It will be a right turn, the only way you can go. Follow the gravel rd to the bottom of the hill & just across the low water bridge you will see Centerpoint gun club on the right. That is where we will be meeting for the shoot.

Don't worry about the drive. If you are in MO, it's not too far. We have folk coming in from every corner of the state. Joplin, KC, St Louis, St. Joseph and farther out. hop in the car and make the drive. I assure you it's worth the windshield time!

My phone number is REDACTED. If you have questions, want to discuss trade goods for tickets or need directions please feel free to call me between 10 am and midnight, 7 days a week.

There is no age limit, if you can handle & fire the weapon safely, your welcome to come and play with us. 

This is a primitive site. You will need to bring lawn chairs/something to sit on. Water isn't a bad idea. I always have some there for everyone, but extra never hurts. I hope to see you there!

This is a family event & is a LOT of fun with like minded folk. Come on down, meet new friends and enjoy a beautiful summer day in the Ozarks."

Once again, innovation is the “watch” word for 5.11 Tactical Series. When we set out to design a Titanium Watch we wanted one that would truly serve the needs of law enforcement. The H.R.T.® Titanium Watch has all of the features needed for day to day activities and includes our revolutionary SureShot® calculator. In a partnership with Horus Vision, makers of proven long-range ballistic software, we bring sophisticated point of impact software to your Titanium Watch. We give you the ability to input thirteen critical variables needed for long range shooting solutions quickly and easily. The SureShot® calculator gives you point of impact shooting solutions out to 1000 meters. Input your known ballistic data (bore height, ballistic coefficient, muzzle velocity and zero range), then add your environmental data (range, temperature, altitude, inclination) and the SureShot® calculator will give you a shooting solution in MILS, TMOA or SMOA. You can even get your solution in clicks for both windage and elevation. The calculator is very easy to use and most of the variables can be put into the Titanium Watch before going out to the field. And that’s not all. This rugged titanium watch can take a real beating. We’ve beefed up the titanium watch pins to stand the strain of a wrestling match, sealed the titanium watch for 100 meters of water resistance and given you a controlled backlight so you can see your data when you need it. Also, the luminescent markings can be charged with direct light to give you secure analog reading in the dark.

Hardware
The H.R.T.® Titanium watch has luminescent analog hour, minute and second hands. We’ve included digital day, date, and two digital time zones, an audible alarm, an hourly chime, a countdown timer and you can check your lap times with a digital chronograph. We’ve included a uni-directional bezel along with a backlight. The H.R.T.® Titanium Watch has a coated titanium case that is lightweight and tough. The mineral crystal face is scratch resistant and reduces glare. This full function timepiece is unique in the world of titanium watches.

Value
The H.R.T.® Titanium Watch is a great value for the number of features and quality of materials. The titanium case, proprietary software and multiple features give you an outstanding titanium watch that looks great and works hard."

No rust and the stock looks great and I have no doubt it functions perfectly.  The serial number is 56040 and being that it is the 22 short it is a rarer gun to find especially in it's current condition.  I have never fired this gun and it was given to me by my grandmother cared for by my grandfather (ex-highway patrol officer/gun collector) and I'm sure it has been a solid thirty years or more since she fired it.  It has been kept in a sleeve in a closet for nearly it's whole life.  I'd hate to get rid of it because it is a family heirloom but I need the money and honestly it belongs to someone who is a collector of high quality antique firearms.

I plan to use the dirtbike as nothing more than a motorcycle trainer so that I can learn to ride. The dollar amounts next to the item descriptions are approximate values based on ebay auctions and such and not necessarily the amount I need out of them.

Up for trade I have the following:
1. Desert camo chest rig with soft armor inserts. It will stop anything up to 9mm from a submachinegun. The soft armor panels for this were cut from another vest I had lying around. I also have a small amount of extra kevlar. $200
2. Digital woodland camo Gortex top and bottom. These are size medium regular and are in great condition. Perfect for hunting and camping. $150
3. Marine Corps standard issue ILBE ruck. Large internal frame pack used by the Marines. Good condition. $75
4. Woodland and coyote brown day packs. These are in good condition and feature MOLLE webbing for extra pouches. $75
5. Strider fixed blade knife. This knife is an extremely durable combat knife. The thick blade alo allows it to be used for prying without fear of breaking the blade. $200
6. SAPI armor plates. These are side plates in fair condition and are rated to stop armor piercing 7.62x51mm rounds. $250
7. 1 carat total weight diamond engagement ring. Ring is white gold with three main stones, and six accent stones. I bought this ring from Helzberg several years ago for $1199.
8. Blackhawk Serpa Level 3 holster for a Beretta M9 or M9a1. I also have a Blackhawk thigh rig for it. Buying new, this setup would cost $150
9. BSA Catseye (older model) 3-10x44mm scope. In fair condition with some blemishes from being mounted in scope rings. $50
10. BSA 4x32mm rimfire scope. Comes with rings to fit a 3/8"" scope rail (not a weaver rail). $30
11. Marine Coprs issue IFAV vest. This vest allows the use of soft armor panels as well as plates (neither included) but is missing a cummerbund. $100
12. Danner Rugged All-Terrain Boots, size 11.5Wide. These are brand new in box and are lined with gortex. These go for around $350 brand new. Very high quality boots.
13. Harris 9-12"" extendable bipod with cant adjustment. Has been partially painted but is in good working order. $40

This is a new production model. It was purchased new approximately two months ago. It comes in the original box with two 15-round magazines in like new condition. MSRP is $775 on berettausa.com, but you can probably find one new for $675-$700 at most gun shops. The difference between this M9 and a brand new one is the price tag and the sales tax. That's it. Price is firm at $550. Would prefer a trade.

The M9 is a short recoil, semi-automatic, single-action / double-action pistol which uses a 15-round staggered box magazine with a reversible magazine release button that can be positioned for either right- or left-handed shooters. The M9 is used with the Bianchi M12 Holster, though other holsters are often used. The specific modifications made from the 
Beretta 92 includes:
- Design of all the parts to make them 100% interchangeable to simplify maintenance for large government organizations.
- Modified the front of the trigger guard so that one could use finger support for easier aiming.
- Recurved the forward base of the grip to aid aiming.
- Hard chromed the barrel bore to protect it from corrosion and to reduce wear.
- New surface coating on the slide called Bruniton, which allegedly provides better corrosion resistance than the previous plain blued finish.
- Enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. Military testing.

The M9 was updated to the M9A1 in 2006. It added—among other things—a Picatinny rail for the attachment of lights, lasers, and other accessories to the weapon. The M9A1 has more aggressive front and backstrap checkering and a beveled magazine well for easier reloading of the weapon. M9A1 pistols are sold with physical vapor deposition (PVD) coated magazines developed to better withstand the conditions in the sandy environments in Iraq and Afghanistan.[8]

The M9 features multiple internal safeties, including a firing pin block that prevents the firing pin from moving without the trigger being pulled, and a firing pin striker that rotates when the safety lever is engaged preventing the firing pin from being hit even if the hammer falls. The M9 also has an ambidextrous external safety lever allowing both left and right handed people to comfortably engage the safety mechanism."

 TACOPS® M9 Assault Medical Backpack 

 The M9 Assault Medical Backpack from TSSi was specifically designed to better fulfill the needs of the operational medic involved in vehicle or aircraft operations. The problem with conventional medical packs is the bulk and thickness of the bag interfering with the medic's ability to sit or move in vehicles or aircraft. The M9 was designed and created with the guidance of a Physician's Assistant (PA), who also served as a Special Operations 18D medic, to provide a backpack with a very thin profile that carries the necessary medical support items for operational medics. Pack only. Contents not included. Also comes fully stocked and field ready! Click here to see the field ready version.

 The SPCS - Soldier Plate Carrier System is the current U.S. Army Plate Carrier System currently issued to all combat troops in Afghanistan (over 60,000 units). Following lengthy review, field evaluations and analysis, the U.S. Army chose the KDH model Magnum TAC-1 system over all other competitor's designs as a result of the following key factors: (1) weight and comfort, (2) ballistic performance, and (3) delivery schedule. The Magnum TAC-1 was the lightest of the plate carriers studied by the U.S. Army and it has the highest ballistic performance as well. This plate carrier/vest provides the soldier with a lightweight option to the standard issue IOTV vest and is designed to meet the requirements of troops working in high-altitude and rugged terrain. The system balances the fine line between coverage vs. mobility.

 Unmatched comfort. One active duty Army Major commented, ""It is by far the most comfortable body armor vest I have ever worn.""
• Highly adjustable for improved fit. The vest can be adjusted ""on-the-run"" without removing the vest with its side adjustable straps. The vest can be adjusted real time as mission requirements change.
• Cummerbund connects with side release buckles rather than Velcro for greater adjustability on the move and superior noise discipline.
• Side plate protection pouches can be easily removed when not mission critical
• Single-handed emergency egress quick-release system
• Low-profile system
• Fits U.S. issue X-Small thru X-Large hard armor ESAPI plates
• Reinforced drag handle
• 360° MOLLE mounting surfaces
• Easy donning/doffing
• IOTV groin and lower back protector compatible
• Provides IOTV specification soft ballistic protection
• Lightest weight military plate carrier on the market today with every objective requirement met
• Protected by nGuard®: resistant to odor, microbes, fungi, mosquitos, bed bugs, color fading"

 The SPCS - Soldier Plate Carrier System is the current U.S. Army Plate Carrier System currently issued to all combat troops in Afghanistan (over 60,000 units). Following lengthy review, field evaluations and analysis, the U.S. Army chose the KDH model Magnum TAC-1 system over all other competitor's designs as a result of the following key factors: (1) weight and comfort, (2) ballistic performance, and (3) delivery schedule. The Magnum TAC-1 was the lightest of the plate carriers studied by the U.S. Army and it has the highest ballistic performance as well. This plate carrier/vest provides the soldier with a lightweight option to the standard issue IOTV vest and is designed to meet the requirements of troops working in high-altitude and rugged terrain. The system balances the fine line between coverage vs. mobility.

 Unmatched comfort. One active duty Army Major commented, ""It is by far the most comfortable body armor vest I have ever worn.""
• Highly adjustable for improved fit. The vest can be adjusted ""on-the-run"" without removing the vest with its side adjustable straps. The vest can be adjusted real time as mission requirements change.
• Cummerbund connects with side release buckles rather than Velcro for greater adjustability on the move and superior noise discipline.
• Side plate protection pouches can be easily removed when not mission critical
• Single-handed emergency egress quick-release system
• Low-profile system
• Fits U.S. issue X-Small thru X-Large hard armor ESAPI plates
• Reinforced drag handle
• 360° MOLLE mounting surfaces
• Easy donning/doffing
• IOTV groin and lower back protector compatible
• Provides IOTV specification soft ballistic protection
• Lightest weight military plate carrier on the market today with every objective requirement met
• Protected by nGuard®: resistant to odor, microbes, fungi, mosquitos, bed bugs, color fading"

I purchased this top of the line bow a few months ago with intentions of getting back into bow hunting, but my work and family demands say otherwise, so my loss is your gain. The bow is in new condition as I have only shot it less that 20 times in my yard. I have not even registered the warrany with Mathews. The bow alone with nothing on it is close to $1000...add up all the extras and you will see this is a deal. The new Chill uses modules to change the bow length which you can replace with a allen wrench for about $20...no bow press needed.

 Danner® ICH™ Olive Military Boots
 MSRP$380.00 | Style 43515X
 USA Crafted
 On the battlefield, key reinforcements make all the difference. The same is true in bootmaking. We bolster the Improved Combat Hiker™ heel and ankle so you’ll be able to stand your ground under any circumstances.

 This American made boot features a waterproof GORE-TEX® lining beneath a layer of durable, full-grain nubuc leather. The outsole is lugged for tough terrain, with an additional abrasion resistant rand for durability.

 Boot Details
 Made in the USA
 Berry compliant
 100% waterproof and breathable GORE-TEX® liner is engineered to keep your feet dry and comfortable - even in extreme conditions
 Full-grain nubuc leather upper offers better protection in cold and wet environments while offering some of the best abrasion- and scuff-resistance of all of our leather options
 Speed laces and lace-to-toe design for a secure fit
 360° abrasion resistant rand stands up to extreme terrains
 Added heel and ankle support strap for increased control
 Extended sizes available for women or those with smaller feet
 Vibram® Bifida outsole provides natural movement for the foot. The thrust, grip and brake areas are characterized by different shaped lugs positioned according to the most recent biomechanical concepts.
 Fiberglass shank
 7"" height
 54 oz weight

 610 Last
 The 610 is our most universal last and can be worn by all foot shapes and sizes. It provides a snug fit through the heel while allowing ample toe room for most versatile fit. This allows more support and side-to-side movement.

 Tips for the Perfect Fit
 Measure both feet. If one foot is slightly larger than the other, select a size that fits the larger of the two.
 Consider the type of socks you'll be wearing with your boot. For thicker socks, you may want to select a half size larger than you normally wear.
 When you do receive your boots, we recommend first wearing them indoors for a few hours to ensure they're the right fit."

As component prices come down and supply is replenished, so do my prices and inventory levels. Drop me a line, and see if taking advantage of my one-on-one, 100% unique, and most importantly, 100% GUARANTEED, custom-build process, is right for your situation.

I also have a Cerakote rig with tons of experience and several colors.
I have Blue Titanium and Burnt Bronze pictured, but have about 10 more colors including ""Micro-Slick"" Ceramic Plating. When you add Cerakote to a custom upper... You get it done for the cost of supplies basically. Usually at a fraction of the cost to get it done by a big shop that uses the exact same spray guns, techniques, and workflow that I do.

I have access ro literally ANY part. So if you have a build in mind but cant find a part or two in the list, I can help. 

BUY WITH CONFIDENCE - I carry/use components from top-tier manufacturers, guarantee my work 100%, and assemble each by hand, with industry standard/specialized tools, to Mil-Spec Tolerances, and with an inhuman attention to detail. 

I SHIP ANYWHERE in the US (FLAT RATE PER UPPER), and especially enjoy helping the people of ""occupied America"" finish their lower receivers into fully functional and badass rifles/pistols. As long as it conforms to your local laws of course. Since an upper assembly does not classify as a firearm, it will ship to your door. I am familiar with most state's laws, but it is ultimately your duty to know, and follow, the parameters your local lawmakers set forth. I can accept no responsibility for my products being so badass that they make evil Leftist scum SH** themselves...

This is a Nikko model 512 12 gauge O/U 26"" rib vent made in Japan.  These guns were made of some of the highest quality walnuts and were made at the same factory as the Winchester 101's with the better parts before they made the Winchesters for them.  I have not had a chance to shoot this one yet but I have another O/U from Nikko and it is hands down the best O/U I have ever had the opportunity to shoot.  

There are very few of the model 512's available for sale across the internet ranging from $700 to $850.  This one is completly original with no parts being changed out as far as but plate and what not, from the looks it has been shot very little although there are signs of use.  Easily a 90% if not 95% gun.

The front of the stock was cut down, as was common with many GI's at the time so that they would fit in their packs. The structural integrity of the rifle isn't damaged at all. It's actually in fantastic working and aesthetic condition.
The rifle is comprised of all original parts and bears the crown of Kaiser-era Germany. Out of the models Erfurt created throughout the course of the war, this model is the only one to see limited production. Makes for a great collection piece with the approaching centennial of the war. Also just plenty of fun to shoot.

The paint can easily be removed if desired. I prefer the feel of a tradition stock on a shotgun, so these are doing no good for me.

Make me an offer, any offer, the worst I can do is say no thanks. The entire package will include:

1 - ATI adjustable pistol grip stock with shell caddy (Woodland digital)
1 - Remington rubber buttpad
2 - Remington fore ends (1 is factory black, 1 is Woodland digital)
1 - Stock mounting bolt, nut and washer

Everything is included to fully interchange the furniture on your Remington 870. They're nice stocks, comfortable. Show minimal signs of wear, simply not my style. Shoot me an offer, I can answer any questions and send pictures of what I have to anyone interested.

The phosphate coating on these parts is the best I have ever seen. It is extremely even and flawless (you can kind of see what I mean in the pics). The gas key is propperly staked and inspected for precision. I am selling because this carrier group came with my rifle and I replaced it with my old Nickle Boron BCG. In perfect condition and is a nice upgrade from most factory bolt carrier groups. All parts included and are ready to drop in and shoot. Included is the following:
Bolt - fully assembled (extractor, gas rings, etc.)
Carrier - fully assembled (staked gas key)
Titanium Firing Pin
Cam Pin
Cotter Pin

Description
KM2
The V-Series KM2 LED conversion head, a direct screw-on replacement for the existing head on SureFire Scout Light® WeaponLights, produces both brilliant white light and intense IR output from one dual-LED emitter assembly. A bezel selector ring allows you to easily switch back and forth from white to infrared output—and it is self-locking so it stays securely on the selected light output, until you decide otherwise. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break, and provide significantly longer runtimes per set of batteries than incandescent emitters of similar output. The KM2 head features a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens that produces a comparatively tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications. The O-ring sealed aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized

Seen several at the last antique arms show, all $200 and up with just one clip. Seen several more at the last Novi show, all $160 and up, again with just one clip.

So me asking $260 for everything is a pretty good deal.

$160 for the rifle with a clip minus the sling and cleaning kit is the lowest I seen it at any show. Then add in 6 more clips which the lowest I seen at any show was $22 each (for aftermarkets, not originals) equals $292 (plus tax from most of the dealers).
