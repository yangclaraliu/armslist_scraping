On the receiver is the US Ordnance ""flaming bomb"" and ""US"" marking on the top left.  What makes this shotgun even more rare is that it was a contract weapon for the US Navy and so the top of the barrel is stamped ""Property US Navy.""  The Remington factory code on the barrel dates this shotgun to ""July 1942.""  This is a real deal wartime shotgun acquired by the US Navy.  The shotgun was most likely acquired by the US Navy under the ""Blanket Procurement Program"" as it has the game scene engraved on the receiver for commercial production and the smooth blued finish but then was acquired by the military.  According to Bruce Canfield and his book ""United States Combat Shotguns"" only around 2300 Remington Model 11 shotguns were ever acquired by the US Navy for use in WWII.  Thus, this is 1 of only 2300 Remington Model 11 ""Property US Navy"" shotguns in WWII.  The bore is bright and shiny with no pitting.  No cracks in the wood.  Excellent finish on the receiver and barrel.  Please E-mail if you are interested.  I will ship the shotgun anywhere in the country to include $25-$30 shipping depending upon location.  I will meet face to face in Arkansas.  Thank you!"

  I'm offering my Gen 4 Glock 19. Probably only 2K rounds through it. I have added some upgrades to the gun which I will notate here. Everything below did NOT come with the gun originally:
•        Additional 15 round mag (Glock made; not aftermarket) total of 3
•        Gould and Goodrich IWB leather holster- great retention and the clip is outstanding
•       Blackhawk Serpa holster (with belt attachment)
•	Extended Mag release (I still have the original too)
•	3.5lb Ghost Trigger Connector (for a lighter & crisper trigger pull) (I still have the original too)
•	 3.5lb connector spring (I still have the original too)
•	 Extended Slide Release 

All these items total $152.00. I’m not trying to inflate the price, just letting you know the value added and what was done.

I also have the original Glock case it came in as well as the other 2 size backstraps, bore brush and an additional rear site. 

For everything I am asking $600.00 which if you price everything out is more than a good deal for you. Plus, the no FFL registration is always nice."

http://www2.diebold.com/pas/cut_sheets/cut_sheet_files/Physical%20Security/Fire%20Resistive%20Products/11973r01.pdf

I built it in as shown to suit my needs; it'll hold ~15,000 round of ammo, a handful of sidearms, and ~6 longarms, depending on how you pack it. Includes 1/2"" bolt-down hardware, but you'll need new wedge anchors. It's currently finished in Rustoleum.

This safe has none of the features designed to impress on the showroom floor (oversize chrome bolts, clearcoat paint, carpet, etc), but it's designed to impress commercial insurance agents. It was previously used as cash storage at a local department store. If you're interested, but it seems overpriced, compare the size and UL ratings to what you can get at Cabelas; I think it's a better deal.

I will delivery it in the Greenville area, with your help; I'm assuming you can handle your half. You and I will load it on my trailer, I'll drive it to your place, and we'll stand it up and roll it wherever you'd like. No stairs, at least not while I'm still around. Driving too far from Greenville will probably cost extra.

If you're interested, contact me with questions. I can provide more pictures, and arrange a time for you to have a look."

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

I bought it new this year from Academy for $649+tax.  I then purchased high quality Beretta accessories for it.  Here is everything it is being offered with:

-92A1 with box/manual/lock and three 17 round Italian Beretta magazines 
- two additional 17 round Italian Beretta magazines (total of 5 identical magazines)
- Italian hand made leather holster specifically designed for the 92 (Beretta made)
- Military grade padded shoulder holster
- 52 rounds of high end defense ammo - 147 Grain Federal Hydra-Shoks 
- 200 rounds of quality Winchester range ammo - 115 Grain FMJ

You can go to Beretta's website and price factory 17 round mags and the holster, none of this stuff is cheap and it is of the highest quality.

I have put about 200 rounds through the gun.  Some 147 Grain Hydra-Shoks to test them for proper feeding for personal defense and the rest range ammo for target practice.  This 92A1 is more accurate then any M9 I used in 15 years on active duty in the military.  It is an Italian made example and it is a tack driver.

I will only sell everything for $800 cash.  I'm taking a big loss between the holsters, magazines, and ammo.  I'm left with a single .357 to carry so I have no use for the 9MM anymore.

 I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one. I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying. Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five. If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

The instructors are top notch and this is a great deal. They offer over 50 classes, handgun, sniper, shotgun, automatic rifle and many more. With this membership you can take any course they offer FREE for the rest of your life. May be interested in bartering for fishing gear, rifles or handguns. Let me know what you have. 

The spectrum of people you will meet there range from teenagers, ladies, grandparents and guys. I must say some of the ladies were great and shoot very well. Many had very little if no prior handgun experience but came out of the class very confident and capable. There are other perks of the membership but really it boils down to the quality of the instructors and what you take away when you leave.

If you would like all of the information, links to the classes and reviews from people who have taken the class please let me know.

Aside from the cost of the membership and the $100 transfer fee the only other cost is a very minimal backround check cost that everyone pays annually."

I bought this ammo from a small, off the beaten path gun shop in South Central Florida back in early February.The owner said this was the first shipment of CCI .22 ammo he had in a over a year. I paid $189.99 a brick plus tax. His single box price was $21.99 

Since then I picked up a Five Seven and like it better than my PMR30 so I'm retiring it and don't need the amount of .22 Mag ammo I have. 

Selling price is $203 per 500 rounds - your choice - the 500 TMJ or the 500 JHP. I won't take less than I paid as I'd simply rather hold it instead.

 I am selling this Marlin Model 60 as I want to start varmint hunting. This requires a rifle with a longer range than any .22 caliber rifle is capable of.

This rifle was purchased new about 6 months ago and has fired approximately 300 rounds. It has been cleaned every time after a shooting event.

The operator’s manual specifies .22 caliber long rifle cartridges only as the semi-automatic needs that recoil to operate.

The Marlin Microgroove rifling makes this a very accurate rifle.

Extensive trigger work has been done by a local gunsmith. It has a DIP Inc. M60 Adjustable Trigger Kit and a McCarbo Trigger Spring Kit. The trigger now has a light and short pull. The original factory pull was about 6.5 lbs. and ¼ inch. The pull now is about 2.5 to 3.0 lbs. and 1/8 inch.

The trigger work springs and adjustable trigger cost almost as much as the rifle did when new but has added much value for the serious shooter.

This has the original box and operator’s manual

This is a sacrifice price as I am asking considerably less than what I have in the rifle. My loss is your gain.

Call with any questions you may have. The price is somewhat negotiable but not much.

This was manufactured by B.F.I. Windham ME. In my opinion this is when they were one of the best AR-15 platforms on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

Once again this is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable!"

Comes with 10 Bushmaster 30 round metal mags,1500 rounds of ammo,owners manual, test target. The gun is in pristine condition. Not a mark on it anywhere. The gun has been sitting in my safe since day one. Factory test fired only. Please call or text REDACTED if interested. The price is $1300.00. Located in Indpls.Indiana. I WILL separate the package if interested in just the AR, ammo, mags, or sight only.

This was manufactured by B.F.I. Windham ME. In my opinion this is when they were one of the best AR-15 platforms on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

Once again this is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable!"

This was manufactured by B.F.I. Windham ME. In my opinion this is when they were one of the best AR-15 platforms on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

Once again this is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable!"

Prefer FTF in West Seattle. 

This barrel has a stainless steel match-grade barrel liner with a carbon fiber sleeve on the outside. This gives it the stiffness of a bull barrel with less weight than the original thin 10/22 barrel. If you're looking for a super-accurate barrel that's also really lightweight, this is the way to go. 

Even though it was mounted on my 10/22 for several years, the barrel still looks really good. The outside just shows some normal wear, but the crown, chamber, and bore are in excellent condition and were always kept very clean. There's a minor blemish on the breech end of the barrel, but you won't see it once it's mounted on the rifle. Overall, this barrel is in great condition and is very accurate and lightweight."

Front trunnion marked ZASTAVA-KRAJUJEVAC YUGOSLAVIA. Barrel made from 4140 steel and rifled specifically for 7.62X39 round.Barrel length is 22 or 23 inches long. Has removable threaded brake on barrel, can be changed to a different one. Direct copy of the original Yugo. Has a 1:10 twist a .300 bore and .311 grove diameter.

Front sight has the night sight flip up lever. Rear sight has the adjustable knob for wind age and has elevation out to 1000 (10 numbered marks on sight)Has bi-pod connected to barrel.This is the closest RPK M72 you'll find without one being original and have a high dollar price on it. This is like new and has only about 100rds thru barrel. Has both sling mounts attached to it for your sling. I've owned it for quite some time 5-8 years shot it when I bought it and put it in safe. Finish is excellent and butt-stock and top half of hand-guard is like new and lower part of hand-guard has about 3 small nicks in it, probably from the kit it was built with. Sights are good not canted at all. Comes with cleaning rod, 2-40rd and 2-30 rd mags.Overall gun is excellent condition including finish. Yugo M72's are just about gone.Great for a collector or a shooter."
