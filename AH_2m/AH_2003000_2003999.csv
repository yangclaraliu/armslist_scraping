The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HKs American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.

The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.

The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK?s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter?s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the ?fire? position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and manufacturing and is currently being made at HK?s new American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:

Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
HK45 grip-to-slide angle matches Model 1911?s profile

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.


The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

Here are the specs/features:

*Sile/Marocchi (according to proof marks on the barrel) 12 gauge three inch chambers
*28 inch barrel
*first barrel is a modified choke
*second barrel is a full choke
*the chokes are removeable, but I don't have any other chokes
*blued barrels with plated receiver
*full length rib with brass bead
*lever operated top break action
*rubber recoil pad
*14 inches from end of the recoil pad to the trigger

The bores, bluing, and plating are 100%. No rusting or marring anywhere. There are two light scratches on the front left of the forearm (first pic), and a small nick on the front of the stock (second pic). It is very small and I could have hid it with a little brown shoe polish, but there are no surprises within this description. This is an Italian over and under 12 gauge, but is not a mantle piece. These shotguns were affordable and meant to be used. I bought a 12 gauge automatic at a garage sale just after buying the Sile and just never used it anymore.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

No bolt guns unless you are willing to take a big loss in value in trade.  No shotguns or black powder.  


Other items considered would be a NICE safe plus cash,  other firearms perhaps.... ?   email me at REDACTED"

advancements in handgun engineering, offering .45 ACP performance and a
host of unique features that no other handgun can match. The checkered
polymer frame is in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) and has a low-bore
axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced operator control. Three additional interchangeable backstraps come standard to quickly customize the grip
feel. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous for ease of use. The
5.3 cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel has a threaded muzzle to
accept sound suppressors, compensators and other accessories. The stainless
steel slide has high-profile combat night sights and includes two mounting
bases to accept multiple styles of optional red-dot electronic sights.

510,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2003510,For Sale:  CZ 75 P-07 .40 - New in Box and Hard to Find - NICE GUN,"Tulsa, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 550,"Listed On: Thursday, August 15, 2013",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is one sweet gun that's new in the box and ready for a new home. Come get this CZ 75 P-07 .40 Caliber in the box with everything shown.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

I just purchased this rifle last week at a local gun shop, it was new in the box from Marlin/Remington, but when I got it home I noticed a small blemish in the bluing on the magazine tube. The defect is located on the bottom side of the magazine tube near the front barrel band. I called Marlin/Remington Customer Service and they sent me a new magazine tube, plug and screw, so hopefully someone can use these parts. Once again, the only issue is the small defect in the bluing on the magazine tube, these parts are basically brand new and fully functional. It only took 10 minutes to replace these parts on my 336c and I'm not a gunsmith, so they're easy to replace. Prefer face to face near Pittsburgh but will ship if needed.

After that, it's up to you. The ammo in the title sells FAST.  Call before you travel.  

I do the WalMart loop (Derry/Manchester/Hooksett/Bedford) often.  I shoot 9mm, 40 and 22lr and I buy it when I see it.  You'll be the second to know.

By the way ... Francis D.   Go F youself you friggin' gouger.  You've got a lot of balls bitchin' that the ammo was gone, when you resell the sh*t here at a 40% mark-up."

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
