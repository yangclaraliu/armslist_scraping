It is an all original, complete, numbers matching real sword. Not a replica. I've been collecting over 10 years and letting go of some things. 

This type 95 was made between late 1938 up to mid 1941. Late 1938 they changed the tsuba or guard to the  9mm thick brass from the 11mm thick brass of the first issue. And then in mid 1941 they changed the guard to the black iron style. 

Has the aluminium tsuka or handle. These are machine made blades, not handmade and signed on tang. Has matching serial number on blade and scabbard throat. 

The Blade was made by the Nagoya arsenal. Two arsenals made the blades, a third kokura did not make any but was a supervising arsenal of the type 95 project and their mark will be found at times along with the nagoya or tokyo first arsenal. This blade and sword were made by nagoya and you can tell on them by when you read the serial number. when you read the number the cutting edge of blade is facing up and it faces down as you read number on the tokyo first blades. 

The Fuchi Stampings, the piece right under the guard is stamped with three symbols, Gifu, Nagoya and Kokura. Gifu is the corporate logo of the group within the arsenal, there were six of these altogether. This one is Gifu, Second is the Nagoya Arsenal stamping and third the Kokura arsenal stamping which sometimes accompanies. 

The blood fuller is full length and the tip is correct, scabbard is correct and the blade is in good shape. few small dark spots but overall nice shape. 

I know what they sell for, if you can get them for 200 at your local gun show then I would advise you to just go buy it there or buy it for 200 and sell it to me for 400. Double your money. I will not ship either. Face to face. I will meet in wisconsin rapids.

Up for sale is my only pistol, a Walther P1 post-war model with the hex pin and fat slide.
Wood grips ran me about 80$.

A great shooter, only gave me feeding problems when I tried using steel ammo (couldn't find anything else due to the shortage).

Comes with 2 clips, a standard leather zip case, the original black plastic grips, 90 (ninety) 9mm rounds, and (if I can find it) the cleaning kit it came with.

Hate to see her go but I need to pay bills this September.
Willing to negotiate price if you can replace the radiator fan motor and/or the emergency brake in my 2005 chevy cavalier (which I have the parts for).

However everything must go at some point, and now is the time for this spectacular pistol.

I've done quite a bit of research on this pistol, but I'm not going to bore you with all the details because I figure that those who would buy it will be familiar with it already. So here are the basic facts:

Pistol is in at least 95% overall condition. Metal finish is excellent with very few handling marks. Grips are perfect & bore is bright/shiny with no rusting, pitting, or other imperfections whatsoever.

This pistol was made in 1944 by Husqvarna (Sweden) and is 100% original - no arsenal refurbing or refinishing - Period! Hard to believe anything made in 1944 could survive in this condition, but all true!

It is one of about 10,000 that was contracted by and then sold to Denmark. Pistol is stamped with the Danish military/police unit marks, plus all of the normal Swedish proof and inspection marks.

All numbers on pistol match. Lahti magazines are not numbered.

There is a very similar pistol listed right now (listed by Jackson Armory) on Gunbroker for $1695 plus shipping and that is without any accessories at all.

Pistol comes with an original holster & belt that is black leather with brass hardware in very good condition. Also included are 4 original magazines, oiler, cleaning rod, magazine loader/screwdriver tool, original Lahti leather lanyard, and 3.5 boxes of collectible 9mm ammo by Sako. The ammo is amazingly clean for 1950's production and has SINOXOID non-corrosive primers.

My asking price for everything is $1500. FTF with pickup in Brandon Florida. You must be at least 21 and a Florida resident to purchase. Thanks for looking.

p.s. My pictures don't really due justice to this fine pistol, but they are the best I can manage with my iPad. So I'd be happy to take & send more or to arrange a time for inspection by a serious buyer. This is a collectible investment and I understand that."

Nice Colt 6” Royal Blue Python .357, Mfg. 1962. Stock # MSH264515SP. Serial # 188xx. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is also one of MANY Colt Pythons and Diamondbacks we currently have in stock. This is a really nice 6” Royal Blue .357 Magnum Colt Python with factory wooden checkered grips with gold-plated Colt medallions. The pistol was manufactured in 1962. In really nice condition, there are a few tiny service marks here and there on the grips and finish, the bore is shiny with strong rifling, and, of course, it has that out of the box Python double action that is smooth as silk – overall condition is 95%. If you are looking for a 1960’s 6” Python, this is a nice one! As you know, Python prices continue to escalate, and we see no end to that trend – there is no telling what this gun will be worth in a few years!

From Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_Model_1892
The Winchester Model 1892 was a lever-action repeating rifle designed by John Browning as a smaller, lighter version of his large-frame Model 1886, and which replaced the Model 1873 as the company's lever-action for pistol-caliber rounds such as the .44-40.

Although the Model 1892 made its debut after the closing of the American frontier, and the true ""Guns that Won the West"" were the earlier Models 1866 and 1873, nonetheless the '92 became an indelible icon of Western mythology through its use in hundreds of motion pictures and television shows, standing in for its older siblings. John Wayne famously carried Model 92s in dozens of films and owned several personally, some with the distinctive oversized ""loop"" lever. Other notable screen 92s were those of Chuck Connors in The Rifleman TV series, and Steve McQueen's ""Mare's Leg"" in Wanted: Dead or Alive.[5]

Winchester ended production of the Model 1892 in 1945 however copies produced by manufacturers such as Browning, Navy Arms, Chiappa, Armi San Marco, and Rossi have continued to be manufactured."

Included is the Taurus Pt709, one 7rd magazine, Taurus hard carrying case, the gun lock, a Size 0 IWB holster, another mag extension in case you get another mag, and safety key. I will say that this gun does not like Winchester ammo. 

Aside from Winchester, I have had no failures of any kind with it, I am just selling to help fund a bigger safe.
Any questions, please let me know!

$320 takes it . Will accept 22lr ammo as a partial trade or Will trade for a bolt action rifle in 223."

Exceptionally rare American, silver mounted, 23-bore double barreled flintlock sporting gun, ca. 1810","New york, New York, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, September 25, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"B. & J. Cooper, New York. Extraordinarily rare and fine American, silver-mounted, 23-bore double barreled flintlock sporting gun in the best British tradition, ca.1810. Weight: 5 ½ Lbs.  Fine 30” Damascus steel barrels with gold-lined touch-holes, excellent bores (.590”/.590”), and which externally retain much of the original brown finish. Extremely high quality, mechanically perfect, locks with internal parts retaining most of the original fire blue color left from the final “drawing” or tempering required after quenching during the hardening process. Externally the locks retain much of the original finish even in the bottoms of the pans which show little evidence of use. Nicely engraved false breech with no corrosion whatever. Handsomely engraved fine silver mounts all in superb condition as is the highly figured American Walnut stock. Original horn-tipped ramrod with functional steel worm on the hidden end.

 B. & J. Cooper were set up at 19 Partition Street, New York, N.Y. from 1803 to 1831. They were primarily rifle and pistol maker’s and very highly regarded for their excellent workmanship, particularly for their dueling pistols some of which were silver mounted. This silver mounted double flintlock sporting gun we have here is the only example, of this quality, by this or any other American maker that I am aware of.

 It is interesting to note here that, during this same time period in England, the fitting out with silver mounts of a best British Double flint gun by Joseph Manton would have almost doubled the price of an already exorbitantly expensive firearm and I cannot think why it should have been any different on our side of the pond. Add to this the fact that silver, being much softer than steel, would not hold up near so well under the rigors of field use and it is easy to understand why there are so few surviving examples today.

 As a personal side note, I had the pleasure of using this magnificent little gun in the field many seasons ago and can attest to both the speed of the ignition and it’s effectiveness on doves at all but the most extreme ranges. Overall, an incredibly rare, quite possibly unique, wholly American sporting gun by a Best American maker and remaining in superb original condition throughout."

I am looking for farm land with a large hill to shoot into in an area that would not disturb neighbors or anyone hunting while shooting a 308 rifle. I would be interested in paying $300.00 per year for the right place. I am mainly concerned about safety and accessibility. I would prefer a place where I could bring my John Deere Gator to set and retrieve targets with.

I am 56 years old and have been hunting, trapping, fishing, reloading and shooting all of my life. I typically shoot with a friend so that we can spot our shots for each other. We are very responsible and would leave your property in as good or better shape than we found it in. I have no interest in shooting at anything other than my targets and if it is not perfectly safe, I will look elsewhere.

I am located near Brookville Indiana and would be willing to drive an hour or better for the opportunity to shoot. If you have a suitable place and would not mind giving a couple of down to earth, good guys a place to shoot, let me know. My name is David, thanks for looking."

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

Introduced in 2008, the P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30.
Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user.
Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt.
Extensively tested, the P30L model has been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.
