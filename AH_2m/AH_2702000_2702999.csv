I bought this rifle about a month ago and just don't have time to shoot it or room for it in my safe. I had planned on getting rid of another rifle in place of this one, however with it being brand new I figured I'd put this one up for sale instead. Aim Surplus has them listed at 529.99.. Which after tax, S&H etc. the price is right around 600. It is a great rifle and the reviews on these newer Gen 2's compare them with brands which are usually regarded as being much higher quality, also much higher price. Thanks for looking and don't hesitate to ask questions."

I shouldn't have to say this, but this is a 7.62x39 caliber rifle, not a 7.62x51 (.308 Winchester) I have had a ton of calls and texts asking for pics of my .308 AR, this is not a .308 AR, which would be an AR10. In comparison, you could call it an AR47, AR-47  because it is an AR chambered in the AK caliber

Can only send pics through text. Couldn't get them to load on here.

No box or papers included.

If you are looking for a great gun or just a good investment, you have found it in this Colt Diamondback. These guns are out of production and they are made by Colt, a combination that will only cause these guns to increase in value. Simply economics, supply and demand. There are no longer being made and they are in high demand = a great investment.

*Introducing AR MR2. This is a replacement to your current magazine lock or factory magazine catch we've developed  to address the latest round of bans in NY, MD, CT, and CA. It installs in about 5 minutes. 
*MR2 is made from 7075-T6 Aluminum anodized to Military Specifications. All materials are made with pride in the USA, by local manufacturers!
* This kit comes with complete installation instructions, and the work can be done by even the most novice of firearm owners
*MR2 creates a fixed magazine rifle or pistol that requires disassembly of the AR firearm action to release the magazine. While the firearm is assembled, the magazine is fixed in place
*Avoid costly registration, eventual confiscation, or prison by installing MR2. With MR2, you have a choice
Legal Disclaimers:
New York: We have received through our Counsel Max Tresmond verbal confirmation from the NYSP that AR MR2 is NY-SAFE compliant in either disassembled action or top-load configurations, and will not be subject to NY-SAFE registration. We are seeking to draw out a letter from NYSP documenting this opinion, but this would be the first time they have done so for any compliance product on the market.

I planned on using it for concealed carry, but would prefer something in 357 Sig. So, I decided to sell it to help fund the purchase of a pistol chambered in 357 Sig.

The date code on this Hk is KI. It comes in the original grey plastic case, with owner's manual, 2-8 round mags, and an extended floorplate for one of the mags. I also installed a factory Hk spurred hammer with the rubberized spur. I also have the original spurless hammer in the box that is included with it as well. The gun also has a Talon grip installed. It is easily removed, and won't leave any residue.

It is my understanding that the stainless slide version hasn't been made since 2002-2003.

My asking price is $800. 

I am looking to trade for a Hk P2000SK 357 Sig, or P239 SAS in 357 Sig. Let me know what you have. I may also be interested in other 357 Sig pistols. Let me know what you have. The worst I can say is no. 

If you are interested, contact me through the contact seller button. Thanks for looking."

Chambered for 2-3/4"" & 3"" shells.

The receiver is from a mid 1980's unfired 870. You will only find bluing of this quality on the Wingmaster. The internals of the action are from this same gun - unfired 1980's Remington Quality. Of course the extractor is the machined steel part like that used on the Police Model - not the molded metal extractor Remington uses on most of their 870's now. The trigger assembly is Metal - not the plastic unit that Remington uses to save $$.

The barrel is brand new from AI&P Tactical ( http://www.aiptactical.com ). It is the Remington Police barrel - 18-1/2"" Factory Parkerized with Factory fixed Improved Cylinder choke (to tighten up buckshot groupings) and a Tritium Front Bead Night Sight. The magazine follower is upgraded to the S&J Hardware Tactical unit.

The forend is a Hogue Overmolded Rubber unit. The butt stock is a Magpul SGA Adjustable Length of Pull unit. This has all of the factory inserts and original packaging included to adjust the fit to you. Both are in black. I think both of these items represent the ideal combination . . . the solid feel and ergonomics of the SGA combined with the simple rubbery grip and feel of the Hogue forend.

This was built to be a no compromise simple serious reliable effective weapon. None of the frills added to make it ""Tacticool"".

If you bought a Factory Police Model 870 and added the stock and forend and Tritium Night Sight, the cost will be $800-$900. Even then it may not be the quality of this mid 1980's unfired Remington action/receiver.

I will throw in 25 rounds of 00 buckshot as well.

All of this at a price not much more than the cheap 870 Express tactical. If you add the items I have on this gun to the Express, you will be into it for more money and it will not be of the same quality. The cheap finish Remington puts on the Express 870 now is prone to rust rather quickly. Take a look at this gun and see the quality that Remington once built into their product. You will be the envy of all your friends when they see this shotgun in your arsenal. Just smile and let them know . . . this is a gun they will not be able to duplicate . . . and it's yours."

As long as you get a good build, these things are as dependable as an Izhmash or an Arsenal. 

I picked this thing up last summer, didn't shoot it much (100-200 rounds maybe) but the irons on this thing are outstanding. 2 inch groups at 100yds. I always cleaned it religiously like any of my guns and with that said as I'm sure you can guess, the thing never malfunctioned once (fte/ftf/etc). Oh, and prior to buying it, I inspected the bolt carrier, bolt and main housing to insure all serials matched.

I think the price I am asking is a fair non-inflated price for one of these bad boys that is certainly going to outlive you. I'm not pressed for cash or anything so I won't respond to emails asking for a lower price.

It also has a Chromed-Lined Bolt Carrier and Gas Key, Staked Keyways, Hardened Back Retractor, Vltor Mil-spec buffer tube, Vltor Sling mount, Aftermarket buffer and aftermarket spring as well! This is a .556 barrel, NOT a .223. This is a great rifle!

The only reason I'm selling it, is because I need money to fix my truck. I've owned this rifle for about 2 years and I've got about 200 rounds through it TOPS! All together it has about 500 rounds through it. I've never had a jam, stove pipe, or anything along those lines. It chews up and spits out anything I feed it. All in All its truly a great gun!

If your an Idiot who doesn't realize what this gun is, or the Value of the parts I put into it, then DO NOT contact!

Professionally Cerakote by ACOATING in Peoria AZ, we put the same matte silver that the CZ custom shop uses on their Matt Stainless Parts.  

After the coating was applied it was taken to the CZ Custom Shop in Mesa AZ for their custom magic to take place.  They did the following: Replace all springs and checked all firing components and set the timing.  They tuned the trigger making it a dream to engage, not a bit of creep and smooth as silk.  They installed and fitted their competition hammer.  Installed a competition flat blade site on the rear and a tritium dot on the front.  

This firearm is a competitor or a great carry pistol.

It was one of only 200 imported by Springfield over 25 years ago.  It’s a 9mm Para semi-automatic.  Basically flawless condition.  Comes with the original Springfield serial numbered box and hard case.  Yes, all serial numbers match.  Also all the original documentation is included.  The original 25 round magazine plus five 32 round UZI magazines are also included. 

I bought the gun never fired a few months ago.  However the temptation to hear it make some noise was too great.  It’s had approximately 10 rounds through it a few weeks ago.  Functions flawlessly   and is truly a blast to shoot.

Would be one of the most significant and iconic pieces in anyone’s collection. 

Sale is not being forced in any way and I’ll keep it and love having it if no one is interested.  Just looking to diversify my collection a little.

Trades?  Likely not.  But would be interested in hearing about your reasonable offers on a low end non polymer lowered AR15, Beretta M9 Commercial, or name brand black 1911a1.  Offers would be trade plus cash on your end.  Please be reasonable and know that honestly I’d rather have the cash to buy exactly what I want rather than your trade that is likely only sort of what want.  Just like automobiles trade in value is less that retail value, sorry.

Sale locally is cash and gun must be transferred at an FLL local to me.  I would be willing to ship.  Cashers check must clear my bank before I ship and I’ll ship to your FFL who must email or mail me a signed copy of his FFL.  You know the drill.  Shipping would be $40 and I will box the original box so it stays in good condition.

Call or email with any questions.

It holds 6 rifles with room to store hundreds of rounds of ammunition and pistol hangers. It was designed to be mounted horizontally on a wall to save space, but it can also be mounted upright as well. It has bi-fold swing-down magnetic doors with glass windows. Inside diameter is 52""x24"", so larger scoped rifles and shotguns will fit. Guns fit in racks very nice and snug, eliminating chances for accidents. Mounts very securely to the wall. I call this child-proof, as it can be mounted out of their reach, and without the key and a latter, no child will find themselves getting into trouble. This cabinet offers as much or more protection from theft as other wood gun cabinets. It will fit very nice over a desk or work station. Innovative design allows for installation in small spaces. Lights can easily be mounted inside and underneath cabinet. Very stunning, very eye catching. It's my belief that if you invest the time and money into a great collection of firearms, You should also invest in a beautiful and secure storage/display cabinet. You wont find this cabinet anywhere else, for any cheaper than this! This particular cabinet is a demo piece, but is still very beautiful. Please contact with any questions you might have.

Great deal, just in a bind to get my car fixed for work and need the cash fast. Can do a NICS check about a minute up the road from my house, or will meet you somewhere. First one to get here gets it, great for plinking(if you can afford that) and very accurate with the sight for quick sight picture. Relatively lightweight with sling swivels.

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

ts straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action"

I received this pistol and the man who retrieved it for the battlefield had one hell of a story.
The gentleman's name was Earl M Blodgett.He was born in 1914.He lived in Los Angeles, California.
After one year of high school he was married.On 11 January 1943 he went in to the army as part of a quartermaster detachment.
This Spreewerks walther p38 was in the hand of a german officer who was standing in defiance as an explosive device ( didn't seem to remember what device )
detonated,and the resulting shrapnel annihilated the Nazi officer.The pistol was still in his hand when Earl took it from him and two drops of blood were on the right side of the slide that Earl never cleaned off.( to spots can be seen in the bluing)He took the man's sword as well but lost it after returning home in 1946.
As a result of the shrapnel,the trigger guard and trigger were damaged slightly.
This is one of the nicest WW2 Walther P-38's you will ever see.It is a Spreewerks GmBh pistol and has Black Bakelite Grips and the magazine that was in the pistol.
This is easily in the 95% range with no rust to speak of and the fact that it has the capture/ bring back paperwork and one hell of a back story,i think ,warrants an asking price of 1200.00 obo or trade.
Feel free to make offers of cash and/or trade,part trade
I hope that this will be the crown jewel of your military collection as well and that you will give it a good home.

Great little SxS here. These things are hard to find and I've seen them go for over $1,500... I'm getting rid of this one cheap for $1,100. A few little nicks from the safe, but nothing you would really notice. The 3"" chambers are real nice on this one. You can hunt almost anything with it except geese. I'll through in the case pictured, which is an expensive case by Baron Country."

--------------------
Pick up the new Winchester® SXP shotgun and experience the light weight, centered balance and instant pointability firsthand. The Super X design provides you with the fastest follow-up shots. No other pump offers the feeling of an inertia-assisted slide-action that can deliver three shots in a half second.  Four massive lugs provide support, strength and solid lockup in the receiver of the lightning-fast Super X® Pump. Under recoil the mass of your body begins to slow the rearward travel of the shotgun, while the inertia of the bolt, slide and forearm continue cycling the action to help you get a head start on your next shot. Dual steel action guide bars channel and eliminate twisting, binding, wasted time and energy when cycling the action.
