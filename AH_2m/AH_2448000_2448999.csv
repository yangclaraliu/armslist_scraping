It's designed specifically to float in the pocket or purse safely, and able to grab, point and shoot.  I did a lot of research and found this for my wife along with subcompact kimber, but my wife liked this more because it was simpler (all she wanted was a safe and reliable  gun she could point and shoot without thinking about it.

NFA REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, or photographs. 

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help.  Also, along with becoming a client, I will help you fill out Form 1, Form 4, etc.  I have also submitted these forms via the new ATF website and can advise you how to use the website (which I think can speed up the process).  Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- Instructions and ReadMe (4 pages)
- The Declaration of NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (16 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages)
- Assignment of Property (2 pages)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.

What sets the XDM apart from the regular XD models is the following:

(M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

(M)inimal Reset Trigger: The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Other companies are selling these for about 30 dollars a set but here we have them for half that and as many sets as you want. Will work with Daniel Defense, LWRC, LMT, and Larue to mention a few. Also Rock River, S&W, Colt, DPMS, Noveske, Alexander, Del-ton, CMMG, Armalite, Double Star, Mega Machine, Vltor and Knights.  These pins will work with all standard ""small pin "" .154 Lower receivers, regardless who makes them........ the majority of lowers have small pin holes. If you have anything but Colt, it is 99 percent chance you have small pins. 

There are tons of aftermarket parts and cosmetic improvements for these guns but Anti Walk pins are something that actually improves the overall performance. You are actually improving the weapon and not just making it look better. If you are going to spend money on your gun, make it count.

There is minimal wear, and no damage - condition is excellent.

Listing for the KelTec is here: http://tinyurl.com/kfoalo2

This gun comes with all the original accessories - two mags (15 rnd), speed loader, and hard plastic case.  

I did some light polishing on this gun, though out of the box this thing had zero issues and the machining and finishing looked great from the factory, so it probably didn't even need it. 
I polished the feed ramp and chamber to a high luster finish. 
Polished sharp edges where the chamber interfaces with slide. 
Polished the bore in the slide where the barrel interfaces. 
Polished the OD of the barrel.
Polished the areas of the spring block that interface with the chamber/barrel. 
Polished the inside top of the slide where the chamber rides. 
Polished the ""pin"" that the trigger rotates about and the mating bore it rotates within.

I have a tactical light I can throw in on a trade or package deal with the PF9 - or it can be had for an extra $20 on a cash deal."

Brown frame, blued slide. Has belt clip installed (in matching blued finish). 
Gun has been ""fluffed and buffed"" and operates MUCH better than new.

Looking for $300.

Selling only to fund purchase of a new gun.  
Also open to trade for a shotgun (12 through 20 gage), or a semi-auto rifle in 5.56 or 7.62 or other readily available caliber.  Let me know what you have.

Basically everything you get with the new gun, plus the belt clip. 

Also, I filed down the sharp edges on the ridges that are on the back of the grip.
This greatly improved comfort for me when shooting without gloves. Visually no different, simply more comfortable. 

Whats a ""fluff and buff""?
You can google it, but basically it is doing all the hand finish work that Kel-Tec does not do to keep prices down. This helps the gun operate smoother, giving better feel and (IMO) better accuracy and less perceived recoil. 
Here is what was done:
Polished feed ramp
Smoothed out machining and casting marks in areas of contact on slide and frame
Broke sharp edge at bottom of bore in frame where barrel rides and polished inside bore
Broke sharp edges where feed ramp meets frame
Polished slide rails
Polished outside of chamber where it slides against slide

I see some of the listings pulled the photos from forum.  Do not buy that.  I have the real rifle in hand.

Up for sale is the rare Larue Tacitical Costa Edition #317 from the latest batch release 251-375.  

http://www.laruetactical.com/costa-556?sort=popular

Total of 500 only with matching serial number for upper and lower will be made.  Next batch could be never or next year by Thanksgiving again.  Normal Larue OBR, PredatAR, PredatOBR have more than a year waiting list as of now.  This is your chance to own one of the rarest rifle from Larue without waiting.  

I installed the Larue Troy sights and shot 50 rounds using Federal AE223 and Lake City 5.56 green tip for evaluation.  I did mount a scope with Larue QD LT-104 to shoot as well and there are mount marks under the rail where it latched on but it's not visible if you mount something over it since an optic is preferred.

All the swag are there and not opened except I swapped the Magpul grip front panel with the indexed panel provided.  It does include the holiday dillo beverage entry tool and everything you see in the photo.  The grouping is .420 with 3 shots at 100 yards and I did produce similar results using non match ammo and it did still group matter than my other fancy rifle.

Unfortunately, I cannot keep the rifle due to other reason and I hate to part this limited rifle which I could never get again (let just say my boss said no).  This is your chance to own one of the best rifle Larue or anyone else has to offer.

Local inquiry preferred with DL and CCW a must.  Out of states will need to provide FFL and carry permit of your state along with driver license or identification.  Postal Money order only or I can take credit card also but I will have to charge you 3% through Square.  Once the fund is cleared I will send out the rifle to you.  I will pay for shipping to your FFL if out of state.

This is an SDS Warrior helmet in excellent condition, I'm not sure it's ever even been used by it's amazing condition.

The helmet will come with an ACU Digital Camo cover that is in excellent condition.  These are the same helmets currently being worn by our troops so you can be assured they are tough and extremely well made.

Usually helmets have been bounced around, have flaking paint and look used but this one is beautiful.  It has the single factory drilled front hole for mounting night vision equipment should you want to go full tactical or go hog hunting or for protecting your melon during tornado season.  The number one cause of death during a tornado are head injuries so this helmet is a multi-tasker that can save your life.  I collect helmets but we do use them during tornado season when needed.

In a bind (those of you with family during the holiday know what i mean) so I'm dropping this to $150 which is a great deal if you plan on using it or keeping it as a reminder of a loved one's service.  They don't come around in this condition very often so if you are considering such a thing this is an excellent one.
