I have two nice guns that shoot great that I don't need because I have other similar items.

#1 - Yugoslavian Mauser, model 24/47

This rifle was made in 1944, if I read the markings correctly, as a Model 24. It was updated after the war to the new standard, 24/47. It is very similar to the Yugo M48 and the German K98. It shoots 8mm Mauser, which is comparable to .30-06.

This particular rifle is a great shooter, very accurate and smooth. Everything's in good condition. I refinished the stock using Minwax Gunstock finish and Helmsman Spar Urethane, satin finish. The metal parts have all been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated. To be honest, it's more fun to shoot than my K98, but I don't need both.

Price for rifle alone: $290
** This is the price in the listing. This price does not include the ammunition or the pistol **

Also pictured: Yugoslavian early 1950s military surplus ammunition. 150 rounds. It shoots great in this rifle, never a problem. It also works in any other 8mm Mauser, but if your firing pin spring is weak, it may not fire every time. It fires every time in the 24/47. Powerful and accurate. Comes with 10 stripper clips, which work flawlessly. $60.

Price for rifle + ammunition: $330


#2 - Hungarian-made Browning Hi Power lookalike, FEG P9R

Want a Hi Power-type gun for half the price (or less) of a Browning? Or, just want a full-size steel service pistol in 9mm? This Hungarian pistol is a pleasure to shoot and is in great shape. It looks and functions like a Hi Power. I should note, it's not parts-compatible with a Hi Power, since the barrel lockup is different. Magazines may be compatible, you'd have to verify.

If you're not familiar with the Browning Hi Power that this gun looks like, a lot of people think it's the finest 9mm pistol ever made. It was created by John Moses Browning, the inventor of the Colt 1911, and shares a lot of concepts with the 1911. Many countries have used Hi Powers as military sidearms. During WWII, both Britain and Germany used them for certain units (the Germans captured a Browning factory in Belgium). Of course, my specific gun is a Hungarian one made much later, so it has little or no historical value itself, but it's a classic design.

This particular gun has great bluing, nice wood grips, no damage or flaws. Shoots great. Comes with two factory magazines and the original styrofoam box liner. Someone painted the sights with glow in the dark paint. If exposed to light, they'll glow for hours. They're not as good as night sights, but they're not bad. If you don't like that, you can remove the paint easily and put white dots or whatever you want on it.

Price for pistol, two magazines, styrofoam box liner: $390

About me: middle-aged CCW holder who enjoys shooting and the history related to guns.
I purchased both guns from FFL dealers. Prices are pretty firm.

Buyer requirements:

- Valid Virginia driver license
- Strong preference given to buyers with concealed carry permits
- I reserve the right to refuse to sell if I have any reason to believe there's anything sketchy

For those of you who have bought Polish AK Receiver tubes from Sportsman's Guide you probably already know the spot treating method a lot of builders use is inadequate and won't hold up. A full heat treat is required.

For those of you have built off of 4130 flats, spot heat treating will work, but a full heat treat results in a much stronger receiver.

The blanks I heat treat have been Rockwell tested to 40. This is the same hardness I understand No Dak Spud treats their receivers to and is well within the acceptable range of 37 to 44. I can heat treat up and down a bit within that scale to suit your needs but it is safest to remain in the middle. I also treat rails.

Pricing (if you provide me your rails and blanks) is $30 per receiver and $10 per rail set. I can also sell (using my rails and blanks) for $60 per receiver and $25 per rail set.

The pic below shows an untreated Polish blank on top, a heat treated Polish blank in the middle and a set of heat treated rails. It should be noted these are not considered firearms until you start drilling to fit your parts kit. Your final heat treated part will have carbon scale on it. This can be sanded away with minimal effort and if you do it right will provide a good base for your final finish be it blue, cerakote, durakote, etc."

With a timeless beauty that’s more than skin deep, the BLR Lightweight ’81 Take-down is ready and waiting to be your next lever-action hunting rifle. The gloss finish on the Walnut straight grip stock contrasts beautifully with the deeply polished blue finish on the receiver and the barrel. This is what a serious lever-action rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was. Now it's even easier to hike or ride in deep where the big ones hide. With the flip of a switch the BLR is in two easy to carry pieces. 

• The button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.
• Every BLR barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
• The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
• The barrel’s standard sights include a Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility front blade with gold bead fitted on a raised ramp-style base.?
• The richly blued steel finish on all external surfaces is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
• The aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.
• The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.
• The BLR has a rotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.
• The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.
• The BLR has a recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.
• The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.
• The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.
• The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.
• The BLR’s trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.
• The fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.
• The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.
• Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.
• Magazine capacity is 3 rounds
• The BLR’s stock is sculpted from fine Walnut and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip.
• The straight grip BLR stock is true to the classic lines of the lever action rifle and has a traditional carbine strap at the fore-end.
• The BLR’s stock has a deep, glossy finish that brings out every nuance of the wood’s warm color and grain.
• The well-formed recoil pad helps reduce felt recoil and flinching.
• Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod"

This rifle is basically new, has a bull barrel and is threaded so you could install a suppressor on it if desired. 

I will consider breaking up rifle to sell: Rifle $575 , Optics $500 , Rings and Rail $230

I sighted it in (10 shots) and after that range trip I cleaned, oiled and stored it. After that I pulled the trigger 4 times and brought home 4 deer. It was cleaned and oiled after each time it was fired after that first range trip. If you are not familiar with the manufacturer of the rail, rings and optics - these are some great quality products and can be researched online. I had intended to do some long range shooting but never got around to it.

I have about $1600 into this rifle. (Rifle ~$700, rail and rings ~$330, optic ~$600). Whoever ends up with this rifle for this price will also end up with a smile on their face.

I have for sale a BNIB LWRC SPR that I just recently purchased.  While waiting for the order to be filled, I was able to purchase the same rifle in FDE cerakote.  I don't need two of these top notch firearms and this is the reason I'm selling this one.  I'm not looking to make money off this, I'm simply looking to get what I paid for it back.  I have the receipt which I will gladly show you.  I did receive a discount for military/police/fire/ems.  I called LWRC & was told the MSRP on this rifle is $2,600 just for the rifle package w/o the extras I received.  I am selling this with the same items that were included in my package price.

Rifle in box with REPR rail kit, adjustable stock, Magpul MIAD adjustable grip, & flip up sights, Froglube libricant & cleaning solvent, Magpul Gen3 Pmags (2 of them w/a coupler plus the Gen2 Pmag from LWRC), Hornady 55 gr tap ammo (20 rounds) & Remington 55 gr FMJ ammo (40 rounds) (ammo is all factory new - no reloads).

I have additional Magpul Gen3 Pmags BNIP & Magpul couplers if interested in purchasing additional of these items or switching items out.  Everything is brand new, never used, never fired, never taken outside, and has all been stored properly in my gun safe since picking them up.  

I appreciate your time and interest in this posting and I'm looking for serious buyers.  I am selling because I want to not because I need to, and the price is set.  Please don't waste my time or yours asking what I'll take or haggle over price.  NO TRADES.  I will only ship to an approved FFL and will not send/sell these items where illegal or to anyone that cannot legally own them.  I will accept cash or money order for payment & shipping will be at your expense through UPS.  I don't check my email daily and the best/fastest way to reach me is by phone/text - Jason REDACTED.  Thank you again for your interest, Take Care & God Bless!

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

Info from Sig...

Sig Sauer 7 + 1 Round 380 ACP w/Night Sights/Two Tone Finish

The Sig Sauer P232 is Sig's smallest and lightest pistol. Chambered in
.380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 is one of
the most reliable back up pistols available with a well earned reputation
as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth
contours and rounded, snag free edges make it ideal for personal
protection. It's the pistol's small size that makes it easy to carry
concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the
outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting
even in large hands. At under 18oz in the blued version, the sleek single
stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it's one of
the premier off duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement
professionals today. Supplied with (2) 7 round magazines."

I will tell you that I hate the standard 6 positon Ar stock. I am 6'4"" and have orangutan arms, so that short stock just never worked well for ME. What I like about this is that is also comes with a rubber butt pad that adds an extra 1/2"" along with 8 positions. It is a sturdy stock and has a decent cheek weld(but you can purchase a riser). Now that I am done with my opinion, I will give you the factory specs..lol

•Eight position collapsible stock for AR style rifles provides one of the longest length of pull on the market with a fixed cheek piece for a constant and repeatable cheek weld in any of the eight stock positions.
•Once the butt is locked into position, the F93 has the feel of a fixed stock without the rattling and movement shooters are used to.
•Includes an overmolded carbine length buffer tube, standard castle nut and ambidextrous sling plate.
•Includes rubber-like recoil pad for enhanced comfort and secure, positive placement.
•Includes 2 quick detach sling attachment points, 3 web sling attachment points and 2 sling hook attachment points.

I purchased this AR & the accessories brand new from the local Gander Mountain to give as a gift for my elderly father-in-law. 
He looked at it for a day then stored it in his climate controlled rifle safe without ever using it. He never fired it or even removed it from his home. He recently passed-away & left the rifle to me.
The rifle is still unfired & is exactly as new

The actual retail price of the Armalite AR15 and the included accessories using Gander Mountain retail pricing is $3100 

The included accessories and details are as follows:

EOTech FTS/QR (Flip-to Side / Quick-Release) Magnifier mount. 
•	For close quarters work the FTS / QR mount allows the entire 4X magnifier unit to be flipped to the side & fully out of the firing line of sight via the activation of a small lever allowing the spring-loaded flip base to operate. The activation of the single QR lever allows the 4X magnifier to be instantly removed from the rifle, then reinstalled with no disruption to targeting line of sight
•	Both the 4X Magnifier and the FTS / QR mount are manufactured from 100% high quality Aluminum alloys.

Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Highly Accurate

The accuray and flat trajectory of the 5.7x28mm cartridge gives a high hit probability up to 50m.

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.
High Capacity Magazine

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine.
Extremely Light and Ergonomic

The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Well-balanced, with smooth contours and no protruding parts, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol will instinctively be handled correctly and is extremely easy to use.
Fully Safe

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing."

Beautiful Magpul Desert Sand and OD Green finish. A Italian Made “Wonder 9” for the Israeli Mossad, who functions somewhat like the American CIA, or Britain’s MI5. The gun is chambered in 9mm; the odds on favorite handgun caliber for the world’s militaries. Even in these days of skyrocketing prices, 9mm ammunition is still, comparatively speaking, inexpensive.  On the slide, the two ""Stars of David"" flank the word ""Mossad"" on either side, and are etched in Desert Sand…..no composite here.  1-15 round magazine. The actual pistol is pictured. Condition is used, very good to excellent. Bright shinny bore. Fixed sights & reversible magazine release. Accurate & reliable shooter. See pictures. $460.00  TN tax and BGC apply.

ArchAngel -- adjustable tension sidesaddle

I'm a shotgun guy.  I love pump-actions.  I especially love Mossberg 500.

This is by far my favorite setup.  First off, the 20in cylinder bore barrel gives the shooter a nice sight radius and shot pattern.  The matching length magazine tube, not only looks good, but provides an additional 7 rounds at your immediate disposal.  I added the ArchAngel sidesaddle for quick reloads.  This model is superior to many others in that it provides 360* capture of each round in addition to the adjustable retention device.  Finally, after much trial and error, I equipped this shotty with the Hogue Overmold stock set.  The stocks feel good in your hand, and the recoil pad on the buttstock is comparative to a Kickeez or Limbsaver brand.  The various pistol grip setups for the Mossberg 500 always feel awkward when disengaging the safety, and the felt recoil was enough to rattle my teeth with the collapsible buttstock.  If you're hell bent on a pistol grip setup, get an 870.  Otherwise, if you're looking for a Badazz Tactical, HD or, EOTW shotgun, then this is it.

Price includes the shotgun, 50 Federal 12ga shells, and Allen shell holder belt

What is also desirable about this particular one is that it is a first-year manufacture and does not have the eyesore ""manufacturer warnings"" etched into the frame on later models.

I'm asking $550 face-to-face in the north Dallas area.  I'll also consider trades on quality semi-auto pistols, preferably in 9mm or 45 ACP.

It is being sold as-is where is (in Benson, NC). I have a clean and clear title in hand.  I am asking $700 cash. That is the firm cash price, no negotiation.  I am more flexible with trades and such. I no longer have any need for the truck, was going to make it a 350/383 conversion but funds and willpower tightened up. I never even got around to pulling the motor.

It is a short cab, long bed, 2 wheel drive, with the 2.8L motor and an automatic transmission. This truck is by no means perfect, but at $700 you can't expect much. It is a good body and frame for a V8 conversion, or a good frame (with a title) to stick under your rat rod. The truck does crank and the transmission pulls. However, the engine does smoke, and leaks some oil. If left in the truck, I would go through the seals, etc before driving much. To my knowledge the transmission shifts, etc without problem. The body itself does have a spot of rust on the passenger side, and a ding on the driver door, but nothing that is beyond repair. The tires are dry rotted and the hood latch does need a new cable also. The truck can possibly be driven locally, however trailer/towing would probably be a better option.

You can reach me by email primarily.  I do have access to a notary and am more than willing to give a bill of sale and title."

Unfired by me, or anybody else except from the factory. I just got this gun out of layaway a couple of weeks ago. With night sights, checkered mainspring housing, ambidextrous safety, adjustable match trigger, etc., hardcase, and everything that came with the gun from the factory (i.e., holster, magazine holder, warranty papers, cleaning brush, ALS keys, and owner’s manual). Gun has factory wood grips, but I installed a brand new set of VZ G10 Operator II grips ( on it right now – pictured). I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60), and a box of 50rds FMJ ammo along with the gun. I like the gun, but it is too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice. Must be 21 years old or older to buy/trade this gun, and must also be a Kentucky resident and have at least a valid KY driver’s license. Local KY sale/trade only. No shipping, or out of state sale, don’t ask. Thanks for looking.

– $1,100 obo, or trade -
    ($1,040 = without the VZ G10 grips)

The GLOCK 26 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the ""BABY GLOCK""-the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the G26 Gen4's frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.
