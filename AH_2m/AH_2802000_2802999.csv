This is a WWII vet bring back Mauser in pretty good shape.  Manufactured in 1943 at the Waffen Werke Brunn factory during the war.  It is not a numbers matching rifle as most are not.  This is NOT a Russian capture rifle.  Repro sling...too good to be original.  Not sure about the cleaning rod.  Bolt and front band do not match serial number.  Several waffenkampf markings here and there.  Laminated stock is good shape except for some bings and bangs.  Same for handguard though there is a tight crack along the top about 3 inches long.  Bore is a little dark...rifling is strong.  I have never attempted to fire it though don't see why it would be a problem...probably should have headspace checked first.  Not interested in any trades.  Will consider a reasonable cash offer.  Not cash strapped and do not have to sell.  Would like to see it appreciated down the road.  Asking $750.  Have a few more pics if u r interested.

This gun looks great and shoots even greater. With the 4"" barrel it is balanced very well and you can't believe the accuracy on this baby. Of course, it's a Smith so the trigger action smooth and the cylinder locks up tight. 

The target picture is from today (3/12/14) and as you can see she shoots great both with .357 and .38 special. All shots are 6 shots in one turn at 7 yards (21 feet) at an indoor range. Tight lockup and smooth trigger action. She's awesome. You'll definitely love this classic revolver.

This is one of the first gen models as I was one of the early pre-orders and waited nearly 9 months for this awesome little piece of kit.  Had it paired up with an older model 10/22 and a Green Mountain bull barrel, but it comes with adapters to use a standard barrel as well.  Stock is in very good condition with only light scuffs and comes with all required installation hardware as well as a few custom modifications.  I switched out the trigger bar spring as well as the trigger safety “blade” spring for a lighter trigger pull.  The original springs are included. I also applied graphite to the trigger bar and performed a red color fill job on the RJF logo.  Stock also comes with 2 Magpul MOE rail sections for the front sides.   I absolutely love this stock and am only selling it to fund another project. I am asking $300 but am also open to the following trades, cash included depending on value: Any of these in 308: Savage 10/11, Remington 700, Stevens 200, Savage Axis, prefer something that is cheap and beat up as this will be a project gun and everything will probably get replaced.  I will also help you install this on your 10/22.  Linked below is the YouTube video that has the installation instructions. Feel free to contact me with questions at 3one6-two13-six3four5.  Texting is preferred because I am usually at work.  Thanks for looking!

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. You can assemble the target in under 2 minutes and it completely disassembles, without the use of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial models have to be assembled with bolts and nuts and are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and .22 Magnum rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50.

I know it will take a special buyer.  I have included a link to an article from Shooting times about the gun.  Below is an excerpt from that article. This is not a 52-1 or 52-2... The 52 no dash was the only gun to go through rigorous testing before it left SW.  Do not low ball me.  Do not waste my time.


According to History of Smith & Wesson by S&W historian Roy Jinks, “To insure the accuracy of the pistol, extra rigid inspection was incorporated by having the Model 52 machine rest tested at 50 yards to insure that the pistol would shoot five-shot groups having maximum spread of two inches. Any pistol that could not meet this standard was returned to production for reworking.”

Insistence upon such tight tolerances meant that production was slow, and only 3,500 units were produced by 1963.

The performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556. The Russian SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate.   

The ""Russian"" version comes in 7.62 x 39. The 556 Russian SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Russian SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. The quad rail front end has loads of space to add whatever type of lasers, lights or sights that you may want or need.   

I bought this rifle last summer along with (8) additional Tapco Polymer magazines.  I have used (4) of the mags to test their functionality while the other (4) are still in their original packaging.  I am also including the original factory magazine bringing the total number to nine.  

It packs a lot of punch with the 7.62 x 39 / AK 47 round whose ballistics are almost identical to the much more expensive .300 aac blackout.  It eats up any kind of ammo you throw at it thanks to its piston driven system.  Unlike the AR 15's direct impingement system that vents into the open block the piston system can run ""dirty ammo"" with little fear of gumming up the works.  

The side folding stock allows this rifle to close down to a compact 26"" length. The design allows operation with the stock open or closed.  When it is closed, this rifle is great in confined spaces. It comes standard with a ""One Point Sling"" attachment point to enhance its versatility.  

I have added a UTG aluminum fore grip which has a waterproof storage accessible by unscrewing the bottom.  The fore grip is attached to the forward quad rail via a quick release cam lever.     

For optics, I have added a Holographic Reflex 552 Sight.  The reticle is the ""Dot in Circle"" style that is switchable from Red to Green with adjustable brightness.  

The rifle also has A.R.M.S. front and rear BUIS (back up iron sights).  These are super low profile so they stay out of the way when not in use. The metal aperature on the back sight is selectable between a large close quarters opening or a small pin hole opening for longer ranges.  

The iron sights perfectly ""Co-Witness"" with the holographic sight.  The tip of the front post has the appearance of being illuminated when you are viewing the iron sights with the reflex sight turned on.  

I have the original box, manual, and pad lock. I am also throwing in the woodland camo (4) AK magazine pouch seen in the picture.  

I am selling this beautiful piece of Swiss Steel because I have a new baby on the way.  I am not interested in trades.    $1450 for the rifle and accessories. Cash Only - FTF transactions. I am not interested in any trades.  

I also have about 1800 rounds of 7.62 x 39 steel case ammo available for sale.  Ask me about a package deal with the rifle."

Purdey enthusiasts speak of guns built ""between the wars"" as most sought after. It is also well known that by the 1990's the English gun trade was again flourishing and at its finest, and Purdey was still the best of the BEST. And of course there are some benefits of the later guns such as production methods, improved steels, and the more modern man's appetite for the finest wood. These guns are no exception. Built in 1996 for a gentleman that is likely Purdey's largest North American client, they are perfection exemplified. The client demanded the finest workmanship and the finest figured wood. He is also an avid shooter, so the guns do have very minor signs of being shot; they are not closet queens. However, they are magnificent, with very high factory original condition. The guns are cased in a Purdey motor case. The case needs some attention to bring back to new condition, but it is all cosmetic and can be completed as part of this purchase. Buying a pair of fine Purdey shotguns is an excellent investment, as the value of the used pair will continue to go up with the cost of a new pair. Presently it would cost nearly $250,000 to purchase this pair new. These can be had for a small fraction of that cost. BECAUSE THE GUNS ARE A TRUE MATCHED PAIR, I WILL BE DESCRIBING AND SHOWING PHOTOS OF GUN #1, WITH A SINGLE PHOTO OF THE GUNS SIDE BY SIDE. DETAILS AND PHOTOS OF GUN #2 ARE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST, BUT THEY ARE IDENTICAL IN ALL PERTINENT AREAS, INCLUDING CONDITION.

Had this bike for about a year has been recently painted.  Runs great, still looks sharp.  New battery and oil change. Has been garaged since I have owned. Mainly used it to train on now that I feel comfortable I am getting rid of it.  Would like to trade for firearms/ ammo.  Looking for a decent/lower end AR-15.  But I will consider all trades concerning firearms, worst thing I can say is no.  If you prefer also open to cash offers.  Not sure what it is worth.  So again feel free to make offers.  Bike is located in New Philadelphia, OH (44663).  Will have to make arrangements to view.  Please email/text pictures of possible trades.  If Bike is still listed it is still available.  Thanks

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. You can assemble the target in under 2 minutes and it completely disassembles, without the use of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial models have to be assembled with bolts and nuts and are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and .22 Magnum rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50.

Uppers are factory built with an FN cold hammer forged chrome-lined 5.56 barrel with PSA bolt carrier groups (Per PSA, bolts are made of Mil-spec shot-peened Carpenter 158 steel. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside, and chrome lined inside). Lower build kits are factory new - I haven't even opened the bags on them. PSA is currently selling the uppers for $500 plus $15 shipping (but they are out of stock) and the lower build kits for $180 plus $7 shipping. Buy one of these sets and all you have to do is add your stripped lower for a complete AR pistol.  $500 FIRM face to face in Hickory, NC for everything.  Or, $450 for just the upper and $110 for just the build kit.  Plus, you get to have it now, rather than waiting 4 weeks or more for PSA to fill your order.  NOT INTERESTED IN LOWER OFFERS OR TRADES.

Have a few sets to sell. Will go by time stamp of unconditional ""I'll Take It"" messages. Questions welcome.

Thanks for looking!"

Offered for your consideration is one (1) Sako Model S491 Vixen, bolt action rifle, chambered in the .22 PPC, (Palmisano & Pindel Cartridge), center fire caliber. The 22 PPC cartridge is an excellent bench rest cartridge that has boasted an impressive performance increase over the older bench rest cartridges. Not only was the 22 PPC cartridge great for bench rest competitions, it also is a very deadly cartridge for varmint use. Because of the efficient design of the overall cartridge, it falls in between the 223 and the 22-250 cartridges when compared in performance. 

This Sako was manufactured in 1992, shortly after Sako changed their model and stamp designations from AI to S491. It is in as close to like new condition as one would expect from a 22 year old rifle. I honestly believe that it would be extremely difficult to find this model rifle in better condition. I would be very comfortable in stating that it would be classified, using NRA Modern Standards of condition, as close to “Perfect” as one could expect to find. 

Sako rifles are known for their crisp triggers, well-fitted parts, and honest minute-of-angle accuracy. A successor to the A-I, the S491 has a larger diameter bolt and action and a non-integral recoil lug.

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. You can assemble the target in under 2 minutes and it completely disassembles, without the use of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial models have to be assembled with bolts and nuts and are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and .22 Magnum rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50.

If you're out of the area and want this shipped to you then you can send a payment through paypal, quick pay, or send a check (must clear before the item ships).

The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations. 

This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle. As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops.With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle.

The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages.
1. Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.
2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation."

It was June 27, 1874 at Adobe Walls on the Canadian River in the Texas panhandle. Young Billy Dixon and 27 Buffalo hunters were suddenly surrounded by more than 500 Kiowa and Comanche warriors.

When Dixon fired his Sharps sporting rifle and knocked a Kiowa from his horse at 1538 yards (7/8 mile), the Indians departed with haste.

All ingredients are produced in the USA using a proprietary formula. It is a non-toxic substance that dissolves carbon on contact. It has a heavy specific gravity, which enables it to ‘season’ the metal by absorption deep into the pores. Using FROGLUBE results in a durable dry slick wax-like surface that reduces friction, eliminates fouling, and destroys rust. FROGLUBE is safe for plastic, urethane, nylon, and wood. FROGLUBEwill give your weapon many extended years of service.

The rifle is pretty decent but the bluing is wearing off the receiver and there is some flash rust showing. The rifle comes with a chrome lined barrel, a red Romanian SAR-1 hardwood furniture, slant brake, red Romanian Bakelight pistol grip, Romanian leather sling and a Romanian 30 rd steel magazine with Finnish floorplate.

I'll also toss in an extra Romanian Bakelight grip, one U.S. made parts grip, a green Chinese Canvas sling and the original Baltic laminated wood furniture. 

Its a nice rifle for an AKM. I've mainly used it for steel plinking (out to 300m). I haven't made the last windage adjustment that I needed to. It would make a great 30 cal. feral pig shooter.
