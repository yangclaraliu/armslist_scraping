1,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2710001,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE 44 MAG. - 225 gr. Barnes XPB 1500 fps - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 41,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 18, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=319

This is an incredibly accurate, full power 44 Mag., lead free load. The long-for-weight all copper bullet uses up the limited powder capacity of the case and keeps us from driving the bullet any faster than we are currently doing.

This 44 mag. load will work great and give adequate penetration for hunting big game species up to about 350 lbs. Since the bullet weight is relatively light, this load only generates moderate recoil.

At Buffalo Bore we always use real over-the-counter firearms to develop our published velocities. We believe the long time industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to achieve exaggerated published velocities is unfair to the customer as he/she will never be able to duplicate such laboratory type velocities in the real world, where it matters. Note our real world velocities below.

1676 fps -- Marlin 1894, 18 inch barrel
1475 fps -- Ruger Super Blackhawk, 5.5 inch barrel

Hey everyone, 
So i've decided to possibly part with my Like New NAA Revolver. It is the model that comes with both eh 22 magnum and the 22 LR cylinders so it is like having two guns in one. It also will come with all the original paperwork, warranty cards, case, and lock. I also am including 40 rounds of Speer Gold-Dot Personal protection 22 mag ammo that is specifically optimized for short barreled guns. Also it has a small silicone cylinder cover that is great if you want to keep both mags loaded as it keeps the round from falling out. This is the model with the 1 1/8 barrel and is 5 shot. It has had 10 22mag rounds shot through her and probably 150 lr through her with no issues. About the only thing she needs is a good cleaning. This is tiny little revolver that is awesome for conceal carry. Im only selling it because Ive found another toy im wanting to get. Bill of sale required on this one
Thanks all!"

Comes with One(13) round Magazine. This is a great weapon that can easily be converted into an SBR with the addition of a stock and appropriate class 3 approval. This auction does not include a stock this auction only includes the pistol and magazines no stock as we are not a class 3 dealer. From the Factory: Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the KRISS System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time. Developed over a 5-year period in cooperation with the US Army ARDEC Picatinny Arsenal, the KRISS system has been designed and proven to meet or exceed the requirements of today’s changing tactical challenges. Due to its small platform envelope and light weight, the KRISS is easily deployed in CQB and mobile tactical situations; it can be quickly and effectively deployed from behind a patrol vehicle steering wheel, covert-carried or by mounted units storing easily in a saddlebox. With its hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge, the KRISS provides in-close knock-down power at 1200 rounds-per-minute and 6” groups at stand-off distances of 100m....all with no worries about over-penetration risks and the confidence of single-fire. The KRISS Vector is built to rugged MILSPEC standards and features simple and robust moving parts. With the removal of only 4 pushpins, the KRISS field strips in 7 seconds...no tools required."

Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

MAKE: MK or EAGLE (made in China)
DRAW WEIGHT: 180 lbs.
TYPE: Recurve style crossbow with fold-away limbs (for easy transport)

This crossbow was bought by my son and was hardly used. He wanted it but then found it to be a problem to be shooting in his apartment complex, so it was given to me and I definitely have no need for it. This crossbow comes equipped with a CENTERPOINT 4X32 mil-dot scope (retails alone for over $45.00) and low profile scope rings (already mounted but never sighted in). Also is included the original rear sight aperature which can be re-mounted (after removing the scope). This process is simple and instructions can be found on YOUTUBE.COM or I can simply guide you through it. Another modification is the extended buttstock (made of steel). This too can be removed and the crossbow can be brought to orginal specs. This buttstock modification was fabricated to be utilized with the scope as it pulls the shooter's eye position back from the scope, enough for a clear view through the scope without distortion.


BROWN CROSSBOW

This crossbow was one of those kits that can be purchased and manufactured in your garage (if you are equipped with wood tools). I do not know the draw weight but surely it isn't that of the above mentioned crossbow. If I was to ""guesstimate,"" I would put it around 70 to 80 pounds of draw weight. The bow is also a recurve style made of metal and the bow-string is made of steel cable (which all came part of the kit). This is a tough beast that can really endure time. It's been in one of my closets for a few years now and it too is not needed (since I have my hunting crossbows). 


Also included in this package is 15 aluminum crossbow bolts (all either brand new or close to being brand new). 

This whole package is up for sale for a total of $140.00 OBO (cash). If you wish to trade for this package, I will make the $140.00 range FIRM. I am not interested in animals, electronics, tattoos, services around the house or vehicles, or junk.

This crossbow was one of those kits that can be purchased and manufactured in your garage (if you are equipped with wood tools). I do not know the draw weight but surely it isn't that of the above mentioned crossbow. If I was to ""guesstimate,"" I would put it around 70 to 80 pounds of draw weight. The bow is also a recurve style made of metal and the bow-string is made of steel cable (which all came part of the kit). This is a tough beast that can really endure time. It's been in one of my closets for a few years now and it too is not needed (since I have my hunting crossbows). 


Also included in this package is 15 aluminum crossbow bolts (all either brand new or close to being brand new). 

This whole package is up for sale for a total of $140.00 OBO (cash). If you wish to trade for this package, I will make the $140.00 range FIRM. I am not interested in animals, electronics, tattoos, services around the house or vehicles, or junk. I am interested in trades for ammo (.22 long rifle, 9mm, .40, .45 ACP, 7.62X39, and/or 5.56/.223).

Interested parties can contact or text me at 505 three six two 3174."

On the stock, I have weaved a shell holder out of one continuous piece of paracord, and makes for a very comfortable cheek weld. The lever has also been wrapped with paracord to match. The stock has also been sprayed with bedliner for added grip. All the internals and mating metal surfaces have been smoothed out and polished so the action is nice and slick. I have added an XS lever rail and XS Ghost ring sights, but I can put the factory sights back on if requested. This Marlin has been a fun project, and shoots fantastic, but I'm starting a new one, and want to see this go to a good owner. The bluing is near perfect, and there are no marks of abuse anywhere.

The Shield was made 1/9/14 according to the spent shell casing included. It came from the factory with a flush seven-round mag and an eight-round extended mag. I am including three additional flush and one additional extended mag, a total of six magazines. 

It has installed the APEX duty/carry sear kit with the additional springs. It was installed by a professional gunsmith in Wichita and it really runs like a top.

This is from the APEX website: The APEX Shield Carry Kit  (SCK) was designed to provide the M&P Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent 5 - 5.5 lb trigger pull with the advantages of shorter over-travel and more detectable trigger reset. 

Everything is like new, which for the gun and mags would run about $600. With this pistol you get the APEX sear and carry kit and gunsmithing for free, worth $125. No trades, thanks anyway."

Pistol is chambered in 7.62X54R. Unlike a regular PSL, this can handle all X54R ammo, including heavy ball.
This was built from some of the finest components available, DEZ Arms adjustable gas block, this allows you to fine tune the gas system to the ammo your shooting.
Tactical solutions oversize mag release, Easy mag changes even with gloves.
SOLID rear trunnion. ever see those wimpy rear trunnions on AK rifles and pistols?
This does NOT have a problem with that. You will take more of a beating than this trunnion will.
The guide rod is the rod, inside a rod type. This makes for a smoother action.
Front site block is a NEW Bulgarian one. I had this one installed to stabilize the front of the barrel better.
3 different muzzle devices as pictured. Including a fake suppressor type, that if permanently attached with a added buttstock, would make this into a legal rifle if so desired, instead of a pistol.
Firearm is painted in Alumahyde II, and comes with 2 mags, a bulldog drag bag and 200 rounds of light ball ammo.
Total round count is under 30 rounds

This was custom machined and aligned by one of the best AK builders out there. final assembly was done locally by a PSL specialist in Tampa that is known to create his own parts if needed. (none were needed in this build)

This is an incredible pistol, less that a half dozen are around that were built. With supplies of parts drying up, there may not be another chance to own one of these again.
I am open to offers, prices are negotiable."

I have owned it for 6 years. It is in good condition. It is sighted in for 100 yards at 0. It is EXTREMELY accurate. From what I hear about this particular model of rifle, I have one of the really good ones. I always hit what I am aiming at - you could drive nails at 350 yards with it. I consistently come away with a 1 inch group at 300 yards.

It is a bolt-action rifle, with a 4-round magazine. It is comfortable to shoot, and has a polymer stock, so its easy to hold onto even when its raining. Easy cleaning - flip up the bolt release lever and the bolt slides right out. The trigger pull is decent for an inexpensive hunting rifle.

The scope is a 50mm Vortex Crossfire, with 6-24x optical zoom, and illuminated mil-dots. Add a bi-pod to this rifle, and you'd have a great sniper rifle. The scope is fantastic, and, though it was already a VERY accurate rifle, has increased the accuracy dramatically. I took a picture of some trees through the scope, which are 1.32 miles away, and then took a picture of the same area outside the scope for perspective.

The scope has a lifetime replacement warranty - even if you drop it and break the lenses, they will replace it. Incredible optics.

I always cleaned it religiously like any of my guns and with that said as I'm sure you can guess, the thing never malfunctioned once (fte/ftf/etc). Oh, and prior to buying it, I inspected the bolt carrier, bolt and main housing to insure all serials matched.

PredatAR® 5.56 Overview

 The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

 The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

 The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

 Both models come with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger.

 (Iron Sights, Optics and QD mounts not included in price)
 Base model includes black Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip, 1 Aluminum Magazine, 1 Rail Strip, and A2 Flash Hider

Fantastic gun. I have 2.

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

The bolt and action are in superb appearance and function flawlessly. This is a seriously accurate shooter!

There is no cleaning kit in the stock, but the gun does have the original sling that was first issued with the rifle.

I actually live south of Gettysburg but over the MD line.  Thanks to our elected officials I can no longer sell this rifle in MD so am listing it in PA and VA.  Since it will technically be an interstate sale the purchase will have to be transferred through an FFL regardless of your state's laws.

This a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Beretta J92M9A0M M9 9mm LTD 15+1 4.9"" Synthetic Black Grip Bruniton Barrel
From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women
of the U.S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two
decades of distinguished service and reliability. The Commercial M9 pistol
is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.
This M9's distinctive military-style markings on various components closely
resemble those of the M9 pistols used by the U.S. Armed Forces, and its
""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the military M9. These two
features as well as the unique M9-prefixed serial number set this
Commercial M9 apart from the Beretta 92 FS pistol.
