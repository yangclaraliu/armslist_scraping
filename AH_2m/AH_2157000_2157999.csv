It has a 26"" octagon barrel, and is JM stamped; which means it was made by Marlin before Remington bought them out and ruined the quality control of these guns.  According to the serial number it was made in 2002.  (serial  number begins with the digits 982)  The gun was bought in '02 or '03 by its original owner at a local gun store here in Indianapolis.  He told me that he fired around 15 or 20 (modern, not black powder) rounds through it and put it up for the last 10 years.  I believe him, considering the condition the rifle is in.  It is in 100% perfect mechanical condition, but it has a couple of minor flaws in the finish.  On both the left and right side of the barrel about 8"" from the muzzle the bluing is thin.  It looks like a factory blemish to me, but could be from long term storage.  There is no rust or pitting, just a couple of spots that are lighter than the rest of the gun.  If I didn't tell you about them it would probably take awhile for you to notice.  The gun cycles as smooth as butter, and the trigger pull is very crisp and light.  It is overall a beautiful gun.  Definitely heirloom quality.  The only reason I am selling it is because I know it will get scratched up if I keep it, since I am rough on my rifles.  I really don't want to do that to such a good looking gun, so I would rather get something that is more modern that wont bother me when it gets scratched up.  I am not willing to ship the rifle at this time, so sales and trades are face to face only.

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

** To answer many of the questions: I don't know a whole lot about the shotgun minus what is online. I know it is worth a decent amount of money, and the extra barrels are rare. They do fit perfectly inside and make this gun essentially a 4-gauge gun. It is not in perfect condition, but it is in great condition. It has been shot, but has been taken care of.

Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery. Never used at the range in perfect condition.

The body and feed lips on these are made from a very heavy gauge steel which will last a lifetime. If you hold one of these in one hand and an aluminum C-products or similar USGI type mag in the other hand, you will see there is no comparison, these are much, much heavier and solid feeling. The body, spring and floorplate are all coated with black teflon maritime coating that wont corrode even under harsh conditions. The teflon coating also means the follower movement (follower is also steel and non-tilt of course) is super smooth. You will be impressed with the quality of these.

Ideally a glock 34/35.

This AK74 was built with all the best goodies, it runs like a champ as near all AK's do and functions without flaw. Picatinny rails on both sides and atop the gun for any accessories you'd like to mount up, and of course the Marine Digital Camo Duracoat looks great. A polished and lightened Tapco trigger, AR15 style collapsible stock, Hogue Grips (so comfortable), the gun features Bulgarian internals. Also including 4 durable 30 round Tapco mags, and 400 rounds of good ammunition. I have a matching laser/green dot scope I will include;  the scope does need a new front lens, a quick ship to the manufacture would have that fixed no problem. Currently I have it mounted to the side rail, and I am just using the laser feature for home defense as I prefer iron sights anyway.   (I probably forgot a few things but I posted a few good pictures.!)

I have only ran 300 rounds through the gun and it had no period of break in, it has been functioning 100% since day one.

This is the reworked version of the AK47, the soviets took notice of our M16's flatter faster shooting round (5.56) and this is there version of it.  It fires the 5.45 round at about 2850fps. 
The benefit of this round over the AR15's 5.56 is primarily in cost. Ammo for this rifle is 35% less than that of the AR-15 configured in 5.56.  The cartridge itself is equally or I dare say more devastating than that of the 5.56. I say this because the round features a hollow cavity that causes the bullet to yaw once it has made contact with the enemy, making a larger wound; generating higher chances to destroy ones vitals.  They call this the poison bullet because it always gets the job done.

Otherwise I will let the pictures do the talking! Feel free to email me here on armslist with any questions you may have. If you want to get in contact with me more quickly feel free to text me at REDACTED  
Calls are also fine if its before 9pm.

The Springfield Armory 9mm Enhanced Micro Pistol (EMP) is the 
first production 1911 made from the ground up to shoot short 
cartridges like 9mm, 40 S&W and 45 GAP. The result? The smallest, 
most concealable 1911 you can buy.

Previously, when 1911s were chambered for short-action calibers like the 
9mm, 40 S&W and 45 GAP, this was done on guns built around the 
longer 45 ACP cartridge (Essentially, long-action 1911s). Spacers 
were placed in the magazine to align the shorter cartridges. The EMP 
is the first production 1911 designed specifically for these shorter 
cartridges.

The world got its first glimpse of the short-action 1911 in 2005 with a 
prototype Springfield gun called the ""Defender."" Chambered in 45 
GAP, this rare gun received rave reviews from numerous firearms 
publications. We decided to launch this new class of 1911 in the more popular 9mm caliber in the EMP.

If you're tired of the same-old AR platform that everyone else has and are looking for something a bit different then check this out. This gun is basically the love child of an AR, AK and FAL. Uses FAL adjustable gas system, AK style gas piston and AR style bolt/FCG. Uses normal AR STANAG magazine (e.g. GI mags, PMags, etc). These guns are super reliable.

These were imported by Kimber in the 90s (lower is stamped 'Kimber'). They had hideous thumbhole stocks and ugly handguards. I converted to use adjustable M4 style stock and TuffForce FAL handguard. Also put on a StormWerkz optic rail. These guns are floating around out there but you're not likely to see very many. Only time I've ever seen another one in person was in the hands of a 14 year old Guatemalan military soldier when I was in Guatemala earlier this year. I noticed it, yelled ""Daewoo?"" and he raised the gun in the air and gave me a thumbs up.

Don't pay a ridiculous amount for this rifle by trying to acquire it on an auction website.  The price below is the price for this rifle, regardless of quantity available.

The SCAR Rifle System achieves complete ergonomic compatibility along with 99% parts commonality between platforms in the same caliber. The SCAR enhances individual officer effectiveness and simplifies mission capabilities, logistic support, reduces training time and minimizes armorer service downtime. The SCAR's free floating barrels are quickly interchangeable by loosening six captive screws. All major windage and elevation adjustments are made at the permanently-attached front sight. Both US Government and manufacturer's testing prove that when a SCAR barrel is removed and then reinstalled, it will return within one minute of angle (1 MOA) to the previously established zero.

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console is Console Vault's flagship product. Taking full advantage of General Motors' model change in 2007 that allowed a much larger console, Console Vault crafted an amazing vault that took full advantage of the ample space now provided. 

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console Vault features an awesome secret compartment at its base, providing an extra dosage of security and covertness for your valuables. The hidden compartment may be used for extra secure storage, and should you not wish to take advantage of this feature, simply remove the access panel for additional space. We've seen some customers attach a holster to this area with velcro, enabling them to keep their firearm in place while traveling. 

 As with all Console Vault products, installation is incredibly simple and installation time requires only about 5 - 10 minutes.

 Suburban Floor Console Features:

•Massive 12-Gauge cold rolled plate steel, welded tab and notch seams
•Superior 3-point locking system resists prying
•Bank Vault-style hinge latch pins

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured."

This is the most desirable caliber per customer demand for Sig Sauer, and the nicest finish they ever put to market on a limited production run, especially chambered in .357 Sig which is just below a .45 ACP in terms of stopping power, this is not a pistol for the light at heart.  

This pistol features all of Sig Sauer's best including their patented SRT (Short Reset Trigger) system that feels close to firing a fully automatic pistol when engaged (scary fast actually), adjustable Sig Lite Combat Rear Night Sights with a Tru-Glow Fiber Optic Front Sight (from Sig Factory),a decocking lever, extended beavertail frame, external extractor, premium white Sig Sauer aluminum grips, a stainless steel slide and a Nitron coated controls and barrel.  Doesn't get any better than this for Sig Sauer, especially not in their own caliber.   Oh yeah, the magazine holds 12 rounds + 1 in the chamber, and extended magazines from Sig are available that hold 15 + 1 in case 12 doesn't get the job done.  

I don't really need to sell this pistol, just have an alternate project I'm working on right now that could use some additional funding, but it's not super high priority or anything.  Reason I state this is so nobody is offended if I pass on your offer, and I imagine I'll pass on quite a few as there's not another one of these on the local market, period.  

That being said, I'm asking $1200.  And before anyone lectures me about ""price gouging"" or anything like that, bear in mind I paid $1,368 for this pistol and have the receipt to prove it (purchased from Osage County Guns in Moussouri).  I also have two additional magazines and would consider throwing in a brand new set of Sig e2 grips as well, open to discussion.  

Thanks for looking!  Text or email, I don't answer calls from unknown numbers.

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured."

908,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2157908,For Sale:  Russian 1917 Tula M91 Mosin-Nagant rifle w/extras,"Grey Forest (NW of SA), San Antonio, Texas",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, September 26, 2013",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Here is a beautiful old Russian M91 rifle, all the way from 1917. This one is of particular interest to collectors because of its date and markings. Anyone with an interest in Russia will recognize 1917 as the start of the Bolshevik Revolution. Although this weapon is marked as having been manufactured at the ""Tula Emporer Peter the Great Ordinance Factory"", it lacks the Imperial crest that normally accompanied such markings. I do not claim to know for sure, but given the date and markings, I think it's likely that this weapon was in production and had already been marked when the fun began, but was only completed and allowed to leave the plant after the crest was removed by the ""Workers"". See an example of the complete mark – 62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinTheOp.htm#MarkChanges – and compare it to the pictures below.

Such speculation aside, what I can see for sure is a complete, historically correct example of this model, in very good overall condition. It does have a few dings and scratches, as would be expected from a nearly-100-year-old weapon. The stock is beautiful wood with brass appointments, all finished in what I believe to be the original factory shellac. The metal retains most of the original factory finish. The weapon has the desirable hexagonal receiver. Serial numbers on the barrel, buttplate and receiver all match, though those on the bolt and floorplate do not.

The sale includes the original canvas sling with leather and metal hardware, the original cleaning rod, and a detachable bayonet of the correct type. Not included in this deal is a supply of various ammunition for this caliber, which I will detail and offer first to the buyer, at a reasonable price to be negotiated. If the buyer of the rifle does not want the ammunition, I will list it separately after the rifle sells.

I am not a gunsmith nor an expert on these weapons, but I have inspected the weapon and researched its history, and have described it to the best of my ability. I will be happy to answer any questions, and I will be happy to provide better or additional pictures if desired. It should go without saying that this rifle is old stock, and may not be as reliable as a modern, recently-produced weapon. Although my inspection reveals no apparent problems, you assume all risk of its use should you decide to attempt to fire it – so I urge the purchaser to have the weapon inspected by a competent gunsmith.

I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash somewhere in the Northwest San Antonio area, but I am willing to ship if necessary, at your expense. As this is a complete functioning weapon, it must be shipped to a licensed dealer in your vicinity, whose services you must arrange and pay for. Shipping will be at cost, via UPS. All told, it's about 12 pounds boxed up.

As this weapon now has potentially winning bids on its auction on Gunbroker, it is no longer available for sale here. If you would be interested in purchasing it, I encourage you to bid on it via Gunbroker -- www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=367918450"

I bought this gun about a year ago because I thought it was cool, but also because it was accurate plinker that could be used to shoot Aguilla Colibri and super Colibri rounds, which are quieter than a nail gun out of this 6"" barreled handgun. I'm not claiming to have done any plinking inside city limits, but if I had the neighbors would've been none the wiser ;)

In it's day, this double action, fast reloading, 9 shot revolver could have been a respectable defensive sidearm, especially with it's light weight and slim profile. Of course today you would be crazy to choose this as a carry gun, but it is fun to shoot and beautiful with it's excellent condition wood ""saw-handle"" grips and Webley-like top break action. It has a crisp, precise sight picture with the brass front sight blade. Sights are non-adjustable and dead on at the short distances I've shot it.

I've enjoyed this gun but have been unemployed for two months and really need some extra cash for necessities. It's been thoroughly cleaned and is in good condition. Does have some holster wear at end of barrell and front edge of cylinder from the original owner, but there is no corrosion. Will sell for $275. Can also sell some Super Colibri bullets cheap with the gun.
