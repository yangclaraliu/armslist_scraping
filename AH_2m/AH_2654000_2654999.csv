My SR9c has the factory included Compact 10-rd Mag (with or without pinky finger extension), and the Extended 17-rd Mag (with full size hand grip extension), and everything that it comes with when buying new.  Gun provides great options for the range, or for compact carry.

Now listen here... I typed all that up and someone had better step up right pert and hand me thirty dollars or I'm liable get over on my ear and pitch a wobbler. I'll 
throw in some odds and ends and a few .22lr to make that the better part of 150 rounds of factory ammo, most of which I'm confident will still go bang when 
you whack the primer. Trade em with your friends if you havent run them all off yet, or sling them in your woodstove for atmosphere. Put them all on the 
dashboard of your vehicle and when you get pulled over for your next DUI start blinking your left eye really fast. You and the officer can have an hearty chuckle 
after your tune-up. Well, whatever you deceide to do , first you gotta buy them. $30 Cheap at twice the price really. I already hear the phone buzzing.

I'll ship this but be forewarned that it has to go UPS and it will be the better part of +20$ if you live near a coast and probably otherwise, too, and it will have to wait a few days until I'm heading past a UPS portal and It will have to be paypal or a USPS Postal MO and I will hold until everything clears the bank and I have bought enough $1 Gino's frozen pizzas to founder a fat woman."

Would sell outright, but really interested in a straight trade.  If you don't mind a longer trigger pull, this gun is perfect as it is a perfect ccw but also feels great to fire.  

Will come with box, and trigger lock.  

I have a really nice case I could throw in to sweeten the deal if it's a fair one.

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

Some Lipsey Exclusive guns happen fairly fast, others take some time. The Bearcat Shopkeeper is one gun that has been on the drawing table for several years. It all started with a visit by Lipsey to one of our biggest and most loyal dealers in Alabama. He showed them a beautiful little 3"" barreled Ruger Bearcat. Everyone agreed it would make for a great Lipsey's Exclusive, and after talking to Ruger, they agreed to take a look at it. 
  Ruger decided to produce a round butt or birdshead type frame to go along with the 3"" barrel. In addition to the 3"" barrel and birdshead gripframe, they had to use a couple of other unique features to make it all work. Due to the short barrel, Ruger had to use a ""button head"" cylinder pin and a crescent shape ejector rod so that the spent cases could easily be extracted from the cylinder. Ruger is also using a steel ejector rod housing that matches the rest of the gun verses the aluminum one used on the standard Bearcats.
  Even though it took 3 years, the wonderful engineers at Ruger made it happen and now we have a true ""Shopkeeper"" size Ruger Bearcat. 
 This is one of those guns that once you put it in your hands, you will have to get one.

We designed this bedside rig to allow our customers the all in one solution to transitioning from your everyday carry IWB holster to your ""Sleepy Time"" holster. No need to change holsters with our rigs! Simply take the weapon and holster off your belt at night and attach your holster to the bedside rig and always be prepared!

We at SSXHolsters take the following steps in creating each holster: 
First, we thermo-form our high quality .060 and .125 Kydex to the maximum pliability gradually, and without scorching the material with direct advice from the plastics industry leaders.    
Second, we hand press each holster up to 1200 lbs. psi. 
Third, we mill the holsters into the models shape/design, machine buff, then wet sand all edges to a nice smooth matte finish. 
All IWB holsters are fitted with a high quality metal belt clip attached at a single point with quality hardware and Loctite to provide a permanent bond while being forgiving of various body positions increasing comfort and ultimately more good people legally carrying their firearms on an everyday basis.  

Our Bedside Rigs are made of very high quality .125 Kydex with .125 ABS as the ""under the mattress arm"". This, combined with high quality hardware and absolute versatility gives us the confidence to say this is the best bedside/holster rig available!

Why Kydex as opposed to other holster materials? 

Kydex®

KYDEX® (ACRYLIC/PVC ALLOY) SHEET

KYDEX® sheet is an extremely durable acrylic/PVC alloy extruded in a range of colors, patterns, textures, thicknesses, and grades to optimize long-term performance, appearance, and cost effectiveness across demanding and diverse end-use applications. Specialized grades of KYDEX® sheet are offered to satisfy requirements specific to thermoforming, membrane pressing, post-forming, brake-forming, and laminating, and to fit a broad range of specialized applications ranging from medical equipment housings and aircraft tray tables to retail store fixtures and trade show displays.

IMPACT RESISTANCE
No other thermoplastic sheet stands up to impact, and gouging like KYDEX® sheet. Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet offers Notched Izod impact resistance to 18 ft-lbs/in., and is available in thicknesses from .028 to .500 inch to withstand levels of abuse from moderate to extreme. Due to its high degree of toughness and resilience, KYDEX® sheet can also be stretched at room temperature to twice its original dimension without breaking.



FLAME RETARDANCY
Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet is available with fire ratings of UL Std. 94 V-0, UL Std. 94 5V; FAR 25.853 (a) and (d); FSTratings: ABD6031 D6-51377:FMVSS 302; Class I/A and others as described in the following pages.











CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
From sulfuric acid to brake fluid to carbon tetrachloride, high performance grades of KYDEX® sheet acrylic/PVC alloys are more resistant to a wider range of concentrated chemicals than any other thermoplastic. In fact, KYDEX® sheet meets the highest standards of chemical resistance for thermoplastic materials as defined inASTM D-1784 standard for Class 12454-C rigid polyvinyl chloride.



DIMENSIONAL STABILITY
Low water absorption and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion give parts made with KYDEX® sheet high dimensional stability.

CLEANABILITY
Tough stains, scuffs, and graffiti can be removed from KYDEX® surfaces using strong cleansers with no staining, fading, or surface damage.



DESIGN FREEDOM
KYDEX® sheet offers unprecedented design and manufacturing flexibility since:

Numerous grades are available to provide properties and certified ratings required for specialized applications.
An uncommonly wide variety of functional and aesthetic effects can be achieved since certain individual grades can be manufactured using a variety of techniques.
Many colors, patterns, textures, and thicknesses are common to grades intended for specific manufacturing methods allowing multicomponent end products to contain a wide variety of matching parts."

**Glock Model shown in photos**

We designed this bedside rig to allow our customers the all in one solution to transitioning from your everyday carry IWB holster to your ""Sleepy Time"" holster. No need to change holsters with our rigs! Simply take the weapon and holster off your belt at night and attach your holster to the bedside rig and always be prepared!

We at SSXHolsters take the following steps in creating each holster: 
First, we thermo-form our high quality .060 and .125 Kydex to the maximum pliability gradually, and without scorching the material with direct advice from the plastics industry leaders.    
Second, we hand press each holster up to 1200 lbs. psi. 
Third, we mill the holsters into the models shape/design, machine buff, then wet sand all edges to a nice smooth matte finish. 
All IWB holsters are fitted with a high quality metal belt clip attached at a single point with quality hardware and Loctite to provide a permanent bond while being forgiving of various body positions increasing comfort and ultimately more good people legally carrying their firearms on an everyday basis.  

Our Bedside Rigs are made of very high quality .125 Kydex with .125 ABS as the ""under the mattress arm"". This, combined with high quality hardware and absolute versatility gives us the confidence to say this is the best bedside/holster rig available!

Don't waste your money on the rest, spent it on the best!  

If there is ever an issue with your holster simply contact us with the information we provide with each shipment and we will either inform you how to address the issue easily, or we will fix it for you. We ask only that you pay return shipping. 

Why Kydex as opposed to other holster materials? 

Kydex®

KYDEX® (ACRYLIC/PVC ALLOY) SHEET

KYDEX® sheet is an extremely durable acrylic/PVC alloy extruded in a range of colors, patterns, textures, thicknesses, and grades to optimize long-term performance, appearance, and cost effectiveness across demanding and diverse end-use applications. Specialized grades of KYDEX® sheet are offered to satisfy requirements specific to thermoforming, membrane pressing, post-forming, brake-forming, and laminating, and to fit a broad range of specialized applications ranging from medical equipment housings and aircraft tray tables to retail store fixtures and trade show displays.

IMPACT RESISTANCE
No other thermoplastic sheet stands up to impact, and gouging like KYDEX® sheet. Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet offers Notched Izod impact resistance to 18 ft-lbs/in., and is available in thicknesses from .028 to .500 inch to withstand levels of abuse from moderate to extreme. Due to its high degree of toughness and resilience, KYDEX® sheet can also be stretched at room temperature to twice its original dimension without breaking.



FLAME RETARDANCY
Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet is available with fire ratings of UL Std. 94 V-0, UL Std. 94 5V; FAR 25.853 (a) and (d); FSTratings: ABD6031 D6-51377:FMVSS 302; Class I/A and others as described in the following pages.











CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
From sulfuric acid to brake fluid to carbon tetrachloride, high performance grades of KYDEX® sheet acrylic/PVC alloys are more resistant to a wider range of concentrated chemicals than any other thermoplastic. In fact, KYDEX® sheet meets the highest standards of chemical resistance for thermoplastic materials as defined inASTM D-1784 standard for Class 12454-C rigid polyvinyl chloride.



DIMENSIONAL STABILITY
Low water absorption and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion give parts made with KYDEX® sheet high dimensional stability.

CLEANABILITY
Tough stains, scuffs, and graffiti can be removed from KYDEX® surfaces using strong cleansers with no staining, fading, or surface damage.



DESIGN FREEDOM
KYDEX® sheet offers unprecedented design and manufacturing flexibility since:

Numerous grades are available to provide properties and certified ratings required for specialized applications.
An uncommonly wide variety of functional and aesthetic effects can be achieved since certain individual grades can be manufactured using a variety of techniques.
Many colors, patterns, textures, and thicknesses are common to grades intended for specific manufacturing methods allowing multicomponent end products to contain a wide variety of matching parts."

This is a great buy for someone who needs one gun that can fill several different roles.  It is a great collectors gun because the Romanian SKS is more rare than Chinese or Yugo versions.  If you want a good brush gun for up to deer size game out to 100-150 yards, this is a good option in it’s stock configuration or add the Ram-Line stock for a normal (American) length of pull. If you need a defensive rifle, put on the Tapco stuff and it’s as reliable as any gun on the market and actually more accurate than an AK-47. If you want a center fire plinker, you won’t find a more inexpensive option. The gun loves cheap Russian steal cased ammo and will shoot it all day and all night.
This was my first center fire rifle and was purchased for all the reasons listed above.  I have since acquired additional rifles that fill each of the above listed roles better and this gun just stays in the safe.  It has become a gun safe queen and I have fired it only one time in the past several years (was cleaning it when a coon started to get in my grape vines so I smoked him at 50 yards). 
I can email additional pics if you need.

NOTE: I will not separate the package and the price is firm.
Thanks.

I bought this rifle new in 2005 and have given it all the TLC it deserves in the years since. The rifle has not been altered in anyway. Included is a Lee Shaver mid-range Soule sight with Hadley eyecup. Original rear flip-up sight and front globe sight are also included. About 500 rounds have passed through this rifle, the first 50 of which were modern copper-jacketed bullets loaded over smokeless powder. The remaining rounds were cast lead over black powder. She shoots great with cloverleaf groups of three at 100 yards common if you do your job. I have used this rifle in several silhouette matches out to 500 yds and did well enough to hold my interest, though any lack of better scores was entirely my fault. She loves 535 gr. Postell bullets loaded to touching the lands (Pedersolis have a longer throat so a drive band and a half are exposed.). I never sized my brass nor crimped the bullets in. She is a heavy rifle at about 13 lbs. There is nary a mark on her as you can see in the photos. More photos available at:

http://s698.photobucket.com/user/cjkosti...REDACTED85164

The only reason I have decided to part with this rifle is I picked up a Browning Highwall BPCR in 45-70 and a C. Sharps 1874 in 45-100. It makes no sense to me to let this fine rifle sit in the safe.

Like new USA Tactical Rifle with Samson EVO forearm, flip up iron sights (not polymer) and fixed Ace entry/carbine stock and Gadsden flag logo on the receiver.  Feels good and shoulders quickly.  I can change the stock out for those who want a standard, adjustable carbine stock and  KNS antirotation trigger pins.  Currently wearing a Kaspa Zombie 1.5-6X scope (I have a few of the Kaspa's and they are pretty good for the price range, search them and you'll see) in a Burris P.E.P.R QD mount, Magpul AFG and ALD Defense trigger.  Comes with 5 Troy Battlemags (6 if I can find the other one).  Very light package until you add the scope.  Purchased very lightly used and fired 60 rounds out of it to zero scope.  Shoots great at the 30 yards we were shooting (didn't have anything more), but prefer my Barnes Precision and home built ARs.

Previous owner advised barrel is a 1:9 twist, 5.56 chamber.
