This turn key bench / varmint Ruger based 10-22 (mfg prior to 2008) comes with the original metal trigger housing (not junk plastic) will out shoot you as it sits. New owner still has the option to bed the action and float the barrel if he/she sees fit. I ran a variety of match and bulk pack offerings through factory Ruger 10 round and 25 round magazines with no issues, fail to fires, fail to feeds etc.  Since this gun was built it has a low round count (approx 200 rounds) I shot paper at 50 yards and small reactive targets at 100 yards. It's been a safe queen in my modern climate controlled Liberty Gun safe. I'm willing to remove the bi-pod, scope, and rings from the deal other than that this gun is staying together! I have some excess ammo and stock Ruger internal parts if you want to work that in at the time of sale. Gun comes with two factory 10 round and two factory 25 round mags. This gun is in mint condition and ready to serve many fun filled years if treated properly.  Thanks for stopping by my listing.

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate

From Nightforce:
Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification 

range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce 

riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 50 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its 

superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately 

reaching to 2000 yards and beyond.

This is the perfect Home Defense Weapon.  The short barrel gives you a spread that makes you not capable of missing and is easily maneuvered in tight spaces and holds 5 rounds of whatever ammo you want to put in it.  You can use 2 3/4 or 3"" ammo with it being bird shot, buck shot, or slugs.  It can handle it and save your life.  Oh, and by the way, it has sights, not normally found on a shotgun.  If you use slugs, you can reach out a lot more distance with accuracy.

I have 2 in stock and when they are gone, the price will go up.  Don't miss out on a bargain.  This is a long gun so there is no waiting period so come in and take one home and sleep better tonight.  I am including enough ammo to load it up so you will be ready to go when you get home.  

How can you you get piece of mind and home safety for such a low price.  Simple to operate by anyone, no license required to defend your home with this weapon.  You have put it off too long, a gun and ammo to feel better right away.  If someone should kick your door in the middle of the night, they will be the ones surprised.

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. 
Built around Beretta’s latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower.

Available in two calibers (9mm and .40 S&W), the Px4 Storm Sub- Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. 

A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies.
The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is
positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. 

A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional).
An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional low-profile configuration.
A standard Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD- 1913) allows for an array of aftermarket accessories

Im looking for a brick of .22lr.  I can't seem to beat the crowd that goes to wal mart early in the morning to buy up all the ammo because I have to go to my job earlier than 8am.  I have a 22 I bought two months ago and haven't been able to shoot because this ammo is so hard to come across at a normal price.  Would anyone be willing to part with a box for a reasonable price?  I can't see how 50$ a brick is justifiable.  Maybe someone could sell me one at cost or just a little over.  I could also trade for some 7mm rem mag core lokt or federal 9mm.  Im at Fort Rucker but I can drive wherever.  Thanks for the help."

The Glocks can be of any generation I'm not picky there. So if you happen to have one lying around that you just don't shoot any longer and was looking to get a new smartphone for yourself or someone special in your life maybe we can both help each other out. I'm just seeing if maybe someone out there really needs (wants) an iPhone that has a clear and clean IMEI so it's ready to be activated on T-Mobile. It's in near MINT condition. We can even meet at a T-Mobile store so you can verify it's legit and ready for service. Will come with a case cover as well. Just let me know. Phone, Case cover, Wall adapter charger and USB cable. That's all. No box. 

Call, Text or Message me if interested. Thanks guys.

It is an FIE Titan .25 ACP semi-auto pocket pistol that I have had for some time now. 
She aint much to look at but has never had any problems. I have always used it for an ankle pistol and it goes with me camping and has taken out many a rabid squirrel.
Never stove pipes or fails to feed or misfires. 
7+1 Capacity, and its a blast to shoot.
I have recently gotten a Beretta in .25 ACP so I don't need this one taking up space in the safe. Was at the range last week testing it out just to ensure I don't sell someone a hand grenade and it took 50 rounds just fine. I cleaned it thoroughly of course after. But as with any gun you will want to clean it yourself before firing. 
The .25ACP is great because it is more reliable than the .22lr because its a centerfire. And certainly has more power behind it. 
Also nowadays the .25 ACP is easier to find ammo for. Ill send a box of Remington with it if full ask is given. 
It is not brand new by any means and it has some pitting and almost all of the bluing is gone. So bear that in mind please before asking to look at it.
bill of sale will come with, and I will ask for a current D/L

The SureFire high capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M-4, M-16 and AR15 variants and other firearms that accept STANAG 4179 (standard M16) magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. 

The SureFire 100 round magazine is slightly thinner than two 30 round magazines clipped together and is about the same overall length. The SureFire 100 round magazine fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines."

It is chambered for 9mm and has a standard 4"" (100mm) barrel, fixed sights and walnut grips. The serial number appears on the front of the frame, on the left side of the receiver, on the side plate sear and trigger. The 1914 Model Luger is characterized by the short frame, the rear ""V"" cut fixed and front dovetailed sight, and the frame with the stock lug. It was produced from 1914 until 1918 for the German Military. 

The right side of the receiver displays all the Imperial Army acceptance stamps. Original grips are finely cut diamond shaped checkering made from walnut or in some cases beech wood. These grips are serial numbered to the gun. The inside of the gun is clean and well cared for. The exterior shows honest wear on the muzzle, barrel and high points on the sides. The barrel is shiny and shows distinct lands and grooves. This Luger shows characteristic holster wear on the side plate and front exposed edges of the rails and end of the barrel. I would rate it about 80% original finish. 

The Luger is accompanied by three magazines and a WWII issue holster with German military markings. With the magazines and about a $250 holster, this gun is priced reasonably."

PS: No trades for my weapon only. Cash preferred. If you got something you want to trade and do that with cash, then that's possible to talk about. But I'm not really interested in just trading. You want to offer me less than $520, go ahead. The worst I can say is no but I know what these sell for, so I'm not going to take $100 off of this. Thanks again."

As I decided that the the compact would be better for the GF.

This is the newest version of this gun(10/13 test fire date), it has great trigger reset compared to the old ones, has a new sear which makes the trigger nice not gritty or mushy and new more accurate barrel compared to models 2yrs ago

Brand new in box never shot only dry fired ~10 times basically to compare to my other one after I did a home trigger job which is awesome BTW. I would even be willing to do a trigger job on this one for you at a small fee of $25 or you can feel the one I have done basically still have takeup but reset is shorter and pull is smooth and lighter neither one will have the USB changed which will only make it better.

Its the LE #309301 but it did not come with 3 mags only 2, and yes I called and complained as it was purchased in December online.

This model has 17rnd mags and no safeties"

I'm interested in a pack of Billet Speed loaders in .357 for a S&W K-frame revolver, but the big packs are $165 (includes 8). I don't need that many, so I wanted to see if someone wanted split a set with me. The are pretty slick looking accessories, and all aluminum, so if someone wanted to throw down like $50 and get three, I'll figure out the tax/shipping and you'd get them in the bags they ship in.

They sell them individually for $20, and $3 to ship for each, so that's how I came out with the number. Let me know if you have an interest through TGT. We could split them more if that's preferable and you wanted 4 or something too."

You can see by the photos it is in very good condition with only minor marks on the stock, some slight bluing wear on the muzzle.  Bore has solid rifling and the gun shoots well.  This one is counterbored.  Fully cleaned of all the cosmoline, I shoot surplus ammo with it and do a very thorough cleaning immediately after shooting.

Letting go of my 9mm Taurus PT-809.  I love shooting this gun.  All the functions work flawlessly and easily such as cocking decocking, safety on/off, and dropping mags.  The best part is you can do all that just as easily with either hand.  Great condition has had a couple hundred rounds through it.  Cycles perfect, never had a miss or stuck casing.  Hate to let it go but need some new computer parts for the kids.  I have probably 150-300 rounds (all brass no steel) i will let go for whatever acadamy sports is selling them for.  Sorry i cant just give them away theyre getting a little on the hard side to find. My name is Matt.  No shipping. Local Kansas City sales only.  Bill of sale unless you want to transfer it through a FFL and that's fine by me if you cover the fee's.

Despite my kids computer needs I am always looking for a tactical 870 shotgun for trade.

Much of the existing work on this weapon was performed by Red Hawk Rifles in Colorado. Like new except for a very few “handling” marks, with less than 100 rounds through it. Although there is nothing wrong with the factory barrel, I never quite decided whether I might switch to an aftermarket barrel, maybe shorten the existing one or just thread it, so the brake was never installed (but it’s included if you want it). The rings came out a bit high for my taste (the cheek adjustment ensures its no functional issue), but since I never absolutely decided on a barrel profile, I never finalized my mount choice (McCann, Precision Reflex etc), so the rings had to wait. I was going to turn the whole thing over to Score High Gunsmithing in Albuquerque for their “accurizing” once I made all my final component decisions. This was intended for tactical and long range applications, maybe competition or critter destruction “from one zip code over”, but I don’t think I’d actually want to carry her very far for hunting; she’s sexy beast, but she is a big girl.

Overall this is a VERY sweet and accurate rifle; it might run $4000-$5000 to have it built for you, it has nearly $3500 in components alone (not including locating, ordering, shipping, and installation). I checked on manufacturers to get those prices, but there are lots of sites out there, so you should check for yourself. You might “find a deal” on some of them for reference. 

I’m asking $2500 for everything and I may consider removing/not including certain components (scope or bipod etc) depending on the deal if you want. I’m not in a rush, only selling because other projects are waiting. Cash talks, low-ballers will be ignored.

Shipping to an FFL is possible but is not included free.

PARTIAL TRADES CONSIDERED.
