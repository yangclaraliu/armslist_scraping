57,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2618057,For Sale:  Colt Trooper MK III .357 CTG Trooper Mark III MKIII w/Original Box!,"Garland, Dallas, Texas",$ 960,"Listed On: Thursday, March 6, 2014",Handguns,Colt                                                                                ,357 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"For sale or trade is a very nice Colt Trooper MK III .357 mag. / .38 revolver with original box, serial number shows 1975 production.  Overall this is a clean revolver in the beautiful deep blue Colt finish.  The finish looks great, but there is a little thinning and wear along the very front edge of the cylinder maybe from resting in a holster at some time, pics may not show it and a touch at the muzzle.  There is a small area on the cylinder where there is/was maybe surface rust?? maybe a 1/8""x1/8"" area.  There is a faint drag line on the cylinder, which tells me this one was shot very little.  Other than the areas mentioned, this is a beautiful piece.  Oh, the wood grips look perfect, no scratches or wear anywhere.  The box is in good/descent shape with some wear and someone has put tape on it.  As you can see the foil label is there and in pretty good shape.  Bottom line, the box is not in great condition, but more important, I have it, which is huge when it comes to the overall value.  Let me know if serious and interested in seeing more pics, I have about a dozen or so.

$960 cash obo. Will consider trades around or above the asking price.  The Trooper's have steadily increased in value over the past couple of years, I've seen them for sale in the $600's and up into the thousands, depending on the finish, condition, if the box & ppwk are included etc., so really all over the place as far as value goes.  I'm in no hurry to get rid of this one as these will only increase in value.  If you are looking for an investment piece, this is a sure thing and shooting it will not decrease the value on these, these are tanks.  I also have a very nice Trooper MK III 4"" Nickel, I would sell both for $1,700 if someone is interested.

If wanting to trade, please state exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, gold, silver etc. etc., so I know the deal and I will consider. I like a bit of everything.

I'm not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifier (not Eotech) in the 5x-6x power range.  I am trying to finish off several rifle projects if someone has multiples.
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool.  
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal. 
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
FN SCAR 16, maybe 17
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal 
Beretta 92FS INOX, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too.
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred.
1911 pistols
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be perfect for my AR-10
Maybe another Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.
Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everthing, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area or I will ship on your dime."

Herbert Schmidt of Ostheim an der Rhon Germany. Schmidt has marketed firearms under a long list of trade names in Europe and the USA including Deputy Marshal, EIG, E8, PIC, Geroco, Madison, Bison, Omega, RG, AMCO, Spesco, Valor, Liberty, LA's Deputy, Liberty Scout, Deputy Magnum, Deputy Adjuster, NATO, Western, Burgo Mod 21, Gecado Model 21 , Indian Scout, VOL, Eusta, Cheyenne Scout, Texas Scout, and Buffalo Scout. The basic Schmidt pattern was a six-shot double action solid frame revolver, with a swing-out cylinder and a short barrel. Schmidt's other principal pattern was a western-style .22 Small Frame Single Action revolver with a rod ejector beneath the barrel. All Schmidt revolvers have the maker's name stamped into the lower edge of the butt grip frame, visible when the grips are removed. As with Em-Ge, Schmidt revolvers were also widely sold in the USA before the passing of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability. While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out! ""Have neer seen one like this"" the weapon bears No refurbishment marks or other countrys arsenal markings! The metal has not a mark on it is stone mint! The magazine follower, action etc have no wear! Mint bore. All matching. No refurbishment marks from other countrys !!
This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine. This rifle saw little to no action its entire life, maybe an officers or political gaurds weapon

The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was apreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle."

Ahw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, my friends are in New York so it's a tough one at 52 years as y'all know! Well, this is just about my favorite. I actually tested it by shooting it, but you can see it was just when I got it in 2009 and it's basically NIB. This is factory engraved with carved Pearl grips, and the factory ones are with it too. Nickel plated and in .45 colt there's not a mark on it and it was factory engraved 'B'. I will also include a custom Meineke Alligator holster for those of you would want to carry it... there's really nothing better too! I will also include the Ivory grips fitted by Jerry Meacham to her also! I'm just a collector so it's Cashiers check, money order and please ask any questions you'd like. I try to honestly work with collectors that have 100% review as I am honest myself and even though this does cost some money, you're also not going to find another unless the dealer wants much more for the same thing! The trigger has been tuned too, and it's been sitting in my safe for this day when I certainly never thought I'd be selling my collection, but I guess life is like that, and you never know.... The buyer pays for shipping, and incidentally it's not going to be 20.00 in the mail either. This will go out overnight by UPS to your dealer insured and guaranteed! Neither of us will take the chance of destruction or misplacing... not for this! Thanks, and good luck!"

The scrolling on the receiver is very nice and the wood is beautiful.  It comes with the choke tubes, plastic case, gun oil, choke tube wrench and owners manual.  The forehand grip has the buldged end which really makes the gun pop.  The only negative about this gun is it's so beautiful you wouldn't want to use it as a layout gun when hunting waterfowl.

Colt O6790 Mustang XSP 380 ACP 2.75"" 6+1 Poly Grip/Frame Black
The Colt 380 Mustang XSP and Mustang Pocketlite are small and lightweight,
and they boast enhanced durability, reliability, and accuracy, making
either an ideal handgun for personal protection. The precise machining
process, use of high-quality materials, and improvements in design make
these pistols two of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the
market. The slide and barrel are CNC-machined from solid bar stock for
precise tolerances, and with loaded magazines, each weighs less than one
pound. These pistols feature high profile sights, a commander-style hammer,
a solid aluminum trigger, and a lowered ejection port. The minimal weight
and length, short single action trigger, grip designs, frame designs, and
firing pin safety block combine to make the Mustang pistols ideal for
personal protection.

Ahw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, my friends are in New York so it's a tough one at 52 years as y'all know! Well, this is just about my favorite. I actually tested it by shooting it, but you can see it was just when I got it in 2009 and it's basically NIB. This is factory engraved with carved Pearl grips, and the factory ones are with it too. Nickel plated and in .45 colt there's not a mark on it and it was factory engraved 'B'. I will also include a custom Meineke Alligator holster for those of you would want to carry it... there's really nothing better too! I will also include the Ivory grips fitted by Jerry Meacham to her also! I'm just a collector so it's Cashiers check, money order and please ask any questions you'd like. I try to honestly work with collectors that have 100% review as I am honest myself and even though this does cost some money, you're also not going to find another unless the dealer wants much more for the same thing! The trigger has been tuned too, and it's been sitting in my safe for this day when I certainly never thought I'd be selling my collection, but I guess life is like that, and you never know.... The buyer pays for shipping, and incidentally it's not going to be 20.00 in the mail either. This will go out overnight by UPS to your dealer insured and guaranteed! Neither of us will take the chance of destruction or misplacing... not for this! Thanks, and good luck!"

$75 for this one

I have the blind I bought for me after I discovered the first one i got was not large enough for me (that one is for sale as well). This one is way way nicer. This one was used for 2-4 hours at a time twice a day for 5 days. Show zero sign of wear or use. This thing is huge with tons of features but still goes into a nice easy to carry pack. This one measured 65"" X 63"" and its not a TP type (comes to a point - measurements are misleading with this type as they measure at the bottom but you get no head room) This one is a true box (plus extra space because the walls bow out when setup - that is how they lock. It locks up very rigid but still setups up and takes down fast and easy. I used a camping style folding chair and I am a big dude and I had room for a another whole person or two in there. its big.  I paid $130 and it worked great but I dont think im going to be hunting next year. This was my first year and it was fun but not for me -too cold-. I am also selling my almost new Savage 30-06 rifle, and a nice 61"" adjustable shooting stick - let me know if you want the details on either.

It comes with the backpack style carrying case but the strap broke because I tied my chair and gun to it, easy fix. Thanks

I bought this blind a few weeks before hunting season and aired it out without testing it. I am a big guy and this was a bit small for me. It was never used. Perfect condition. Its been outside in a screened in porch away from the elements but soaked in fresh air. Was $55..My loss your gain.

Ahw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, my friends are in New York so it's a tough one at 52 years as y'all know! Well, this is just about my favorite. I actually tested it by shooting it, but you can see it was just when I got it in 2009 and it's basically NIB. This is factory engraved with carved Pearl grips, and the factory ones are with it too. Nickel plated and in .45 colt there's not a mark on it and it was factory engraved 'B'. I will also include a custom Meineke Alligator holster for those of you would want to carry it... there's really nothing better too! I will also include the Ivory grips fitted by Jerry Meacham to her also! I'm just a collector so it's Cashiers check, money order and please ask any questions you'd like. I try to honestly work with collectors that have 100% review as I am honest myself and even though this does cost some money, you're also not going to find another unless the dealer wants much more for the same thing! The trigger has been tuned too, and it's been sitting in my safe for this day when I certainly never thought I'd be selling my collection, but I guess life is like that, and you never know.... The buyer pays for shipping, and incidentally it's not going to be 20.00 in the mail either. This will go out overnight by UPS to your dealer insured and guaranteed! Neither of us will take the chance of destruction or misplacing... not for this! Thanks, and good luck!"

UPC Code: REDACTED80
Manufacturer: EOTech
Model: Generation 3
Model: G33STS
Type: Magnifier
Size: 3X
Finish/Color: Black
Description: Switch to Side
Manufacturer Part #: G33.STS


The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.


This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing."
