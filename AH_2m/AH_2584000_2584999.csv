It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it. I still have the mount so if you have some American optics you can use it. The drag bag I have it in was issued to me during my tour to Afghanistan and my supply guy didn't want it back. The rifle is with my father In-law in E-town because I'm overseas. I'm willing to except money, and guns or a combination of the two. Please don't come at me with a piece of crap and then flag my post as spam when I'm not interested. The picture of me and the drag bag is old but that's it. It's painted now though. The tan was standing out a little. Here's all the stuff that my father-in-law has:
(1) PSL-54C chambered in 7.62x54R

300 rounds loose Wolf 55gr FMJ (no boxes):
196 rounds of Herter’s 55gr FMJ in the boxes:

320 rounds Wolf (WPA) Wolf 62gr Soft Point (SP) in the boxes:
300 rounds of mixed Wolf and Tula 62gr HP loose:
Total is 2116 rounds.  The loose ammo was loaded in aluminum NATO spec magazines and stored in my safe. There are likely more rounds of loose ammo but I am underestimating in case I loaded those mags to 29 instead of 30. The boxed ammo was stored in an airtight ammo can in a closet.

I'm not interested in shipping it so I'm listing it for .20 a round. Total for all 2116 rounds would be 423.00 but if you buy the whole thing I will let it go for 400.00. If you want less than the whole thing, I will sell for .20 a round in the batches listed (I won't split up a batch). 

Please save us both some time and look online at the cheapest you can find this ammo either on Armslist, Gunbroker, a retailer, or anywhere you want. The cheapest you are going to find it is .22 a round on gunbroker plus the $25 or so to ship it. Don't shoot me low ball offers.

The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

This Glock has had stippling done, which makes it DRASTICALLY more comfortable, and it is much easier to hold onto.   It's in great condition, and every Glock it has a lifetime warranty.

I got the gun recently.  The day AFTER I got it, my renter (I own a duplex, live in one side, rent out the other), lost her job.  I know she’s going to have problems paying rent next month.  I will buy another one when she gets a job again and returns to paying rent reliably.  Simple as that.  This is NOTHING wrong with the gun in any way that I know of.

 Type B Gas Vent Systems Give You These Important Advantages
 Safety of the Hart & Cooley® system is assured by the double-wall, air-insulated design and locking joints. Properly installed, the vent cannot come apart through vibration, and offers protection against vent failure or fire hazard. Type B Gas Vent is designed for negative pressure applications and flue gas temperatures not exceeding 400°F above ambient for Category I appliances.
 Durability is the result of high-quality materials and workmanship, with galvanized outer pipe and aluminum inner pipe providing protection against corrosion and external damage.
 Simple installation is achieved with a complete line of adjustable fittings and various lengths of pipe. Curled ends lock together for stability and easy assembly. A full set of installation instructions are supplied with all caps and supports.
 HART & COOLEY® B-VENT complies with the latest Underwriters Laboratories Standard No. 441 and Bears the Mark.
 B-Vent Features
• 3"" to 12"" inner and outer pipe curled together as an integral unit.
• 14"" - 30"" sizes have a snap-lock coupling system.
• Unique locking band provides 360° turning radius of the pipe and fittings.
• Locking band slides over tabs easily, locks firmly without twisting. Locking tabs hold pipe securely together, can be easily unlocked.
• Reinforced ends-- curled bead on end of outer pipe for rigidity and strength.
• Deep Locking Groove assures solid joint and secure lock.
• The 4RPX pipe is UL-listed for installation in a 2x6 wall.
• Corrosion-resistant aluminum inner wall for rapid warm-up.
• Galvanized steel outer pipe for maximum protection.
• Positive Stop--provides proper alignment and positive fit for mating end of pipe or fitting."

Having searched for land multiple times over the last 15 years, we know firsthand how difficult it is to find property that is this nice. 

There is income potential from a select harvest of mature hardwoods that could be used to offset the purchase price.

Gain immediate equity. In the interest of a quick sale, the listed cost is just $500 more than the 2010 appraised value. That is an incredible bargain that leaves me no room to accept less than the asking price.  Purchasing land is a solid investment that will produce a big return. They don't make any more land!!

The age of this equipment is unknown. We purchased it 2 years ago from the original owner who had it posted on Craig's List. He lived near Warrenton, MO and used the tiller for his personal garden.

It has a 14.5"" Barrel with mid-length gas system and both the upper and lower receivers are BCM (top of the line AR manufacture). It is dressed in Magpul gear with the MIAD pistol grip, CTR collapsible stock, extended trigger guard and XTM rail panels. It also has a Tangodown vertical grip with cutout for the pressure switch for the weaponlight. The weaponlight is a Surefire M591, which is the same one used by the military in Iraq and Afghanistan currently. 

The rail system is a Midwest Industries free floating monolithic aluminum rail that directly mounts to the barrel receiver and not the delta ring.

The optic is an Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) red dot that co-witnesses with the Troy Battlesight rear flip up sight and the A2 front sight. Both the rear flip up sight and the front A2 sight have tritium inserts that glow int he dark without needing any light.

I have a Spikes Tactical ST-T2 buffer and Tubbs flat wire buffer spring in it and KNS anti-rotation hammer and trigger pins installed. I also have installed a BCM Gunfighter charging handle installed on it for easier one handed operation.

I'll toss in six 30 round magazines, 2 metal BCM mags and 4 Magpul PMags.

This AR is fully Mil-Spec, none of that crappy Commercial stuff they have out now.

I have about 300 rounds through it so it is broken in and ready for battle or range use and is VERY dependable. I has never had a jam, failure to feed or failure to extract. It is cleaned thoroughly each time its shot and put away lubed and ready to go at a moments notice.

I have $2800 in the rifle and I am asking $2700 for it or possible even trade for vehicle or equal or higher value.

This is a top of the line AR-15 and the value will only go up, specially if there is another attempted ban or double that price if there is an actual ban on these.

Email with make/model, miles, running condition, any issues it has and I will email you back if interested so you can send me pictures. Must be dependable vehicle."

Each pouch can hold up to either 3 M/16, 2 AK, or 2 .308 magazines. It can hold 2 M/16 magazines with use of a coupler. The staggered design also allows a 20 round m/16 magazine to set up high enough within the internal stirrup to use along side with 30 rounders or to allow the user to identify certain magazines with unique purposes. Also within the internal stirrup , a M/18 smoke can be placed within. The MOTS also has an adjustable shock-cord via cord-locks which also helps to retain magazines within from mag rattle. MOLLE/PALS webbing is located on the sides of the pouch for additional modular pouches. Covered by HSGI Life Time Warranty. Made in the USA.

 Up for sale or trade is a pristine mathews ignithion youth bow. It's a real mathews bow with all the bells and whistles. A lot of you bows are Chinese junk with a big name label on them. The bow is rated for 40 lbs. It will go down to about 30 lbs.

Custom narrow grip (original grip included) Also comes with an extra cam. It is currently set up for a 20"" draw. The exta cam is for a 21"" draw. This is the best youth bow out there. It has a high let off which really help a youngster with shooting.
Other length cams are a available on eBay for around $50

No junk. No single shots. No hipoints or anything like that.

Worst I can do is say no.

It's in good condition with a solid bore and the barrel has no pitting. Every time I clean it I utilize something with ammonia. I can shoot a man sized target using military surplus at 650yds With the Romanian optic it comes with. The one that is pictured wouldn't hold a zero so I canned it. I still have the mount so if you have some American optics you can use it. The drag bag I have it in was issued to me during my tour to Afghanistan and my supply guy didn't want it back. The rifle is with my father In-law in E-town because I'm overseas. I'm willing to except money, and guns or a combination of the two. Please don't come at me with a piece of crap and then flag my post as spam when I'm not interested. The picture of me and the drag bag is old but that's it. It's painted now though. The tan was standing out a little. Here's all the stuff that my father-in-law has:
(1) PSL-54C chambered in 7.62x54R
(1) PSO-1 Romanian 
(1) drag bag
(1) bushnel range finder ~900m
(1) auxiliary mount for scope
(2) 10rds magazine
(2) 5rds magazine
