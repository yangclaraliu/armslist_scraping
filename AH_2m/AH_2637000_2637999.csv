Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal.

I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22.

From Manufacturer:
The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

The rifle has upgraded furniture which includes a Tapco pistol grip, Tapco Intrafuse handguard with side and bottom rails, Tapco vertical foregrip, AR-15 style collapsible stock and AK-74 style muzzle brake.  The Norinco Mak-90’s are some of the best AK’s period and especially for the money, they have a very smooth trigger pull for better accuracy, a 1.6mm thick receiver vs. 1mm found on most AK’s and they have a heavier chrome lined barrel, these are built to last.  These also have a blued finish vs. the black paint or other coating on other AK’s, so they are are nicer looking IMO and they have the chrome bolt, carrier and gas piston.

$900 cash or will look at good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, gold, silver etc. etc., so I know the deal, I like a bit of everything.

I'm not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL

Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool or a .450 Bushmaster, maybe complete rifles, but I have several complete AR’s now, just let me know 

Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)

Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal. 

Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails

Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal, I can convert these myself

Beretta 92FS INOX, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites

Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too.

XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred.

1911 pistols

Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be perfect for my AR-10

Maybe another Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.

Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everthing, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Will consider other firearms and ammo in the calibers listed above, just let me know the deal and I will consider.  Again, most of the items above would be a back-up to what I already have, so trades would need to be in my favor.

Ftf at or around Garland.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship

Both are lightly used in excellent condition.  I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link on here but if they don't get erased, check the links below for more details

1.  Ghost Blind - 4-Panel Predator - these are right at $200 plus shipping new:  http://www.amazon.com/GhostBlind-GBP-041P-AZ-Ghostblind-4-Panel-Predator/dp/B007R4QI1C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-1&keywords=ghost+blind  

2.  Ghost Blind Deluxe Carry bag with pouches, tie-down straps, and shoulder straps - extremely high-quality bag - I've been able to strap a Cat Quiver, Tripod, and folding decoy all the backside of it with the straps - if you read my review at Amazon, you will get more on this - well worth the money, this bag is:  http://www.amazon.com/Ghostblind-Deluxe-Carry-Predator-Blind/dp/B009DVA2GE/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=REDACTED&sr=8-3&keywords=ghost+blind

So this is in essence $300 worth of product here.  This is a fantastic blind system.  I just decided that's it's a bit too bulky to carry in as far as I usually go (not really heavy, just bulky).   But check out the vids on the manufacturer's site for effectiveness demonstrations:  http://www.ghostblind.com/

There are a few minor scuffs on the mirrors, which is inevitable with use, but this does NOT decrease the effectiveness of the blind, as the maker's site will explain.... There would have to be a LOT of big scratches before it might affect the effectively even a tiny amount.

Old Price:  $245

New Price:  Yours for $235 firm (I'm taking a $65 plus shipping hit here). 

If you want it shipped to your door anywhere in CONUS, due to size, I'm afraid I'd have to add about $60, but if actual cost ends up being less, I will send a refund with item when shipped.

BUT LIKE ALL OTHER HONEST MEN, I AM running low on .22 and for some odd reason I cant seem to find any at my local walmart for 22$ a 500 rnd bulk box because all of these jaggoffs that go stand in line at 7 am (while good americans are at work earning an HONEST living) just so they can resell said ammo to said hard working good americans at double or triple the price. so, I guess since im not on welfare and cant go stand up there in line on TUESDAY AND THURSDAY MORNINGS AT 7AM to get in line for my three boxes (and seriously, if you are so fucking broke that its worth the whole big 60 bux you will profit by spending 3 or 4 hours driving to walmart and standing in line and driving home, then spending even more time answering emails and driving to meet people, I mean really....that's like making 5 or 6 bux an hour when you extrapolate it. just pathetic really. but then greed is a terrible thing. some people are so disgustingly pathetic that just thinking how they are ""getting over"" on everyone and making ""so much money"" because they are just soooo clever. why don't you douchebags give it a fukking rest already and let someone get a fukking box of ammo you pathetic brokeass sacks of shite. but I guess the REALLY clever ones take their wife and get SIX boxes and make 120 dollars for their trouble. im seriously starting to get fukking irritated. I haven't been able to buy any .22 ammo since LAST SUMMER when I manged to luck out and my son and I were at bardstown walmart and got 6 boxes of white Winchester, have 2 left as you can see in the pic, and no, it isn't for sell.... but when we bought ammo we kept it to shoot tho, not to rip someone off. now thats almost gone, along with some more I already had and im down to about 3 or 4 thousand rounds of it and need more because im going to go .22 shooting next decent day and that will be another thousand rnds. gone. but yeah, if anyone has any for sell that is reasonable (not m22 black box Winchester tho, theres a recall on that stuff) id sure like to spend a hundred bux and get more than 1000 rnds for it. fukking rediculous and I hope someone gets tired of it and arranges to ""buy"" your overpriced ammo and then bashes your skull in and takes it, like robbing hood..."

It is my first Python and I'm telling myself there will always be more coming along. Bright Nickel with very minimal use. It is obvious the gun has been taken care of and stored most of its life. Unfortunately no box or papers so I purchased a nice gun pouch for it and it is shown in a couple pictures. I don't believe I would sell the item if it had the original box and papers but if I did, I would definitely ask more. The revolver has a whisper of a turn line and you have to look very close to see it. The grips are near perfect and the medallions are beautiful gold but my photos make them look silver. I use an FFL to do my shipping and receiving and the Buyer is responsible to know your State and local laws. Don't bid on the revolver if not legal where you live. It Will Not Ship. Shipping, Full Insurance and Signature Confirmation plus the FFL fee is approx. 75.00 and I split that with the buyer so the winner will pay 37.50 for his part of the costs. Shipping is also FFL to FFL only. I accept Bank Check/MO., Postal MO. and Personal Check. My bank is very fast and a personal check will clear in 1 day. Shipping is USPS Priority Express and I always keep the buyer informed of payment received, item shipped and tracking info. Please email any questions and I will reply ASAP.....Thanks."

I am not interested in any other models. My 1911 has been upgraded with Hogue grip pannels, Pachmyer rubber finger grooves, and two piece full length guide rod. I also polished all the internals (barrel, feed ramp, trigger bar, sear, disconnect, firing pin) using the Micro mesh process. This process only removes .001"" of the parrent material or less. The American Classic also comes well equipped from the factory with adjustable trigger and extended controls. The fit is amazingly tight, it's far tighter than my Springfield Range Officer, or my Ruger SR1911 and they are both new in the box! The only complaint I have about this gun is that it does punch paper low, but that's very common for this particular make and model. Invest in some adjustable sites and you could easily out shoot much higher priced pistols.
 I will want some boot or extras to accompany your rifle. How much will depend on the condition of the rifle offered. I am not a gouger however, If your rifle is new, or truely like new with low rounds and I don't have to travel far I would ask $50. If it shows some bluing wear around the edges but still very clean I would expect $75, and so on. 

** Apparently I need to add a quick note** I am not really wanting to sell. If you want to make a cash offer feel free, but any further emails just asking how much I want will be ignored. What I want is listed in the ad, not just once but twice. Also there are about ten gun stores within 5 minutes of my house.

The real beauty of this system is that 1 remote works all 3 lighting banks. And since there's 3 remotes, you can put them in various places.

I've got 3 of the light systems in the link above.  These are RADIO FREQUENCY  ( RF ) controlled, so the on/off remote can be put anywhere, it doesn't have to point at the lighting fixture to control it. You can actually have it anywhere in the safe or even in the room it's in. I had the remote in the door hanger.

These were $48.00 EACH at Sears, and $8.00 shipping per unit. Do the math.

SPEER GOLD DOT
9mm Luger +P 124 GR. GDHP

Reliable round with a long track record--issued as duty ammunition by the majority of US law enforcement agencies for many years.
Molecular bonding(a process similar to nickel plating) of this JHP's jacket material to its lead core allows for excellent weight retention and expansion, and ensures that it doesn't shed it's jacket--unlike traditional JHPs--during barrier penetration(i.e. glass, thick clothing, doors). Visual: http://www.speer-ammo.com/products/gold_dot_const.aspx


50 rounds per box, new and unopened.
Asking for:
$45 per box
or trade for 130-180 rounds of 9mm FMJ per box (depending on the quality)

These go for $25-$30 per 20 rd box online($1.20-$1.50/shot), which after shipping charges probably come out to be considerably more than that...
...not that you CAN order them online anyway; they are all either out of stock or back-ordered for like 6-12 months--almost impossible to get.
