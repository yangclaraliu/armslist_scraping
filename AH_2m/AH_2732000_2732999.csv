Here is the D.C. Engineering Dragonov Style Norinco SKS in like new condition. This company, DC Engineering, is worth taking a look at. They supply after market AK, Ar15, and SKS parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detroit magazine is hand welded in two separate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragonov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers a magazine adapter to use AK47 mags. $525.00 Cash only at this time.

You buy this ammo at a crazy inflated price, and I throw in a gun to shoot it with. And some holsters to wear that gun in these different scenarios:
1. Open carry.
2. Winter concealed carry outside waistband with a jacket or long shirt.
3. Anytime concealment inside waistband.
4. Deep concealment on your ankle.

The ammo is Federal 9mm Luger 115gr FMJ, 1000 rounds.
The gun is a Kahr CM9 which functions flawlessly, plus a few holsters.

No, I won't sell the ammo without the gun, this is a package deal. The price is firm. No trades.

The Kahr is in excellent condition. I put about 3500 rounds through it with very few failures. The failures I did have were all with the same 7-round magazine which is known to have issues. I traded that magazine in to Kahr for a 6-round replacement and all was well after that.

Upon reading that the recoil spring assembly is only good for 2000 rounds or so, I replaced it, but never had issues. I have a couple hundred rounds through it with the new recoil assembly on, also with no issues.

It's a great gun but I went with a .380 for a smaller, lighter option and just never use it anymore.

Kahr CM9

I have a great looking LWRC M6A2 that is one of the best of AR Gas Piston riffles on the market.  This is one of the most accurate AR platforms I have ever shot and that is why I got 2 of them so I figured I might let one go if the right deal comes by.  Here are the specs from online.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Barrel Length: 16.1""
Weight (unloaded): 7.3 lbs (16.1"" barrel)

Centered on the left side of the receiver panel is a multi-colored bronze medallion depicting a canvasback duck, the Ducks Unlimited mallard head logo, flanked by decorative scroll work. At the lower left, stamped in gold-colored script is Remington Model-1100TM and on the lower right is the serial number preceded by DU. Six hundred of these guns were sold directly to DU Chapters for fund raising dinners in 1973, and 10,000 sold conventionally............................................................................................................................ ........................................ As a follow-up to the first year's Remington 1100, DU chose an identically decorated 870 Wingmaster pump as its second Gun of the Year. Introduced in 1950 as a more inexpensively made version of the Model 31, the 870 went on to become a great waterfowling gun and the best-selling shotgun ever made. In 1974 there had already been over 2 million 870s produced, and today that number has climbed to more than 10 million. This DU version of the 870 has a 2 3/4-inch chamber, a 30-inch full-choke barrel, upgraded walnut on the stock and forearm, gold inlaid engraving, and an enameled DU crest on the receiver.

I believe the 1100 to be unfired and have the original hard case for it. The 870 appears to have been loaded and cycled but I am not certain if it was fired or not, I tried to take pictures to show this. They are in close to new condition as it gets with just a few handling marks. 
Price is for a FTF only shipping will be $80 insured."

This is a Detonics Combat Master .45acp with (2) Detonics 6 round magazines. This particular model is an un-catalogued model with no markings on either side of the slide or on the chamber of the barrel which from the research I have done says its a specialty made pistol for the executives or someone very close to the company heads.  Muzzle is crown cut which is ultra rare on these pistols. I have never seen another barrel cut like it on any of the Detonics I have seen. This pistol is SUPER CLEAN, ULTRA ACCURATE, and a blast to shoot. Trigger is smooth as silk and breaks like a $3,500 Wilson. The gentleman I bought it from 8 years ago had barely shot it and it looked new in box. I have put 400-500 down range and never had an issue. Cash sale preferred at this time, but always open to specialty or hard to find trades. 
This one is stamped Bellevue, WA and all parts have matching serial numbers etched into the gun parts by hand and match the last 3 serial digits. This handmade & assembled custom pistol and was years ahead of the compact 1911 design when it was produced back in the 80's. There are zero MIM(metal injection molding) parts in this pistol. No plastic or other cheap materials. I have tons of pictures and can shoot them if interested. Feel free to TEXT or CALL REDACTED. I have ordered a new WOLFF Recoil spring and firing pin spring just to update the pistol, but they have not been installed yet. Currently has the original 3 spring system which is still very strong and probably doesn’t need to be replaced.

We only put about 100 rounds through it before he decided he was more interested in revolvers so it just sits in my gun safe now.

Condition is of course excellent, and it will come with two magazines and the box and original papers. This one is the .22/45 which is meant to simulate the grip angle and feel of a Colt 1911. The trigger is great, sight picture is great, and the feel does in fact mimic a Colt. I will include a hundred rounds of .22 ammo with the gun so you don't have to wait to shoot it with your son or daughter. Ruger has a lifetime warranty so this is a pretty safe purchase. 

We had zero malfunctions in the short time it was used and I found it to be very accurate. In about 20 rounds, I had my son shooting empty shotgun shells with regularity and 25-40 yards with it. (By the way, it will fit in a USGI holster for the M1911 as well as about any other 1911 holster.

Contact me through Armslist and we can arrange to meet in person here in Santa Fe. This is a nice pistol and a lot of fun. I have had probably 15 Ruger Mk1s over the years and all of them have been about perfect. This one is no exception."

Alexander Arms says:

This tactical trigger unit has been designed specifically for field use and does not share a common heritage with a target trigger. For this reason, it is not recommended for target-type shooting, although it may be used with some success in this discipline. The trigger is basically a single stage unit with a bushing mounted disconnector, which is adjustable for engagement and over travel while the pull weight and disconnector engagement are fixed to ensure durability during hard use and inclement environments.

The trigger bow is intentionally narrower than those commonly found on target type triggers. This assists with accurate reference of the trigger finger if the unit is used with gloves or in cold/wet conditions. The pull weight allows manipulation of the trigger with gloves while minimizing the possibility of discharging a round unexpectedly in the manner of a target trigger. In extreme cold conditions the trigger can still be used with mitts with the trigger guard pivoted down, although this is not recommended.

The unit is manufactured from an S7 type tool steel and is through-hardened to provide a durable base. The surface is chrome-plated using a technique that creates a dense finish and a surface hardness in excess of 72 HRC. This surface provides the durability for the trigger in adverse conditions and, hence, the surfaces on both the trigger and the hammer should not be further polished or honed."
