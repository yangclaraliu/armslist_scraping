I bought two of everything when preparing for this build.  One for me and one for my girlfriend.  She has an AR and wanted to step up to this when she had funds so I bought in advance.   We broke up so therefore I don’t expect she’ll be buying this anymore and I really don’t need to build an identical AR-15 to the one I have.  The parts are all BRAND NEW, never installed or even saw a bench.   I can sell the parts or I can sell the complete upper that I built which is beautiful and a tack driver!   If you are interested in the complete upper it’s available with or without Yankee Hill flip up sights.   I will not sell the sights separate and they are already dialed in at 100yds.  The price listed below is exactly what it cost me in high grade mil-spec parts.  There is no profit in this price at all or any charge for my labor to build.  I enjoy doing builds so if you don’t want to build well than this is a good deal for a SWAT grade upper.

Price:$ 525
Manufacturer:Taurus, We have for sale a New In Box Stainless Steel Taurus Judge Public Defender chambered in .45lc/.410 shotgun shell. This is the ""Concealed Carry"" version of the super popular Judge.
This is by far one of the most popular guns on the market today. It comes with a couple different types of bullets. Some .45's .4 triple 000 rounds, some pdx 1's, and a few other types in believe. You can put 5 different bullets in the gun at one time. 
The newest version of the Judge might just revolutionize small frame revolvers. The Model 4510 Public Defender delivers the same devastating power in a new scaled-down size that can travel with you. Available in a carbon steel or stainless steel frame and with the option of a Titanium cylinder, the new Public Defender also features a reduced pro le hammer that wont catch when it needs to come out quickly. Below it says caliber and .410/.45 wasn't an option so it had to put just .45 but in fact it does chamber both size rounds.

http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-Desert-Eagle-1911-G-Model.asp

Purchased last month. Only about 100rds down the pipe. 
Only been to the range twice and cleaned both times. 
Never been carried. Has no Holster wear.

I love 1911's but I just dont shoot very well with them. I just shoot better with Glocks.

This is in my opinion the best 1911 under $1000. I urge you to read some reviews and you will hear nothing but good things about this pistol. 

It is a tack driver ! Not in my hands but a couple of buddies of mine shot extremely well with it. 

I am only trying to get back close to what I paid for it. May be willing to include extra mags or ammo to close the deal.

You've been asking for a couple heavy 45 AUTO RIM standard pressure loads, so by popular demand, here they are. Both of these loads utilize high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the ballistic equivalent of +P 45 ACP loads, yet they operate at standard 45 ACP pressures. These loads are safe to use in ANY 45 ACP revolver that is in normal operating condition, including ANY model 1917 Colt or S&W revolver.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch MT Gun gives velocities almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 inch and 6.5 inch barrels. This is not a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel.

Item # 31A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 869 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 795 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 880 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 875 FPS

Item # 31A was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot through stick frame and dry wall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 27 inches of penetration through live flesh and bone."

Finishing an 80% lower is an easy, affordable and satisfying way to build your own custom AR-15.
These are so easy to finish you can damn-near do it entirely with a Dremel but a drill press is recommended. Use a #115 Dremel bit or 3/8"" or smaller end mill bit to route out the fire control pocket, then drill the hammer/trigger pin holes, the selector hole and the trigger hole to finish your receiver. Instructions are available online along with numerous youtube videos for additional support, links can be provided if necessary. If you go slow and steady it's almost impossible to not finish with a working receiver.


Jigless 80% Lower Receiver - Black

Here it is - a JIGLESS 80 percent AR receiver. Machining with a Jig will soon be a glimpse of the past. We bring you an 80 percent lower that can be machined without a jig! Correct - you do not need a Jig to complete this AR Lower Receiver! This 80% lower receiver is made with a Kevlar reinforced polymer. No Jig is required to machine out. Simply get rid of all the white.
Although this product can be completed without a jig, it is still recommended that a jig be used especially for the inexperienced builder. We will NOT warranty a product for Trigger Holes / Safety Selector / Trigger pocket being miss-drilled by the customer. Thank you

I am selling my Wifes' FireStorm  38 Special. She asked for a revolver, she got a revolver, and realized they're bigger than she wated.  She wants something much smaller.  Only been fired once, about 50 rounds put through it.  It being a revolver, it is extremely reliable. I will be including a box of 25 hollow-points, and a  50 ct box of standard ball ammo. I am the original owner of this gun. As you can see in the photos this is a ""hammerless"" model (IE: No grip to pull the hammer back with your thumb).  The hammer can still be locked back by hand by partially pulling the trigger grabbing the hammer with your thumb.  (Do this at your own risk, don't be an idiot and hurt yourself, or God-forbid, someone else.  If you're not confident in your abilities to do so, don't do it. I'm not responsible for your actions you decided to take upon yourself to do ""Because you saw it on the internet."") Disclaimer stated, it has an extremely light trigger pull when the hammer is pulled back.  It's awesome.  

There is good documentation online on accessories for these revolvers. Usually found under the Bersa name.  Hand grips are widely available. If we were going to keep it, that would be something I purchased. But the Mrs wants something smaller. (Go figure...)

Arms Corp built this design for Bersa for many years if I remember correctly, and stopped building under the Bersa name a few years ago. 


Included but not pictured, is the original case, first shot brass, and all paperwork associated with the gun from the MFR.


If you are interested in purchasing, You can email me at the included email address, and we can make arrangements to meet. I will be documenting the sale on paper, and making a photocopy of your valid drivers license to be printed up and stored with my copy of the paperwork. We will each have a copy of the paperwork. I'm not interested in finding your house or where you live, stealing your identity, etc. I just want to keep myself clear if something happens involving the firearm. It will stay locked up in my safe for eternity."

Product description
Important Aimpoint CompM2, ML2 and M3 Mounting Considerations:
Do to the Accucam mounting mechanism being located on the non-ejection port side of most weapons, the battery/brightness control mechanism of the Aimpoint will be located at the 10:00 o'clock position as shown in the above image (non-ejection port side), instead of the 2:00 o'clock position (ejection port side). This allows a right handed shooter to easily operate the Accucam QD mechanism and the brightness control knob with the off hand instead of the fire control hand. The windage and elevation adjustments are also rotated.

Important Aimpoint CompM3 Rubber Cover Consideration: 
If you intend to use the rubber cover included with your Aimpoint CompM3, it will need to be modified to fit with the Accucam QD Aimpoint Cantilever Mount. 

Product Description:
Many of you have asked us to develop a quick detach system for our combat tested Aimpoint Cantilever Ring. With the development of our Accucam Quick Detach Locking Lever System we are now able to fill those requests. The Accucam Quick Detach Aimpoint Cantilever Ring has the same robust features as our original Aimpoint Cantilever Ring. The body is manufactured from solid billet 6061 T6 aluminum and six cap screws firmly hold the Aimpoint in place. Also, a spare battery is kept handy in an insulatd capped waterproof compartment. The height of the Aimpoint QD Cantilever Ring allows for ""True Absolute Co-Witnessing"" when using back up iron sights.
The Accucam QD Locking Lever System provides you with a solid method to quickly install or remove your Aimpoint mount from the weapon system. The Aimpoint can quickly be installed on a dovetail rail in seconds by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the locked position. It can then be quickly removed by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the unlocked position. It is fully adjustable to fit worn or out of spec MIL-STD-1913 dovetails. Not recommended for .50 BMG or lightweight machine guns.
In tests, the Accucam Locking Lever System has shown to be repeatable to 1/2 MOA. The unique finger loop design is easily operated, even with a gloved hand and the rounded design is ergonomic and virtually snag-proof. The Accucam mechanism is manufactured from solid billet 4140 steel and manganese phosphated black to mil-spec."

I'm looking for full size Kimber 1911 double stack 45 acp in excellent condition (composite lower).  I'd prefer a CUSTOM but will consider all in excellent condition.  Will also consider purchasing just the lower if it is in excellent condition and build the rest of the gun myself.

You might be wondering why I'm advertising looking for a Kimber 1911 double stack when there are at least 2 on Armslist?  Well, these individuals are apparently afraid of technology and the concept of selling a firearm through FFL and PayPal.  If you can setup an Armslist account and post an ad, you can setup a PayPal account and REQUEST A PAYMENT.  It is so easy that even a child could do it... and it protects both you (the seller) and me (the buyer).

This is how it would work if we agree on a sale:
1) You: make a REQUEST FOR PAYMENT on PayPal to me (include details of the gun, serial number, and the FFL you plan to ship from).
2) I call the your FFL to verify them and to provide my FFL information.
3) You: go to the your FFL and I call them to verify your gun and then I submit payment on PayPal.
4) You: verify payment received and I setup shipping with your FFL and MY gun.  You get to keep a copy of receipt for shipping from FFL (your proof you left gun with FFL).
5) You enjoy your $, I enjoy my gun.

PayPal wouldn't stay in business or serve any purpose unless they protected both buyer and seller.  Don't be afraid... not all technology is bad.

Extras - Comes with a sling, two 30-round mags and a rail on top of the carry handle for mounting optics. This rifle comes with back-up/iron sights. Please note that this rifle does NOT come with the red dot optics as pictured. The M17-S was a commercial bullpup rifle sold by the Bushmaster Firearms company of Windham, Maine, from 1994 to 2005. It was the first bullpup-configured rifle available commercially in the American market. Making use of a self-compensating gas system and a rotating bolt, the receiver is designed to be easily field stripped for cleaning, employing a captive-push-pin system to both open up the receiver and yet retain the push pins to prevent their loss in the field. The barrel length is 21.5 inches, with 6 lands/grooves, and incorporates a 1:9"" twist. The butt-stock is integrated into the rear of the receiver in typical bullpup style, and the pistol grip is sharply angled to facilitate an ergonomic and comfortable grip whether shooting from the shoulder or off the shoulder. The carry handle also has a rail mounted to its top, allowing one to mount any type of standard optics. Magazine releases on each side of the rifle and a top-mounted charging handle allow for ambidextrous use, and it accepts any standard AR/M4/M16 magazine. Rare, and highly sought-after! Will ship through FFL. Must have a copy of the FFL it's going to be delivered to. Money order only. Shipping charges extra. NO Trades please! Please don't email me asking if it's available. If you see this post it is available."

I bought 2 of these and this one only has 2 mags through it (30 rounds) with no issues. One cool feature on the CZ compared to the Sig is the Decock lever/slide release is integrated into the single lever which is more efficient than having two levers in my opinion.

Savage Axis .223 Rem. One owner, me. Less than 75 rounds fired. 99% condition. Only evidence of use is some light abrasion on the bottom of the grip and the bolt has very light markings from being worked. I can send more pictures of the rifle to interested buyers.

 No scope, but it has weaver bases. No field sights. 

The target pictures show my best groups when I first got the rifle, a 3X group in a touching clover leaf and then another 2X touching group after scope adjustment. All at 100yds. 

The next target show a 3X group at 100yds with 2X touching and one shot less than .5 inches away for a group less than 0.6 inches. Then there is a 3X group at 200 yds that measures just under 2 inches.

It shot my hand loads very well, 50gr V-max with Benchmark powder, as seen in the pictures. I do not how it performs with factory ammo, I only ever shot hand loads, no steel junk ammo. It is only chambered for .223 Rem, no 5.56 ammo.

Great rifle that is light, accurate, and handles very well.

Will include 100 rounds of factory loaded Winchester white box ammunition with FTF transactions. Will ship at buyers expense.

When needed it just flips up out of rail otherwise you can install your choice of sighting system.

these rifles have matching bayonets and are not-counterbored are the most notable things.

when imported bayonets at often mixed up and no one wants to dig through an actual pile of pointy metal things with numbers marked on them so they just grab one and sell it with the nearest rifle
bores are also occasionally counter-bored and affect accuracy

1895-1911 W. Richards 12 Gauge SxS Underlever Shotgun. You don't see many of these underlevers around. It has a 28.25"" Cast Steel Barrel (un-cut), Functioning side hammers and working double triggers. Walnut stock is in good shape.  No scroll work on wood or metal. Has incorrect bolt for breech pivot pin. Left firing Pin needs replaced to make mechanically functional. Not recommended for shooting, and not to be confused with Wesley or William Richards shotguns.

1966 Rohm RG10 .22short revolver, blued w/white plastic grips, 2.5"" barrel – Excellent+ condition w/original box and 13 rounds of ammo. Box of ammo are likely as old as the gun. Great trainer or novelty piece.

1972 Remington Speedmaster 552 .22 (S,L,LR) tube fed semi-auto, 23.5"" barrel - Great working and physical condition. Bluing is strong with some scratches mainly on the receiver. Stock has a few minor dings as might be expected, but looks very good. I've taken this one down and did a thorough cleaning. It is in great shape with a bright shiny bore.

1975 Winchester Model 94 30-30, blued w/wood stock, 20"" barrel – Great working and Physical condition. Has some minor pitting, especially on one side of receiver, due to setting for many years. The rust and finish have been removed from the left side of the receiver where most of the pitting is located. Because of the difficulty in bluing this model, it will either need to be sent out for special processing, or one could go the paint route. Brownell's has a product called Paint & Bake that is said to look very nice and is very durable. It was owned by a very elderly man who has passed away. Considering he was up in his years when he bought it new, I would guess it did not get much use. The action and condition also indicate very little use.

1976 Glenfield Model 60 .22LR, tube fed semi-auto – Very good condition with the stock having some minor scratches and thinning of the finish in a couple places. Checkering is in great shape. Also has a Bushnell 4x Sportview 22 scope. Overall a good looking rifle. If the stock were just a little better, I'd grade it excellent.

The holster has been sold and is not included in the sale.

The original owner indicated that he had fired one box of ammo before placing this in his nightstand. Judging by its pristine condition I have no reason to doubt the statement. Also, this is appears to be a “New” model Vaquero as it begins with S/N 510 – xxxxxxxx  and was produced with the revised cylinder bore process as the Ruger “Billboard” safety warning is under the barrel as opposed to the side… more aesthetically appealing…that’s up to you.
