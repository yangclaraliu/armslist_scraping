A quality holster is paramount when taking on the responsibility of carrying a firearm.


 Hero Holsters LLC offers high-quality inside the waistband (IWB) holsters at a very competitive price. We are also the first to offer in our regular lineup, an IWB with true level one retention by way of a thumb break. Some people say that active retention on a concealed holster is pointless. Sure, if gun safety and peace of mind is pointless then yes it is.

If you're new to the idea of IWB carry, let's go over the benefits:
1) Highly concealable. An outside holster has much more likelihood to ""print"" against the clothing covering it. IWBs all but disappear.
 2) Ease of reholstering. A cheap nylon ""fits-all"" type of holster will collapse inside the waistband as soon as you draw the gun. This makes range time very frustrating.
3) Comfort. Yes, really- the leather across the back goes towards the body and spreads the contact of the weapon out across the body to avoid points of pressure.

Come take a look at our website at www.HeroHolsters.com. Hero Holsters LLC was founded by a Sheriff's detective with ten years on the job before getting shot multiple times and having to taking a medical retirement.

A hero is an ordinary person who does an extraordinary thing. Be extraordinary.

Open top holsters are $50. The Officer model with active retention is $65."

These are very difficult to find.  I bought this one last month and customized it for action pistol competition USPSA Production.

This gun has all the goodies from CZ Custom including short reset trigger.  Trigger was done locally and professionally.  Double action is about 4.5#, single action is 1.5#.

Price includes everything that it came with from CZ Custom, 3 full capacity magazines, as well as trigger job parts/springs.

This gun is ready to put on your hip and compete at the highest levels of USPSA.

We have many sets available if you are interested.  Because of our last listing I thought I would clear up a few misconceptions. 
PTS does not mean airsoft, it stands for Practice, training, simulation.  These sights were made under license from Magpul.  They are from the same Dupont polymer as the top end line many call the MOE MBUS.  Since we sell both of the sets we have been able to compare similarities and longevity.  To me these are not much different than the MOE line, size, function, spring, brand of screws, etc.  These make extremely cost effective back up sights,  after all these are like I said ""back up sights""  opened up only when your optics loose battery life.  Magpul is not going to water down their brand even in this lower end market by putting out a subpar product.  I do warn there are copies/clones all over the place, but we had a supplier out of Denver com to us with these a few years ago and proved to us these were a licensed product, even gave us 4 months to sample and demo sets to see if we approved.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

I had the 4 lb trigger spring installed but can be swapped out with a 5.5 (have all factory and additional apex parts still). This gun has only seen 250-300 rounds with absolutely no failures.

I'm looking to spend between 500-700, maybe a little more for the right deal that includes a mint rifle with extras, or NIB.  If you're going to offer me a WASR, it's gotta be mechanically perfect and reasonably priced (we all know it's not worth anywhere near a grand like some bozos are asking on here).  If you're asking more for a stock used rifle in general than I can buy it for new, don't bother.

I've got cash:  please tell me exactly what you have, exactly what you want for it, and be willing to send pictures.  I will travel for the right deal, but you must be willing to meet part way if you live a distance away, or be extremely reasonable on the price.

From the manufacturer’s web site:

This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

517,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2783517,For Sale:  Speer 223 Nickel Plated Brass - Awsome Stuff!,"Statewide, Alabama, United States",$ 9,"Listed On: Thursday, March 13, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have right around 1,500 pieces out of the 4,000 pieces of Speer 223 Nickel Plated Brass left from 4 days ago when I ran the add.
 This is all once fired, very clean, and should re-load 7-8 times. 
 This brass will feed smoother than regular brass and besides the ease of chambering in your gun it holds sub-MOA at over 125 yrds in a ruger m77 mkII varmint. 
 There are some great benefits to Nickel Plated Brass that many don't realize and it is the reason all your high dollar ammo makers use it in rounds that really count:
 1. Reduced Friction: Nickel is harder than the brass from which cartridge cases are made. The nickel plating on the outside of the case prevents dirt and grit from embedding in the surface of the case. This reduces the friction of the case as it works its way through the magazine, into the chamber prior to firing and then out of the chamber after the shooter fires the cartridge.
 2. Corrosion Resistance: Brass is susceptible to corrosion, especially if it is exposed to the elements. Leather cartridge belts, in particular, tend to cause brass to corrode. This corrosion may eventually damage the cartridge, and it can also interfere with the operation of the rifle or pistol. Nickel plating almost completely eliminates this type of corrosion. 
 3. Increased Visibility: The case is the most expensive component of a cartridge. It is also the only reusable component. Shooting hobbyists who reload their spent cases must search the ground to retrieve any cases they may have dropped. This is a good idea even for those who do not reload. The problem is that unplated brass cases develop a patina upon firing, which makes them blend into the ground. A nickel plated case remains shiny even after firing, so it is much easier to spot.
 4. Damage Visibility: Scratches in a cartridge case can render it unsuitable for reloading. Also, once a case has been reloaded multiple times, it begins to wear out and develop thin areas. The patina that a brass case develops after firing can mask these danger signals. The nickel on a plated case is thin and relatively easy to damage, and the underlying brass tends to show through any scratches or other damage. This serves as an indication to the hobbyist to discard the case, rather than reloading it.

 I'm asking 9.90 per hundred on it and if it was un-fired rather than once-fired, it would be worth 28.00+ for a 100 and then after you loaded and shot it once you would be right here, but at 3 times the money.

 I only have this one 4000 lot batch and then its gone, so if your wanting some please don't wait long, or you will miss out.

 It will be shipped only and the price is thus:
 200 pieces Shipped to you 25.00. That is a small 2 day Priority Box.
 400 Pieces will be 2 boxes at 25.00
 Over 400 pieces will be in a Medium Box, or Large if Someone wants a big batch.

 Pay Pal is my preference and give you the buyer 100% safety if there is any problem.
 I also take credit cards over the phone and can do a check in the mail if needed.

 I ship every day Monday - Friday. When payment is received I buy postage and e-mail you with information and tracking number. I pack and ship brass the following day. From payment to receiving brass usually takes 3 days total, excluding weekends, and its delivered to your front door.

 When enquiring please let me know how many pieces your looking to get and I will shoot you a price with shipping included and then you can go from there.

 I also have large quantities of 223 in regular brass also and 9mm, 40s&w, 45acp, 38Sp, etc. and limited quantities of other rifle brass. If you send me an e-mail I will let you know availability and prices.

FAQ on trigger Pull 

The CZ custom hammer will give you a ""full"" trigger pull of about 3.8 to 4.2lbs but creep free.  The reason I say ?full? is that is what the trigger will need to activate fully. I.e. hanging a weight on the trigger. If we could actually weight the break point of the sear less the trigger return spring, The actual beak point of the sear hammer engagement is about 1.5/2.0Lbs the rest is the trigger return spring, since we normally don't let the trigger all the way forward for subsequent shot the sear break point matter more then overall trigger weight. To lighten the trigger more it is necessary to lighten the trigger return spring, this can be done by careful bending, also replace the mainspring with something lighter a 13lb or 15lb mainspring, this depends on the type of ammo you are going to shoot? I shoot a 13Lb mainspring, having said that I load my own ammo so can choose the primer sensitivity and depth.

533,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2783533,For Sale:  Speer 223 Nickel Plated Brass - Awsome Stuff!,"StateWide, California, United States",$ 9,"Listed On: Thursday, March 13, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have right around 1,500 pieces out of the 4,000 pieces of Speer 223 Nickel Plated Brass left from 4 days ago when I ran the add. 
 This is all once fired, very clean, and should re-load 7-8 times. 
 This brass will feed smoother than regular brass and besides the ease of chambering in your gun it holds sub-MOA at over 125 yrds in a ruger m77 mkII varmint. 
 There are some great benefits to Nickel Plated Brass that many don't realize and it is the reason all your high dollar ammo makers use it in rounds that really count:
 1. Reduced Friction: Nickel is harder than the brass from which cartridge cases are made. The nickel plating on the outside of the case prevents dirt and grit from embedding in the surface of the case. This reduces the friction of the case as it works its way through the magazine, into the chamber prior to firing and then out of the chamber after the shooter fires the cartridge.
 2. Corrosion Resistance: Brass is susceptible to corrosion, especially if it is exposed to the elements. Leather cartridge belts, in particular, tend to cause brass to corrode. This corrosion may eventually damage the cartridge, and it can also interfere with the operation of the rifle or pistol. Nickel plating almost completely eliminates this type of corrosion. 
 3. Increased Visibility: The case is the most expensive component of a cartridge. It is also the only reusable component. Shooting hobbyists who reload their spent cases must search the ground to retrieve any cases they may have dropped. This is a good idea even for those who do not reload. The problem is that unplated brass cases develop a patina upon firing, which makes them blend into the ground. A nickel plated case remains shiny even after firing, so it is much easier to spot.
 4. Damage Visibility: Scratches in a cartridge case can render it unsuitable for reloading. Also, once a case has been reloaded multiple times, it begins to wear out and develop thin areas. The patina that a brass case develops after firing can mask these danger signals. The nickel on a plated case is thin and relatively easy to damage, and the underlying brass tends to show through any scratches or other damage. This serves as an indication to the hobbyist to discard the case, rather than reloading it.

 I'm asking 9.90 per hundred on it and if it was un-fired rather than once-fired, it would be worth 28.00+ for a 100 and then after you loaded and shot it once you would be right here, but at 3 times the money.

 It will be shipped only and the price is thus:
 200 pieces Shipped to you 25.00. That is a small 2 day Priority Box.
 400 Pieces will be 2 boxes at 25.00

 I ship every day Monday - Friday. When payment is received I buy postage and e-mail you with information and tracking number. I pack and ship brass the following day. From payment to receiving brass usually takes 3 days total, excluding weekends, and its delivered to your front door.

549,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2783549,For Sale:  Speer 223 Nickel Plated Brass - Awsome Stuff!,"StateWide, Connecticut, United States",$ 9,"Listed On: Thursday, March 13, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have right around 1,500 pieces out of the 4,000 pieces of Speer 223 Nickel Plated Brass left from 4 days ago when I ran the add. 
 This is all once fired, very clean, and should re-load 7-8 times. 
 This brass will feed smoother than regular brass and besides the ease of chambering in your gun it holds sub-MOA at over 125 yrds in a ruger m77 mkII varmint. 
 There are some great benefits to Nickel Plated Brass that many don't realize and it is the reason all your high dollar ammo makers use it in rounds that really count:
 1. Reduced Friction: Nickel is harder than the brass from which cartridge cases are made. The nickel plating on the outside of the case prevents dirt and grit from embedding in the surface of the case. This reduces the friction of the case as it works its way through the magazine, into the chamber prior to firing and then out of the chamber after the shooter fires the cartridge.
 2. Corrosion Resistance: Brass is susceptible to corrosion, especially if it is exposed to the elements. Leather cartridge belts, in particular, tend to cause brass to corrode. This corrosion may eventually damage the cartridge, and it can also interfere with the operation of the rifle or pistol. Nickel plating almost completely eliminates this type of corrosion. 
 3. Increased Visibility: The case is the most expensive component of a cartridge. It is also the only reusable component. Shooting hobbyists who reload their spent cases must search the ground to retrieve any cases they may have dropped. This is a good idea even for those who do not reload. The problem is that unplated brass cases develop a patina upon firing, which makes them blend into the ground. A nickel plated case remains shiny even after firing, so it is much easier to spot.
 4. Damage Visibility: Scratches in a cartridge case can render it unsuitable for reloading. Also, once a case has been reloaded multiple times, it begins to wear out and develop thin areas. The patina that a brass case develops after firing can mask these danger signals. The nickel on a plated case is thin and relatively easy to damage, and the underlying brass tends to show through any scratches or other damage. This serves as an indication to the hobbyist to discard the case, rather than reloading it.

 I'm asking 9.90 per hundred on it and if it was un-fired rather than once-fired, it would be worth 28.00+ for a 100 and then after you loaded and shot it once you would be right here, but at 3 times the money.

 I only have this one 4000 lot batch and then its gone, so if your wanting some please don't wait long, or you will miss out.

 It will be shipped only and the price is thus:
 200 pieces Shipped to you 25.00. That is a small 2 day Priority Box.
 400 Pieces will be 2 boxes at 25.00
 Over 400 pieces will be in a Medium Box, or Large if Someone wants a big batch.

 Pay Pal is my preference and give you the buyer 100% safety if there is any problem.
 I also take credit cards over the phone and can do a check in the mail if needed.

 I ship every day Monday - Friday. When payment is received I buy postage and e-mail you with information and tracking number. I pack and ship brass the following day. From payment to receiving brass usually takes 3 days total, excluding weekends, and its delivered to your front door.

 When enquiring please let me know how many pieces your looking to get and I will shoot you a price with shipping included and then you can go from there.

 I also have large quantities of 223 in regular brass also and 9mm, 40s&w, 45acp, 38Sp, etc. and limited quantities of other rifle brass. If you send me an e-mail I will let you know availability and prices.

It is a left handed, long action, model 700.  It appears to be glass bedded in an olive drab, aftermarket (possibly McMillan) stock.  It has a stainless, aftermarket, 22""ish (if memory serves correct) barrel, with a threaded muzzle with a cap.  He said the action and trigger appear to have been ""worked.""  It looks like an ADL (no trap door), but without removing it from the stock, he couldn't be certain.
This rifle has seen some use, and I won't pretend to believe that it was a safe queen, but it is a really nice rifle, with a REALLY smooth action.  The round count is unknown.

This particular ""baby eagle"" model is becoming increasingly rare. In recent years of the pistols production, Charles Daly (who has now gone out of business) had taken over the importation of the firearm from Magnum Research, at which point the pistols name changed to the IWI Jericho 941.

the ""Desert Eagle Pistol"" on the side of the slide and ""Israel Military Industries"", but have yet to have found another one for sale. This would be an awesome piece to add to a collection.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

The Vetterli rifles were a series of Swiss army service rifles in use from 1869 to circa 1890, when they were replaced with Schmidt-Rubin rifles. Modified Vetterli rifles were also used by the Italian Army.

The Swiss Vetterli rifles combined the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine and a bolt system derived from the German Dreyse needle gun. They were also the first repeating rifle to feature a self-cocking action and a small caliber. Due to the Swiss Federal Council's early 1866 decision to equip the army with a breechloading repeating rifle, the Vetterli rifles were, at the time of their introduction, the most advanced military rifles in Europe.  The Vetterli was the replacement for Milbank-Amsler rifles, which were a metallic cartridge conversion from previous muzzle loading rifles."

Product Description:
Details

This quality 7.62x39mm ammo is great for training with your AK-47 and is available at a great price due to a special buy opportunity! Wolf had an opportunity to bring in a few containers of 2010 production ammo from a contract that fell through and they couldn't pass up on the opportunity. This ammo has sat inside of the factory for the last few years so it has been kept dry and safe from the elements. This ammo was produced in the generic white box usually designated for contracts that don't require the fancier packaging but it’s the same great ammo."

I have a Sig P938 that I'd considering trading. I like it I just prefer carrying my 1911. I can an a Benchmade infidel 3300 all black for the right trade. The Sig comes with everything in the box, a custom kydex IWB holster, and an AE Nelson holster. I've only shot it once. Two boxes of ammo through it (100rounds). I carred it for a week, I just like my 1911 better. I paid $680 for it, $35 for the AE Nelson holster, $65 for the kydex
