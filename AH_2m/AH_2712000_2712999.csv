Like new, manufacturer refurbished, Nikon Monarch ATB 8.5 x 56mm Binoculars -- just received from Nikon last week, see packing sleep. I bought them new last summer and they were just recently serviced to meet factory standards, see picture. The lenses are in flawless condition. The body is in great condition. And, the neckstrap has never been used. The front lens cover, however, does have some damage, see picture, but it is only cosmetic and does not affect functionality in any way; moreover, I recommend getting an aftermarket chest harness with lens covers anyway, like the one found here: http://10000birds.com/s4-gear-lockdown-binocular-harness.htm

My thoughts: These binoculars are fantastic. Perfect for the hunter who is priced out of the leica/zeiss/swarovski market, but still wants a topnotch optic. They binoculars are the ideal magnification for hunting in the Rocky Mountains, and, the larger objective -- 56mm -- lets in a ton of light. Also, the image and clarity of these binoculars is superb. For the price, you just cannot be disappointed. Look at how they rank on Allbinos, the worlds foremost binocular review website: http://www.allbinos.com/allbinos_ranking-binoculars_ranking-8x56.html Notice how they compare to more expensive alternatives. This ranking and review, along with other positive feedback found online, is what sold me on the binoculars; and I couldn’t have been more pleased with them in the field. Despite any negative feedback you might find out there about Nikon optics, usually in regard to the plastics they use, the company is known for producing high quality glass which, of course, is the top priority for quality optics. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

This is a Detonics Combat Master with 2 authentic Detonics 6 round magazines. I have two others for sale seperately $50 each (can be included for right offer). This particular model has no markings or lettering on either side of the slide, nor on the barrel chamber which means that it was a pistol made for the higher ups, executives, or someone with a special link to the executives. the Muzzle is crown cut which is ultra rare on these pistols. I have never seen another barrel cut like it. These are collectors pistols and dont come up alot for sale, much less at this price. This pistol is SUPER CLEAN, ULTRA ACCURATE, and a blast to shoot. Trigger is tight and breaks like a $3,000 Wislon. The gentleman I bought it from 8 years ago had barely shot it and it looked new in box. I have put 500 down range and never had an issue. The magazines regularly sell for $50 and higher on ebay and other auction sites when they come up. Prefer cash at this time, but always open to specialty or hard to find trades. 
This one is stamped Bellevue, WA and all parts have matching serial numbers etched into the gun by hand. This is a handmade custom pistol and was years ahead of the design when it was produced back in the 80's. There are zero MIM(metal injection molding) parts in this pistol. No plastic or other cheap materials. I have tons of pictures and can shoot them if interested. Feel free to TEXT or CALL REDACTED. I have ordered a new WOLFF Recoil spring and firing pin spring just to update the pistol, but they have not been installed yet.

It comes with a Sightmark red dot sight and an extra charging handle. I am also selling my New Frontier AR15 rifle complete lower. These items do not go together because you need  NFA stamp however if you want to do that then you can certainly attach them. But the lower is a plastic lower and even though that seems like it would be horrible I can say they work great and are just as reliable plus make a rifle extremely lightweight. It has a Magpul stock on it and comes with a sig sauer stock and the original stock it came with. I have an extra one which is why I am selling this one. It is brand new and extremely light. The three stocks cost $90 the sightmark rds cost $60 the extra charging handle cost $7 the lower cost $150 and the Upper cost $800 because it was a custom factory build.

It is a very tight gun with no play between the receivers. Great buffer spring and tube, you can barely hear/feel the action during the shot. It's a very good setup for playing around at the range or hunting. I am no sniper by any means, but I can consistently hit a 12"" steel plate at 300yds every time and with low wind I can hit a target at 600yds with proper compensation for bullet drop and distance. It's an awesome rifle, but I don't use it much and looking to add a lighter rifle to the collection.

I am selling this so I can get a truck or SUV, something that can occasionally tow a small to medium sized trailer.  As much as I'd like to add to my collection, I am only interested in cash or trade for a truck.

As much as I love my Kimber, you can't drive a pistol-no matter how nice it is and believe me, this one is N-I-C-E-!!!!!  Original purchase price was about $1430 out the door.  Purchased early 2013, the guy I bought it from shot a couple clips and realized it was too much for him.  

Comes with all the brochures, barrel lock, original oil tube, site adjustment allen wrench, case,  and two 7 round clips.

I'm currently out of work so I've been buying military/government surplus items to resell  trying to make ends meet.  Every time I turn around, I need to borrow or rent a truck, my friends are getting tired of it and I can't keep renting.

If you have a Ford, Dodge, Toyota, Nissan truck or SUV (No Chevrolets please)  that runs and drives great, has current tags and a good title and can occasionally pull a small to medium sized trailer call me.  

I am out of work so I don't have cash to add to a trade but I do have other items for sale here and on CL I'd be willing to trade for the right truck.  Some of the other items are:
    Hardigg Shipping/Storage cases designed to hold twelve M-16s/Ar-15s with up to 20"" barrels
    A Large Remote control Helicopter with HD video camera.  Worth $500, tried to fly once... once.  Still in great shape.

    Large shipping containers originally designed to hold twenty rifles, foam has been removed.
    2 city lots in Wewoka, OK
    Molle 2 Combat load carrying vests
    Flexible metal conduit

For an in depth video of this gun see this review on YouTube, (The BEST Self Defense Handgun (SW99; $825 MSRP) — Review & Explanation.)

-Tritium Night Sights
-extra standard sights
-FIVE (5) total Magazines

The Smith and Wesson SW-99 is a joint venture pistol between Smith and Wesson and Carl Walther and as the pictures show it is marked with the Walther and Smith and Wesson ID. It is a striker fired semi-automatic pistol with a total capacity of 13+1 in .40 Cal. It has an ambidextrous mag release located on the rear of the trigger guard which itself is oversized to enable ease of use even with gloves on. The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture. The unique and ergonomic grip of this pistol was designed by the renowned Swiss match pistol grip designer Cesare Morini. It breaks down easily without tools much like a Glock. The hand grip panels can be removed and replaced to fit the hand gun to the operator. It has a rear adjustable sight for windage. It has a polymer frame with a stainless steel slide with a Picatinny mount for lighting or Laser sight. Magazines are all Metal and fall freely from the magwell. All exposed metal surfaces are covered in a  black melonite finish. The gun is very accurate and scores of 100 are easy to accomplish. The best feature other than being able to fit the firearm to your hand size is the ability to decock the striker before disassembly unlike a Glock which has to be dry fired to disassemble. The gun can be left in a single action mode for true single action throughout operation or decocked for a first double action trigger stroke and then it transitions to single action. TheSW99 introduced features like a decocking button located on top of the gun's slide and a new magazine release on the trigger guard. With the S&W99 the shooter can drop the magazine with their trigger finger and with one hand, never having to change their hold on the gun."

This is a great coyote gun because it does not have the boat paddle stock or the heavy barrel so its not to heavy to pack around and small caliber so it don't put a huge hole in them. This is a very accurate rifle. Have some 40 grain v-max loaded up for it and it shoots them great, also have some more bullets and powder and brass so you can reload some yourself if you'd like.

Looking to get my money out of the gun, so price is dropped to the exact cost of the gun.

I paid  
$350 for the rifle.
$200 for the Scope mount (modern recreation of era specific mount by accumounts.) permanently mounted but can be removed and allows for the use of Iron sights. (since the gun was not numbers matching I had the scope mount welded on, but i can easily remove it in my shop..
$150 nicon scope with BDC
$120 bent charging handle.

Ammo is about 400rounds at $.45 each (this ammo is 1940's match ammo and performs the best in the gun)

If you want the entire package that shoots about .75 moa then you will need to cover the cost of parts.  or mix and match as needed.  but if you only want the base rifle then $350 will do it.  I own a few mosins and a lot of rifles so i can use the scope, bent handle on other rifles.

NOTE:  you can mount a period specific scope to the scope mount that is currently on the rifle.  Accumounts makes one.  I simply prefer a BDC,  again this gun was built to be a functional gun.

This rifle will consistently hit a 6-7 inch gong at 600 yds.

It uses 7.62x54r.
~.75"" groups at 100 yds with 180 grain surplus ammo.
1.5"" groups at 100 yds with 147 grain bulk surplus ammo

It has a perfect bore, Scope, mount, custom bolt , Original wood stock in EXCELLENT Condition.  This rifle is just to pretty for me as I abuse the crap out of all of my firearms.  

Im getting questions both good ones and stupid ones so im going to put the answers here.

""This this a stock rifle""?  NO.  Read the Description,  It was built for maximum accuracy, 

""I don't think this is a pretty rifle, the scope is not original, and I own 15 other Mosin nagants"":  Thats great buddy,  do any of them shoot groups like this?  because this rifle was not numbers matching nor was it a museum piece,  It was purchased to fill a functional role, and a shorter cheaper doner rifle filled the role, so.. This one is sold as a functional shooter.   *Note if you are a marksman or real shooter all you need to so is see the groups and a list of modifications,  trigger pull can be checked when you look at the weapon..    Please dont waist my time comparing your junk size with mine on a e-mail.. it will be deleted.

""what kind of scope and mount is that""?  The Scope mount is a re manufacture copy of the ww2 scope mount system used by finland  made by accumounts.  You can mount a PE scope on it if you want.  More Importantly you can access the Iron sights by removing the scope top from the scope base if the scope ever breaks while you are hunting / shooting.  The Scope on the rifle now is a Nikon Pro-staff variable zoom with a .308 BDC (Bulled Drop Commentator),  If you care about bolistics you will notice that the 54R round ahs a similar flight path to the American 308 out to ~500 yds.  Again you can put a PE Scope on it if you want.  but, If you want an easy to use rifle keep the NIKON on there.



From my years in the Marine Corp I can tell that this weapon was more then likely a Garrison Gun as it is cleaned with all of the original bluing in EXCELLENT SHAPE.

Barrel is Stamped   SA   1942   B   D

The reason for sale is that I do not want to scratch / beat up this beautiful weapon.  I originally built it to be a back pack / truck gun to range out to 600yds, but instead I built a small Hungarian carbine (it was smaller and already beat up) to backpack/ 4x4 with and I can range 500 yds easily with and I don't feel like damaging this beautiful weapon.

This gun is by far the best shooting Mosin Nagant many people have had their hands on. but I'm a functional gun guy and dont want to have a ""safe queen"".  ""Just for Kicks"" I put up a picture of the rifle that I built for backpacking (Its the retarded ugly looking one that that has a 2-piece stock) that i'm replacing this rifle with.  This way you can see what I had in mind,  as you can see the short, fugly,  and very functional Hungarian carbine can be used as a bat and I wont care if the stock breaks.  



Due to the cost of the Scope, Mounting system, Rifle, ammo and the time required to ""free float"" the barrel and other things necessary to make a rifle shoot sub MOA I'm firm on the price.   Transfer will take place at a colorado FFL dealer or mailed to an FFL dealer in your state / city."

The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest, fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent, accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

These were made by the same people who make the EAA Witness line of pistols nowadays. I got this for my son, because I thought he would like shooting it. Well, instead, he has his sights set on a rifle so here it is. The Tanfolglio is about the same size as a Ruger or Colt .22 and though less expensive, they are good guns. They have a safety which allows them to be carried fully loaded, unlike the Colt. This was called the Swiss Safe and it works, completely blocking the hammer from making contact with the rim of the .22 round when engaged. 

It will make a good plinker or even something to use on jackrabbits and the like. The brass frame has a lot of nice patina on it and doesn't appear to have eve been polished. Bluing s a good 90-95% and the bore is perfect. It has not been used or carried much, and my son only shot about 12 rounds through it. 

Since .22 ammunition can be tough to find, I will include 100 rounds of it for you so you can go right out and shoot it. Hopefully soon the internet scalpers will stop buying all of it up at Walmart so ammunition will be easier to get soon. Rin Peterson's in ABQ and the Outdoorsman in Santa Fe are getting it regularly. Walmart too, but you just have to ask when it will come in to beat those scalpers to the punch.

I think you'll like this gun. I did and that was why we got it. The Italians make some good stuff in Gardone, Italy, (most reproduction BP guns) and this is no exception.

Contact me through Armslist with your number and I will call you to arrange a meeting. I used to put my number in these ads, but I got inundated with Nigerian princes who wanted to give me their fortunes for just a small percentage, lol.

Good shooting..."

If you've ever been there or had friends who have, you know what kind of spectacular training is provided in both Nevada and Alaska.  This membership sells for $25,000 if you buy it directly from the company, and allows you to take any course they currently offer or may offer in the future, at any location, for FREE.  You also get a huge 40% discount off at their Pro Shop, and if you host one of their courses you get 50% of the proceeds.

When I attended last, I had a SWAT officer, Air Force operations instructor, and several NRA firearms instructors in the course.  Become better trained than 99% of those who carry guns, even those who carry one for a living!

I'm more than willing to tell you about my personal experiences with Front Sight, and walk you through the membership transfer process if you need.  I'm only asking $1200 for each membership (the cost of one 4-day course is $2,000 - if you take just one of these courses, such as the Defensive Handgun course, you've more than paid for the cost of this membership).  I will sell one or all together, and I'll pay the $100 transfer fee for you that Front Sight requires to activate the membership.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

This model is known as the 24F 12-T, the T meaning Turkey so I've read, Savage designed this for hunting Turkey specifically, but you could hunt a wide variety of things with it, .223 for Coyote, Fox, Rabbit, etc, 12ga for the samething, or Squirrel, Quail, etc. VERY versatile weapon. Just installed a NOS Weaver one piece #74 Scope Base on it, as well as a Razorback Sling, it is ready to scope and hunt with. Very accurate even with the iron sights, and the matte finish makes it harder to see in low light conditions. Both barrels fire. Uses Mossberg 500 Accuchokes, so chokes are plentiful. Will include almost 7 boxes of .223 Remington Ammo I bought for this for the right deal.

Fifty rounds have been test fired and this Piston system runs perfectly and gets a lot of attention at the range. This pistol is more reliable and cleaner than a regular AR and with no blow back in your face!  It even has a selector to adjust the piston system so it will run with a Suppressor or with a .22 Conversion Kit.

It includes the Samson EVO Rail, Spikes Lower, PSA Lower Parts Kit with a very crisp Upgraded Trigger, Magpul Grip with storage and adjustable backstraps, Magpul Flip Up Back Up Sights, Phase 5 Buffer tube (will easily accept Sig Brace), Bungee Sling and left or right attach point, new Pmag and Primary Arms Microdot Sight.  

This is the ultimate and legal to carry Car / Truck pistol because of the compact size, power, optics and 30 round capacity.  And it can be carried concealed as a pistol under a jacket or in a backpack with your GA Weapons Carry License... God Bless America!

If you are not familiar with Adams Arms, do some research because I am convinced they are the best bang for your buck piston system on the market.

Please do not low ball me because I have almost $900 invested just in the upper alone.  I would like to sell this to someone with a GA Weapons Carry License if possible.

Adams Arms newest offering combines features from both the Tactical Elite and the Evo Ultra Lite line of uppers to give you a new more price friendly and versatile option; the Tactical Evo Upper. This new line of uppers will give you the most inexpensive option on the market for a free floating, tactical piston upper. We’ve taken the lighter more versatile Samson Evolution rail, used on our Evo Ultra Lite uppers, and added it to our standard government contoured barrel and standard picatinny gas block. These barrels and blocks take less time to machine and less money to produce than the ultra lite barrel and gas block. This means a savings in manufacturing cost, which we can pass on to the customer. The benefits of the Samson Evolution rail is that it is lighter and allows the end user to configure his fore end for whatever need may arise without having to conform to a set of quad rails. By combining our standard government profile barrel and our standard gas block with the lighter more versatile Samson Evolution rail we’ve been able to build a new line of uppers which combine two great qualities into one.

Adobe Walls Armory is a new, family owned and operated company located in Broomfield Colorado about 15 miles NW of Denver.  We are an LLC incorporated in the State of Colorado.  

We deal in arms, accessories and ammunition.  We specialize in the top 7 handgun calibers - .380 ACP, 9mm (9 mm) Luger, .357 magnum, .38 special, .40 S&W, 10mm and .45 ACP.  We do carry 10 mm and 223 Remington on a limited basis.

We offer competitive pricing on both new an re-manufactured ammunition.  We can beat or match any of the big box stores such as Gander, Cabelas, Bass Pro and yes, even Walmart.  Should you find comparable ammo at a big box store where the regular price (no sale prices please and no ammo with steel casings or steel core, etc.), send us a scan or picture of a receipt or a picture of boxes on the shelf with price and we will match or beat their regular price.  If we can't, we will send you a free box of 50 or 25 rounds - depending on caliber).  We are so confident of the quality ammunition, we will do what it takes to put rounds in your weapon so you can test for yourself.  Once you fire them, we know you will be back for more.

We deliver on the north side of the Denver Metro Area in a 15 mile radius for a small fee which is generally $5-10 to cover gas and wear.  You can pick up in Broomfield near 120th and Sheridan, it is free.  Lastly, we can ship anywhere in the lower 48.  We ship a lot of ammo and get great rates so do not let distance be a factor.  It is the buyers responsibility to know all their local, county and state laws.

We offer boxes of 50 new rounds (sometimes 100 rounds) and lots of reman 150, 250 and 500 rounds packaged in bulk and apply increased discounts per round so the more you buy, the more you save.  If you want 1000+ rounds, please email us for a quote.  

If you buy a box or two at a time from the big box stores, your volume discount on what you have purchased over time goes into the retailers pocket.  We put some of that money back in your pocket so you can save money and/or shoot more!  

Refer a customer and receive a 10% increase in the number of rounds bought by your referee on your next order!  Yes, free ammo for a referral!!!  (Please email sales@adobewallsarmory for full details - please put ""Refer a Friend"" as the subject and we will get to them right away.)

In these days of constant ammo shortages, the days of swinging by Walmart to grab a couple boxes on the way to the range are all but gone.  Buying bulk saves you money, time and ensures you shoot when you want to shoot instead of ending up disappointed and frustrated.

While our website is under development, we have posted prices for our bulk, once remanufactured ammo - www.adobewallsarmory.com.  If you want to order, or have any questions, please email REDACTED.

This rifle is a pleasure to shoot, especially because of how clean it runs due to the piston operating system. Fouling in the chamber is significantly reduced and the gun can run forever.

This rifles accuracy is fantastic, due to the precision it was manufactured with. It's not a sub-MOA weapon by any means, but it's certainly more accurate than 90% of the AR's on the market. The trigger has a nice clean brake.

The 556's bolt is contained within the upper receiver for the entirety of it's operating cycle, thus the stock and ""buffer tube"" can be removed without any impact on the operation of the weapon.

- A2 flash hider with standard threads.
-Flat Top receiver
-M1913 rails on the bottom and sides of the handguard (unless you're running more than a PEQ, a surefire, a grip pod, and a Tac Sling Mount this is more than enough rail)
-2 position gas piston operating system (1 for regular use and one to clear fouling)
