Nice Daewoo DR-200 .223/5.56 gas piston operated rifle 18"" barrel, this one is a Kimber import.  These are awesome and extremely well built rifles and still used as the Korean's battle rifle, just like our fine men and women use the M4.  It is like an AK-47 and AR-15 rolled into one, you get the best of both worlds.  I really like the iron sights on these rifles, but you can pick-up a small rail to attach optics for around $50 +/- or you can get the full rail system for quite a bit more.  Overall, I would say the condition is very nice/excellent, there are some marks here and there on the receiver, you can see them in the pics.  I don't see these listed to often and they seem to be going for $1,000-$1,500 on average, depending on condition.  Comes with 1 Pmag and 2 Thermold, all 30rd. mags, it uses any std. AR mag.

$1,100 cash or will consider good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.    

Below I listed a handful I do not have yet and would not mind owning, but also listed are ones I would not mind having more of and will consider if the deal makes sense, so feel free to offer as I like a bit of everything.

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or AR uppers (or completer rifles) in .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf, would like to try H&K USP or prefer larger like the Tactical or Expert models, that's about it.

Semi-auto rifles, AR, AK, Saiga, PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants.

Semi-auto pistols or revolvers in .357 mag & .44 mag.

Maybe bolt-guns in the common calibers, maybe quality higher power range optics.

Maybe ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but not going to give retail value as I do not need any.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Lewisville area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed."

It's a great addition to anyone building a AR pistol or a legal SBR. I have fired one 30 round magazine through this upper without a hitch, shoots great and is awesome both suppressed and un-suppressed. I have to sell her off now as I need some extra cash at the moment. The only thing this upper is missing is the bolt carrier group which I already sold, but just throw a BCG in there and pin it onto a lower and your ready to rock n' roll.

The MP310 is one of the strongest and most dependable over and under shotguns in the world. You can find a prettier gun, but not a stronger or more dependable firearm. The quality of the Model 310 is evident once you see its hammer-forged barrels, machined steel receiver and monoblock, and checkered cast-off walnut stock. The metalwork is double-dip blued and the barrels are hard chrome-lined and matched with a ventilated rib. An automatic tang safety, a selective trigger, and automatic selective ejectors make operating the Model 310 a breeze. Rubber buttpad. Four screw-in choke tubes (F/M/C/IC) included.

I have used this tiller three seasons for a small 30ftX20ft garden.  The motor has less than 12hours on it and runs flawless.  The motor cranked on the first pull and ran flawless on Monday 4-21-2014.  While using it that day, the transmission of the tiller stripped about a third of the teeth on the tine shaft which caused the tines to stop turning and also cracked one side of transmission case.  This has absolutely nothing to do with motors ability to operate properly as it was still running when this happened.  The tiller is being sold for the motor and all other parts which are all in great condition.  There is very little to no rust on the tines as they were cleaned and painted for off season storage.

The rifle itself has only been to the range maybe three times, does not have an accutrigger, with less than 75 rounds put through it. The one scope already mounted is a Bushnell 3-9x40 and the unmounted scope is a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40. The Nikon would need different mounts in order to place it above the bolt because the shaft is too short for the length of the bolt. The bipod is basic and the legs work on tensioned springs. I am asking $400 for the whole lot, not dividing things up unless maybe minus one scope. Buyer is responsible for the cost of transfer paperwork.

AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly, chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO,employs a revolutionary truly Free Floating Gas Piston design. Unlike other competing piston driven designs, the Adcor system eliminates any influence the moving piston may have on the barrel's harmonics upon firing, resulting in greater shot-to-shot consistency and increased potential accuracy. The upper features an Integral Quad Rail Free Floating Handguard and innovative Ambidextrous Forward-Mounted, Non-Reciprocating Charging Handle. The Chrome Moly Barrel is button broached and Chrome Linedwith a 1 in 7"" twist for use with heavier projectile weights. 

The Gas Piston Operating System is growing in popularity and offers advantages over the AR-15's traditional direct gas impingement design. Primary among them is keeping hot propellant gases and carbon fouling from being dumped directly into the upper receiver upon firing, keeping the action clean, cool and functioning reliably for longer periods with less maintenance. The B.E.A.R. offers a Tool-Free Take Down piston assembly for easy cleaning in the field. Additional features include an adjustable gas regulator for optimum cycling with different ammunition types and/or sound suppressor usage, and a unique polymer Dust Wiper attached to the bolt carrier that protects the ejection port from outside debris when the bolt is in battery. 

Upper comes complete with bolt carrier assembly, side charging handle, and standard charging handle assemblies, and is ready to drop onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver.

It’s a hybrid between a Ruger Super Blackhawk .44 mag revolver and a Ruger New Vaquero Montado with a smaller XR3 style grip and special serrations found only on the Montado.   The smaller grip makes this gun very unique and perfect for those who want a full size .44 mag ruger, but a much easier to hold grip.

The upper main frame is a Super Blackhawk stainless steel chambered in .44 Magnum with a 4-3/4 barrel and fiberoptic front sight.  The gun also has an after market cylinder pin and wollf spring kit.    

The lower grip frame is a Ruger New Vaquero Montado, also in stainless steel.  The Montado was a special version of the New Vaquero and includes the older style Ruger XR3 grip frame which is about the same size as the Colt SAA and smaller than the current Ruger grip frames found on most Ruger SAA guns.  The two frames mate up perfectly and work wonderfully together.  The gun shoots perfectly great!   Its especially comfortable for anyone with small to medium size hands and feels like holding a much smaller and less powerful gun than it is.  

I might possibly be interested in a trade, but would prefer cash.  If trading, the guns I'm currently interested in now are...

They are:

Ruger Mini 14 Tactical or Patrol with the 16"" barrel.   Either black or stainless.  Extra 20 or 30 round mags would be a plus. 

S&W Scandium J frame revolvers. 

Possibly Certain S&W J frame airweight revolvers.  Especially if moon clip capable. 

Possibly Rohrbaugh R9 

Certain Kahr models.   

S&W .44 mag models 3” barrel in stainless

Possibly Ruger LCR or LCRx, especially if it has a front night sight

Otherwise I’m asking $725 cash, or best offer.   This is a one of a kind firearm that simply cannot be duplicated without great expense."

Manufacturer's Description:
Model #: KSG
Caliber: 12 Ga
Capacity: 14+1 2.75"", 12+1 3""
Action: Pump Action 
Finish: Black 
Stock: Black Polymer 
Sights: None
Weight:	6.90 lbs
Overall Length: 26.10""
Barrel Length: 18.50”

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I also have 150 rounds of UMC .40 cal FMJ, 27 rounds of Federal 180 grain HST JHP, and 3 rounds of Hydra-Shok.  Pistol was purchased by me from the Marksman in May of 2010. It comes with the original case, two fired rounds from the factory, three (3) 13 round magazines, and night sights (sorry, no factory paperwork). Take a look at the pictures and you will see that there are NO scratches, dents or dings on this pistol. It was cleaned, lubed, and stored after every range visit. As is typical of Glocks, it has fired with every squeeze of the trigger with no FTF or FTE. Absolutely nothing wrong with this pistol, just getting away from striker-fired pistols.  

I would like to sell the pistol and ammo for $550 or trade for something that shoots .45 ACP, 30.06, or 7.62x51 (NO STRIKER-FIRED PISTOLS PLEASE).  For those offering a trade with more value than the G23 I have plenty of ammo in various calibers that I can use instead of cash, your choice.  I'm not looking to trade for something that is double the value of the G23 and ammo, so please keep this in mind.

I am located in Lacey and would be willing to travel approximately 30 minutes in any cardinal direction, maybe a little further for full price sale or the right trade.  FTF will be conducted in a public place that we both agree on.  

CPL and DL from the state of Washington is a must.  If you are military contact me and we will work it out.  I will require a peek at both (no pics) documents and will do a transfer of ownership for both parties that will go no further than my safe.

Send me an email through Armslist or text David at (360) Four81-3six00 and I will respond ASAP.  More pics available upon request."

The Ruger 10/22 rifle has become America's favorite 22LR rifle, with proven performance in a wide range of styles for every rimfire application. Ideally suited for informal target shooting, small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate.

Included is a Bushnell 4x32 scope with medium profile rings (not the ones that came with the scope -- those sucked), one 4-round magazine (blue), one 7-round magazine (blue), two nickel 7-round magazines, Winchester sling, original manual, and 100 rounds of Armscor 40gr ammo. A brown vinyl/leather case is included. It's old and not pretty, but it's intact and provides good protection. If you want a brand new black nylon case that I have for this rifle, it's an extra $20. The rifle has a fresh cleaning.

I bought this brand new at Guns Unlimited last year. It has about 250 rounds through it: CCI, Fiocchi, Winchester, and Armscor. My friend bought this model rifle from GU about the same time I did, and we took them to the 100-yard outdoor range in Grand Island. Here's one thing we learned after not expecting much from a $225 gun: once these rifles are sighted in at 25 yards, they're sighted in for 50, 75, or 100 yards. There's no bullet drop out to 100. We tried compensating for an expected drop, but after checking the targets we realized the bullets were going exactly where we aimed. In short, these Marlins are ridiculously accurate. They're also extremely light, which is also unexpected, given the slightly thicker barrels that Marlin uses. The adjustable trigger pull is clean and has a crisp break. There are no variances in its consistency, and I have not modified it from its factory settings.

Why am I selling it? Stupid medical expenses.

Nebraska purchase permit required. Here's how the deal will happen: We meet at the Bullet Hole (108th & Harrison) and we each show our driver's licenses and purchase permit cards. We trade our names and purchase permit numbers on index cards, do the exchange, and away we go. This is to protect both of us!

Respond through this site and I'll send you my phone number, or call you ASAP if you provide yours. Since I'm throwing in the ammo and case for free, the price is firm. Don't let the recent irrational increase in the prices of 22WMR ammo scare you away. I'll tell you how to check notifications about the cheapest prices that come up with several retailers every day on the hour. Cabela's participates in this, and I've used it many times to buy ammo when you can't get it in the store and there's no shipping cost. No worries!
