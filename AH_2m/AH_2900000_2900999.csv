This is a great stock that anybody can throw on their unconverted Saiga. It’s made tough and I really have liked having it on my Saiga 12, I am however converting my shotgun and I am looking to sell this. Really can’t say enough that this is a really solid stock- have shot several 3” magnum 00 buck and BB rounds and it stays strong-no wiggling and has never acted loose or cheap.  

Full disclosure:  this has some scratches- not something that you are going to miss when you look at it. The scratches are all esthetic and they do not effect function-but I know that it’s a deal breaker for those of you that won’t take your weapon out except to show it off to your friends. Saiga’s are ugly anyway, so it really doesn’t do much to hurt how sexy your weapon will be.

These are selling online for somewhere between $120 and $140 so I think that it’s a fair price at $50. I’d like to turn this into cash for my next project but if you have something that you’d like to trade, let me know and I’ll consider it. Thanks for your time."

This has the ""shark fin"" front sight and a rear sight that is adjustable for both elevation AND windage. It also comes with a birdcage flash hider. It also has the AK Sig forearm brace, which is a blast to use. Very comfortable and 100% legal. I have replaced the stock grip with a MOE AK grip and added a AFG to make it more comfortable to shoot. I have put around 500 rounds through this, and it has performed flawlessly. And despite the common myth of AK's being inaccurate, I'm hitting spent shells at 20 feet and full sized targets at 100 yards with the iron sights.This package comes with up to 5 mags (4 tapco 30 round and 1 40 round import), up to +/- 1300 rounds of wolf FMJ's, and a triple AK mag/triple pistol mag MOLLE pouch, depending on trade.

The stock is nice looking although not pristine, being an original Bulgarian set. The receiver is US made and well made; the rails are parallel, rivets are in the right spot, and the fit and finish are great. The barrel is chrome lined, as is the muzzle brake. The rest of the parts are from a matching Bulgarian rifle.
It comes with 2 magazines; a 30 round Tapco and a 45 round bakelite from the eastern bloc, which both looks and works excellently, both are pictured.
Not pictured is the ammo, around 1300 rounds or so of Ukrainian 7n6. I bought 2 tins of ammo (2160 rounds) with it, one remains totally unopened and the other still has about a quarter of it left. I've cleaned the gun thoroughly every time I have taken it out - all 3 times. Also comes with an aluminum side rail with a quick detach mount (not pictured).
I paid over 1000$ for all of it, so I am looking for 800$ or best offer, which is less than the gun and a tin of ammo, not even factoring in the shipping and FFL fees you would have to pay. Mostly looking for money, but I may possibly entertain some trades?"

This link is for all parts except the powerplant and the drop skid frame.

http://www.saturnsurplus.com/4a032.htm

The engine is in great condition but needs plugs ($8) and a fuel pump ($10).

Used Wedtech 4A032-3, 4 cylinder, 4 stroke 32 cu in (524cc) motor mounted on a 3000 watt power unit with 1 and 3 phase connections. Both the engine and power plant are experimental and are extremely rare, and to find them together is 1 in a million.

The engine can be used for golf carts, go carts, inboard engine boats, airboats, ultra light aircraft and many other projects.

________________________________

I'm getting a lot of emails from Arkansas and Tennessee residents stating that because it is a long gun, I can sell across state lines.  They then get upset when I tell them, no, that is not correct.

Please people, know the laws before propositioning illegal transfers.  Out of State residents can ONLY purchase long guns from LICENSED dealers.

Q: From whom may an unlicensed person acquire a firearm under the GCA?
A person may only acquire a firearm within the person’s own State, except that he or she may purchase or otherwise acquire a rifle or shotgun, in person, at a licensee’s premises in any State, provided the sale complies with State laws applicable in the State of sale and the State where the purchaser resides. A person may borrow or rent a firearm in any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes.

2 magazines 12+1, manual, back straps, carrying case, lock, EVERYTHING that came with it.

Reason for sale: Basically I bought 5 guns.. 3 compacts, one full size gun, 1 rifle. I normally carry a revolver and was weighing my options, the gun I decided to keep was a full size gun for a bedstand gun, the compact I liked the most was this m&p 9c, it was better than the m&P shield especially because I'm lefty but I liked the more rounds and the all around feel to the weapon more. But I want the full size gun and can't keep both financial wise. So in other words this gun is truly flawless. I'm not selling off my problems like most gun sellers, I just need the money.

Now you can shoot the same shotgun that this legendary champion uses. Mossberg proudly presents the Jerry Miculek Pro Series 930 Tactical Class of signature semi-automatic shotguns, built to Jerry Miculek's specifications.

I have for sale a used, but good condition, Beretta PX4 Storm Compact 9mm. It comes with the box and 2 15 round magazines. Somehow I ended up with 2 of them and one needs to go.

The firearm is very reliable. I have had it out to the range on several occasions and I have put around 400 rounds through it with no issues. Feels great in the hand and is extremely accurate and easy to shoot. The rotating barrel makes for quick followup shots. I have been carrying one of these more than my Glock 19 and while it does weigh 2-3 ounces more, I hardly notice it. Crossbreed holster makes carry easy and convenient.

If interested, please give me a call. You must have a lifetime carry permit or we can do transfer at FFL. In any event, bill of sale will be done. Asking $450 THIS WEEKEND ONLY.  After that I will put it back at the $500 as listed in the other post. I am not interested in any trades right now and I am firm on the price. Thank you for your time and have a good night. Don, REDACTED call/text. Yes, I am local."

The gun functions perfectly and locks up tight, the single action trigger pull is also rather exceptional. A re-blueing job would leave you with a very nice revolver.  This gun has hogue grips.

The firing pins break frequently. And the rebound spring is lost or bent and is no longer useable. The braking problem is the result of ""SHEAR"" stress caused by the original design of the bolt. We could not change the design of the bolt's so we tried to help by trying new materials for the firing pins. We've made pin's from various kinds of steel including hardened A2 tool steel with little success. We tried heat treated the pin's to different hardness's. That didn't work either! We've even made a batch of firing pin's from Titanium. Much to our surprise, that batch broke even faster than the steel firing pins. Titanium is strong but it doesn't hold up well to ""shear"" stress.To insure that the firearms works as designed the main spring should be changed every year or two. The recoil spring is made of hi-test piano wire as are the main spring and firing pin rebound spring. We have been ""Intratec Parts"" since 1998. We aren't just order takers.

The SAM7R Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.
