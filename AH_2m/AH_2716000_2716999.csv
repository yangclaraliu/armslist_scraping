MORE INFO:
The GLOCK 19 Gen4, in 9x19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G19 Gen4 also retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

Trigger Safety
Safe and ingeniously simple: Contrary to conventional, the trigger is the only operating element. All three pistol safeties are deactivated when the trigger is pulled -and automatically activated when it is released.

Tenifer Coating
Unique GLOCK hi-tech surface refinement for barrel and slide. Apart from optimum corrosion protection and anti-reflective finish, a degree of hardness of 64 HRC - close to that of a diamond - is achieved.

Polymer Frame
Corrosion resistant, tougher than steel and still 86% lighter. More than 20 years ago, GLOCK pistols were the first industrially manufactured handguns with high-tech polymer frames."

The best features of both the AR and the AK platform. The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), “Night Stalkers”, provided the helicopters, insert and cover for the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound in May 2011. To commemorate this historic event, Sig Sauer manufactured a very limited number of these U.S. Army ""Night Stalkers"" rifles. Sig Sauer is no longer taking orders on these 5.56 NATO's. The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in this 160th SOAR (A) commemorative semiautomatic with the silhouette that takes you back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. The 160th SOAR (A) features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as an aluminum quadrail forend. The Night Stalker Medicine has a standard hand guard but has mini attachable rails for optional accessories.  Sig Sauer shaved a pound off this model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The Night Stalkers 160th SOAR (A) emblem is engraved on the receiver. Own a piece of history. Cash price. Firearms may only be shipped to a licensed dealer (FFL Holder) - If you are not a licensed dealer, you must make arrangements with a dealer in your state to receive the firearm and transfer it to you.

This is the same suit that agencies use when riots break out. Is bash proof but NOT bullet proof. Has everything you need to cover everything except your head, forearms, hands and feet.(which is why the price was discounted) Tried everything on then took it off and has been sitting in the closet since. All the gear is adjustable. 

A suit that includes all the gear would cost $600+ if you can find it. I paid $320. So price is $220.

The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

I have for sale an unfired (other than the factory) Springfield 1911 Loaded. Model# PX9109LP. I purchased it new last year but have not fired, field stripped, or cleaned it. I was going to do a few upgrades but have decided to go with a commander length instead. What you see is what you get. In addition to the typical Loaded model upgrades I have included the following: GunCrafter MSH with new MSH spring kit; Installed. I replaced the factory ILS MSH. It is very simple to switch back. VZ Alien grips;Installed. 3 Wilson Combat ETM magazines. Wilson Combat 16# recoil spring; not installed. Ed Brown Heavy Duty Recoil Spring Guide; not installed Ed Brown Recoil Spring Plug; not installed. Condor holster. I was going to replace the factory guide rod with the Ed Brown parts but have not got around to it. It’s a simple swap. I have not field stripped the gun but there is a faint assembly scratch on the parkerization (also known as an “Idiot Scratch”) at the slide release. I can only assume this happened during final assembly as I bought the gun new but didn’t notice it at the time. Check the pics. Does not include the original case, paperwork, Springfield magazines, Springfield grip panels or Springfield MSH. 
Item is available to Idaho residents, at least 21 years old and not prohibited from owning a handgun.  Two receipts will be issued, one for the seller and one for the buyer.

This handgun works as advertised and is amazingly reliable.  $1000 firm or a 9mm Walther PPQ plus $500 is the ticket.  I will also consider a Glock 29 plus cash.  I will consider other fair offers.  There is slight carry wear.  Lowballers just keep on moving please.  First come first served.  Not many of these around and they are asking more for less.  Buyer to be willing to complete bill of sale for my records."

265,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2716265,For Sale:  Nikon Monarch 3 8-32x50ED SF Matte Rifle Scope,"Grand Blanc, Flint, Michigan",$ 600,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 19, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Selling my Nikon Monarch 3 8-32x50ED SF Matte Rifle Scope. This scope has been discounted by Nikon, so your only chance to get it is here! I bought this scope in July 2012, used it for two deer seasons. Scope is in magnificent condition, no scratches, no signs of use. I'm disassembling some of my guns to rebuild and I'm upgrading scopes, otherwise I'd have no reason to get rid of this.

Nikon Monarch 8-32X50ED SF Riflescopes are perfect for extreme long range hunting and target shooting. Like all Monarchs the three new riflescopes were developed to give shooters increased versatility and superlative performance with virtually any type of rifle, in any caliber and in any imaginable hunting situation. The Nikon 8-32X50ED SF is the first rifle scope to incorporate Nikon's exclusive and legendary ED glass. Nikon ED glass delivers superior sharpness and color correction for unmatched detail resolution. While still maintaining the American-preferred one-inch diameter main body tube, Monarch Riflescopes where developed to not only provide the shooter with a big, bright, sharp sight picture, but at the same time minimize the overall length of the scope-and maximize the mount ring spacing capability. The resulting line of rifle-scopes pushes the envelope of optical performance with Nikon's lead-and-arsenic-free Eco-Glass lenses and trademark Ultra ClearCoat anti-reflective multi-coatings, is fast-handling, pleasing to the eye and very importantly, allows for mounting on virtually any rifle-even magnum-length actions.

Nikon Monarch Rifle Scopes come standard with a locking side focus parallax adjustment. Nikon's easy-to-reach dials allow the user to quickly focus from the shooting position, in addition to the enhanced ring spacing, the new scope design includes the monarch eye box design with its impressive 4-time zoom range and a very comfortable 4 inches of eye relief that remains constant throughout the power range without sacrificing field of view. The Nikon Monarch 8-32x50 ED SF Matte Rifle Scope's massive ocular lens also delivers both a large high-resolution sight picture and the maximum field of view corresponding to each power setting. As an additional convenience feature, Nikon Optics has placed rear-facing magnification indicators on the zoom control and included a quick-focus eyepiece on the eye box.

All Nikon Monarch Rifle-Scopes utilize precise, repeatable, hand-turn reticle adjustments and feature an interchangeable turret technology system, which allows shooters to switch out turret knobs and caps for maximum convenience and versatility.

The shotgun has an 18-1/2 inch barrel, front rifle sight with a silver bead, flip-up adjustable rear sight, 6+1 shot capacity, wood stock and forearm and is chambered for both 2-3/4 & 3 inch shells.

From the research I have done this shotgun sells for upwards of $800-$1,000 dollars so at $750 for one in pristine condition and having been fired less than 25 times this is an amazing deal. Being stainless steel this shotgun is rust proof, and makes an excellent addition to any boat or home.

This gun appears to have been manufactured in the mid 1980's at Winchester's New Haven Connecticut plant. These Winchester Model 1300 Marine’s have a Stainless barrel, magazine tube and a few other parts. The Stainless parts are nickel plated as well as the aluminum receiver, trigger group and most of the internals. The Stainless Marine was issued to the US Coast Guard and other maritime law enforcement agencies as well as the civilian market. These Winchester’s are rugged and very corrosion resistant.

This Stainless Steel Marine 12 Gauge Shotgun is in excellent condition. All the furniture appears to be in great shape. The pump forearm is in very good condition with no scratches or dents anywhere on the wood. The nickel finish on the stainless steel barrel is pristine. The bore is smooth and shinny and looks great and the receiver is in excellent condition. The finish is very reflective and the gun is in like new condition without a scratch."

AGRIP is NOT permanent - If you want to reposition the AGRIP just peel it off and re-apply anytime, today or next year! AGRIP is made to improve the full combat grip on your handgun by providing a non-slip barrier between your hands and the pistol grip. The results are the handgun stays in the position it was originally gripped, even after repeated fire. AGRIP is so thin and flexible you can see and feel the checkering on your pistol THROUGH the AGRIP material. There is nothing like AGRIP anywhere! AGRIP is not a rubber grip so it won't add bulk to your firearm grip and Agrip won't cause blisters liked rubber grips. AGRIP is cut to fit your exact firearm. It's easy to apply and can be removed and repositioned anytime. Simply remove, re-apply and rub it down hard. AGRIP is pre-cut and fitted for most popular firearms and is also available in separate 5""x8"" sheets. Sheets can be cut to fit any rifle or tool. Available in black

I have a Lee hand press kit # 90179
RCBS Hand Priming Tool #90200
RCBS 3- die carb TC Set 9mm Luger P/N 20515
RCBS F L Die Set .223 Rem P/N 11101

I'm also throwing in a bag full of once shot 223 brass consisting of about 125+ shells and a Redding Shell holder P/N 11006

None of it is used, all still in the box but the boxes have been all over the house over the years so the boxes are pretty tired. Perfect for someone that wants to try their hand at reloading but don't want to pay too much. 

I brought the price down a little because the last time I posted this there seemed to be interest from people not in the area and wanted me to ship it. It was fine except they were only offering like 10 bucks and sadly it would be a little more than that so hopefully this would make it a little more affordable for them. 
If you're local than I'm more than happy to meet you someplace public after work like a Fred Meyers parking lot or something. If I get contacted before work I can throw everything in my car and be ready to meet up as soon as I'm off. I'm working all over town this week so there's no telling if I'll be close or not but I never care if I have to drive. 

Everything goes, not splitting it up. Not interested in trades unless it's a Glock 21 in which case I also have enough cash to throw in....yeah it's a long shot but you never know. 

Now my spiel. The ad stays up as long as it remains unsold. I take it down as soon as I sell it. If I don't reply it's because I can't get to a computer or because there's one or more people that replied first. This doesn't mean I don't value your interest it's just the fairest way to run things. I accept on a first come-first serve basis but for the love of god please don't jerk me around. I'll even be hesitant if you told me I'd have to wait till the weekend because that means I could possibly get several people with cash in hand wanting to purchase and where does that leave me? I'll wait and piss off everyone that came after you. I'll go ahead and sell it to them and suddenly you think I'm an asshole and tell me why I suck over email. I mean I'll still be accommodating just please be serious.

And I've been jerked around enough to know a few buyers I should avoid. These people will also not get a response from me.

That's enough from me. Enjoy the lousy pics (zero interest in photography, I'm sorry). Look up the part numbers for more info. Like I said I never got the chance to get into reloading but I'll try to be as much help as I can.

Cheers"

I'd rate it 9.5 out of 10 in every way. Only turned on twice and used for a total of 30 mins.  I bought this as a spare for the business but it never ended up being used...so looking to trade it.  Specs below.  Perfect for professionals and students alike.  I use my other one for training using the camera/video to provide immediate feedback.  Great for the range or classroom!  Includes the S-Pen so you can write and take notes on the tablet!  Compare to Walmart.com's price.  No phone company data plan needed.  Note: this was purchased directly from Samsung as a factory refurbished unit.  It is identical in all ways to a full retail version except for a sticker in the back from Samsung stating it's a refurbished unit.  These stickers are only issued by Samsung to ensure the buyer that it is up to their standards.  Even the box is specially issued for these units.  Bottom line, don't pay $550 for a new one.   Firearms and ammo for the most part are back to normal levels...so treat yourself or family member to a high tech piece of gear they can use for the cost of an idle, un-used firearm / ammo.  Great for school/college.  Wanted to do something for your kids education and give them the edge?  Here's you chance...esp. if you already have more than enough firearms.   Depending on the trade offer, I'd consider adding cash...conversely I'll take partial trades as well.  Looking for a fair deal based on age, condition, and exact specs.

In an emergency, your hands are the first tool you will use! Think of all the things you can come in contact with in an emergency, broken glass, twisted steel, splintered wood, hot surfaces. The list has no end! You may be tough, but an infected cut can be disastrous when there are no hospitals to go to! Buy a pair today and be ready when the SHTF. These are brand new first quality. Features include padded leather palms and rubber finger and knuckle guards on the top. They will keep your hands scratch and cut free! They make awesome shooting gloves. No more cold, numb fingers getting scraped and cut! These also make excellent work gloves too! I have all sizes. Payment through PayPal is fast and secure. Shipping is FREE!!! Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

UPDATE: This is from a customer who bought a pair of these for his brother who is a U.S. Navy SEAL currently deployed:

-My brother informed me that your gloves held up in combat without any glitches. I guess you can say combat proven. Thanks again."

This ammo is in U.S. made Enbloc clips with six clips per bandoleer.  There are four bandoleers in an original ammo box.  In the pictures, the box markings say 384 rounds, but there are actually half that amount in the box.  I am selling all these components together as one package deal.  The clips are all obviously U.S. made from the markings on them and are either WWII or Korean War vintage.  I have researched the ammo itself online and this is quality ammo.  The bullets are 150 gr from what I can determine and are not magnetic, meaning that they are not armor piercing.  The headstamps on the cartridges are PS 82 which is reliable ammo and not the stuff people have had trouble with.  They are boxer primed and the empty, high quality cases are excellent for reloading after removing the primer crimp.  I will deliver these for no charge to the Bakersfield or Kern River Valley CA areas.  I will also ship them for the asking price plus actual shipping cost.  I do not charge extra for packaging.  I accept cash, money orders, bank drafts or bank cashiers checks, or PayPal (no credit cards) for payment.  If this does not sell on ARMSLIST soon, I will list them on an online firearm auction and I know they will go for this amount or more.  So, save yourself some $ and buy them now.  Also, these high quality U.S. made Enbloc clips are going for $25 a dozen and more online.  So, 78 cents a round is quite reasonable with the clips, bandoleers and original military ammo box.  I prefer that you text or call me @ 76o-417-1o27 to purchase this ammo, but email is acceptable if that is easier for you."

Theirs is ""Untouched"" which Means... they have NO CLUE if it functions or to the extent of the damage due to improper storage for 100 years.
