This is the ultimate rabbit / squirrel gun.  It is a Savage 24f in .22lr upper and 20 gauge lower with 3.0"" chamber.  Overall it is Fair+ to Good condition.  The bluing is good+ on the barrels and fair+ to good on the receiver -- but the wood is not pretty.  I'll tell you that right now.... this is not a gun you buy for aesthetics.  What makes it special are the customizations:  (1) Both barrels shortened from 24"" down to EIGHTEEN (18.1) inches, for the ultimate short light handy small game gun; this is a professional cut / crown / re-blue, & sight setback job by Jared McCluskey (McCluskey machine shop) out of Altus, and (2) Stock shortened - the LOP went from about 14.5"" to about 13.5"", and (3) Good professional trigger job - was up close to 14 lbs (not kidding); now it breaks cleanly at 5 lbs, 9 oz.  Great bores in both barrels.  Fixed choke on the shotgun barrel - due to being shortened, it's effectively a cylinder bore - quail, dove, squirrel and rabbit type bore for < 25 yards.

Oh, the back of the plastic trigger guard is cracked, but it still works, and this is a very cheap part to replace.  It is an $8.45 part at gunpartscorp.com

Comes with or without an excellent-condition Sightron S2 1.5-6x40mm scope (currently mounted with high-quality all-steel rings).  There's enough eye relief to use the shotgun on 1.5x or crank it up for long-range .22 shots.

Yours for $480 WITH scope and rings FTF, or $245 without scope and rings.  ($25 off old price)

Those are FTF prices.  Add $25 for shipping to your door if you are Okla. resident via FedEx ground, or to your FFL's door anywhere in CONUS if not an Okla. resident.  Please note that if I send to you directly rather than to FFL, as allowed per BATFE regs, I need to see some proof of residency (text me pic of driver's license), and I do my own OSCN background check for felony convictions.

This shotgun is in really nice shape.  The action works flawlessly and is smooth and not a speck of rust, (or dirt for that matter), anywhere that I can find.  The stock is chekered and beautifull.  You won't be disappointed in this one and I think you would be hard pressed to find another one in this shape.  This shotgun is a really nice.  The guy that owned these before really knew how to take care of firearms and his passion was shotguns.  He passed away in May and left these with his wife and I ended up with them to sell for her.  The gun is blued and the stock is rich with a really nice finish.  Has a 30"" blued barrel with no rust and is a Slide Action Shotgun.  It has on the left side of the receiver """"WESTERN FIELD"" and has a pointing Irish Setter.  It is of the  ""HAMERLESS HUMPBACK"" version Slide Action shotgun.

OUR TERMS and CONDITIONS;
Buyer must be 18 years old for long guns.  You must be legally able to own or possess a firearm. You must secure a current FFL in your State of residence and in your area for us to ship the firearm to. I will only ship this firearm to an FFL. I will need a legible copy of his FFL with dealer ID, signature and expiration date. If I can't read it or I can't check it out or it is not clear and legible I will not ship the firearm. Please have your FFL put the buyer/owners full name, home address, home phone number, and his information on the FFL for our records and so I can match the buyer to the FFL and to the firearm.

I am a Federal Firearm Licensed Dealer. You must abide by all Local, State and Federal Laws and it is YOUR responsibility to know your local laws before buying. Not my responsibility! There will be a 25% re-stocking fee if the firearm cannot be delivered as agreed on any canceled or returned item after payment.  Shipping will be paid to and from by you accepting the firearm and on any return firearm.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out. Your payment, by cash, Personal Check, Certified Check, USPS Money Order, and now we accept Credit Cards as well. I wouldn't recommend cash but if you must send cash, go ahead, I'm honest and will accept cash as your payment.  Personal Checks must clear my bank and I will not ship until I get confirmation your check has cleared, usually about a 7 to 10 day wait after deposit. Certified Checks must also clear but usually have a shorter wait time. USPS Money Orders must also clear but usually very fast and sometimes I can cash them at the Post Office. All major Credit Cards are accepted, except Discover, but you must call me to give me your CC information, number, expiration date, CCV and Name on the card. There is a 3% up-fee/surcharge on Credit Cards on the full amount including shipping but as soon as the funds show up in my account I will ship. Usually about 24 hours.

Your payment is due in our hands or account within 7 calendar days after you agree to buy.  NO excuses, NO extensions accepted. Call me or e-mail with your information. If you do not pay within the 7 days as agreed I will re-post this firearm.  Your call or e-mail will not change this. Longuns, Rifle, or Shotguns  etc., firearms will be shipped UPS Ground for $38.00, paid by you so add to the amount of the firearm, and Alaska is an extra $10.00 with a signature required on all firearms. Insurance and other shippers are optional and may cost extra.  I almost always add insurance to the shipping.

Please if you cannot or will not pay on time please don't tell me you will.

Also note that we will provide prompt service and ship as soon as the funds and  confirmation allows us to do so. I will attempt to ship within 2 business days after your payment is confirmed and I have a legal FFL in my hands and I have verified his FFL.

We reserve the right to end this sale early at any time if there are no inquiries or e-mails regarding this sale.  If you want to buy this firearm please let me know ASAP.  The first person to contact me has the first right of refusal.  I will only take this firearm off the site when I have money in hand for the purchase.  Only then will the firearm be taken off our shelf waiting for your payment to clear. This firearm will remain on our ""For Sale"" shelf until that time. Please ask all questions before buying. My name is Brad, REDACTED or e-mail me at REDACTED

I support the NRA and so should you. Membership is $35.00 for one year but I can sign you up for one year for $25.00 and I'll pay the extra $10.00 for the one-year membership. We need the NRA more than ever right now so I urge you to join if you are not already a member.  If you are not a member and sign up through me ask about our extended NRA discount on this sale.

If you don't want to lose your gun rights and you don't want more Government CONTROL, and you want to be able to buy guns and ammunition, and you want your gun stores to stay in business, - JOIN THE NRA!!!  Let's vote them out of there, and ""God Bless America""
If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales tax, on top of everything else. You can come into my shop and buy direct and save the shipping if you live in Washington State but read everything above.  You will need to fill out a form 4473 and pass a background check if you want to come in and buy direct.

I will not ship anything anymore to CA, MD, Hawaii, DC, NY, NJ, MA, Colorado or Connecticut now, or some cities in Illinois. Not my problem that you live there. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know the laws of your area, local, City, State or Federal. If this firearm is illegal for you to own in your area, you will be charged a 25% re-stock fee if your FFL Dealer cannot transfer to you. Not my problem. You will pay shipping to and from.  Thanks for looking!

This is a T/C Encore Prohunter SS receiver with swing hammer, with a 24"" SS Encore barrel in .280 rem.  All in excellent condition with pristine bore.  The twist rate is 1 in 9.0"" (not 9.25 or 9.5 like most .280s), so it will shoot the 168 and 180 bergers if you like. Of course, you can put any barrel you like on this receiver.

The special thing about this rifle is the hardwood furniture, particularly the forend, which is unique with a custom schnabel end;  all wood is finished in reddish-brown wood stain with tung oil finish plus polyurethane. 

It has a black aluminum scope mount and is currently wearing a Sightron S1 2.5-10x44mm scope, in Weaver rings.  Scope comes with box & papers. This rifle is a deer-killing mo-sheen, and is a very short & handy rifle for the full-length barrel.  Very accurate as well.

Please note that the buttstock nylon pouch thing is NOT included!  Everything else is.

Old Price:  $795 / $675

New Price:  Yours for $735 for entire package, or $620 for rifle without scope and rings.  Firm prices - I believe this is a very good price for what you get.

Those are FTF prices.  Add $25 for shipping to your door if you are Okla. resident via FedEx ground, or to your FFL's door anywhere in CONUS if not an Okla. resident.  Please note that if I send to you directly rather than to FFL, as allowed per BATFE regs, I need to see some proof of residency (text me pic of driver's license), and I do my own OSCN background check for felony convictions.

This is an as-new-in locking box** with all original papers and accessories, Phoenix Arms HP22 pistol, with the stainless steel finish and 5"" barrel, in .22lr, in pristine condition, unfired except for function testing (< 20 rounds)

This is a 10-shot, external hammer, semi-auto pistol, of high quality but low price.  It has one mag and one ""safety mag"" which you can insert as additional safety when left in a home with children.

**Except that this pistol has the commonly-known and sought-after professional gunsmithing already done to it, which removes the pesky magazine disconnect safety.  Now it operates normally like any other pistol, with an ordinary manual safety.  As a result of this customization, this pistol is now $170 FTF (reduced from $180).

These pistols are made in the USA and get very good reviews universally - they are excellent for the price, once you get rid of the unneeded safeties, as I have on this one.

Or add $25 for shipping to your door if you are Okla. resident via FedEx ground, or to your FFL's door anywhere in CONUS if not an Okla. resident.  Please note that if I send to you directly rather than to FFL, as allowed per BATFE regs, I need to see some proof of residency (text me pic of driver's license), and I do my own OSCN background check for felony convictions.

OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 940,"Listed On: Thursday, August 28, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a PSE Tac-15i complete package, with multiple customizations.  This is the kind that has a dedicated crossbow lower, not an AR15 lower (looks like AR15 but it's all one component) - so I can ship it to anyone -  No FFL required and no need to sacrifice a lower! This is a complete, ready-to-hunt crossbow.

You get the crossbow, a dozen Tac-15 26.25"" arrows with 85 gr field tips, all in perfect condition, a PSE Tac-15 Soft-sided padded & zippered case (black & gray) with special compartment for arrows, not one but TWO cocking crank handles (I thought I lost the first one and ordered a new one, then found the ""lost"" one), rubber grip (factory), extra cocking unit cord, and these customizations:  (1) Removal of the lower P-rail, to significantly lighten this bow for hunting, (2) Installation of two short P-rails to the underside of the main frame, for a more solid base for the ""handguard"", (3) Removal of a small section of the front of the upper scope P-rail which is a known, needed modification, as the factory-length front end of the rail is known to interfere with arrow flight - this mod is necessary in order to produce superb accuracy, and finally, (4) a tuned high-quality drop-away QAD arrow rest (no biscuit), to maximize accuracy.

This bow has a good to very-good condition string (ready-to-hunt for at least 2 more seasons), and is extremely accurate and powerful.  

This bow is scoped with a Sightron S2 3-9 x 40mm scope on an extended riser rail (that stays up out of arrow's way) in high-quality rings.  You can buy it with or without the scope, but your price without scope still DOES include this nice extended riser rail for you, as well as the Burris rings.

**NOTE: The FAB Defense forward Pistol Grip shown in the picture does NOT come with this item.

This bow is capable of 3"" groups or better at 75 yards if you group and mark your arrows which hit the same.  I love this bow and hate to part with it, but need money and I prefer to hunt with my draw-loc vertical rigs which aren't as front-heavy.  But this is your plains speed goat, mulie, & turkey bow, for Western OK and the other states that allow x-bows.  

[Original Price:  $1,395 with scope; $1,185 without scope]

New Price:  Yours for $1,145 for entire package, or $940 for everything except scope.  (Note:  Subtract another $190 from the price if I keep all 12 arrows)

These are FTF prices. Add $40 for shipping directly to your door anywhere in CONUS.  This is a good price on shipping, due to the amount of packaging involved here.

This is NOT one of the newer Tac-15s which are the subject of the recall.  This is a 2011 model, I think.

Offering the ability to quickly move the magnifier out of the way without having to detach the unit, the 3x Tactical Magnifier S.T.S. gives shooters quick target acquisition capabilities.

Fraudsters are attempting to sell sought-after firearms by copying electronic data from legitimate postings and referencing, unbeknownst to their knowledge, local FFL dealer's information in their geographic areas of ""fraud operation"" in an attempt to both legitimize and entice victims to purchase firearms from them.

Copy the picture in the ad and use Google Chrome to conduct an Internet search of the image(s) they are using.  You may find the image on other actionable websites where the firearm has already been sold at a much higher price!  Contact the alleged FFL dealer they reference in their emails and ask if they know the selling party.  Ask for additional pictures!  Advise the seller that you live in the local area and you would like to make an appointment to inspect the firearm in person!  Deal with FFL dealers directly and they should help be able to attest to the legitimacy of the transaction and verify the firearm.  

Also, conduct an email review of the internal header's (research the technology using google if you don't know what this is) from the seller and you will be able to identify that the emails are being opened and sent from mobile devices in SOUTH AFRICA!  Do not become a victim of these pirates!  The price may be enticing but do not fall for the scam...  

Also, when you send a cashier's check they cross out the memo portion of the check (identifying the sale of a firearms) and put ""N/A"" so that it appears you are simply sending them money!  They appear to be using mules in the states to both receive and cash the money using questionable financial centers. 

These fraudsters were selling an FN SCAR 17S FDE NIB with ""issued bipod and four FDE magazines"" for $2,100.  The total came to $2,175 with shipping from FFL to FFL.  Too good to be true right!  This is a fraud and you should report them to LE authorities.  These pirates need to be caught and prosecuted!  Be alert and don't fall victim... This fraud appears to be proliferating so pass the good word to as many as you can."

This is the fastest cycling pump shotgun on the market. The science behind being the fastest cycling pump shotgun is the rotary bolt similar to the bolt used in AR-15 Type weapons which uses the inertia from the load being fired to throw the pump back. From there all the shooter needs to do is throw the pump forward to cycle the next round. 
Its been a great gun, its just time to move on to something else.

It has fiber optic front and rear sights on the barrel... It comes with both the stock breech plug, for using percussion caps, AND a brand-new / never fired 209 primer conversion kit breech plug which is currently installed (this is a $75 plus tax part) - for this breech plug, you use the red plastic 209 primer-holders as you would on newer Knight's rifles.  This conversion allows you to use Blackhorn 209 clean-burning powder if you want, which doesn't ignite reliably with percussion caps.  I will include 20 of the red 209-primer-holders - each can be used about 3 times.  That will get you through 1 or 2 hunting seasons; one season easily.  These are cheap and readily available to buy more from MidwayUSA or directly from Knight's.

Also comes with a small buttload of No. 11 percussion caps, for using that breech plug, plus an extra nipple, and nipple removal tool.  Also comes with breech plug removal tool for both breech plugs.

The stock was a black synthetic one, but it's been re-finished with a unique nice tan textured spray finish.  It is flaking some, but pretty good overall.  This rifle has a nice recoil pad on the stock, but also comes with a brand new Pachmayr Decelerator slip-on recoil pad ($30 part), which lengthens the LOP from youth sized to adult man sized, and fits and looks very nice.  This is important because this is not a good rifle for kids - due to the trigger breaking at ONE lb, 5 oz.  Lightest trigger on any of my rifles.  Don't know why it's so light, but it is.  The bore and receiver on this rifle are pristine.  Knight's are known for their superior accuracy.

This rifle comes with or without a Nikon Omega 3-9x40 scope in high-quality, QD weaver rings.  This is a short, light, handy, muzzleloader for adults with experience (due to excellent but light trigger).

Old Prices:  $460 everything / $240 rifle & Pachmayr pad / $435 with scope but without pad / $215 without scope or Pad

New Prices:  Due to the new conversion kit and new Pachmayr pad price is $440 with scope and rings, or $220 without scope and rings.  Now if I keep the Pachmayr pad, subtract $25 from these prices (i.e. $415 with scope and rings or $195 without).

The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability. While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out!

This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine. This rifle saw little to no action its entire life, maybe an officers or political gaurds weapon

The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was apreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle."

Note that this is an extremely rare configuration for this rifle (and the best one):  The new LR260Ls if you can get one, have a 20"" barrel.  The old ones had an 18"" bbl with permanent/fixed muzzle brake. This one has an 18"" barrel with no muzzle brake - just 5/8ths x 24 tpi threading for accessory of your choice (and comes with a knurled thread protector).  The barrel is a 1 in 7.5"" twist so it will shoot anything you can throw out it, from 140/142 Bergers, Lapuas, & Sierras, to younameit.  Pristine barrel, VERY low round count.  This rifle is very accurate & reliable.  It is the ultimate ""just-one"" rifle for both SHTF and hunting any game on earth.

The LR260L config is a lightweight hunting config, with ACE skeleton buttstock with recoil pad, lo-pro gas block, and a 2-stage JP enterprises hunting/match trigger - mine has a excellent crisp 5lb, 6oz trigger.

This rifle comes with the following extras/ customizations:
1.  ERGO rubber grip
2.  FAB Industries ""T-Grip"" front vertical grip with storage compartment, built in switch for light, and comes with a Surefire 6P light 'installed'.
3.  Oversized ""Tac-Latch"" charging handle
4.   Adjustable gas tube installed, for subsonic or low-power rounds (plus the original gas tube is included)
5.  ""Customization"" (change from original factory config):  The carbon fiber handguard was replaced with a carbine-length aluminum FF quad-rail of unknown make.  Note that this config results in the gas tube being somewhat exposed due to rifle-length gas system but carbine-length FF handguard.  But this has the added advantage of being able to access and adjust the gas tube adjustment instantly.  This is unusual but to me it was worth it to reduce weight and still have a quad-rail.  It is not a problem however; those gas tubes are steel & tougher than they look and I never hit them on anything.  But if you want to put a longer FF handguard back on here and sell or re-use the FF quad rail , you may of course.  This quad rail cost me about $150 since it's for AR10 not AR15.
6.  One 4-round DPMS mag, legal for hunting.
7.  SIX brand-new, never-used DPMS 20-round mags for .260, .308, .243, .338 federal, etc. (Yes they have marks on them because I took them out of the package but I've never used them - I shoot using the 4-round mag).  Note that only five 20-round mags are shown in the pic below, but there are six of them.
8.  I will throw in two boxes of Federal Fusion 120s hunting ammo (20 rds/box).
9.  Original paperwork (but not box)
10.  Brand new Lee Reloading Die set, .260 Rem
11.  Single point sling (flat dark earth color)

[Note that the pictured case does not come with rifle; which is part of the reason I reduced my price by $470 as shown below].

In case you're not aware of the advantages of the .260 rem, it ""blows away"" the .308 at long-range (600-1000 yards and beyond), in drop and drift, and does it with less recoil - see prominent experts in practical long-range shooting, such as:  http://demigodllc.com/articles/the-case-for-260-remington/

Also note that, using the same bullets, .260 rem has more velocity from this 18"" barrel with light loads than a 6.5 Grendel does from a 24"" barrel with very hot loads.  And feeds more reliably and with more readily-available mags than 6.5 Grendel.

1st Old Price:  $1,920
2nd Old Price:  $1,550

New Price (won't go any lower - I'll just keep it):  $1,395 FTF  (Add $180 if you want the Nikon Omega 3-9 x 40mm scope, and the Warne Maxima rings).  Excellent price for this rare config & all the mags, etc.

Add $30 for shipping anywhere in CONUS to your FFL.

NIB Barret Model 98B .338 Lapua Magnum 10 Rounds BLK Bolt Action Repeating Rifle.
Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

ts straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action...put about two ten rnds through it the last time i was testing its accuracy....Please no trades and would not meet anywhere.rifle would ship from FedEx/UPS to an ffl holder within the state.

NIB Barret Model 98B .338 Lapua Magnum 10 Rounds BLK Bolt Action Repeating Rifle.
Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it's not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

ts straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

I haven't been able to buy any .22 ammo since LAST SUMMER when I manged to luck out and my son and I were at bardstown walmart and got 6 boxes of white Winchester, have 2 left as you can see in the pic, and no, it isn't for sell.... but when we bought ammo we kept it to shoot tho, not to rip someone off. now thats almost gone, along with some more I already had and im down to about 3 or 4 thousand rounds of it and need more because im going to go .22 shooting next decent day and that will be another thousand rnds. gone. but yeah, if anyone has any for sell that is reasonable (not m22 black box Winchester tho, theres a recall on that stuff) id sure like to spend a hundred bux and get more than 1000 rnds for it. fucking rediculous"

The Holy Grail of Revolvers:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Python

This 4"" Barreled gun was purchased by My buddies Dad IN 1964
He passed away my buddy isn't a shooter So I have it at my FFL for sale.
This sat for the last 20+ years (Lubed/Oiled) in his safe.
Not to be confused, this is a Shooter not a Virgin. There is some very slight blueing loss at the tip of the Barrel. But the Trigger and wheel are tight and the timing is perfect.
The gun is in VG condition rated at 95-88%
$1700 plus shipping to your FFL.
Please let me know if you need anymore info.

Also please note it is very difficult to photograph these guns and Avoid Glare, so as not to look like the Blueing is worn off. They are that shiny!
I took multiple pics so if you see ""Glare"" on One and not on the other it is because there is no wear, there!

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

 More and more businesses are storing their records electronically. Even if you back up your computer records and files, they still aren't safe. Which is why we offer the FireKing MediaVault. CDs, zip disks, diskettes, microfiche and data cartridges are more sensitive to heat than paper records, so the MediaVault is specially designed to protect them from the harmful effects of heat, as well as humidity and dust. The MediaVault is the only media safe of its size to carry a UL Class 125 1-hour rating for insulated record protection equipment. Affordable and compact, the MediaVault works as a stand-alone unit and is small enough to fit under a desk or credenza."

It is in excellent condition with a bag 6 pmags, 450rds of ammo, Aimpoint 9000l. This is a complete rifle that was put together at a factory. I will not part out the rifle.

I am willing to take partial trades for a 500 Smith and Wesson. XDm's with a 5"" barrel, preferable 9mm or 45. Maybe a M&P 45 with 5"" barrel.

If you have trades, go to gunbroker, look at what the cheapest buy it nows are, that is what we will go with on prices for your trade, This is what I did with my rifle. ""If you want to go what I have in it"" Then consider $1,700 for the rifle, $700 for the ammo, $400 for the aimpoint, $80 for the bag, $60 for extra pmags. $2,940 trade value?!?

I you have other trades, I may consider. Not interested in Shotguns, or hunting rifles. Not really looking for a pistol that is worth over 1k either. I am partial to lower end names that do the same Job. I have a $400 Llama 1911 that will shoot fairly close to a Colt.

This is a high end rifle and MSRP is $1,700 and looks like you can get them on Gun Broker for $1,400 so that is what I am lookng to get out of it. The ammo is over $1.50 a round whever you look. So at least $450 in value for the ammo. The Aimpoint is $400 where ever you look so my 2k asking price shoule be pretty fair.

You need to be willing to meet me locally. I have had a lot of offers trying to get me to drvie to South FL. I don't mind a road trip, but provide me with gas money and a hotel room!!!

Email with any questions, I should reply pretty quickly.

When I was low on money, I worked two jobs...for 5 years. I did not receive nor did I expect a handout of someone else's money.    People used to be embarrassed to be on welfare because that meant they were not self-sufficient...and they wanted to be, they wanted to take care of themselves and take care of their own family and they wanted to work for what they have. Now I see people boasting of the number of free benefits they get from Government welfare, like it is some kind of victory. It is disgraceful and honorable men would be ashamed.

Specs from manufacture...
The Archangel© is the latest holster in the (AIWB) Inside the Waistband Appendix Holster family. The Archangel was specifically designed to retain the concealment advantages of Appendix carry as well as the speed of draw offered by its predecessors. We changed the “J” hooks to dual snap belt loops and did away with the tuckable feature.

Additionally, while the the tuckable feature is important for some end-users, it does add some bulk to the overall holster. The Archangel does not feature a tuckable design and is intended to be worn with a shirt-tails out concealment. The holster itself is very minimal in design and rides very comfortably inside the waistband. The result is a slim-line holster with reduced dimensions and yet just as secure and fast as its other KYDEX® predecessors.
