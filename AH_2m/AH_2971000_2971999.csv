Product Description

Built using the Ultimate Sighting System (USS), the Mark III Tactical Mil Dot 3-9x42 scope combines the benefits of a Mark III tactical scope with the advantage of a backup red dot sight. The system is equipped with a Mark III tactical scope and a specially designed MRD34 ring. The ring, which mounts directly to the ocular lens housing with a built-in Weaver-style platform, stabilizes the red dot sight so you can lock confidently lock on your target. With the scope and sight, the USS is perfect for both close quarter battle and long-range shooting.

 The scope also includes fully multicoated lenses for brightness and clarity, along with a red/green illuminated Mil Dot reticle with multiple brightness settings. Other features include open target turrets, a bullet drop compensator calibrated for the .223 cartridge with a 55-grain bullet, a rotating mount for users who prefer offset functionality, a built-in sunshade, and a quick-focus eyepiece.

I am selling it because I just ordered a pcp air rifle. The Hatsan 135 is one of the most powerful spring air rifles in production.

It delivers a 22 pellet with authority, capable of delivering up to 30 fpe at the muzzle, more than enough for any small game and even some medium game hunting. The gun is accurate.

I'm 5' 10"" so if your around my height or know your bike will fit me that's a plus. I ride to and from school daily which is about 8-9 miles round trip and the cheap-O bike I bought to get a feel for biking is falling apart now. Time for upgrade.

Willing to trade my Remington 700 AAC/SD Tactical. Less then 200 rounds shot before and during hunting season. Cash or cash with trade! Rifle is worth a lot but I'm pricing to sell at $1100. So if we negotiate a deal the combined value will have to be equivalent to the cost of the rifle.

George Bates and Ed Dittus were kind enough to provide us with a test sample of their newest 37mm launcher, the ExD-37, for testing and evaluation purposes. The ExD-37 brings the level of 37mm launchers up a few notches. This new addition to the B&D line incorporates several advances in launcher technology. First off, is the new firing mechanism. It is completely enclosed, with no exposed hammer. It is also a double action, so if for some reason the launcher misfires, you can pull the trigger again, for another strike at the primer, without having to re-cock a hammer, or re-open the launcher. The trigger pull is strong and breaks crisply. The launcher bears a serial number for easy Form 1 registration should the owner or Agency desire to register it as a Destructive Device.

Blue collar. That is the Pratka model OMEN. The Pratka squares off directly with .308 AR rifles. This model gives you a shorter, lightweight barrel and lightweight stock. This is a no frills rifle at first glance, but it has all of the upgrades that an operator wants, like a match trigger, billet receivers and muzzle brake. This isn’t your typical black rifle. The Pratka is harder hitting than any high-end .308 ARs and competitively priced. Shoot one for yourself and experience first-hand an advanced evolution in military-grade ARs.

Blue collar. That is the Pratka model OMEN. The Pratka squares off directly with .308 AR rifles. This model gives you a shorter, lightweight barrel and lightweight stock. This is a no frills rifle at first glance, but it has all of the upgrades that an operator wants, like a match trigger, billet receivers and muzzle brake. This isn’t your typical black rifle. The Pratka is harder hitting than any high-end .308 ARs and competitively priced. Shoot one for yourself and experience first-hand an advanced evolution in military-grade ARs.

These were 7mm Mauser conversions, that make very nice sporters.  I picked it up as a barreled action, intending on re-barreling myself, but that's not going to happen; too many projects.  It shows a little pitting above the wood line.  Can send additional pictures to clarify.  Crest is intact and is cosmetically very nice.  Mechanically, very smooth and functions really well.  If you're looking for a Mauser action for a custom build this would be a good place to start.

most subcompacts.

The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

I believe I have a U.S. Springfield Model 1795 Musket (Type II or Type III) that has been modified.  It appears to have a percussion cap lock and was cut down to a total length of 42.5 inches.  I think these are referred to as ""Indian rifles"" or ""farmer's rifles"".

The area behind the trigger is stamped ""1811"" but the butt plate is stamped ""1812"" and it is stamped ""U.S. Springfield"".  There are no other identifiable markings that I could find.  It appears in pretty good shape (but there is a wedge of wood gouged out in front of the trigger plate).

This gun appears typical of a military musket that has been cut down for ""sporting"" use after its military use.  This gun indeed started out life as a primary American military flintlock musket made in 1812 which could've been used against the British in the war of 1812.

Originally, these guns were made with barrels measuring about 44 inches with three bands attaching barrel to stock. This gun has also been converted to percussion with a drum type of bolster that could of been performed by numerous gunsmiths, blacksmiths, or other mechanics during the anti-bellum era (1845-1860). These guns were cut down for many 
reasons, reducing weight would make these more amenable for use on a farm to hunt game, etc.  I have an e-mail dated 2011 from a very well known U.S. antique gun dealer who stated that he believed the gun was valued at, because of its condition, at between $600 - $1,000.  I can e-mail additional photos if interested.  REASONABLE offers considered."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

  For those of us who believe in the concept of ""Less is More"", when it comes to functionality, the Joe Man Trigger Guard Mercury Holster may just be your next holster for this summer!   Designed for concealed carry weapons use, the Mercury Holster is a no-bulk design which facilitates safe concealed carrying of your handgun while keeping the trigger and trigger guard completely encased during those times when you simply cannot wear a full sized holster.   How does it work? Simply anchor the cord to a sturdy location (ie: belt, purse, backpack and others) and holster your weapon. The holster prevents unintentional objects from entering the trigger guard and inadvertent pressing of the trigger.   When needed, one only has to establish a shooting grip and yank the weapon free to use it.   This ingenious design permits multiple roles and carry positions from a single holster while keeping in mind that ounces add up to pounds.   For full details, visit:http://shop.patriottac.com/Joe-Man-Trigger-Guard-Mercury-Holster-TrigGrdHolster.htm     We also sell products from G Code, EOTech, Aimpoint, Sightmark, Firefield, and others."

XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy.

PredatAR® 5.56 Overview:

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger.

The I-12 is well-balanced, and features a narrow-profile fore-end and buttstock. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. Every I-12 Franchi shotgun is powered by the Inertia Driven System. That means no bulky gas cylinders, valves, pistons, or hardware. Without that extra baggage, the I-12 has a slender, low-profile fore-end that fits the shooter's hand for comfortable handling. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%. The I-12 in Max-4 HD is an ideal choice as a waterfowl gun. This variant also features a 28-inch ventilated rib barrel, and a red-bar front sight and includes a set of screw-in choke tubes.

It is a F I Industries Model D .380.  Looks like a mini 1911.  Very nice condition.  From the research I have done, this is a very rare pistol.  I have taken it to two different gun stores and both said they have never seen one before in all the years they have been dealing.

I am no expert and cannot speak to the absolute truth of what I have read, but I found the following information on this pistol from several locations...

""In the 1970's Colt decided to offer a scaled down 1911 in .380 auto and chose to partner with Star instead of making their very own gun (called the Pony).  After this product was announced, Colt, just coming out of bankruptcy, decided to discontinue all of their .380 products.  Very few Colt-branded guns seem to have been sold.  FI Industries bought up the parts and assembled them as the Model D.  The frames were made in anticipation of the Colt deal, as all the early serial numbers start with ""CPA (Colt Pony Automatic).

Supposedly there were only around 100 made with the CPA serial numbers (which this one has).  The plaque on the grip says ""FI Industries, Washington DC""

Open to offers from those who know more about this pistol and trades."
