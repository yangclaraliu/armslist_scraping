I built this AR as a precision rifle. We are looking at buying a house, so I need cash. I will have to build another, probably very close to this, once things settle down.

The best I have gotten out of it so far is about 1.1 MOA, shooting Federal GMM 69gr. I am confident the problem was me, not the rifle, but I cannot promise anything. I have shot about 200 rounds through it, starting with the shoot one, clean for 10 rounds, then shoot 10 clean for the first hundred. The rifle has been through a couple different configurations, which is one reason I never got to fully wring it out.

SUPER RARE Olympic target air rifle  
These vintage rifles are very highly sought after by shooters and collectors.  There are some light handling marks. The finish is completely original and a “collector’s preference”.  In the opening of his excellent novel Point of Impact, Stephen Hunter quotes Colonel Townsend Whelen as saying, ""Only accurate rifles are interesting."" If that is so, then the 300S is one of the most interesting air rifles ever conceived.  The functioning/firing of this rifle is perfect. I bought it from an experienced air rifle shooter/collector and he had a long conversation with me about ""dry firing"" a Precision Air Rifle, basically: DON'T DO IT. He never did and I haven't either.  Bipod not included.

SUPER RARE Olympic target air pistol  
These vintage pistols are very highly sought after by shooters and collectors.  
The Model 65 is a truly classic target air pistol.  First introduced in the mid 1960's, it was THE target air pistol for many, many years. I believe that there are still international records held by it. It is a spring piston air pistol which was designed for accuracy, not power.  It is considered recoilless because of a sliding action of the receiver to absorb the recoil.  Cocking and compressing the spring is done by pulling back on a lever on the left side of the gun. There are many variations to the basic design, different barrel lengths, grips, sights, one model with an electronic trigger etc.  The rear sight is completely adjustable as you would expect.  There are some light handling marks. The finish is completely original and a “collector’s preference”.  The functioning/firing of this pistol is perfect. I bought it from an experienced air rifle shooter/collector and he had a long conversation with me about ""dry firing"" a Precision Air Pistol, basically: DON'T DO IT. He never did and I haven't either.

The Model 65 is a truly classic target air pistol.  First introduced in the mid 1960's, it was THE target air pistol for many, many years. I believe that there are still international records held by it. It is a spring piston air pistol which was designed for accuracy, not power.  It is considered recoilless because of a sliding action of the receiver to absorb the recoil.  Cocking and compressing the spring is done by pulling back on a lever on the left side of the gun. There are many variations to the basic design, different barrel lengths, grips, sights, one model with an electronic trigger etc.  The rear sight is completely adjustable as you would expect.  

There are some light handling marks. The finish is completely original and a “collector’s preference”. 

The functioning/firing of this pistol is perfect. I bought it from an experienced air rifle shooter/collector and he had a long conversation with me about ""dry firing"" a Precision Air Pistol, basically: DON'T DO IT. He never did and I haven't either.  More photos available by request.

SUPER RARE Olympic target air rifle  

These vintage rifles are very highly sought after by shooters and collectors.  There are some light handling marks. The finish is completely original and a “collector’s preference”. 

In the opening of his excellent novel Point of Impact, Stephen Hunter quotes Colonel Townsend Whelen as saying, ""Only accurate rifles are interesting."" If that is so, then the 300S is one of the most interesting air rifles ever conceived.

The functioning/firing of this rifle is perfect. I bought it from an experienced air rifle shooter/collector and he had a long conversation with me about ""dry firing"" a Precision Air Rifle, basically: DON'T DO IT. He never did and I haven't either.  Bipod not included.  More photos available by request.

It is the stainless steel version with a ""varmint"" barrel. It's not a heavy target or bull barrel. I think it's the perfect profile - it starts very thick in the chamber area and tapers down towards the muzzle.

The rifle has been bedded into a Bell & Carlson synthetic stock with Brownells Accuglass. The bedding is very tight in the action area and supports the chamber area. Past the chamber area it is free-floated. This was done to make the stock more rigid and keep the fore-end from touching the barrel when pressure is applied from underneath.

This stock is far better than the factory garbage and has swivel studs for mounting slings and bipods. There is an ammo carrier glued to the buttstock.



The scope is a Nikon Buckmasters 3-9x40. This has been an outstanding optic for me in the last few years. Its adjustments are more repeatable than two Leupold VX-II scopes that I've had. Very tolerant of adjusting back and forth for different loads.

It shoots well and I can provide 110yd targets if curious. I'd say it averages 1.5MOA 5-shot groups with almost any ammunition, and will easily print 1-1.25MOA with Remington 100gr. Core-Lokt factory ammo. For whatever reason it seems to shoot well with this stuff.

It's been a superb deer, coyote, and prairie dog gun for me. I have other needs now and am letting it go. 

Total price includes 40 rounds of factory Remington 100gr ""core-lokt PSP"" (these shoot well out of it), and some cases that are ready for powder and bullets.  

89 remington cases, 60 winchester cases, 19 federal cases.  All trimmed at 2.484"" +- .001."" They've been tumbled, resized, primer pockets cleaned. 

If the rifle ends up needing to be shipped, I'll have to send the ammunition separately, but will not charge for the ammunition package (I will charge to ship the rifle - likely $30 ground).

Price is firm.  This is a good gun."

This one is just too nice looking to shoot and I cannot yet afford the man cave I want to be able to hang it over a fireplace or gun display or jukebox. I could not find a stray mark in it, it's in perfect condition. It's a modern production sold through ""America Remembers"" manufactured as an authorized commemorative or collectible rifle by Elvis's heirs. I realize that things manufactured as ""collectible"" rarely are actual collectibles, but this rifle is just too interesting and nice to ignore. It was ONLY available through America remembers for $2599. It is the model 1894 lever action angle eject (94AE) with modern cross bolt safety. It does not appear to have ever been fired, and I certainly have not fired it. It comes with the hang tag, but no owners manual. #451 out of 1000 made. Caliber is 30-30 Winchester. I have seen some sell for more than $2599, and seen some sell for less than $2599. I am pricing mine below the lowest priced sale I found on gunsamerica or any other sold rifle.
 I see that America Remembers just issued another Elvis tribute in the form of a Colt Government model 45. It was in the most recent issue of American Rifleman. They also made a Colt Single Action Army model. If you love Elvis, you could pick up an entire firearms collection, Colt SAA Revolver, Colt 1911 Pistol, and Winchester 1894 Rifle. Now if they will just make a Remington 870 pump shotgun and a Colt AR15, you would never need a gun WITHOUT Elvis on it :) You can check my feedback scores on ebay and gunbroker under ""evlgreg"" with 14+ years of 100% perfect feedback and reputation and over 1000 transactions.
 The gun is located in Colorado which means face to face sales are not possible. I will not respond to anyone offering to buy it outside of the new Colorado laws.  If you know of a local dealer that will perform the transfer, then please let me know. All the dealers I contacted will not do a full transfer for the new state mandated $10 maximum. I am happy to package and ship the rifle and will include a padded gun case to insure the rifle arrives safely to your dealer for a non person-to-person transfer.  You will have to send me your Dealer's current FFL document for me to ship."

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability.

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture."

The Holstarr Rack is not limited to just holding a pistol but can be used to hold many different types of accessories and multiple accessories such as a flashlight, pepper spray, knife, TV remote, cell phone, drink holder, handcuffs, clip, pistol holster and/or anything that might fit on your belt. Most bed holsters comes with an universal and generic type holster that may or may not fit your pistol, whereas the The Holstarr Rack allows you to use your own personal holster specifically designed for your pistol insuring a secure fit. Being that The Holstarr Rack is a one piece design there are not any movable or attached parts that could wear out or fall off. Ambidextrous in design, The Holstarr Rack can be placed on the left or right side of the bed and the head or foot board of the bed and upside down or right side up to allow for many applications. Specification: 10.5"" long x 12"" wide x 1.75"" high, 14 Gage steel, powder-coated black texture. It sales for $24.99, please contact your local Arms dealer.

I was told its from a dealership.  Its 4 feet tall by 8 feet long.  In GREAT shape.  I paid a tad over $800 at auction.  Have been told by collectors its easily worth over $1,000 due to its rarity and condition.

I can either sell it or trade it for gun related items.  Here is a list that I'd consider.  And I am not desperate so no junk please.

Sig 226 either 9MM or 40 Cal
Any good name 1911 chambered in 45
Smith and Wesson revolvers 6"" or longer barrel.  Might consider a 4 38 Special
Glocks
Magnum Research handguns
AR10 Lower
AR15 upper or lower or both
M1 Garand or Carbine.
Benelli M2 or M4
Saiga 12 GA or 410


I know that most guns are either below or above the $750 price on the sign so remainder of balance would be made up by cash on my end or on your end either cash or ammo.  I would consider several guns at once and I'd make up the difference in cash.

NO COMPACTS please!!  I have a few conceal carry weapons already.  All handguns that I listed I would like full size please.  

I am firm on the $750 price since I paid more and have had collectors tell me its worth a lot more.

Not to sound harsh but I will not pay inflated ""obama"" prices on guns.  Thanks for your time and interest.  Email if interested please.


Oh...  I also have a VERY NICE set of rims off of a 2008 FXDC (Dyna SuperGlide) that has a rear tire mounted in awesome shape that I'd like to trade too.  Value on them is $350.  Rims are laced,, in great shape too.  Only 2,000 miles on them before I took them off the bike."

I would like it to go to a good home where it will be appreciated. This 1889 is a Grade 1 and serial number is 67893. The exposed hammers add interest to this relic and will help to make it a nice conversation piece. It was owned by a Marine Commandant (highest rank) and I'm trying to get the name. If I get the name the price may go up, especially with evidence. Stylized hammers and rounded pistol grip also make this stand out. The butt plate is intact and the gun is in working order, but it's advisable to use low power rounds. Walnut furniture is intact, there is a chunk missing on the bottom by the trigger, but you'd have to turn it upside down to see it. This would look fabulous over your mantle or in your man cave. A rich patina covers the metal parts and I have not attempted to restore it in any way. Bores look better than I expected, appears to have not been shot much. The dark rings are close to the rear and seem to be stops that position the shells.

The Rifle is a Chinese Polytech m1a side stamped. The rifle was shipped to Warbird Custom Guns http://www.warbirdscustomguns.com/ and had several things done to it. First I had the Polytech bolt replace with a complete LRB bolt from LRB arms. http://www.lrbarms.com/m14parts.html do some research and you will find this bolt is the foremost bolt for the M1a currently. I also had Tim at Warbirds install new American made springs and a sadlak National Match spring guide. I also had him drill a USGI connector lock hole so the stock that the M1a For sits in would perform flawlessly. The M1A sits in a SAGE EBR chassis system that performs flawlessly. http://sageebr.com/. I also installed a threaded front sight base made by Smith Enterprises. I attached a PWS PRC muzzle brake to the front. http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=127 between the muzzle brake and the chassis system the rifle kicks about as much as a quality AK47.  I also have a grip pod system on the front rail. http://www.grippod.com/. Rifle fuctions flawlessly I have shot about 300 rounds of foreign nato  7.62x51 with 0 malfunctions. I will include 5 brand new CMI magazines still in the plastic. The flashlight and Aimpoint pro do not come with the rifle. I would sell the aimpoint pro for $350.00 if you really wanted it. I am asking 2400.00 or best offer. I will reduce the price of the gun by 100 dollars if you want the muzzle brake removed. I will also reduce the price by 70 dollars if you dont want the grip pod. I am open to partial trades or straight trades. I am interested in piston driven .308s and also ak 47s. I have about 20 CMI m1a magazines if you are interested in anymore. Also the old Chinese bolt, stock and springs come with the gun if you would like them."
