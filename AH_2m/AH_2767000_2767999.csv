From Barrett.net 

Its straight-line design, running from the highly efficient muzzle brake to the shooter's shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip and allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a new round into the chamber as the bolt glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

This impressive long-range rifle system is equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod. From its shooter-adaptable design to its unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

Standard from the factory includes adjustable bar/dot night sights, checkered front strap, and checkered mainspring housing.  I've installed a short aluminum trigger, and I have the original trigger with it as well.  I did not modify the internals, just fitted the new trigger.  This pistol has a fantastic trigger pull as it is from the factory; no modification needed.  Sig Sauer makes some great 1911s with a lot of features for the money.  What's nice about this Traditional model is that it will fit any standard 5"" Govt 1911 holster, unlike many of the other Sig 1911s that have a proprietary (thicker) slide profile.  Included with the pistol are the two (2) original factory 8rd magazines, original factory case, and owner's manual.

Lower Receiver Specifications

The lower receiver used in this build is a True MIL-SPEC forged lower, quality made using 7075 T6 aluminum (aircraft grade). The Lower was manufactured by DPMS. They make high quality MIL-SPEC lowers. Before you buy an AR-15 always make sure that the lower receiver is a Forged Lower Receiver made with 7075 T6 aluminum. 	   
Lower Parts Kit Specifications 

The lower parts kit used in this build was made by a military contractor CMMG. These are true mil-spec lower parts used by the military and other large manufacturers. These are high quality lower parts made to last. Before you buy an AR-15 always make sure that the lower parts kit is from a reputable manufacturer and are not made from polymer parts. Some manufacturers use cheap imported parts from overseas that will not last long under the high heat and pressure of firing multiple rounds quickly. Always ask about each part before buying an rifle. If the seller cannot or will not tell you where the parts come from beware. 	   
Buffer Tube & Buffer/Action Spring Specifications 

The 6 position adjustable UTG stock allows you to fit the rifle to your needs and has been built to meet all military specifications. What does this mean for you? First and foremost, you get the best possible fit between the stock body and the tube, cancelling any rattle that might occur with cheaper stocks. Oh, and did we mention the tube is 100% made in the USA? We have pulled out all the stops to create and craft the best Mil-Spec AR stock on the market. The only place to start is with the UTG Mil-Spec T6 Stock. The buffer tube used in this build is mil-spec and was made with 7075 T6 aluminum (aircraft grade). These are true mil-spec buffer tubes made with military grade materials and mil-spec diameter. The tube also includes a carbine action spring and carbine buffer. Before you buy an AR-15 you should ask for the specifics of the buffer tube. Many sellers will call their buffer tube ""mil-spec"" simply because the diameter of the tube is mil-spec, but you should also ask what type of aluminum it was made from. If it was not made from 7075 T6 it will not be as durable and could possibly bend on you under heavy stress. Don't settle for mil-spec diameter, insist on mil spec materials as well. 	   
Buttstock Specifications 

The 6 position adjustable stock allows you to fit the rifle to your needs and has been built to meet all military specifications. What does this mean for you? First and foremost, you get the best possible fit between the stock body and the tube.	   
Pistol Grip Specifications 

The Pistol Grip used in this build is a mil-spec Magpul MOE Plus Pistol Grip. The MOE+ Grip combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, this AR15/M16 drop-in design features a hard-polymer bottom edge to reduce the possibility of equipment snags or grip damage. The MOE+ Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. This is the most comfortable pistol grip that Magpul makes. Don't settle for a cheap plastic pistol grip, make sure it's a Magpul.




Upper Receiver Specifications 

The Upper Receiver used in this build is a Forged, Mil-spec Stag Arms A3 flat top upper Manufactured using 7075 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum with M4 feed ramp cuts and Hard Anodized in Dark Black. It includes a mil-spec Forward Assist Assembly, Ejection Cover Door Assembly, and a Billet Aluminum Heavy Duty Charging Handle. Before you buy an AR-15 always make sure that the upper receiver is a Forged and made with 7075 T6 aluminum. 	   
Bolt Carrier Group Specifications 

The Bolt Carrier Group used in this build is Nickel Boron Coated from WMD Guns. The bolt carrier group is one of the most important parts of any rifle. The Nickel Boron Coated Bolt Carrier Group from WMD Guns is one of the absolute best bolt carrier groups available period! 

The bolt is Carpenter 158 case hardened steel that has been shot peened and magnetic particle inspected. It is Manufactured to Government drawings with Mil-Spec gas rings and NiB-X coated (40% more wear resistant than Chrome).

The Extractor is manufactured, heat treated, and hardened per Government drawings. It also includes a black extractor buffer and heavy duty spring and is also NiB-X coated.

The Firing Pin is manufactured, heat treated, hardened, Chromed and certified per Government drawings.

The Carrier is an M16 style full auto carrier (heavy weight), 8620 material, heat treated and case hardened. The Manufacturing tolerances on inside diameters is tightly controlled. NiB-X coated for durability and ease of cleaning.

The Gas Key is Hardened to USGI Specifications and attached using grade 8 hardened fasteners. Permatex No. 3D Aviation Form a gasket Type III Sealing Compound per MIL-S-45180 used on assembly. NiB-X coated. Staked per military specifications.

The Cam pin is Manufactured, heat treated, hardened and certified per Government drawings. NiB-X Coated.

Before you buy an AR-15 you must ask the following questions about the Bolt Carrier Group: 
Who is the manufacturer of the bolt carrier group? 
Is the bolt made from 158 Carpenter Steel? 
Is the bolt shot peened? 
Is it Magnetic Particle Inspected? 
Is it Nickel Boron Coated for durability?
If any of the answers are No then you have a very inferior unreliable bolt carrier group. Many sellers skimp on this part and buy cheap off brand bolt carrier groups. This is one part that you should never cut corners on! Make them tell you who manufactures the bolt carrier group and what it's specs are.

Gas Tube Specifications 

The Gas Tube used in this build is a Carbine Length Mil-Spec Gas Tube. 	   
Gas Block Specifications 

The Gas Block used in this build is a Yankee Hill Machine Low Profile Gas Block. This gas block provides a simple, low profile design that can be used to mount a mid-length forearm to a carbine length barrel. Manufactured from high quality steel and finished with a mil. spec. phosphate coating. This gas block has a bore diameter of .750 inches. 	   
Free Float Quad Rail Specifications 

The Free Float Quad Rail used in this build is very high quality with “T” marked rails to mark accessory locations. It utilizes anti-rotation screws for secure installation. The forearms and barrel nuts are made of 6061-T6 aluminum and hardcoated to military specifications. The jam nut and anti-rotation screws are steel and plated a matte black finish to match.

Always ask what type of rail is installed before buying an rifle. Free float rails are much better than 2 piece rails because they allow for greater accuracy. Since Free Float rails do not put any strain on the barrel it allows the rifle to be much more accurate. Try to stay away from 2 piece rails that bolt directly to the barrel because the extra weight and pressure on the barrel will decrease the accuracy of your rifle. Always go free float if you can. 	   
Vertical Grip Specifications 

The Front Vertical Grip used in this build is a Bipod Grip. Designed for use with 1913 Picatinny railed hand guards, the Bipod Grip is similar to the famous Grippod. It is quickly removable with no tools and provides a stationary platform for shooters to use. 	   
Flash Hider/Compensator Specifications 

The Compensator/Flash Hider used in this build is an aggressive tooth Phantom Comp/Flash Hider. The popular Phantom Flash Suppressor has been redesigned to work as a muzzle compensator while maintaining the excellent flash hiding capabilities of its predecessor. This 5 port design has no downward facing port which helps eliminate d"

ACH Head-Loc™ Retention System H-Nape

The Head-Loc RS was developed to improve safety, comfort and stability of chinstraps used in MICH/ACH ballistic helmets. Every component, down to each stitch pattern, was designed specifically for this purpose, giving the ACH greater utility than ever before. Custom adjustment tabs allow the helmet to be adjusted while wearing it, without any hanging loose ends. Simplified strap geometry makes the system 3X more stable than existing chinstraps.

This system has resulted from years of input and testing by some of the most respected operators in the USSOCOM community. Their demanding requirements for NVG stability, multiple environment versatility and overall performance are credit to the design today. Without their help, the Head-Loc chinstrap would not exist.

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.
The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

-------------------- More Info -------------------------
By Far the most advanced composite AR 15 lower on the market today, and at a price anyone can afford. Formed from a blend of scientifically advanced materials, the PCF C-15 lowers have proven to be among the lightest, most durable composite lowers available today. And because they are molded from a solid color, finish ware and scratches are a thing of the past.

Every lower is shipped with the accu-group composite fire control system, a market first in the AR 15 world, and offer a 4.5lb to 5.0lb trigger pull with zero perceived creep, an ultra crisp let off, and incredibly fast lock up times. These lowers also feature a reversible safety to accommodate right or left hand shooters.

Still want more? How about a six position buffer tube and slider (commercial)? If that’s not enough, how about the fact that this lower will except any milspec upper and offers an 8% elongation factor, giving it a zero slop fit? No more wedging the back of your lower with extra parts!

A nice inexpensive light lower option at 1LB, 11oz compared to 2lb, 3oz of a similarly equipped forged lower.

Vortex StrikeFire SFRD-AR15 Red/Green Dot Sight w/ Extra-High Mount

Description:

When the situation demands fast shooting...and a big scope with a narrow field of view won't cut it, the StrikeFire red dot riflescope lets you shoot quickly with both eyes open! With unlimited field of view and eye relief—nothing gets you on target faster than this tough, shockproof and waterproof red dot scope.
Includes:

Extra-high 30mm ring, appropriate for Flat Top AR15
2x Magnifier
Flip-up lens caps
CR2 battery
Features:

Fully Multi-Coated Lenses: Increase light transmission with multiple anti-reflective coatings on all air-to-glass surfaces.
30mm Tube: Allows greater windage and elevation adjustment travel along with greater strength compared to the one-inch tube.
One-Piece Tube: Rugged, aluminum alloy chassis maximizes strength and waterproofness.
Extra-high Ring Height:	Puts scope's bore center 37mm (1.46 inches) above the base height. Commonly used for mounting with a Flat Top AR15, providing absolute co-witness. Mounting ring fits Weaver or Picatinny style base.
Waterproof: Optics are sealed with o-rings to prevent moisture, dust, and debris from getting inside the scope.
Fogproof: Nitrogen purged to inhibit internal fogging.
Shockproof: High recoil rating. Tested with .375 H&H Magnum for 1000 rounds.
Parallax Free: Allows for rapid shooting with both eyes open, without concern for parallax shooting error. Parallax free beyond 50 yards; less than one-inch error closer than 50 yards.
Operating Temperature:	Rated from -40 degrees to +140 degrees Fahrenheit.
Unlimited Eye Relief: Non-critical eye relief for rapid target aquisition.
Red/Green Light Switch:	Allows switching between red and green dot for optimum contrast with surroundings.
Adjustable Dot Intensity:	Allows adjusting of the dot intensity according to viewing conditions.
Night Vision Mode	Sets the brightness to the lowest possible level—an illumination level that generally is not seen without use of a night vision device.
2x Doubler: Screw-in doubler provides extra magnification for longer distance shooting.
Flip-up Lens Caps: The protective caps flip up from the lenses: 1.38 inches from the eyepiece and 1.75 inches from the objective lens.
Battery Life: 6-hour auto-shutdown feature maximizes battery life.
Typical battery life in normal mode of operation:
Maximum brightness of 130 hours (Red) | 420 hours (Green);
Minimum brightness of 4400 hours (Red) | 4700 hours (Green).
Typical battery life in night vision mode:

------------------ More Info ----------------------
By Far the most advanced composite AR 15 lower on the market today, and at a price anyone can afford. Formed from a blend of scientifically advanced materials, the PCF C-15 lowers have proven to be among the lightest, most durable composite lowers available today. And because they are molded from a solid color, finish ware and scratches are a thing of the past.

Every lower is shipped with the accu-group composite fire control system, a market first in the AR 15 world, and offer a 4.5lb to 5.0lb trigger pull with zero perceived creep, an ultra crisp let off, and incredibly fast lock up times. These lowers also feature a reversible safety to accommodate right or left hand shooters.

Still want more? How about a six position buffer tube and slider (commercial)? If that’s not enough, how about the fact that this lower will except any milspec upper and offers an 8% elongation factor, giving it a zero slop fit? No more wedging the back of your lower with extra parts!

A nice inexpensive light lower option at 1LB, 11oz compared to 2lb, 3oz of a similarly equipped forged lower.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

Offered for your consideration is one (1) Walther P38 – P1 semi-automatic pistol chambered in the very popular 9m/m, (9X19m/m – Luger), caliber. This P1 is in excellent condition showing only very minor finish wear on a few sharp edges. It comes with a period German camouflaged holster, cleaning kit, original Walther P1 magazine, and owners manual. It was manufactured in April, 1974.

In late 1963 the postwar military model P1 was adopted for use by the German military, identifiable by the P1 stamping on the slide. The postwar pistols, whether marked as P38 or P1, have an aluminum frame rather than the steel frame of the original design. The aluminum frame was later reinforced with a hex bolt above the trigger guard. During the 1990s the German military started replacing the P1 with the P8 pistol and finally phased out the P1 in 2004.

I have over $630 into this gun.  $450 firm, no trades.  Now including a custom Thiess IWB holster.  

For sale is a Ruger LC9 the way it should be.  Gun has the RTK trigger installed by Galloway Precision with the Galloway trigger bar, hammer, and reduced power springs.  This is the 50% short stroke trigger system.  Reduces take up and over travel in the long DA only LC9.  These upgrades make it easier to be accurate with the first shot, and more accurate with follow up shots.  Super smooth and easy to shoot compared to the stock LC9.

Gun is also equipped with the Galloway stainless guide rod, and a set of XS Express Tritium Big Dot night sights.  All of these upgrades combine to make the LC9 an easy to shoot, safe, accurate carry pistol.  100% reliable with any ammo I could stuff in the magazine.  The gun has the magazine disconnect removed, (allows the weapon to be fired without a magazine inserted.  Highly desirable if the bad guy somehow hits your mag release and all you're left with is one in the chamber.) and the loaded chamber indicator mod done (why let the bad guy know if your gun is loaded or not?).

Price is $450 FIRM with 3 Ruger mags and a finger extension, box and papers.  FTF only in Jax.  Must be FLORIDA RESIDENT 21 years of age and sign a Bill of Sale.  Prefer CCW.  I don't care if you can get this gun cheaper somewhere else.  If it was that easy you wouldn't be bugging me.  Go buy it  and see if they'll throw in shipping, transfer and the upgrades as well.

These were built in the 60's and 70's in  Knoxville, Tennessee.  It shoots standard .45 ACP ammo in semi-auto fashion from a closed bolt using a simple blow-back action and very few moving parts.   Has a real operational muzzle brake, 16"" barrel and beautiful walnut furniture.  The rear stock, butt plate and sling loop are original Thompson (that's just what Volunteer Enterprises used).  The bluing is 80-90% in my opinion, and overall the gun looks very nice.  It's very fun to shoot, but mostly it's fun to just hold and look at!  It is very iconic. I've only fired a couple of magazines through it, but for me it functioned flawlessly, with no failures.  It is pretty quiet with almost no recoil, but makes a big hole!  My young son can handle it easily.   It uses standard grease gun stick mags, and a high-capacity one is included.  
This is a fairly inexpensive reproduction of the Thompson, but that being said this gun DOES NOT feel ""cheap"".  I have owned a couple of the GSG .22 cal copies (like the HK and AK47), and this Thompson does NOT feel like them.  It's heavy; probably about the same weight of an original Thompson, and just feel dense, heavy and solid in your hands.  The Walnut furniture is generous in proportions and great feeling in your hands.  It is impossible to not draw people over when at the range.  It's just cool.

The only trades I might be interested in would be for a magnum revolver made by Colt or S&W only.  I could add $ to the deal for the right gun.  For cash, the price is firm.  I would like to see a CWP or other ""good guy"" card to complete the sale.   If it's listed, I still have it.  To weed out scammers, e-mails without contact phone numbers will be ignored.

931,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2767931,"For Sale:  PRESS RELEASE FOR BUFFALO BARNES LEAD FREE 125gr. TAC-XP 40 S&W, STANDARD PRESSURE, LOW FLASH   (ITEM 23D)","Azusa, California, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 4, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=303

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
1303 fps  -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel
You’ll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

This is the largest, heaviest 9mm I've ever handled, also the most accurate. The weight translates to more stable shooting. With a full magazine inserted, this gun is amazingly balanced, though still very heavy. That weight assists in rapid fire shooting. It is heavy and built like a tank. It is not a good candidate for concealed carry, which is exactly why I am selling it.

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.
