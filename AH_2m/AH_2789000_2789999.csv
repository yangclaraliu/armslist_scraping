Like New Glock G20 10mm Gen 3 w/True Dot Night Sights. The Glock has seen little use, but is a few year old now and the rear Night Sights are starting to fade, the front is still bright. Bought this used last year along with a 44mag for my brother who was heading up to Alaska for four legged defense, He decided he wanted to stick with the 44mag and didn't want this. This is a great back country carry gun with 2, 15rd mags with some of the hotter loads gives you 31rds of near 41mag defensive power in a reliable package. I have a couple hundred rounds of range and defensive ammo up for sale as well (in pic). 

$750 As a package for both gun and ammo (I have about $875 into everything you see), I am willing to sell the gun only for $525, the Ammo for $275. 

I am willing to consider fair offers (yes $400 is too low) and trades (for S&W 629/29/329pd or 69 or Ruger Redhawk in 44mag or Marlin 1895 or Win 1886 in 45/70), but i am really looking for cash.

Bose Companion 2 Series II Multimedia Speaker , the set has been used very little they are like new 
Product Information 
The Bose Companion 2 is produced by a company known for producing high fidelity stereo equipment. These Bose computer speakers are built to higher standards than the built-in speakers included with most PCs and laptops and can be placed apart from each other for greater stereo separation, making them well suited as multimedia computer speakers. Consisting of a right and left unit (each with a 7.5-inch height) and built-in bass ports, these Bose Companion 2 computer speakers provide deep bass reproduction without the need for a separate subwoofer. The Bose computer speakers are wired and include two audio inputs: one for a computer, with a second input on the front of the right speaker for hooking up an auxiliary device (such as an MP3 player). Bose Companion 2 computer speakers utilize TrueSpace, a proprietary digital stereo processing system, to provide a powerful audio boost to video gaming, movies and music played on a computer. These multimedia computer speakers are housed in contemporary cabinets designed to visually complement any PC or laptop as well as extending its sound capabilities.

Coincidentally, after I bought it, I realized it was made in Longmont, CO, which I happened to call home back in 2009-10. Small world. Either way...

576,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2789576,For Sale:  380 Auto Standard Pressure Ammo 90 gr. JHP (1025 fps/M.E. 210 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Sunday, March 9, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=218

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto standard pressure loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel.  We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle. Note my ""real world"" velocities from my personal ""real world"" pistols.

Purchased in December, about 20 rounds fired through it, treated with Frog Lube brand synthetic gun lube, (this is great stuff,  it bonds with the metal and really makes the action smooth!) 7 rounds of .380 low recoil, lead free primer, bull nose ammunition. Factory lockable hard case, owners manual, a small tactical style ballistic nylon range bag, one magazine, two concealed carry holsters. One is designed to conceal the outline of the gun and still allow use of the gun without removing it from the holster, the other slips into your pocket or purse and allows fast draw while keeping the gun in a stable position. 
While most pocket pistol builders use the straight blowback design, the Kel-Tec uses a locked breech system, like modern large-caliber pistols. By using a locked breech, the P3AT does not need a heavy slide to retard the blowback of the action. This results in the lightest .380 auto ever built. This gun fires with a smooth double-action pull of the trigger which measures at 6 pounds pull. 
It is small enough and light enough that it can always be at hand if a weapon is needed. While a larger handgun might be left in the vehicle or at home, the little Kel-Tec is always there within easy reach. It weighs less than many popular pocket knives, yet carries a payload of seven .380 cartridges. 
Rapidly firing the .380 until empty, it is easy to keep all shots centered on a standard silhouette target at fifteen yards.

It's in good shape, it does have some minor handling marks, I would still rate it at 95%.
Most of the marks are around the trigger guard. No holster wear of any kind, just minor nicks in the finish around the trigger guard. Yes I said it twice, just to make sure you heard me.
Included is box, manual, both sets of grips and all the factory candy. 

This is FTF in Indy, Valid IN DL and a LTCH (carry permit) please.
Gas is expensive, I will not drive all over the place, if you are not from Indy, you will need to come here. I live on the South side, but will meet you anywhere in Indy."

Comes with one 20 rd. magazine, hard-shelled case, and original factory manuals on CD.  This has been my long range coyote gun, and it loves the (relatively) inexpensive military surplus 147 and 150 grain ammo which leaves the barrel at about 2,800 fps.  In the hilly area where I hunt, 600 yards was about the farthest shot possible, and the longer 20"" fluted barrel handles that distance with ease.  I built a faster (4,225 fps) coyote gun on a .204 Ruger platform, and just don't have the need for two.

The factory specs : For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube.  Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight.  Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings.

This is a very well made, accurate setup for converting a 1911 to fire 22LR.

I've used this conversion on a Kimber Custom Eclipse and a Baer Thunder Ranch Special. It ran flawlessly on the Baer, but the slide-to-frame fit on the Kimber was a bit tight and made it more finicky about ammo. I'm not sure if this was just the pistol I had or Kimbers in general, so caveat emptor.

I probably have somewhere between 1000 and 1500 rounds on the conversion. It's in 
excellent condition with some wear visible in the areas where it mates with the host's frame rails.

The kit comes in a soft padded case that holds the slide, slide stop, takedown tool, and two magazines (all included). I've misplaced the original manual somewhere along the way, but I made a hardcopy of a pdf version.

I realize that people are having a hard time even finding .22 ammo these days so I'm including a partial box (about 250 rounds) of Federal Auto Match.  The manual explicitly says ""No Federal"" but I think this stuff should run ok."

It is all metal with aluminum alloy frame, stainless slide, and stainless barrel. It has an ambidextrous safety/de-cocker lever, a slide release lever, a magazine release, and a magazine disconnect which disables the trigger when the magazine is removed. Traditional DA pistol, which means first shot is in double action and follow up shots are single action. It is thin, at barely an inch wide and a 3-1/2"" barrel, making it a favorite for concealed carry. Smith and Wesson 3913 single stack 8 plus 1 (2 mags included). This is a great shooter with holster wear present on top of slide and some on trigger guard. Hogue rubber grips makes for a good grip purchase and recoil absorbtion. 3 dot Novak sights. Weight with empty mag is 25 oz. , just right to put this fine pistol’s recoil impulse at a superbly comfortable minimum. These 3rd gen S&W semi-autos are arguably the best Smith & Wesson ever produced. Original black plastic wraparound grip included.

This ammo is NOT Reloads .  Most is NEW IN THE BOX . MOST is RECENT Production . Few boxes is older ammo . What happened is I went through my stock and thinned out my collection of rounds I don't have a weapon for anymore . What I wanted to do is TRADE for a NICE 22 Mag rifle and a dealer said he would trade for ammo . Once I went through my stuff , he low balled me and wanted to pick and choose certain brands at a LOW price . So I'm putting this out to do on my own. I would like to sell or trade  as a LOT, but who knows ? let me know what you have or are interested in . I went on line and checked cheapest going rate and totaled $1200 . So that's where I'm starting at and we can go from there . I live just outside Dayton, Ohio in Beavercreek , Ohio. Thanks, Rick REDACTED"

This simple and reliable 15 round pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

 

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

 

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Extra power recoil spring (recoil is like a compact 9mm)
Trijicon Tritium XS Big Dot night sights

This shoots very smoothly. I've shot maybe 150~rounds through it since it was finished. It is surprisingly light for a full-size 45. I have comfortably IWB carried it before and after the work. It has a small scuff from the holster in the Cerakote on the right side.

It will come with the original case, 2-13rd magazines and all of the XD gear.

I will also include some Federal Premium Tactical HST 230gr ammunition (several boxes), once fired brass and a box of Winchester fmj 230gr (Not for sale separately)

I have more pictures upon request.

The only reason for selling is that I want another long distance rifle to play around with. Distance is my true shooting passion. 

Here's the deal, I know what I have in it and what it is worth. I'm selling/trading for way less than I have in it and for what I think is a fair market price. If you don't think it's fair, don't buy it, it's that simple. I don't need to or have to sell it.

As stated above, the cash price is $800 firm, $900 will get the pistol and all  extras.

Trade value is set at $900 for everything listed

I'm easy to get along with, so don't be afraid to offer a trade. The worst I can say is no. 

I would prefer to sell FTF locally in state. I will sell out of state but, you are responsible for any and all transfer fees and your applicable state laws. I would rather not ship this, however I will do so if need be.

I'm willing to drive a reasonable distance (up to 50 miles one way)for the right deal. I live in Rushville, 1 hour east of Indy.

If you have questions, please feel free to ask.

You may call me at 765-56one-53nine1 between 9am and 9pm.

Thank you for looking and have a nice day."

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. The rock solid corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame is lighter than steel and has a Picatinny rail for mounting lights, lasers and accessories. Multiple trigger firing modes and a special grip frame with included interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates ensure a customized shooting experience. The one piece slide is machined from nitro-carbuerized steel and has a corrosion resistant blued finish. A polygonal barrel bore profile results in increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. The P30L features a longer slide and barrel than the standard P30.
Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot.

The upper receiver has the enhanced charging handle for ease of use. The upper receiver itself is monolithic meaning that the rail system and upper were milled out of one solid piece of aluminium. This means that there is no gap on the top rail and it also eliminates the need for a barrel nut. The piston system is a one piece piston system that can be switched from normal firing to suppressed firing modes.
This is considered one of the best gas piston rifles and have only become harder and harder to find.
