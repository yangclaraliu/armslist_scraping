Precision multi-coated optics are the distinguishing feature of the Firefield Tactical Riflescope line and offers the clearest view in both bright and low light situations. Featuring a built in 5mW red laser, the Firefield Riflescope, is used for quick target acquisition in rapid changing environments, so it hits the target every time with precision accuracy. The lowest magnification setting at 2.5x can be used for scanning, while offering a much broader field of view, while the highest settings in the magnification range are more than adequate for mid to long-range shots. A respectable zoom from 2.5-10x allows the shooter to make an accurate shot at a long distance and keep a tight grouping. The FF13011 also includes 100-500 yard .223 bullet drop compensation turret, which adjusts the elevation of the reticle ensuring that the shooter can achieve zero by moving the compensation turret to the correct yardage. Firefield-Victory Justifies Everything."

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.  This gun is backed by Davidson's lifetime guarantee.

To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  This gun is backed by Davidson's lifetime guarantee.

It comes with a sling as well, but there are no marking on it from what I can tell. The bore is in good shape overall, but there is some light pitting in the last six inches or so of the bore toward the muzzle.

It weighs only 7 lbs. The No.2 grade is several steps above the common field grade guns and has lots of beautifully detailed factory engraving, even on the screw heads, and features richly grained, high quality wood. This gun has SN#349364, which indicates it was made in 1921. It is 12 Gauge with 26"" Barrels, left is choked full, right is cylinder bore, and the length of pull is 13 3/4"" with an early vintage Pachmayr White Line rubber pad on the butt. It has an automatic safety, double triggers and extractors. The serial numbers all match. The metal finish appears to be all original, with the rust bluing on the barrels at around 90%, while a substantial amount of original case colors remains on the receiver with some protected areas and the bottom looking really bright. The deluxe tiger striped stock is in great shape with no cracks and sharp checkering, while the forearm has some wear and scuffs, but is still in good shape with a deluxe ebony insert at the front. The left barrel has a very slight ding about 4"" from the muzzle (also in a pic). Bores are mint, and the gun is mechanically sound and locks up nice and tight. I've tried to describe the gun accurately, with plenty of detailed photos, but please email me if you have questions. Thanks for looking, and good luck in bidding! This gun ships to a C&R or FFL holders, and shipping is $25, extra for Alaska or Hawaii. Payment can be via Western Union, USPS Money Orders/Certified Checks and personal checks. Please note that for personal checks gun will not ship until check clears. Please ensure that the item(s) you are bidding on are legal in the state you reside in."

It weighs only 7 lbs. The No.2 grade is several steps above the common field grade guns and has lots of beautifully detailed factory engraving, even on the screw heads, and features richly grained, high quality wood. This gun has SN#349364, which indicates it was made in 1921. It is 12 Gauge with 26"" Barrels, left is choked full, right is cylinder bore, and the length of pull is 13 3/4"" with an early vintage Pachmayr White Line rubber pad on the butt. It has an automatic safety, double triggers and extractors. The serial numbers all match. The metal finish appears to be all original, with the rust bluing on the barrels at around 90%, while a substantial amount of original case colors remains on the receiver with some protected areas and the bottom looking really bright. The deluxe tiger striped stock is in great shape with no cracks and sharp checkering, while the forearm has some wear and scuffs, but is still in good shape with a deluxe ebony insert at the front. The left barrel has a very slight ding about 4"" from the muzzle (also in a pic). Bores are mint, and the gun is mechanically sound and locks up nice and tight. I've tried to describe the gun accurately, with plenty of detailed photos, but please email me if you have questions. Thanks for looking, and good luck in bidding! This gun ships to a C&R or FFL holders, and shipping is $25, extra for Alaska or Hawaii. Payment can be via Western Union, USPS Money Orders/Certified Checks and personal checks. Please note that for personal checks gun will not ship until check clears. Please ensure that the item(s) you are bidding on are legal in the state you reside in."

Prior owner advised it has 22rds down the barrel. 

It's a 24in Bohica Arms bolt action 50BMG upper that mounts on any AR lower. It takes about 5min to swap the bolt catch to a modified bolt catch that I'll include and swap the hammer to one with a extra power spring that ill also include. Once swapped the parts will work with this upper and any 5.56 upper so no need to swap parts again. 

It's in pretty good shape but Bohica used cheap finish that does show a few signs of use. The prior owner advised that fired brass is hard to eject and I've read a few places that its a common problem with these. I haven't fired it to say how hard it is or if prior owner is just used to a traditional bolt action and its smooth cycling of the bolt. But from reading several places on line that its not a problem with the gun more of a design problem breaking the brass free when you turn the bolt up. 

Included is
50BMG upper
Bipod
18rds of 50BMG (American Eagle)
22 fired casings
Modified bolt catch 
Polished hammer with extra power spring

The glock has been shot 1 time. As in 1 round just to make sure it functioned well. It is gen 3. Glock stopped making OD green so they are almost impossible to find. It is standard right from the factory but you get an extra new mag depending on price/ trade. The sig was a police carry so it has slide wear but internally it is spotless and functions really well. Extremely tight gun. It's the German made not a copy. It's as accurate as you are. Please txt or call me that's the best way to get in touch. Everything in the pic could be traded or sold. Contact me asap if you are interisted cause i have another offer on the table. Name is Phillip. REDACTED
