Nothing wrong with it, it is just too high up for my liking on a bolt action. It will be perfect on an AR style rifle.

I accept cash/mo/paypal and will ship USPS priority for an additional $5 as well as provide a tracking number!

Please message me with any questions! Thanks for looking!"

How many shots will you get from your 500cc Dragon Claw? Our tech department filled their dual-tank air rifle to 3,000 psi, loaded it with 210-grain bullets and let loose! They shot the first 4 shots on high power. The first shot was 669 fps. Shot 4 was 681 fps.

The next 16 bullets were shot on low power. Shot 5 was 593 fps, and the final shot on low power was 456 fps. That brought the tank down to 800 psi for a total of 20 shots.

This shows you what one gun can do. Velocity and psi levels will vary gun to gun.

The Sam Yang Dragon Claw throws a .50-caliber projectile and gets 230 ft-lbs. of muzzle energy, giving you the power to compete with firearms when hunting. This rifle can humanely and quickly take out deer, feral hogs, javelinas, coyotes, foxes, nutria, possums, woodchucks, raccoons and similar-sized animals.

Because this gun has two large air reservoirs, you have the luxury of getting more shots from a fill and to do more hunting.

This rifle will come with a high pressure hand pump ($180) and a box of 200 grain hollow point pellets.

The flash hider has been replaced from the original dummy flash hider, to a new after market one. This rifle comes with 2-20 round mags and a official 3rd gen Springfield Armory Scope mount. A local contempt gun smith did a great trigger job, comparable to a national match one you would see On a high end m1a.

The upper is a

-Lantac USA DGN556 muzzle break pinned and welded
-Midwest Industries SS Gen 2 free float modular tube
-Bravo Company Gunfighter charging handle (Medium)
-Matech 200-600yd folding rear back up ironsight currently being used by US Army and Daniel Defense fixed front sight

I have only put around 150 rounds of ammo through the upper just to test function. It works flawlessly. I also have a GPI Custom Gunworks forged lower receiver I can include for the right trade as well as 7 3rd gen Magpul mags and ~350 rounds of ammo. The only thing to note about the GPI lower is that the tip of the buffer retainer pin has sheared off and will not hold the buffer in the carbine tube. I can be convinced to fix this if it's that much of a problem for you.
Sale price of the upper alone is $1000

What I'm looking for specifically is a Government model Colt 1911 in new - like new condition, or a Colt made in 1918 specifically for the Navy. I will consider other trades, and I may be able to include some cash on top as well if the trade is worth it.

I will meet you at the Blacksburg shooting range if you would like to test fire any of my listed firearms. May consider meetings at local ""gun friendly"" businesses, like a gun shop. I will not meet you at my home or yours, unfortunately there are some folks out there wanting to do harm and we do not have the time to ""get to know"" one another. Hate to do this but you will need to provide your own ammo for test fires. Seems that folks like to make me drag all my guns out, haul them to the range, shoot up my ammo and then not buy anything. Ammo and gas ain't cheap so do not waste my time.

Here is a 1943 Russian 91/30 Mosin Nagant rifle complete with sling, bayonet, oil can and ammo pouch. I also have FMJ surplus and soft point hunting ammo available. This rifle has all matching numbers with the exception of the bayonet. The markings on the receiver are faint but can be read with the naked eye. The only issue I have found is the cleaning rod does not like to stay put, the threads on the rod are good but it will not screw into the stock securely.

From the Cejay Engineering Website:

Phoenix Jr.™ Infrared Beacon IR-14 (NSN: 5855-01-438-4588) is an extremely rugged and low cost Infrared marker beacon. The Phoenix Jr. (Firefly) beacon was principally designed as an individual Combat Identification marker employed to minimize fratricide (the inadvertent destruction of battle field assets by friendly forces.) It has also been used as a vehicle ID marker, drop zone indicator and perimeter marker. Since its introduction in 1984, the Phoenix Jr. is the most widely used electronic Combat ID system in the world.

The Phoenix Jr. (Firefly) beacon has been utilized by American and coalition forces for combat identification in theatres of operation such as Kosovo, Bosnia, Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq. The beacon has many uses in combat and other operations for marking personnel, vehicles, pathways or locations. It incorporates a flash rate that was specified to prevent confusion with small arms fire. Use the Phoenix Jr. to identify friendly force positions, demarcation lines or perimeters.

Phoenix Jr. is the world standard for covert signaling and identification of military, law enforcement, SWAT and homeland security assets.

Leupold MSRP is 500, cabelas has the scope for 450. I ordered an ar 15 that came with this scope. I never fired the gun with the scope on it because I need a long range setup. It doesn’t have a scratch on it, and has all accesssories and manuals. Only difference is they didn’t ship me the box. I thought I might keep the scope before I ordered another long range one so I bough butler creek flip up caps that fit perfectly. You would be out the door at 480 with no scope caps from cabelas. The green firedot and bullet drop compensator specificallly for .223 is awesome. I’ll even throw in a mil-spec 30 round magazine. It’s got the best warranty out there LEUPOLD, no warranty card, etc. As good as vortex’s warranty. Call or text with any questions."

Warne RAMP Rapid Acquisition Multi-sight Platform Tactical Scope Mount Product Info
Warne R.A.M.P. (Rapid Acquisition Multi-Sight Platform) Tactical Scope Mount is a cantilever style scope mounting platform that allows proper scope installation on the popular AR-15 rifle. With Warne mounts, an operator can now position their head in the proper position whether upright or prone and not sacrifice their shooting position due to improper optic positioning. The Warne RAMP Tactical Mount also offers unique 45 degree mounting rails on one or both sides of the optic. The Warne RAMP Mount has up to 2 integrated mounting rails for optional sights or lights. This heavy duty Scope Rail from Warne keeps secure with two 1/2"" tactical nut attachments with up to 65 in/lbs or torque.
As you know, variable power optics are great for distance but not CQB scenarios. Additionally, CQB sights are great for close quarters and entry scenarios but not for distance shots or target ID. So which one do you choose? Why not have both? The Warne R.A.M.P Mount provides exactly that. The primary sight can be as small as a 1-4 or as large as an 8.5-25 or larger variable power optic. With a mini red dot on one or both sides of the ocular, a shooter can transition from scope to dot or dot to scope in less than a second by rotating the weapon 45 degrees left or right. While the technique is not new, the position of the red dot is. By placing the sight under the ocular of the scope, Warne has provided a wider field of view thru the mini red dot and make acquiring the dot in the sight faster than you can imagine. And once again, you won't have to sacrifice your shooting position when transitioning from sight to sight.
By design, the AR platform was intended for fixed iron sights and did not offer an acceptable mounting surface for optics. As the weapon system evolved from the military designate M16A1 to the M16A3 and M4, Picatinny mounting systems became standard equipment, however, the rail system found on the A3 and M4 weapon systems still did not allow a variable power optic to be mounted far enough forward with conventional scope mounts. The Warne RAMP Modular Mounting System positions the front ring forward of the upper receiver by 1 3/4"" allowing the optics to be mounted farther forward allowing the shooter to position their head in the proper position whether upright or prone and not sacrifice their shooting position due to improper optic positioning. Finally, a scope mounting platform designed for the serious shooting enthusiast and professionals world wide!"

I do not have re-manufactured and new in each of the calibers, but I have something.  Personally, I shoot the reloads, see no difference and save some money.  Ammo is sold by the box - generally 50 rounds but sometimes 100 rounds.  Prices are competitive.  Stock varies in this crazy market.

Please email for a quote.  Ammo has literally become a commodity and in these times of shortages, quotes are only good for 3 days.  My apologies.  Cash is best but of coarse a money order is fine.  Credit cards are accepted but I have to add $3.5% to pay the credit card company as pricing for ammo has a very small margin.  Again, I apologize.

I am located in Broomfield near 120th and Sheridan.  I was in a car accident and limited in my driving.  I am willing to meet somewhere, but I can only drive about 20 minutes in any direction.  For some gas money for the truck, I might meet you Downtown!  lol

This is one of the most underrated pistols on the market in my opinion.  I use it as my conceal and carry.  I'm not sure I can recall having a misfeed or jam, that's why i trust it on my side.  It is a double/single action and the trigger is very crisp and smooth compared to other pistols and is accurate as all get out with its blowback design. It is a double stack and holds 13 rounds but is still a small gun.  The pistol is in great condition as you can see in the pictures and has very little use.  Comes with 1 mag. 

If you want more mags you can buy beretta cheetah mags for $20 to fit this gun, you just have to make a knotch just above the original knotch on the cheetah mag to make it fit. Super easy, i've done it for my other astra i have.  Just google how to do it.

I'm only asking $315 for it buyer pays shipping. Why buy a $600 XDS when you can get this guy for half the price.

I also have a lot of FMJ 380 acp ammo if you want to pay extra cash for some.

Hands down, the most commonly used phrase we hear from tactical end users is, “smaller, lighter, faster” when describing the perfect optic.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color.

If you just want the shotgun it'll be $350.
The pistol is the generation 1 babe eagle by magnum research inc.the gun is hard to find.I was looking for this one for about a year. I went to 10 gun shows with weekend pass and found this one at the last min. It comes with a drop leg holster, a tactical hip holster, two ten round mags, original case, and manual. I had this pistol appraised at $750. If you want to buy just the pistol $750 is what it'll be. If you take both it'll be $1000. 
I'm just needing the cash pretty bad but there is some pay in price within reason. But not a lot. With the pistol I will not absolutely not take less than $650 . So do not email me if ur offering less than that. Like I said I'm in need of the cash bad. It's not a want to get rid of its a have to get rid of. Also I've had bout 4 guys tell me that the pistol is, which I know, that its a Jericho. So since I wanted to list as a baby eagle I did cuz most people know it as a baby eagle."

It is number 73 of 250 and comes in the original custom Browning case. The keys are with the case, but no other paperwork is present. The shotgun is in 12ga, 28"" vent rib chrome lined barrels, *- over **- fixed chokes... This Gun was presented as an award to my late Dad in the eighties and was never shot by him, There was a 14kyg personalized cap on the bottom of the pistol grip that has been removed and the gold nails have been replaced in the mounting holes, Overall this shotgun is in exceptional condition with only a minor ding here and there. The fore arm is dinged on the sharp edge of the mounting hardware, only noticeable on direct view due to the 100% engraving on all the silver metal parts"

Mostly target loads, but there were a few boxes of defensive rounds. They even have bulk boxes(100+) of .45 auto and .223. Good luck and happy shooting!"
