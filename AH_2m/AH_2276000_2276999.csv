The Voli is ultimate optic ready tactical carbine, with everything you need to add the tactical red dot sight or optic of your choice to have a complete rifle system. This rifle was built and configured with the patrol officer, tactical enthusiast, or self-defense user in mind. The Magpul MOE furniture provides comfortable, durable, and ergonomic benefits and the ease of adding accessories such as slings, lights, and storage for batteries and parts. The Magpul MOE line of products has numerous accessories making configuring your rifle for your needs simple. This rifle also features an ambidextrous safety selector lever from Battle Arms Development. 

The mid-length direct impingement gas system is an improvement of then tried and trued operating system that has been in use by our armed forces for decades. The mid-length gas system provides a longer hand guard, providing more real estate for mounting accessories, allows for an extended more comfortable grip, and an increased length in sight radius. The mid-legth gas system also reduces the pressure to the gas operating system reducing stress on parts and components and providing a smoother and reduced recoil impulse. The gas tube has been Melonite treated for extra corrosion resistance and reliability. 

The bolt carrier group is an M16 weight carrier made from 8620 steel and is finished inside and out with a new, cutting edge proprietary coating process by Adams Arms. This revolutionary new coating process offers multiple advantages over and above traditional current coating processes on the market today. These advantages include a harder surface level then hard chrome, superior lubricity properties, and excellent corrosion resistance, all superior to traditional Mil-Spec Parkerizing. The gas key is heat treated and finished with the same new coating process as the carrier, attached to the carrier with Grade 8 fasteners manufactured in the United States, and properly staked. The bolt is manufactured from proper Mil-Spec Carpenter No. 158 ® Steel, magnetic particle inspected (MPI), and has a carbine extractor spring, insert, and Crane O-ring. 

The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical dimensions held within +-.001” and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil spec receiver extension/buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control. The front sight base is an F Marked base, the height of the base will match perfectly with rear sights mounted on the upper receiver, allowing you to sight in with out the addition of an extended length front sight post. The front sight base is also pinned for durability; the barrel is also finished under the front sight base."

During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-Frame line of .357 Magnums: the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681 and Model 686.The Models 581 and 681 have fixed sights, whereas the 586 and 686 use adjustable sights.
Offered here is a Smith & Wesson Model 686 manufactured in 1985 (per date on grips and confirmed from Smith & Wesson customer service). This revolver is Product Code 104215 and Special Order 6052. It has a 6” barrel, adjustable rear sights and adjustable front sight. This is a fairly rare variant of one of the finest combat/target revolvers out there. As it was an early model, it had the hammer’s firing pin and the frame’s firing pin bushing replaced – “M” is stamped on frame by the model number. The truly amazing thing about this classic revolver is the condition – it appears as new and unfired. No trace of powder, scoring or flashing inside the frame or cylinder. Barely able to be seen turn line on cylinder. Comes with the original box with label, all paperwork, sealed cleaning rod and screwdriver and unopened hex wrench for setting the front sight. Grips are the older style Goncalo Alves wood, target style and absolutely gorgeous. This will make a great pistol for the advanced collector, investor or shooter who appreciate the pre-lock target style Smith & Wesson revolvers."

I have up for sale a used taurus pt-22 22 lr pistol. It is a great little pistol and shoots good. Only thing is it doesnt like the cheap bulk ammo I had. So occasionally liked to not feed the second round after the one put straight into the barrel. Was pretty obvious it was the kind of ammo because when I ran 25 rounds of good stuff through it, it had zero issues. Either way, it is a fantastic little gun and shoots great. Would be great for conceal or a backup. This is the black, gold, and rosewood model. This will come with one magazine, the gun, and possible ammunition for the right offer. This will be as is, so please message me with any questions you may have.

This 16"" AR-15 barrel is constructed from Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel, and has been finished inside and out with Voodoo Barrels' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel.

The Beretta Px4 Storm Sub-Compact pistol is the most advanced sub-compact sidearm of its kind. Built around Beretta’s latest Px4 modular technology, the Px4 Storm Sub-Compact delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower.

A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies. The pistol adapts to different hand sizes easily with interchangeable backstraps (included). An ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters.

A reversible magazine release button can be mounted on either side and can quickly be replaced by a smaller and larger size button (optional).
An interchangeable slide catch can also be replaced with an optional low-profile configuration.

Only 10,000 of each kind 20,000 total made in the cold war by Norinco in China for Russia during the cold war. My guess is for if we went to war they could use the ammo out of our m-16s in their AKs. Who knows how many made it to the states. I have a lot more pics than i can post on here so email me for more.

I have done a lot of modifications to make the gun tactical, but have changed nothing permanently on the rifle. All the original parts are with it and all the serials match, its not a mutt gun slapped together and imported. I only see one of these like every other gun show with one or two clips and just all wood priced around $1200. 

OK i am going to list everything with it and what i paid starting with whats on the gun-
-Black Tapco folding stock $59.99
-Saw pistol grip with storage inside $29.99
-Sling attachment with quick detach $9.99
-Blackhawk single point sling with quick shoulder detach, I cant remember $29.99 to $49.99
-Top mount, not the crappy cover mount that kept falling off this one attaches where the iron sights go and screws in the stock $89.99
-BSA red dot scope with laser,Has rubber over the end so during recoil it doesn't hit you in the face. Bought at academy for $129.99 i think. 
-Quad rail made of aircraft aluminum very sturdy and light replaced wooden hand grips paid $89.99
-Second pistol grip on quad rail. Moves 180 degrees and locks in place. With the stock folded i used the double pistol grips with the laser to shoot from the hip accurately. $19.99. 

Thats what is all on the gun. Fully tactical. Cost me around $475 for the parts plus the time putting it all together.  

Clips I have 9 30rd and 1 10rd all for .556 .223. Reg ak mags wont work, dont even fit in the gun and these are hard to find trust me two years to get all these.

4 wooden Strum made in Germany mags Very unique i think made of bamboo not plastic
3 Black metal Unmarked 30 rd mags
2 Plastic promags one in the box both never used
1 Black metal 10 rd mag perfect for hunting

I have two of the wooden and two of the black metal mags in mag couplers. I also have 2 pairs of promag mag couplers still in the box.

I have the original wooden thumb hole stock and hand guards.I have the original sights and every screw and piece i took off to modify saved.

Extra parts I have are-
-the pistol grip that came with the tapco folding stock
-a extra hammer really hard to find got a extra one just in case cost me $99
- and 5 battery's for the scope and laser stored in a plastic bag in the pistol grip
-I have 300 rounds of self defense ammo that i kept in the clips 200 ballistic tip and 100 
green tip armor piercing
-Tactical bag that has two pockets and 4 mag pouches that mags can be doubled up in, also has a padded sling. Brand is field line tactical bought at academy $69.99 

Everything here comes as a package deal, except the ammo, and case, doesn't have to be bought. This is a perfect end of the world, zombie apocalypse, or whatever you think is going to happen gun. .556 and .223 will be the most common in the end. Also if it never happens its still a cold war collector item.

I like this gun don't really want to sell it, but thinking of starting a new project.
Asking $2400 for the entire package.
Only interested in a nice quality AR-15 or M-16, or 44 Mag for trades

Spanish Airforce Mauser All original and all matching numbers.Chambered in 8mm Mauser caliber marked ""Cal 7.92 [P] [R]"" on left side of receiver. 23 1/8"" barrel.There are no import marks defacing this rifle. This is NOT one of the more common Spanish made La Coruna M43 rifles.""S/42G"" marked rear sight, ""lxr"" marked magazine follower. Bolt, trigger-guard, floor-plate and receiver are all matching, other parts are un-numbered, as is correct for these rifles. Shiny and prominent Spanish Airforce eagle crest stamped center of receiver. Maintains 95% original bluing, walnut stock is in good condition except for small crack above rear stock plate. Nice prominent rifling, with some pitting which is typical for these rifles. Battled Communists in the streets of Germany during the Weimar Republic era, served in the early Nazi era German Army, and then went on to kill working class anarchists in the Spanish Civil War before being rebuilt for the Spanish Airforce in the late WW2 era. It has it's original correct cleaning rod, Spanish black leather sling with the distinctive Spanish curved brass buckle, correct Spanish bayonet along with bayonet scabbard and bayonet frog, that is a slightly lighter and thinner version of the German Mauser 98k bayonet, correct original muzzle cap cover made specifically for the Kar 98a front sight, and two black leather Spanish ammo pouches one marked ""EPI"". These are all scarce and desirable items that are worth it by themselves. This rifle is very difficult to find with all its' original accessories along with being in the condition that it is. This rifle is meant for collector's specifically Mauser enthusiasts, it has a lot of history behind it especially if you have read ""Homage to Catalonia"" by George Orwell. Made for Spanish military, high quality military craftsmanship unlike the common M43 Spanish Mausers which had heat treatment issues. $1500


Peruvian Model 1909 that was manufactured prior to WWI by Mauser in Oberndorf Germany.The first and original Mauser factory. Has ""Waffenfabrik Mauser-Oberndorf A/N"" left side receiver. Has the Lange Visier (""Roller Coaster"") long-range rear sight. It has a 29.13"" barrel with German ""H"" style bayonet lug. This rifle is beautifully made (pre-WWI build quality and attention to detail was absolutely superb) and is nicely marked with the Peruvian crest on the receiver partially removed, under which is marked ""MAUSER ORIGINAL"". This rifle is completely original.It is NOT import marked. The original blue finish rates about 80%. The stock is in very good shape with handling wear no cracks or chips...and never sanded or refinished. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is sharp and bright. A nice example of a very hard to find South American contract Mauser rifle.Safety is marked ""56"", bolt shroud ""56"", bolt ""3359"" and receiver ""30988"". If you need more pictures of how the rifle looks just ask. $550.

For sale is a NEW Ed Brown Special Forces 1911, recently finished in Ed's custom shop. 

This gun is blued, with Tritium night sights, government 5"" barrel, Cocobolo checkered grips, a stainless match grade barrel, and a naked slide (slide has no 'Ed Brown' or 'Special Forces' engraved on it. See pics). Again, this gun has Ed's blued finish on carbon steel for the frame and slide, and is not finished in their specialized Gen III coating. 

This gun has never been loaded or fired. Comes New In Box with all of the standard accessories, including the trigger key, gun oil, Ed Brown tags, manual, and zippered soft case. The gun comes with one Ed Brown magazine (this is standard for ordering from Ed Brown, the one mag).

The Brown family runs one of the most lauded custom 1911 shops out there, and his models are compared against other top shelf guns made by Wilson Combat and Les Baer. Really beautiful gun, and I think this model is improved by the naked slide. The Special Forces is one of his popular current lines of production, and is intended as kind of a workhorse 1911. 

This is a great gun with lots of features that make the 1911 even more usable than its military specification cousins. This is also a relatively simple custom gun, with a really attractive finish. A great balance between function and design. Priced to sell. If you're in the market for a good deal on a custom 1911, consider this deal, and feel free to ask for more information.  

Sales in WI only please. Get in touch if you need more pictures or any more info. A signed copy of the bill of sale will go to both parties. Thank you!"
