2,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2224002,For Sale:  	Kershaw Outcast Large Camp Knife w/Kydex Sheath (Discontinued & Hard To Find),"Huntsville/Madison, Alabama, United States",$ 100,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 15, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a very lightly used Kershaw Outcast for sale.

The highlights are D2 steel, 10"" blade, 6"" Santoprene handle, in this case wrapped in paracord with lanyard as part of the wrapping, and 22 oz. total weight (plus an oz. or two for the paracord). The handle was a bit too thin for my ham-fists, and the wrapping did the trick in the girth department. However, it did defeat the cushioning that the ribbed Neoprene provided, so the buyer may or may not want to keep it on there. You get several feet of paracord either way though, so there ya go.

The outcast comes with one of the better factory sheaths in the business. The mount is similar to a MOLLE-LOK, and works with no modification on your belt, or on your MOLLE vest or pack.

The Outcast is a chopping BEAST!

Price is $90.00 if purchased locally, or $100 if shipped. Shipping will be via FedEx 2-Day Delivery. You can pay via PayPal or you can mail me a Money Order.

$2000 Firm need to sell. At this price you will get your money back if you ever decide to sell it.

I had one in high school and searched for years for a nice one. I drove to St. Louis to get this beauty, however I hurt my leg and can no longer start it easily.

I bought it with 1900 miles on it, and rode it to 3900 miles. The fluids were changed every 1k miles with K&N Filter and BelRay oils

It is all original. It is in excellent condition and very nice. I'm moving and must sell it.
If your looking at this ad, you probably already know what your looking at as these were the original thumpers.

Here is what it needs and why it's priced so cheap.

Needs new tires
Needs a Battery
Needs the pilot jet cleaned in the carburetor (slightly plugged and makes it backfire)


Other than that it is a head turner and runs great.

It comes with a new air Filter, 2 Rear Sprockets (one smaller and one bigger than stock to gear it the way you want), and it also comes with a Factory Yamaha Service manual that tells you how to rebuild the motor, to changing a spark plug. It's a factory manual the mechanics use. Has torque values down to the spoke nipples.

It has a CLEAR Oklahoma title signed and notarized ready to go!

At $2k it won't last the weekend."

One of the best kept secrets in the firearm industry has to be Bersa Firearms. Bersa Firearms are very well known with concealed carry aficionados and for good reason. Bersa Firearms are very well built, available in defensive calibers, and an incredible value at any price point. The Bersa Thunder, Thunder Combat, Thunder Concealed Carry, Thunder Pro, and BP Concealed Carry are among the most popular concealed carry firearms available and are feature rich with what shooters want and demand. Spend anytime with a Bersa Firearm and you will become a fan instantly. After all it is about performance not price tag.

The Thunder Pro UC is a smaller version of the proven Thunder Pro. Compact and powerful, the Thunder Pro UC is an excellent choice for those who need stopping power without bulk. Preserving the best features of the standard Thunder Pro, the Thunder Pro Ultra Compact is a superior value in a compact, service grade handgun.

Like the standard Pro, the Thunder Pro UC features an improved Browning Petter barrel locking system which provides reliable feeding and ejection. The safety, cocking lever, slide stop levers and magazine catch are completely ambidextrous making this a perfect fit for right or left handers. The Thunder Pro UC maintains the Bersa tradition of accuracy, reliability and durability and is an excellent choice for anyone needing a tough, reliable, compact sidearm.

Youâre government may quit on you but your upper never will!

The ""GSD"" Edition features a 16 inch HBAR (or heavy barrel) in black that is chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 1/9 twist rate and M4 feed ramps. Our carbine length HBAR is made out of the highest quality, 416 stainless and percision rifling Tactical ARs is known for giving it Sub MOA accuracy right out of the box.

We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset. We've found that when building for a specific person, it increases the attention to detail significantly and therefore, the finished product is second to no one and far superior than that of any mas-produced or storebought brand out there. The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within a week and typically ship within 24 hours of purchase.

Our MIL-A-8625F type 3 class 2 upper receiver is the perfect fit for a barrel of this quality. It is precision machined to Mil Spec from 7075 aluminum that has been T6 heat treated and hard coat anodized. It features M4 feedramps, flattop design with an integral Picatinny-style rail, .250"" takedown pin bores, forward assist and our signature ejection port door.

The Complete TacticalARs.com ""GSD"" upper has a 10"" Carbine Free Float Rail System with precise fit to our Mil Spec upper receiver. Our proprietary rail system has been crafted out of 6061 T6 aircraft aluminum with a level III hard anodized finish and is mounted over our properly fitted micro gas block. All that you have left to do is Pin It and Win It!

***** Please note that prices are significantly reduced for a limited time only in an effort to launch our brand on a national level instead of our current local presence. That being the case, this listing is for a Complete Upper Receiver and actually DOES include our M16 Bolt Carrier Group and Charging Handle but only for a limited time. We also carry just about any aftermarket part available so if you need anything, let us know and we will give you our employee discount and free shipping with this order. We have everything from PMAGS to Carry Handles, Sights, Forward Grips, Lower Receiver parts and any other hard to find items in stock so make sure to ask.*****"

Our Brand New, High End AR-10 Upper features the incredibly hard to come by, 16 inch 7.62x51 Nitride heavy barrel, (HBAR) making it much stronger and far more accurate than any other chrome lined barrel on the market today. It's chambered in .308 Winchester with a 1/10 twist rate. No detail is overlooked and each barrel is HPT and MPI inspected. They are made from 416 stainless, have M4 feed ramps, 5/8 muzzle break thread and finished in black with a carbine gas system.

We hand build each one to order and attach your name to it from the onset. We've found that when building for a specific person, it increases the attention to detail significantly and therefore, the finished product is second to no one and far superior than that of any mas-produced or store-bought brand out there. The best part, we will have it on your doorstep within 2 weeks of purchase.

Our High-Quality, DPMS Style upper receiver comes in an A3 flattop configuration that offers plenty of flexibility in both open and optical sighting options. MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail has 17 cross-slots that accept popular AR-15/M16 accessories and scope mounts. Shell deflector and forward assist are machined as a single unit. Our standard receiver features a Bravo Company Mod 3 charging handle, custom port cover, and forward assist. Also standard is CMMG's .308 bolt carrier group making this a fully complete upper receiver that is ready to roll.

The Complete TacticalARs.com ""Magnus"" High End Upper has a 12"" Carbine Free Float Rail System with precise fit to our upper receiver. Our proprietary rail system has been crafted out of 6061 T6 aircraft aluminum with a level III hard anodized finish and is mounted over our properly fitted micro gas block. All that you have left to do is Pin It and Win It!

***** Please note that prices are SIGNIFICANTLY reduced for a limited time only in an effort to launch our brand on a national level instead of our current local presence. That being the case, this listing is for a Complete Upper Receiver and actually DOES include a CMMG 308 Bolt Carrier Group and BCM Mod 3 Charging Handle but only for a limited time. We also carry just about any aftermarket part available so if you need anything, let us know and we will give you our employee discount and free shipping with this order.*****"

Just for the Glock 22 a**h*** saying this offer is worth $300. I recently sent this in to Ruger for evaluation and condition is 9/10 and pretty much new with all the parts replaced with the gunsmith quoting ""I would'nt sell this for less than $500"" this gun still goes for $524 new at impactguns, 184 rounds LEFT of 45acp was pretty much $100 seeing that I bought a new box of winchester 100 rounds for $53.64 and magtech for 50 goes for $28.64 each and I have 1 1/2 boxes of that. holster I got for free from a friend which I'm sure is $10-$40. Hogue grip I got for $12, and pretty much another $100 for the misc ammo.
Your glock is like a honda civic, common, parts easy to find and yes reliable. But for a gun to sell for 558.99 new with everything the factory sends AND YOUR offer only has the gun,1 mag and a 6/10 condition to come along saying your offer is worth $700 with no ammo?!?!?! you dont even have the box for F*** sake! go rip somebody else off. 


If you guys want to be technical my offer total is worth around $700 total. so don't try to rip me off or say I'm ripping you off. I'm here to find something more manageable to defend me and mines, not to rip people off for fun. I'm not the govt haha"

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Elite 16â³ Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12â³ rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be.

A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 US uses the trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) model. 
This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The P2000 trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3-8.5 pounds of pressure, compared to 12-15 pounds found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment (by HK armorers) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound range.

Features:
â¢	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
â¢	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
â¢	Modular grip with exchangeable back straps to easily adjust the grip size to the shooterÂ´s hand
â¢	Ideal size and weight to comply with the requirements of the full range of police missions, including concealed carry
â¢	Low profile slide and slimline, compact dimensions
â¢	Ambidextrous slide release (located on both sides of the frame)
â¢	Very short trigger reset distance to enhance the speed of multiple or follow-up shots
â¢	Polymer recoil absorber bushing (similar to the HK USP COMPACT) aids in recoil reduction
â¢	Corrosion resistant Hostile Environment blued finish
â¢	Oversized recurved trigger guard for use with gloves
â¢	One piece machined steel slide
â¢	Industry standard mounting grooves for installing accessories
â¢	Ambidextrous magazine release lever
â¢	Optional magazine disconnect
â¢	Patented Lock-Out Safety device

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

The gun is about a year old and I'm selling it as I recently bought a different shotgun.  It has minor wear and tear and has been shot 6 times.  Killed 3 birds last year, none in 2012 and also from sighting in the gun.  I have a Browning soft case included with the gun since I have a scope on my new gun and the case won't fit it.  It also has the factory fitted Hi-Viz sights with additional lumens to change to what ever color you'd like, and also comes with an invector plus xtra-full choke.  I also have a scope mount installed on the gun, which is camo'd also in MOBUI to match the gun. New this gun retails for just under $1000, minus tax and/or shipping costs. So I don't think $650 is too much to ask for a gun thats been shot 6 times and is around a year old.  Still the same gun that can be bought now with some extra savings and a soft case included, which retails for around $40 also.

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12â in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

   Your most basic, unmolested AR 15 in its factory configuration.
This is the older, original M&P 15 Sport model that comes with a fixed rear sight and 5r 1:8 twist in comparison to the new models with a flip up sight and a 1:9 twist.
Rifle has been kept in safe since bought (2011) and is stock, no new additions.
Has had 60 rounds through the rifle and is in great condition - only a minor scuff on the underside of the barrel where the rifle laid against a gun rack for over 2 years .

I really like this gun but it needs to belong to a collector who will appreciate more than I. It shoots great and is very accurate. Really fun to shoot.  There are a few minor dings in the stock, as expected with the rifles age, and a small area of the bluing is scratched near the tip of the barrel where it looks like someone used too coarse steel wool to try to clean it. This will not show up in the photos and is nearly unnoticeable. Really nice grain pattern is present in the stock.

It's a very small pocket gun with a unique tip-up barrel that's great for deep concealment carry, a backup gun, or just plinking.  Comes with two magazines holding seven rounds each and a pocket holster.  The tip up barrel means that you don't have to rack the slide to chamber and unchamber a round and the .22lr shoots soft enough that even a recoil averse shooter can put rounds on target easily and consistently.  Features a single-action/double-action trigger and a manual safety so it can be carried in DA with the safety off or on or SA with the safety on, however is preferred.  Great backup gun or a carry gun for new shooters or those who don't have the hand strength to easily rack the slide on a small semi-auto.  Absolutely disappears in your pocket.  Works best with hot ammo, I've had excellent reliability with CCI stingers and Mini-mags.  Extremely little wear on the gun, finish is 98% and there are some minor scratches on the grips.
