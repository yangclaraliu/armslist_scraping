Preferably a super v.  I am looking to purchase the first part of next week.  I am buying from a dealer before next weekend if I cant find one on here.  Dont bother trying to scam me.  If you are out of state and want to ship it, that's fine.  BUT I WILL ABSOLUTELY NOT PAY UNTIL I SEE THE GUN AT MY FFL!!!  If you aren't ok with that, dont bother emailing me.  I prefer face to face anyway.  I am not interested in any other guns.  I am only looking for a vector.  I have cash, or some trade items if you are looking for a partial trade.  


I have had a few questions about what I have to trade, so here goes.  I have a spikes tactical punisher AR15.  I have had it posted here on armslist for a while, offering to trade toward a vector.  I would give the spikes (which I have nearly $1500 in) PLUS $500 for a base model vector.  I would give it and $1100 for a super v with the tac pac (eotech, surefire light, etc).  I also have a 2011 Elite pure competition bow.  The bow itself was about $900, plus there is around $600 in upgrades, extras, arrows and a case.  I would do the same deal.  The bow and $500 for a base model vector, or the bow and $1100 for the super v with tac pac.  Or I would give both for the super v with a tac pac.  Again, I will not ship any of my items until I see the vector at my ffl."

==========================================
The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

The Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

3. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

4. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

5. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

6. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).

7. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

8. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.

11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

Colt Government model series 70 MKIV manufactured in 1977 with Pachmayr Signature grips. Bought when new, this pistol has had less than 50 rounds run through it. The gun has been professionally ""throated"" so that the empty ejected cases will not be dented and can be reloaded. It also has had its feeding ramp polished to reliably feed all types of .45 acp ammo. Comes with three 7 round magazines/carrier and shoulder holster.
The Shotgun shell pistol was made by F.I.E also in the 70's. It is a single (12 in.) barrel, single shot pistol in 20 gauge. This gun is in three pieces, is compact to move and can be assembled in appx 5 seconds, but assembly may be in violation of laws/regulations and is solely at the owners discretion. This arm can be made into a legal hunting shotgun for $132.30 (stock and barrel) from Numrich Gun Parts and one could have the versatility of hunting or home defense without over penetration."

If you're reading this it is.

Up for sale is a used but not abused 16"" AR-15.  Included is everything you see in the picture:  The rifle, a brand new chrome bolt carrier group, red dot sight with cantilever mount, BUIS, 300 rds 55gr Hornady SP ammo, 300 FMJ bullets, 300 primers, 1lb powder, and 5 USGI 30-rd magazines.

Specific details:

Rifle - 5.56mm chamber, 1:9 twist, A4 configuration, M4 profile barrel, T-marked upper, M4 feed ramps.  This rifle runs flawlessly on any ammo including steel cased and is very accurate.  It's easily capable of 1"" groups at 100 yds if you and your ammo are.  I built this rifle about 7 years ago and have used it frequently.  It has about 3500 rds on it.  I'd trust it to deal with a zombie horde or alien invasion.  Rifle is built on a Century Arms stripped forged lower, RRA lower parts kit, & a Mod1 Upper.  Has a nice trigger with Wolff reduced power springs.  No issue igniting hard military primers/light strikes with them.

RRA chrome BCG is brand new.  The whole assembly is hard chromed except the firing pin & retaining pin.  Bolt, carrier, extractor, cam pin are all chrome.  Key is very nicely staked.  The chrome BCG improves reliability as it can operate in a dirtier environment with less lubrication.  But where it really shines is in ease of cleaning - pretty much just wipe it off.

The red dot sight is an Aimpoint Comp M2 knockoff.  It has a very nice, solid cantilever mount.  The optic itself is average & what you'd expect for a $100 red dot.  Includes flip up covers & fresh battery.  Has a 4 MOA dot, 5 brightness settings, red or green dot.

BUIS is a new Midwest Industries rear flip sight.  Optional FREE upgrade new Matech rear sight - same as the Army issue one  http://www.impactguns.com/matech-mil-spec-buis-wranging-fits-rail-systems-buis.aspx

Ammo & reloading components.  300 rds loaded ammo with Hornady 55gr soft point bullets.  Very accurate closed-base bullets good for both target shooting or varmints.  1 pound sealed can of Hodgdon H335 powder, 300 CCI #41 primers, and 300 55 gr FMJ bullets (more than that pictured but only 300 included).  Enough components to reload the 300 rds of loaded ammo 1 time.

5 USGI magazines.  All used, but functional.  Mix of contract manufacturers - Adventure Line, Parsons, Okay, etc. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need more detailed pictures.  Understand this rifle is used - it's a shooter & not a safe queen.  While by no means a beater it does have some minor scratches & cosmetic dings.  What you'd expect for a used rifle with 3500 rds that has been well taken care of.

Price is firm, will not ship, will not split package up, not interested in trades.  I have 8 ARs so thinning the herd a little to fund another purchase."

Due to a few really annoying offers: people a brand new 870 WINGMASTER 20ga is selling for $750 at the fin and they do not have any etching engraving Murels etc so in 20 years it will not really be worth Much at all! Remington did not do many of these ESPECIALLY in 20ga the 20ga like this is less than 200 made making it very collectible especially in a few more years. They only offered this 20ga 870 WINGMASTER with the enhanced receiver engraving for 1 year which was 1999 they offered it from 99-04 on 12ga models and they had gold triggers which mine does not since it's the 99 only 20ga."

This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired.  Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low serial number (008775) and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters.  Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum. 

Condition is new old stock! It comes with an inspection receipt, original box and copy of ART MPC manual  VAL AT $1,200.00"

This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired.  Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low (001455) serial number and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters.  Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum.

I'm asking $400 or best offer.  Open to trades listed below.  It's in great shape and you are welcome to come look at it.  I'm only getting rid of it because I got a gun safe.  I can deliver it for you if it's not too far and the deal is right, but only if you're sure you want it.  And yes, if you are reading this, it's still available.  Let me know if you have any questions."
