The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

Slide-to-frame fit is excellent. 

It shoots sub-1"" groups at 25 yards from a bench rest.

Great condition with some areas of slight wear--i'd planned on getting it cerracoated, but I just don't end up shooting it often. This would cost you much more to build it than it will to buy it.

What I could figure out about this gun is that they were produced from around mid 1940's up until the 80's. This one seems to be one of the earlier production, estimating in the 50's or so, but not sure.
Good working condition, inexpensive little shooter or collector item. Comes with one 8rd (I think) magazine but additional mags are not too hard to find. Will entertain reasonable offers, but not really looking to trade."

A lot of this ammo I am losing money on but I am not going to have a gun to shoot it so why not. I will negotiate on price and accessories but please no ridiculously low-balled offers. Forgot to include that the Speer Gold Dot ammo comes free of charge as well, 43 rounds of it. Had to test a few for the few times I carried the gun.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truly unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

This was always my backup gun for my girlfriend if I was ever out of the house and anything happened. About 150 RDS through it. Great looking wood grain grips, blued finish and lots of accessories.

Fires excellent (trust it with my girlfriend standing behind it) and it's been sighted. Never got around to night sights. Wish I had.

Like I said I have upped my armory and it's time to purge. Not looking to make money on this gun I just want it gone to make room. 

I'm gonna list it for $500 OBO. I see a lot of .45s up here for $550+ for just the gun and maybe 2 clips and i think that's ridiculous. so. To whoever the lucky person is that comes across this first... send your offer and who knows it may be your lucky day. 

So anyway here's the extra goods. I've got the gun, 2 8 round magazines. 25 230gr Remington Golden saber Brass jacketed hollow points and 11 unknown FMJ (my friend gave me after a day at the range.

The principal designer was George Kelgren, formerly of the the Intratec and Grendel firearms companies. The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR fires 55 grain ball ammunition 600fps slower than a 20″ barreled AR-15 rifle, and 300fps slower than a 14.5″ barreled M4 carbine. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all!"

The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all! >>>  INCLUDES - LARGE RED DOT (8 SETTINGS) SIGHT FOR QUICK ACQUISITION - 150 LUMEN PUSH BUTTON TACH LIGHT - GREEN PUSH BUTTON LASER (5mW) - SQUID FOREARM WITH RAIL - SLANT FOREGRIP (VERTICLE NOT LEGAL ON A PISTOL) - (1) 30 ROUND METAL MAG - (1) SUREFIRE 60 ROUND DOUBLE STACK METAL MAGAZINE - SOFT CASE W/ 4 MAG POUCHES - CENTER CARRY SLING - DOOR KNOCKER FLASH HIDER - 100 ROUNDS OF 5.56 X 45 AMMO.

Original owner, only fired twice, carried a few times. Excelent condition. Longslide RIA 1911 chambered in either .22TCM or 9mm. Comes with both barrels, extractors, and springs. Just swap the parts and go from 9mmx19 to the new and exciting .22TCM. This new round was designed to compete with Fabriqe National's 5.7x28mm pistol round. The .22 TCM is essentially a necked down 5.56 and offers armor piercing muzzle velocity for half the price of a 5.7 Go online and do some research if you doubt me. Ive taken this to the range and put clean holes through 3/16"" steel and cinder blocks. SERIOUSLY. The best characteristic of the round in my opinion is its incredibly flat trajectory. I fire roughly the same group at 20ft or 20yds. Again, read the reviews if you doubt me. Low low low recoil, big ball of flames, just a real sweet round. If you wanna just go blow through some 9mm it works great for that too! haha. With either round chambered, its super accurate and has never malfunctioned on me. Pistol comes with; 9mm barrel, 9mm springs, .22TCM barrel, .22TCM springs, Hi-Viz fully adjustable sights, polished trigger, after market grip screws, Wilson Combat mag release, mags, hard case, all paperwork, one box of each ammunition, breach plug and lock, tool kit, range box and more. Im over $800 into this pistol with all that's included and Im not looking to get screwed. This isn't your regular POS Rock Island Armory, so please don't mistake it for one."

Bike looks and runs great. It is grey and blue (hard to find), has no cosmetic problems at all. Runs great, transmission is smooth. When I bought it, there was a small antifreeze leak, but I put some BarS stop leak in it, and the problem has not continued and the antifreeze level has stayed full all summer. The reason I am selling is two-fold. I know nothing about mechanics, so I will be as honest as I can and tell you everything I know. The bike runs great (I rode it today), but there is a noise coming out of the front of it. It sounds like a rattle or clanging. Can only really be heard when holding steady at around 2400RPM. Don't hear it going higher speeds, don't hear it when accelerating. This could be a major issue, or nothing at all. I don't know, what I do know is my second reason for selling is I need money for bills, and don't have money to put into bike. This is a great bike, especially for the price. It has 24K miles. It is powerful for a 750, starts everytime, and looks great. For all I know the sound I am hearing is a real cheap fix - yours to decide. Come give it a look.

I have all receipts, manuals, pelican case and even the original warranty card. Paid almost 1200, and that's with a military discount (have the receipt to prove it) I am very firm on the price as this is essentially a brand new scope. These are great scopes for an ""apocalypse"" rifle because they are indestructible and require very little training to be proficient. Don't take my word for it, the US military loves these things. I am current Special Ops, and I can tell you that this would be a great scope for any AR-10 type setup, or any bolt gun chambered in .308 or 7.62X51. Just check out Amazon and you won't find a better deal. I bought this thing straight from trijicon, and it was manufactured in 2011."

Well....not necesarily.  The .40 OD framed G23, Gen 3, in the photos has been modified for carry, on duty or off.  Practical changes meant to facilitate deployment in a bad situation. The action polish was done by RK guns in Nampa-$50.  The sights are Tru Glo TFO for rapid acquisition in daylight or low/no light conditions - $100.  The extended mag release, extended slide release, and extended slide lock make operation and take down much faster than normal.  The 'tape' grip is by Talon - $20.   Comes with two thirteen round mags, hard case, papers, etc.  FYI, the tape at the rear of the slide facilitated a grip issue that was me, not the pistol.  Keep it or take it off, as you wish.  I have fired Federal 165 grain HP rounds  through this weapon exclusively.  I guesstimate at just over 1000 rounds so break in has been done.  I would not ask this price for a stock Glock, but I know this one, and with the mods, its worth the price.

The only thing I see is that a couple of letters on the barrel are fading a little bit. Thats all. The rifle is just beautiful. It was in a safe for almost the past 20 years before I bought it  . It comes with a Weatherby premier 3-9x40 which is also in perfect shape. I will include a box of 20 Weatherby factory rounds for a good trade. I am interested in 1911s of good quality which I can include cash as well if your value is higher. I would like to trade on a 1500 value. I know I want 1150 in cash but the rifle is worth more .

Eight miles east of Medicine Bow National Forest.  15 miles S/E of Centennial and 15 miles N/E of Woods Landing.  Two hours from north suburbs of Denver.
I have developed 9 lots on over 300 acres. These lots range from 13 acres to 60 acres, and are perfect for those who just want to be left alone.  At this time there is only one occupied residence within 3 miles of the development.

Ideally, my neighbors would be like minded folks who are thinking for when the SHTF and in the meantime, appreciate a weekend get-away to shoot lots of guns and be close to hunting, fishing, skiing and snowmobiling which are 30 minutes or less away.

There is a long distance gun range up to 600 yards (longer if you want it) developed on site, with more to come! Roads built to all lots and power run to some. Prices starting at $1500/acre ... and can be very negotiable to the right buyer (neighbor). I can finance purchases.

I'm preferring to sell to folks outside of Albany County, Wyoming so that all owners have a 'destination visit' to their property. Hopefully, when you or I visit our property, there will not be things happening like a local company picnic at the gun range, or some kids being sent out to the property for the afternoon to ride dirt bikes all over the countryside, etc. etc. such as might be the case with local ownership.
If this sounds interesting to you, please send me a response to this listing and we'll talk!

Your Model 29, .44 Magnum is part of a special order of five
thousand units with three inch barrels, round butt combat stocks
and a blue finish, which were originally produced for Lew Horton
Distributing Company with manufacturing of these handguns began

all the units and requested Smith & Wesson to make them
available to other distributors.

Production, caliber .44 Remington Magnum, in our company
records. These records indicate that your revolver with serial
number ALA9XXX, was shipped from our factory on November 4,
1985, and delivered to Southern Gun Distributors Inc., Opa
Locka, FL. The records indicate that this firearm was shipped
wi th a 3 inch barrel, blue finish, and smooth Goncalo Alves
finger groove combat round butt grips.

It comes with two magazines, one is a flush fit and the other has an extension. Also included is a Ruger cleaning cloth and zipper pouch. I am asking $300 for the gun and would like to either sell or trade up. I have 1500 rds. ammo and a couple hundred cash for the right trade. I won't sell the ammo without the gun.
