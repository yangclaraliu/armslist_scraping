Get yours before they get around to banning it! The design of the sear engagement is similar to high quality match grade triggers and the third mode makes the reset of the trigger seem to be automatic so all you have to do is press as fast as you can. By using NP3 for abrasion resistance, low coefficient of friction, and hardness, the life span of these triggers is greatly increased. One trigger was tested over ten thousand rounds and then measured to see the change in the engagement surfaces. After the ten thousand rounds, the trigger had minimal to no significant change in engagement surfaces and was deemed ready for more endurance testing. The extremely high quality of these parts combined with the unbeatable advantageous of NP3 make for a revolutionary trigger. This is another example of high quality metal parts using NP3 to offer the best product available. Go To their website to learn more http://tacfirecon.com/

It comes with the AA's bolt carrier, standard charging handle, and Kies Master Blaster muzzle device. (Makes shooting this more fun directing the blast forward away from you.)

Below is the information from Adams Arms website:

The 5.56 PDW Tactical Elite 7.5"" Upper is a short barreled pistol piston upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. It comes with our proprietary Melonited heavy contour barrel and pistol length gas piston system. Because the piston chamber is the same size as the chamber on the rest of the Adams Arms gas lengths this 7.5"" upper now has the proper dwell time to get cyclic rate and bullet velocity needed to make this a viable short barreled option for any CQB scenarios. We've also added a 7"" Samson free floating Evolution forearm giving the shooter the ultimate tactical option in a personal defense weapon. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

The time has come for me to part way with one of my all time favorite firearms, my IWI Desert Eagle Mark XIX. Black in color, and chambered in .44 Magnum. She's treated me very well, and has never failed to amaze me. Nothing but good times/memories. Life is good, but just like any other human being, I was thrown a few curve balls which forces me to let her go. I've put a total of approximately 150 rounds through her. There are few blemishes due to handling, but nothing major, no major scratches or imperfections. She's still gorgeous! The marking in picture near the barrel lock pin is just some oil residue from my last outing. Always torn down and clean after each shooting event. Will come with three EMPTY factory steel magazines. I May or may not have a box of leftover ammo lying around that I can include, just to get you going.

I'm asking $1350 FIRM. Yes, that's in US currency. While I'm mainly interested in a FTF CASH only transaction, I may be willing to entertain those with reasonable trades. Buyer must have a current/valid WA State ID or drivers license. While not having a CPL WILL NOT necessarily bar you from owning this firearm, I usually PREFER to only deal with those who have a current/valid CPL in their possession, so don't be offended if I turn you down because of this. I know the value of my firearm and will not be letting her go for next to nothing. Trade value must be at or above me asking price and must be in my favor as I'm mainly interested in cash at the moment. So, no, I will not trade you for your single plastic firearm. The only firearm that I'm really interested in at the moment is the 4"" barrel S&W500, specifically the Backpacker, however, I'm willing to entertain those those with MULTIPLE FIREARM trades, HIGHER-END firearms, or well-conditioned running and driving VEHICLES with current tabs and clean titles.

With all that being said, please feel free to throw your offers my way. I believe I'm a pretty nice, relaxed and understanding guy, The worst that I can possibly say is ""Kick rocks your lowlife piece of shit!"", okay I'm kidding, but seriously, the worst that I can say is ""No, thank you. I appreciate the interest/offer, but I'm going to have to pass. Good luck with everything."", let's face it, it's not that bad right, we've all dealt with rejection one time or another. Email is probably the best way to get a hold of me as I get notifications straight to my phone, however, for those looking for a faster response, please fee free to leave a name and number, and your preferred way of communication i.e. text or phone call and I will get back to you as soon as I possibly can. Thanks my fellow gunners. Shoot on!"

Up for sale is two BRAND NEW IN BOX inflatable pontoon boats. Yes, two! BOTH are RIVER CAPABLE!

Boxes have seen better days, mainly from me having to move them around the shop here and there but is still structurally sound. Note, just the cardboard, outside cover boxes show wear. All contents inside are in perfect, brand new condition! I now have two sitting in the shop awaiting for a couple of new owners to put them to use! Grab them both! One for you and possibly your partner or significant other? You can be the savior that you've always wanted to be by purchasing these, perhaps for your kids? That way, they, too can enjoy their summer, while you go out on whatever great expeditions you have set up for this upcoming summer season. What better way to share your experience on water than with some good company! Don't forget the snacks, drinks, and fishing gear!

I'm mainly interested in cash as recent events forces me to sell these, buy both and I'm sure we can work out some sort of package deal, I may be willing to entertain those with reasonable trades items. Trade items must be at or above my asking prices. Willing to trade both off for a single item, though single item must be highly in my favor. I'm mainly interested in firearms, and electronics, can trade both towards payment of a well running and driving, currently tabbed, clean title vehicle. Feel free to message me any offers that you may have and we'll see if we can come to an agreement.

Asking price is $450. I'll be more than happy to meet up and demo with serious buyers in a populated, well lit area. With that being said, lets get on the camera shall we?

The camera is in great condition and perfect for anybody who's looking to get into photography. Very lightweight, compact, and packed with powerful features. The only reason that I'm looking to sell it is because I can no longer find the time to actually use it. I have a pretty hectic work schedule that changes constantly, making it hard for me to find time to enjoy the things that I like to do. I've only used it on a few occasions, which consisted of birthday parties, family outings, and holidays. So there is very little usage. There are very slight minor scratches on the rotating LCD screen, but it's honestly nothing major. Doesn't affect functionality whatsoever, I'm just picky when it comes to things of this nature, but it really isn't that bad. Comes with everything you need in order to get you started and shooting. Camera body, lens, battery, charger, neck strap, and memory card.

Willing to trade for legal firearms, Canon DSLR camera body, high end car audio, other electronic goods, and that's pretty much it, but feel free to offer me whatever you have and we'll see if we work something out to reach an agreement. Other than that, it's a cash only transaction. I can send over actual photos to those who are interested.

I've recently made the switch to Nikon and have a few leftovers sitting around; I figured I'd throw it up and see what what I can get. All items are in very good and proper working order. I'm mainly looking for a cash transaction, however, I may be willing to trade for higher end T-Mobile smartphone(s), legal firearm(s), high end car audio, other electronic goods, and that's pretty much it. I have cash to add on my end if needed. Other than that, it's a cash only transaction. I won't be doing any PayPal transactions, and definitely won't be shipping it anywhere, sorry overseas scammers, try getting a REAL job, instead of getting over and profiting off of innocent people. With that being said, shall we move on? On to the list...

The 45 has a genuine lifetime warranty whether you bought the gun new or used.  They will repair or replace it for free.  It's a got a great rep on the forums for that.  It shoots excellently.  I have fired maybe 250-300 rounds and haven't had a single FTF or FTE with any type of ammo.

It came with the 22LR cylinder and after buying it, I bought the 22 Mag cylinder from the factory.  Good choice.  The 22 Mag is an awesome round.  I've probably fired 50-60 rounds through this as a guess.

This is without a doubt one of the best shooting compact pistols that I have ever owned. The combination of the weight and point-able nature of this makes it shoot straight for me when I punch out. The only issue for me is that it is too heavy to carry as a secondary weapon, as I normally carry on my ankle or in a cargo pocket. This weapon needs to be carried on the waist or in a shoulder holster. The short double action trigger pull of the LDA is incomparable to anything currently available by other manufacturers.

I purchased it with one Para mag, which feels like it may need a new spring. I purchased an ACT mag and 2 Cobramags in Officer's length which are included. The Cobramag is one of the best available.

A single mag holder and OWB/IWB leather holster are also included.

I need the cash for my secondary weapon purchase, so a trade would have to be something special. Make me a cash or trade offer. We can probably come together.

This is without a doubt one of the best shooting compact pistols that I have ever owned. The combination of the weight and point-able nature of this makes it shoot straight for me when I punch out. The only issue for me is that it is too heavy to carry as a secondary weapon, as I normally carry on my ankle or in a cargo pocket. This weapon needs to be carried on the waist or in a shoulder holster. The short double action trigger pull of the LDA is incomparable to anything currently available by other manufacturers.

I purchased it with one Para mag, which feels like it may need a new spring. I purchased an ACT mag and 2 Cobramags in Officer's length which are included. The Cobramag is one of the best available.

A single mag holder and OWB/IWB leather holster are also included.

I need the cash for my secondary weapon purchase, so a trade would have to be something special. Make me a cash or trade offer. We can probably come together.

 VERY HARD TO FIND!!!
No need to get into a lengthy description of detail about the RAMI because I am sure everyone knows about it but if you do not, feel free to ask. 
 
All I have done is give it a good cleaning to get the factory packing grease off of it and put it in the safe.
Flawless looking and a Great feeling pistol with the 10 round mag as shown and with the 14 round extended mag that also comes with it. A lot of good looking fire power in such a small work of art.
I did add the grip extension on it but still have the factory one that is included. 
 
I know that the de-cocker CZ'S are more popular and harder to come by than the safety models but I prefer the safety models.
I have a GREAT temptation to fire it and will probably take the post down by next week end and give in to it BUT for now, will sell or trade for the right offer."

Although the stock has been mounted and used, it looks as good as it did the day I got it. I have been impressed by how well the finish has held up. 

The base stock was foliage green, so in areas where the hydro dip didn't reach (like inside the storage compartment) that's the color visible. 

The PMags and XTM rail covers came from the same place and match the color tones of the stock. The mags are like new - I never used them.  A few of the XTM covers have a chips at the separation line from being removed from a rail - MagPul deffinitely designed them to stay put - but they aren't really noticeable in my opinion, and I'm pretty picky about those things.

If you want to save money id take the first option. If you just looking for simple this option is for you. Will not sell anything else if you take it this way. No holsters, comes just like it would with a new 50$ sight. Will give original sight if you dont like this one but have fun taking it off. 600$ Firm I guess if you want a 3rd mag will sell for 35$ Much cheaper then i paid from gougers. Now i dont mean to sound like a hard Ace but people tend to waste my time with how much with this and this bla bla. Thats why these are the two options.

ONLY TRADES CONCIDERED, Quarter stick, Auto meater gauges (NOT AUTO GAUGE) Temp, fuel, oil, voltage. or fuel system. 16 gallon cell, -10 line and pump, filter etc that will feed 800 hp. I have another add with a spikes AR. So may trade this, the AR and possibley built defense shotgun for the right roller."

I still have the original wood stock and bayonet mount.  I bought dies and reloading supplies for it because it is so hard to find good ammo for these things.  Bore slugs out to .311 and Hornady makes a great bullet at .312 that shoot great from it.  I will include with the sale all the extra parts, ammo and reloading components.  There are over 100 Hornady bullets, about 300 brass cases in storage containers and set of Lee neck sizing dies.  All numbers on the rife match.  From the proof marks on the rifle I have been able to determine that this was a Canadian issued rife.  It is really fun to shoot and I hate to give it up but I need the money for other projects."

How much do you have invested in your guns? And yet most people keep them tucked away in a closet or in some flimsy wood and glass display case. Do yourself a a favor and invest in something to protect your valuables. Record your serial numbers and take pictures. Store them in Drop Box or some other photo hosting service in case your computers get stolen the same time they steal your guns. Just sayin'."

This PX4 Storm is in excellent condition, very clean and very well taken care of. It is the Type C model that is the Constant Action. It includes everything from the factory, box, paperwork, extra backstraps and 2-10rd magazines.

Beretta's Px4 Storm features an exclusive Beretta-designed locked breech with a rotating barrel system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise. The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and it also features a deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer-reinforced fiberglass and features an integral Picatinny MIL-STD rail. The Px4 Storm has an ambidextrous safety/decocking lever and a reversible magazine release, and it may be configured with a small, medium, or large backstrap for individual fit (3 backstraps included). The modular structure, ergonomics, and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law enforcement use and personal defense.

This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself. With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth. Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. A dueling tree is also an excellent training tool that will help sharpen your shooting skills. Back up and put that Nikon or Luepold scope to work and have long range duels with your friends! The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50. You can email through the sight or call or text me @ 931-312-912two

The last picture is from Actiontarget.com. I selected one rimfire target and one AR500 target. With shipping is well over $860! Who has that kind of money to waste? I know I don't!

Rimfire trees:
6 paddle = $200
8 paddle = $235
AR500 trees:
4 paddle = $275
6 paddle = $325

For an unbeatable deal, order one 8 paddle rimfire tree and one 6 paddle AR500 tree and get BOTH trees for only $475! You can't even buy 1 commercial AR500 tree for that price! 2 commercial trees like this would be well over $800.00!

I am open to almost any firearm trade. Try me. Send me what you have. I will seriously consider any offer. Trade me that weapon you have thats just sitting in your safe for a target that will provide years of fun!"

Quite a few returned with the GI's after WWII, but few have strong working springs like this for crisp action.  Wear on the grips hints to its history.  I am also including a vintage holster (not original).

With hotter loads exiting the muzzle at nearly 2000 fps with around 2000 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle, the .454 Casull is an impressive cartridge. This is a VERY POTENT handgun!
 To give you a comparison of how powerful it really is, the venerable .357 Magnum has around 500 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle. The Taurus Raging Bull 454 really is like holding the power of a raging bull in your hands! Capable of releasing 5 of these powerful rounds in a matter of seconds makes the Raging Bull a formidable weapon. To help keep all this firepower under control, the Taurus Raging Bull comes with rubber cushioned grips, a heavy frame, and porting at the top of the barrel to help minimize recoil. Eight ports (four on each side of the front sight) vent gas upwards to help minimize the kick up of the Raging Bull. The rust resistant stainless steel matte finish helps ensure good looks for the life of this revolver."
