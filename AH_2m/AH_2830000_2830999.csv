Ruger 10/22 .22LR Carbine w/ 18.5″ Barrel, 10+1 Rounds, Stainless Steel, Black Synthetic Stock, Ruger 1256

The Ruger 10/22 rifle is America’s favorite .22 LR rifle, with proven performance in a wide range of styles for every rimfire application. Ideally suited for informal target shooting, “plinking,” small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate.

With a variety of choices – from the standard 10/22 Carbine, to the tack-driving accuracy of the Target model, the 10/22 is still today’s most popular .22 rifle. It looks right, feels right, shoots right and continues to perform under heavy use – inspiring the most fanatical loyalty from its owners. With proven design, legendary reliability and the modern features demanded by today’s .22 LR shooters, these firearms are priced right to make keeping tradition affordable.
PATENTED, DETACHABLE 10-SHOT ROTARY MAGZINE features a unique rotor to separate cartridges and provide reliable feeding.
EASY-TO-USE EXTENDED MAGAZINE RELEASE provides smooth, no-fuss removal of the unique, flush mounted magazine – with no exposed magazine to dent and no uncomfortable protrusions at the rifle’s balance point.
POSITIVE, PUSH-BUTTON, CROSS-BOLT MANUAL SAFETY
COMBINATION SCOPE BASE ADAPTER for both Weaver-style and .22 “tip-off” scope mounts is  provided with every rifle.
HAMMER-FORGED BARREL that is locked into the receiver by a unique two-screw V-block system.

Opelika, Phenix City, Alabama",$ 500,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 18, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is one Pre Patent Buckmaster 184 in excellent condition. This Knife was purchased by me in the mid 80's and has been on display. This knife has been in a box on a shelf for the past 5 year and I have no desire to display it any more. This knife has never been used and the compass and stone are in excellent condition. The price of $500 is firm. 

The Buck 184 ""Buckmaster"" is a large Bowie-bladed survival knife, allegedly developed at the request of the US Navy SEALs. The knife has a blade that is approximately 7.5"" (19cm) long, and is of the classic Bowie shape. The hollow-ground main edge is about 6.5"" (16.5cm) long. The false edge is serrated on one side. The back of the blade features a very aggressive 3"" (7.5cm) long sawback. Maximum blade width is about 1.5"" (3.7cm), and the blade is .288 - .290-inch thick. The blade is forged 425mod steel. The handguard is about 6mm thick, with both ends curving slightly towards the blade. Each end is drilled and tapped for a 2"" (51mm) long, 10mm diameter ""point"" which is designed to allow the knife to be used as an anchor when a line is attached to the lanyard ring at the pommel. The grip is 4"" (102mm) long and 1.25"" (2.8cm) in diameter, knurled and grooved for a sure grip. The grip is hollow, with a usable internal opening secured by the threaded pommel, which in turn is knurled, slightly larger in diameter than the grip, and sealed with a black rubber O-ring. The threaded pommel also secured a 4.5mm thick steel stamping which is pierced to provide a lanyard/rope hole.

Regarding the grappling hooks, these are described in the patent. In brief, the patent discusses the attachment of the grapples to the quillon with sufficient strength to support a load of 600 pounds and reference is made to a casting line. With this said, it is generally accepted that using the knife as a grappling hook, which implies the act of tying a rope to the pommel and throwing the knife, could be very hazardous! In fact, the last of the BUCKMASTER knives came with small flyers saying that using the knife as a grappling hook would void the warranty. A better use of these hooks are as anchor pins where knife can be wedged in some rocks or the crotch of a tree and used with a securing line off the lanyard loop attached to the hollow handle cap/pommel.

The sheath is of black rigid fiberglass-reinforced plastic. Attached to the front of the sheath is one removable black nylon pouch; it contains a full-size Silva Type 12 compass with a red cord lanyard. The back of the sheath has an inlaid sharpening stone. Heavy black nylon webbing is used to cover the stone, secure the two pouches to the sheath, secure the knife in its sheath, and provide a loop for a leg tie. An additional loop of black nylon webbing, with a Fastex-type closure, provides a quick-release belt loop.

The Karabiner Model 1931 (K31) is a magazine-fed, straight-pull bolt-action rifle. It was the standard issue rifle of the Swiss armed forces from 1933 until 1958, though examples remained in service into the 1970s. It has a 6-round removable magazine, and is chambered for the 7.5x55mm Swiss (also known as unofficially 7.5x55mm Schmidt Rubin), a cartridge with ballistic qualities similar to the 7.62x51mm NATO/.308 Winchester cartridge. Each rifle included a 6 round detachable box magazine with matching engraved serial number.  A stripper clip loads the magazine from the top of the receiver.

There's 2160 rounds total in two sealed cans of 1080 each, and the ammo is 1976-production Russian 7N6 surplus with a 52gr air-cavity bullet. As this weekend Palmetto State Armory is having a free shipping sale on sealed 5.45 crates, I'm temporarily dropping my price to match what they're offering. Price is as follows:

$390 for both sealed spam cans plus crate and opener, 2160 rounds total

$195 for a sealed 1080 round spam can. Includes can opener.

Sorry but I'm firm on price, this is one of the two listings of 5.45 on Armslist in the entire state of Missouri and you're not going to find it for less either online or in a local store. I'm already matching the lowest current in-stock prices as per gun-deals and gunbot.

Note: a bunch of people have contacted me about the $160 spam cans from Widener's they've seen on gunbot and expect me to match that price. Thing is, if you actually follow the link to Widener's site it shows as out of stock and according to the cached page saved on Archive.org this has been the case for months now. Even then if they did have it in-stock you'd be looking at roughly $30 in ground shipping per spam can since they weigh 29lb each, so it would cost you exactly as much from there as it would from me (plus a shipping delay.) USAC sales does have it in-stock for $169/can, but will charge you $39 for shipping to the St. Louis area which actually makes it a little more expensive than my price: http://i.imgur.com/SJH9YqD.jpg

I live north of St. Louis but if you're in the city I will drive as far as St. Charles to meet up with you at a public place such as the parking lot of Cabelas or Bass Pro."

These guns are difficult to find.  It comes complete in the box along with two high capacity 16 round magazines.

The CZ 75 B Stainless is the first stainless steel firearm to bear the CZ name. With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well.

CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

•All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts)
•High capacity double column magazines
•Hammer forged barrels
•Ergonomic grip and controls
•Unparalleled accuracy
•Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control
•3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available)
•Smooth double action and crisp single action
•Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials
•Firing pin block safety
•Two 16 round magazines included

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, de-cockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The photos you see are of the actual gun you will receive.  The entire kit is brand new stock and has not been handled other than for inspection.

Please contact me with any questions you may have before purchasing.  Since it is a brand new, unfired gun the price is firm and trades are not being considered. Shipping costs will be incurred by the buyer and any transfer other than local and in person transfer will be to your FFL in states that will allow.

ALL OTHER CALIBERS AVAILIABLE. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES ( SHOWN BELOW ) THIS IS THE NEW R8 MODEL FROM BLASER. ALL OF THE GREAT BLASER FEATURES PLUS MORE. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES. A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the brand-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance.iseruse buyer shuld contarct me thanks you"

Was my Dads truck...my daily driver the last few years. Parked it last summer when I had to buy a van for work.
I had planned on restoring her, but life happens... Not going to be able to hold on to her that long. Only body damage shown on right rear. Tailgate and bed excellent. Interior excellent, paint typical GM of that era. Drivetrain tired, but in working order. Needs some wiring clean up. A hub is making noise sometimes if backing up with the wheel turned to the left. Other little things with something this age. A prime candidate for restoration...hoping this is where she goes.
My dad has since died since giving it to me so you will need to apply for a lost title. Or I can go through the process of getting the title if it's important to you, but the expense will be yours. Call Brian to view and drive. 541-2twotwo-9zero9five"

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement of conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. Using the HK- proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle’s interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 is produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1's upper receiver is be fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this manufacturing process, producing a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use."

Caliber 7.62 mm (.308 caliber) 
Length 2.84 inches 

Description
SF3P-762-5/8-24
The advanced SureFire SF3P-762-5/8-24 three-prong flash hider, which fits the Armalite AR-10, DPMS LR308, and 7.62 mm rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads, features a patent-pending design that greatly reduces muzzle flash—typically greater than 99%—when compared with a plain muzzle. Boasting robust tines built to withstand the rigors of combat, the SF3P-762-5/8-24 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 7.62 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM762-RC model having recently won the Mk13 .300 Win-Mag sniper rifle contract award with the US Special Operations Command in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted. 

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—and including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SF3P-762-5/8-24 flash hider is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning, even after extreme use. 

When used in conjunction with a SureFire SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SF3P-762-5/8-24 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment and to prevent the audible ringing of tines inside the suppressor. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. 

SureFire flash hiders are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment and are covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee. 

FITS: Armalite AR-10, DPMS LR308, and 7.62 mm rifles with 5/8-24 muzzle threads 

MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 7.62 mm /.308 caliber sound suppressors 

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, flash hider/suppressor adapters, and muzzle brake/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders."

Starting from our exclusive priming mixture and priming system ( the mixture is not “ spun “ in the rim but is pressed in the same ) , guaranteeing an even burning ratio and minimal standard deviation and delay of ignition , to the precision drawing of the case always gauged for the precise orthogonality , to the specially lubricated bullets , loaded using a unique process that prevents bullets from touching one another to ensure the loaded bullet integrity , all of these factors are contributing , together with exclusive powder mix , to the small “ miracle “ of an ammunition which has no peers in the arena."

This is a beautiful classic full sized 9mm, has been 100% reliable.  I love it and really dont want to get rid of it but I'm willing to sacrifice it for something more compact for me to carry this summer.  This is the stainless steel INOX version, virtually rust proof and very easy to clean, also has the more desirable matching stainless steel controls instead of the black plastic ones.  Incredibly smooth slide, and smooth da/sa action.
I have a fair amount of stuff for it and will trade gear for gear depending on what you have.  Has its original box and I have a kydex OWB holster and mag pouch for it and up to six 15 round magazines.

I'm looking primarily for a SIG P938, but would also be interested in a Springfield XDm 3.8in compact in 9mm or a Glock 26+a little cash/ammo/extra mags.

Prefer to trade, but I will sell everything, the gun, 6 mags, mag pouch and holster for $700.
Will sell the gun and four mags for $600. 

I have my CCL, Feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers, I sleep during the day but will get back with you ASAP if I'm interested.

There are little bits of rust on the outside of the barrel and some of the bluing has worn off so it's not in mint condition. Good for a plinker you can throw around or for the squirrel hunters.

I've shot 300 rounds through it with no failures.  Everything in the original package is included (two magazines, Kahr hard case, and all documentation/manuals).  This is a great concealed carry, personal/home defense pistol.  I bought and installed these very bright night sights (see pic) in November of 2012, so they have a good 8-9 years of brightness left in them. The accuracy of this pistol is incredible.  The picture below was taken on 5/27 at Bracken Gun Range.  This is a five-shot grouping with one stray (my fault, not the gun's) from a bench rest.  That is four shots in the same large hole, and I'm an ""average"" shooter.  Chuck (owner of Bracken Gun Range) attested the grouping.  If you decide to buy it, you must provide CHL or we can meet at an FFL dealer (Adelbridge Firearms on San Pedro and you pay the transfer fee).  Text or call me at two-1-0, two-six-0, 5-four-five-4 if interested. 

I also have this gun on Gunbroker, so if any bids come in on the gun, you will have to go onto Gunbroker and click ""buy it now"", which will be higher than the listed price here.
