Trinity Scent Control

The Scent Blocker Alpha Jacket & Pants is just what the name implies, the leader of the pack. Constructed of a high-quality micro-fleece polyester shell, the Alpha is deadly silent and treated with a DWR water repellent treatment to keep you dry in mist and light rain. The WindBlocker membrane ensures that this jacket will keep you protected from cold, blustery wind. The BodyLock collar and Hybrid BodyLock waist helps hold in heat and scent for maximum protection. The DWR water repellent finish will keep you dry in light rain and mist, while the removable hood provides a layer of protection where you tend to lose most of your body heat. Non-slip grip patches on each shoulder help stabilize and secure your backpack, bow sling or rifle sling. The Alpha Jacket is TreeSpider compatible and features an innovative safety harness slit. A plethora of pockets will help you store essential gear and the offset zipper will help keep your zipper from digging into your chin. The Alpha Jacket is designed for late season and cold weather hunting, so this jacket features plenty of room to layer underneath. Trinity Scent Technology utilizes a synthetic carbon system that is said to absorb up to 40% more odor than carbon technology and up to 200% more than zeolite technology. Superior odor absorption isn't the only claim to fame for Trinity Technology. Trinity is extremely lightweight and quiet, allowing you closer shots at game.

Its even still wrapped in the plastic it was shipped in, box has never been opened, sight has never been removed from box. Its as brand new as it gets. I ordered 2 thinking I would have a use for it, but only put one to use, so now this one is just sitting around.

Info from the Aimpoint website:
A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic
• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. 
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking 
and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared 
to iron sights and magnified scopes.
• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with 
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world 
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with 
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. 
(Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
• Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
• QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. 
Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.
• Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage, 
fingerprints and scratches.

The statutes below were taken directly from LexisNexis.com (2014), which is the official site that Georgia uses to post and update it's new and existing laws.

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-132
Possession of a handgun by a person under the age of 18 years

Georgia law only covers possession of handguns by those 
""Under"" the age of 18 with varying circumstances, as well as those 21+. That means a person 18-20 can legally ""posses"" a handgun.


O.C.G.A. § 16-11-101.1
Furnishing pistol or revolver to person under the age of 18 years

This law relates to the sale of handguns in Georgia through a private party (you and I) sale. Once again, it only refers to those ""under"" the age of 18. The rest of the laws that apply to the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in Georgia are federal laws which only apply to an FFL or manufacturer. (http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/articles/2004/citizen%60s-guide-to-federal-firearms-law.aspx> 

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-126
Having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons; license requirement; exceptions for homes, motor vehicles, and other locations and conditions; penalties for violations

These Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads were designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for defense against humans. Both loads feature light weight, hollow nosed bullets, designed to mushroom dramatically at the intended impact velocities. Item # 4H will perform on humans much like our DEER GRENADE load (Item # 4F) performs on game animals. The light-for-caliber weight of these bullets, aids in reduced felt recoil, for faster follow-up shots. We've employed flash suppressed powders but, with any bullet moving this fast from typical length revolvers, there is still a decent flash in low light.

Both of these loads will also work well on light, big game such as whitetail deer.

Both of these loads are safe to use in ALL/ANY 44 mag. firearm that is in normal operating condition.

Note our real world velocities taken from my personal stock firearms. We prefer to establish our advertised velocities from over-the-counter, stock firearms, while most ammunition companies establish their published velocities from laboratory, long, test barrels, which provide false or exaggeratedly high readings. We feel that this long established practice does not give the customer a true idea of what the ammunition is doing when fired from 'real world guns' under 'real world conditions,' where these numbers really do matter.

This is a wonder to shoot. The gun is in great shape other than minimal wear mark from being shot. The gun has has about 200 rounds down the pipe, cleaned, and put into the safe. The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$.

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but don't offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I answer email immediately, or can be reached by text. Please no calls.

This gun spent almost it's entire life in a gun safe and then I bought it a few years ago to shoot clays. I have put about 1500 rounds through it and it functions flawlessly, as you'd expect from Beretta. Mechanically it is perfect. There are numerous very minor safe dings in the wood, but very light and nothing through the finish. The wood as you can see, is obviously custom and was added after the original owner bought the gun, It is spectacular to say the least. The wood is worth at least $800-$900 from Coles. When I bought the gun, I had Jack Concannon install a kickeez recoil pad, mercury recoil reducer in the buttstock and open up the forcing cone. I also bought 4 Briley extended chokes which will go with the gun. It shoots great and with the improvements, very comfortably. I just don't shoot anymore - 3 times in the last 2 years. I am asking $1500 cash OBRO.

This is a wonder to shoot. The gun is in great shape other than minimal wear mark from being shot. The gun has has about 200 rounds down the pipe, cleaned, and put into the safe. The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$.

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but don't offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I answer email immediately, or can be reached by text. Please no calls.

Elite Piston AR-15 16"" 30+1 Optic Ready Magpul","Midland, Dothan, Alabama","$ 1,545","Listed On: Tuesday, April 1, 2014",Rifles,no type,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"B.E.A.R. (Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor Defense feature
a patent-bearing, gas piston system with a free-floating barrel for
increased accuracy. This is due to the piston's incorporation into the
upper half of the forward rail system - so it never touches the barrel.
Extremely close machine tolerances eliminate the need for piston rings. 
With a tool-less field strip design, a B.E.A.R. requires nothing more than
a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong. The piston's cyclical rate
for a controlled rate of fire adjusts with a turn of the gas plug located
in the front piston assembly. Because diminished heat reaches the upper,
hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver,
lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Due to superior
design, the B.E.A.R. has no carrier tilt and low fouling of the chamber and
action. The ejection port wiper prevents the entry of dust, sand and other
debris by moving into the ejection port opening flush with the inside
geometry of the upper receiver. The spring-loaded shield allows the bolt
carrier to return to ready position. Being made of a highly-durable,
self-lubricating polymer helps the shield withstand temperature extremes.
The B.E.A.R. Elite series features a few upgrades, including a Magpul MOE
rifle stock and Magpul MOE ergonomic rifle grip with aggressive texturing
for a sure grip. The chrome-lined barrel from FN Manufacturing has 1:7
twist and is hammer-forged with a M249 rifling profile for long life and
exceptional accuracy. It also has a forward-placed, ambidextrous charging
handle. It has a two-piece key-locked, highly-rigid quad-rail system made
of aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy that seamlessly mounts to the
upper receiver made from the same aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy.
The upper and lower rails separate with the push of a button - no special
tools required. NOTE. I ONLY ACCEPT WESTERN UNION AND MONEY GRAM, THEN WHEN I RECEIVED THE CASH THEN IT CAN BE SHIPPED."

Actual pictures will be added after work today.  CURRENT PICTURE SHOWN IS A STOCK PHOTO FROM THE DAWSON PRECISION WEBSITE - NOT ACTUAL ITEM FOR SALE.

I am selling a Hard Chromed STI EDGE 40cal that I bought from DAWSON PRECISION.  I also had them add the Competition Ready Package to it.  It has less than 300 rounds through it from two trips to the range.  It was never used in competition.  I bought it to replace my CZ CTS 40cal but the CZ just fits my hand better and I shouldn't have tried to fix something that wasn't broken.  It has just sat in my safe in case I changed my mind or the CZ broke but after a year I can't justify holding onto it anymore. So my rash purchase equals your savings, no wait time, no tax, and no shipping (FTF only).  I paid $2340 for the pistol with the one standard 126mm 14 round magazine, before any add-ons.

I also have additional magazines for it, which will not be separated until AFTER THE PISTOL HAS SOLD.  The buyer of the pistol has first shot at the magazines.  if they don't want them, then they will be sold on a first come, first served basis.  All magazines are new and were only removed from their packaging to install the +1 tool-less aluminum baseplates.  I still have the original plastic baseplates as well.

6 - 140mm mags - 18rds -                    $60/ea
2 - 170mm mags - 22rds -                   $100/ea
8 - aluminum tool-less +1 baseplates -   $32/ea
                                 Total when new $816

I don't haggle which is why I listed all the prices.  This way you can see exactly what you are saving.  The magazines are backordered right now - I am not going to mark up the price like some, but I am going to price very close to what I paid because they are new and you won't have to wait for more to be made sometime in the future by backordering.
Since the pistol is in like new condition and not even broke in yet, I feel that 15% off is more than fair.  

Buyer will have to sign a bill of sale stating they are not a prohibited possessor.
