LEGACY ARMS CITADEL M-1 .22 LR – Legacy CIR22M1SMMG
“MOONSHINE MUDDY GIRL” EDITION

Straight from the pages of history … the greatest conflict of modern times, World War II … comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exacting specifications of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction rifle comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge.
Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews, and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand rifle, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the “United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1″, its official military designation.

Unique camo stock
Citadel M-1.22 are ready for fun plinking!

The M-1.22 features an adjustable rear sight, semi-automatic blow back action, 10 round magazine and polymer bayonet lug. The M-1.22 has an 18 inch barrel with 6 groove rifling in a 1:16 rate of twist. It’s overall length is 35 inches and the stock is cut of a traditional M1.

I am selling my Core 15 CXV along with all the accessories and ammo I have for it as a package deal. I purchased this gun in October and since then it has probably had about 200 rounds through it. I recently lost one of my jobs and am needing the extra money. If I wasn't in this position I wouldn't consider selling it, but my loss could very well be your gain! I have found that while Core is not a wildly known brand, their appreciation for quality definitely shows in their guns. Not only has it functioned flawlessly since the first shot but it also comes with a lifetime guarantee regardless number of owners or rounds through it. I bought and installed accessories that I felt were tailored made for a personal defense rifle as well as a sporting rifle. Between the upgraded grip/stock/fore grip this rifle is very comfortable to shoot and has plenty of places for even more attachments. Here is a list of the things I have for it.

Core 15 CXV Rifle (Lifetime Warranty) - $750
Nikon P-223 3x Scope (Lifetime Warranty) with NcStar quick detatch mount - $175
Magpul STR Stock with cheek rest and battery storage (Forest Green) - $85
Magpul Foregrip (Forest Green) - $40
Hogue Grip - $25
Hard Case - $30
Total of 3 Pmags and one traditional metal Mag (2 Pmags I bought extra) - $40
Ammo - 234 Rounds in 5.56
131 Rounds in .223 = about $150

* I also have ALL the original parts (Grip, Stock, Foregrip) that are in perfect condition and included with the gun

Everything comes to around $1300 but I am asking 1000 OBO

This rifle has been cleaned each time it was fired and is in practically new condition. No visible scratches or dings on the gun or any parts and all of the internals have consistently been lubricated to keep the gun running flawlessly. I have tons of pictures of the bolt carrier group and some of the other internals that I can email anyone who may be interested. Thank you for your interest!"

Walther 5120329 P22 .22lr Semi-Auto Pistol with Factory Laser- 3.4″ Threaded Barrel, 10-Round, Black Finish

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

Walther 5120329 P22 .22lr Semi-Auto Pistol with Factory Laser- 3.4″ Threaded Barrel, 10-Round, Black Finish

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

Walther 5120329 P22 .22lr Semi-Auto Pistol with Factory Laser- 3.4″ Threaded Barrel, 10-Round, Black Finish

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

Walther H&K 416-22 .22LR Pistol with 20rd Mag – 5780303

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416 s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic. The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient, and have a 20-round capacity.

P-07 details:

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached."

Hardly used and near perfect without the 6-8 month wait! Retails for $149.00 locally. If you don't know about about Brommeland please google him. 

From his website- MAX - CON V Maximum Concealment Holster V Introduced in 1992, the MAX - CON V is without a doubt the most comfortable and concealable IWB holster on the market today. The belt loops are spaced fore and aft to recess them below the outside profile of the frame and slide of the weapon, thus significantly enhancing concealment. The bulk associated with having snaps placed at the holster’s widest point is totally eliminated with this approach.This holster is VERY comfortable, especially for extended wear. It’s flat, broad profile works like a snowshoe, spreading the weight across a large enough area to prevent the weapon from “digging” into the body. Each and every curve serves a particular function, avoiding nerve “pressure points” and making it very anatomically compatible with the muscle groups of the hip and thigh area. The result is a holster that feels like it looks - like there is nothing there at all.Another innovative design feature is that the rear belt loop is slightly longer than the front. If it becomes necessary to draw the weapon from a seated position, this allows the holster to rock slightly forward, greatly assisting the ability to draw while seated. This is of immeasurable value if one is caught in a hold - up while seated in a restaurant or becomes the victim of a car - jacking attempt. Gun in pictures not included."

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights.

Manufactured in the USA by Cody Mfg. Corp in the mid-1950s, this small company created a full size top break double action revolver similar to the top break Smith and Wesson or the Webley but chambered it in the common .22LR caliber. This is the first one we have seen in our shop and it is in great condition. For a full size revolver, this one is very light weight weighing in at only 1lb 3 oz. If you are not buying it for your collection, this could be the perfect revolver for a backpacking trip where weight savings is an important factor. Now is your chance to own a gun that not many other people can say they have in their collection and you can buy it on your C&R."

Now fitted with a blue octagonal barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. The Henry Pump Octagon, also available in .22 Magnum, is one gun that is built for fun. It also sports a grooved receiver for mounting a scope, and Marbles semi buckhorn fully adjustable rear sights with standard 3/8″ dovetail slots enabling you to change sights if you choose to do so.

Concealed carry wasn't legal then but in some cases it was ""BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY"" and I worked in some pretty sh*tty neighborhoods where most residents were packing. This pistol works well and when coworkers made fun of a wimpy .32, I put 7 rounds THROUGH a pair of solid oak 2X8's standing in front of a firewood pile. EVERY round went through the oak boards and into the logs yet recoil is mild and noise was tolerable without ear protection. $300 CASH FIRM TO OHIO RESIDENT ONLY, IN PERSON,(prefer CCW holder as I am so we know records are clean).

Virtually every critical component of every pistol is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. The finest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards. America's best shooters keep choosing Kimber. Legendary LAPD™ SWAT tested five major 1911 brands and chose Kimber. United States Marines assigned to Special Operations Command chose Kimber. The U.S.A. Shooting Rapid Fire Pistol Team trains for Olympic competition with a Kimber. Most recently, LAPD™ SIS transitioned to Kimber. They all chose Kimber for the same reason: quality, dependability and accuracy. So should you. Quality is the true measure of value. On the strength of quality, Kimber has become the world's largest producer of 1911 pistols. Compare a Kimber with any other brand of 1911—or any other type of semi-automatic pistol—and see for yourself why Kimber is the choice of America's best."

This is the ""Extreme"" version of the P226, which features the Short Reset Trigger, Hogue G10 grips, night sights, and probably a few other things.  :)

Comes with six magazines (2 Sig, 4 Mec-Gar), and a Serpa holster.  Lock was removed from the holster for an IDPA tournament, but retention is still strong without it.

For reference, paid $1099 for the gun, plus another $150 or so for the extra mags and holster.

Prefer to meet in Thurston County if possible, and would like to see CPL.

Thanks,

This is a relatively gently-used firearm with approximately 300-400 rounds through it. Very minimal wear, never carried. I bought this as a range toy, and it has certainly been great in that role! It's the long slide model (5""), and is one of the most accurate pistols I've ever shot. These are also DA/SA, striker-fired pistols. I'm sad to see it go, but am looking to get another CCW firearm. Picture is a generic one; identical.

The high-performance LED is virtually immune to failure since there is no filament to burn out or break, and it provides a far longer runtime per set of batteries when compared to incandescent lights of similar lumen output. It comes standard with a high-strength aerospace aluminum body with a Mil-Spec hard-anodized finish for extreme durability. Also features an ergonomic CombatGrip configuration suited for flashlight/handgun techniques and provides a secure hold with cold, wet, or gloved hands. 

The M3LT features tactical switching— a pushbutton switch that (1) is located on the tailcap for fast, no-look access and for use with flashlight/handgun techniques, and (2) always activates maximum light output when fully depressed.

Features:

Virtually indestructible 4-die LED emitter regulated to maximize output and runtime

Two output levels—high for maximum light, low for extended runtime

Turbohead TIR lens produces tight, extended-reach beam

Coated, tempered window resists impact and thermal shock, maximizes light transmission
