Comes with pistol,3 Nighthawk mags,Nighthawk bag and all the paperwork.

When it comes time to choose your everyday carry gun there is a lot to consider. You need something that is reliable, accurate, and easy to wear all day. You need something that you can enjoy shooting a lot, because there is no substitute for practice. That's where the T3 comes in. We designed this pistol to be pleasing to the eye, but also to be a workhorse that can stand up to thousands and thousands of rounds.

The T3 has the best features for any gun its size. The frame is based on the Officer model, but for those with large hands, it features an extended magazine well that gives you the length you need to get all your fingers on the grip. The extension also serves another function. The hand-cut geometric angles really add to the looks as well. The slide is a 4.25"" Commander length that affords a better sight radius.

Another consideration is weight. The T3 actually weighs one ounce lighter than most officer size 1911s. This makes the T3 the first choice for an all-day carry pistol.

Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eights Night Sights are standard. The mainspring housing, as well as the rear of the slide, are horizontally serrated to match. This feature also helps prevent snags on silk lined jackets and coats that checkering often causes. The top of the slide is also serrated to reduce glare. A Nighthawk Custom© lightweight aluminum trigger that has been blacked-out using Perma Kote™ breaks between 3.5 and 4 lbs with no creep. When you put all of these features in one package, you come up with the finest carry gun you can own. All you add is practice.

Getting into trap this year and need to load more shells?
If you have been loading with a single stage press and you need to do more volume, let me know. It's a huge improvement over loading with a 600jr.

It is not the one that automatically indexes (that's the 9000), but it's also not $600.  

It comes with 1 oz and 1 1/8 oz shot bars, as well as at least two powder bushings.  I will provide my (relatively) local source of additional powder bushings, etc.  Both bottles are present and serviceable.  They both have plastic plugs and metal caps. I ""lost"" the rubber gromet from the shot bottle after it came loose, fell into the shot partition of the bar and caused 150+ shells to be loaded with unacceptable crimps and 3/4 oz shot instead of 1 oz. The gromet was a redundancy anyway because the shot partition has a captive rubber insert to prevent shearing. The press performed flawlessly after that (aside from some operator headspace and timing issues) until I upgraded to The Beast.  I do have the spent primer cup that it didn't come with, but I ordered as a replacement part from MEC.  The wad guide set is present and doesn't have any broken fingers.

If you have questions, let me know and I will answer them.  I don't know everything, but I got pretty proficient with it and have upgraded to The Monster Ponsness Warren, so the 650 is excess.

This will make someone a fantastic press at a great price. Please get in touch with offers.  

Trap season is in full swing.  Everybody is probably feeling the pinch of paying full retail for commercial shells.  Save some money and at least load your practice ammo.    I can give some help on finding most of the needed supplies.  (I have powder and know where to get primers and wads at the best prices.  I also know where to get reclaimed shot.

If you need some supplies to get started, I can add them.  There would be an extra charge for this, but how much extra will be determined by how much of what items you need.  If it's powder you need, I have it listed.  If you're buying the press, I will come down from the prices of the Win AALite and Promo."

NO TRADES.  While I appreciate the offers, if I don't get $450 I will just give it to my son when he turns 21.  Included is a custom Thiess IWB holster as well.

For sale is a Ruger LC9 the way it should be.  Gun has the RTK trigger installed by Galloway Precision with the Galloway trigger bar, hammer, and reduced power springs.  This is the 50% short stroke trigger system.  Reduces take up and over travel in the long DA only LC9.  These upgrades make it easier to be accurate with the first shot, and more accurate with follow up shots.    

Gun is also equipped with the Galloway stainless guide rod, and a set of XS Express Tritium Big Dot night sights.  All of these upgrades combine to make the LC9 an easy to shoot, safe, accurate carry pistol. 100% reliable with any ammo I could stuff in the magazine.  The gun has the magazine disconnect removed, (allows the weapon to be fired without a magazine inserted.  Highly desirable if the bad guy somehow hits your mag release and all you're left with is one in the chamber.) and the loaded chamber indicator mod done (why let the bad guy know if your gun is loaded or not?). 

Price is $450 FIRM with 3 Ruger mags and a finger extension, box and papers.  FTF only in Jax.  Must be 21 years of age, a FLORIDA RESIDENT, and sign a Bill of Sale.  Prefer CCW.  I don't care if you can get this gun cheaper somewhere else.  If it was that easy you wouldn't be bugging me.  Go buy it  and see if they'll throw in shipping, transfer and the upgrades as well. No trades."

Ammo was manufactured by Barnaul, considered to be the best and most reliable brand of Russian ammo you can buy (Compare to Tula or Privi) . It's steel cased, noncorrosive, lacquered. Good plinking ammo, reliable and not too dirty (again, compare to Tula or Privi). This is also a great case of ammo to be stuck in storage for emergencies or prepping.

I am asking $220 . Call or text at 417-4-nine-6-00-eight-2

Will break open the can to sell part, same per-round price. The price is as cheap as anything on Gunbot with price+tax+shipping (other than reloads), so I'm not trying to be a crook or gouger here. Will meet anywhere in the Springfield/Nixa/Republic area, FTF only.

I purchased from a good home. I don't know how to use the JVC Movie Camera, so selling or trading at an offer it would be hard to refuse.

The batteries need charging and I don't know how to do that.  However, the previous owner had taken some great movies with it.  That is all I know about the JVC Video Camera.

NOTE: JUST THE VOYAGER BAG ALONE IS WORTH JUST 1 BOX OF AMMO!

The shotgun looks great and functions great. There is a *very* minor rust spot on the barrel, and the previous owner electro-penned a serial number onto the bottom of the trigger guard. Other than those minor blemishes, the wood and steel look great. I recently used this to shoot clays at Pintail Point and it functioned nicely.

Sure, you can buy a plastic PMR-30 but it just does not have the cool factor that this thing does, nor is it this compact. Time capsule. It's Perfect."

Face to face transaction in Willamette Valley area only.
From Crimson Trace:
Crimson Trace® presents the MVF-515 Red; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a red laser sight and a 150/200 Lumen-LED light module. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a green laser module for direct replacement. The MVF-515 Red won the 2010 Academy of Excellence Award for ""Self-Defense Product of the Year""."

I have Two of them for sale.  They have been sitting in my safe and never/rarely (300 has never been fired) get fired so I am selling them.  I am the original owner of both.

GUN #1

This is a BRAND NEW Palmetto State Armory 300 Blackout with magpul furniture (Grip, Stock and Trigger Guard).  The upper has a MI free float rail with 3 rails which can be placed wherever you want them and you can add more if needed.  Very thin, low profile free floating rail.  On the rail is a Magpul AFG.

Gun also has a 2-7x35 Burris Fullfield E1 Rifle Scope on it with the BDC EBR-1 reticle...Awesome close quarter scope with long range capabilities...Gun is sitting in Warne High Scope rings.  Gun comes with 1 30 round black PMAG.

***Flashlight and mount NOT INCLUDED

Price - Complete Package - $1,000...Gun minus the scope and rings is $850...I'm pretty firm on my price as I feel this is very reasonable.  I may be interested in trades for quality guns but cash is king.

GUN #2

Gun number 2 is chambered in 5.56 Nato/223 and has a Palmetto State Lower with Magpul furniture and the upper is a SOTA Arms upper with a medium weight stainless steel 16"" barrel (barrel is in between a standard profile and a heavy bull barrel).  Still a great battle rifle which balances and points well.  Gun has a factory built free float mid-length quad rail (looks identical to my YHM free float rail but came from SOTA Arms)...Very sturdy and well built.  Barrel has a nice muzzle brake which nearly eliminates muzzle rise.   Gun also has a Mako hook on the rail for your point hand.

Gun has a brand new Vortex strike fire with mount and has a magpul front sight and an ARMS rear sight...Both front and rear sight are pop up (The rear sight is from an old AR15 I had duracoated so it has an urban camo pattern on it and the front magpul is cracked on the side but it doesn't affect function.

Round count is less than 200 flawless rounds and the gun is in like new condition.

Price for Complete Package - $1,000 and price without optics, mount or backup sights is $850.

If someone wants to buy both I could work out a deal with them on the price."

The 6"" seems much less common than the 4"" - but I don't know the numbers.  As typical for the time, one inside grip panel has handwritten pencil numbers matching the serial number.  Slight cylinder turn line and bluing wear at muzzle, otherwise pristine condition.  Being over 50 years old and limited production, this is a must have for serious Colt collectors and prices will undoubtedly continue increasing.

This gun is in excellent condition in every way, no scratches and very low round count (practically new). I rate this gun 9.5 out of 10, the only reason 9.5 is because it is not new from the manufacturer. Only serious inquiries, low ball offers will not be returned, Im not going to give it away. This gun sells brand new for $599.99 + tax from Academy & Cabelas. I'm asking $625.00 firm for the gun & holster ($100.00 savings). If you offer an trade, please include pictures with your offer.

This smart little number draws quickly with a full spur hammer. Just like its cousins it's a best buy in its size, now in a cool new set-up with Ribber rubber grips and a red fiber-optic front sight. A transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear and the Taurus Security System consists of a keyed, quarter-turn style socket-head screw which can be set to prevent the hammer from pivoting back into the frame, thus rendering the weapon inoperative.
