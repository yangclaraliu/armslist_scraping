‚ÄúTHE JUDGE ‚Äì Public Defender‚Äù; What more needs to be said!?! The newest version of the Judge might just revolutionize small frame revolvers. The Model 4510 delivers the same devastating firepower in a new scaled-down size that can travel with you. The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. This device is an integral part of the firearm and therefore, cannot be lost. This same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems alike (two keys come with each gun). Available in a carbon steel or stainless steel frame and with the option of a Titanium cylinder, the new Public Defender also features a reduced profile hammer that won't catch when it needs to come out quickly.

Consider the RUGER LC9 NRA is a Special Edition, double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull for your next concealed carry firearm. Slightly larger than the ever-popular LCP, the control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. For peace of mind, a loaded chamber indicator provides visual and tactile indication of a chambered round, as well as internal, manual, & magazine safeties. The Ruger LC9 features smooth ""melted"" edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing. With its unique Natural Gear Camouflage frame, this Limited Edition LC9 totes a NRA prefixed serial number and provides a donation to the National Rifle Association with each purchase. It also comes with a lifetime repair or replacement warrantee as well as a custom Ruger carrying pouch to protect your ‚Äúconcealed‚Äù investment.

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semi-auto pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense borrowing features from the M9 & 92, and is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for on and off duty law enforcement, private security forces, and responsible citizens. The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact, compact, and full frame versions. Like the M9 and 92, the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way-only fit for ease of mind. Ambidextrous de-cocking and a positive thumb safety prevents unintentional discharge if the gun is dropped and a non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty.

My father acquired this gun in 1977 in lieu of payment due him for Locksmith services.  It was locked in the safe until last October when he passed away.  It now belongs to me but even though I have a lot of firearms, I have no interest in this one.  Manufactured in 1898, it is the 2nd model with the double post top latch, free-wheeling cylinder, and leaf spring under the grips.  Serial number is located on the frame and starts with the letter ""E"".  The left grip is original but the right grip was fashioned out of wood.  I have seen original grips on ebay.  
I am no expert on antique firearms but I've been told by those who claim they are that the nickle finish appears to be above average for it's age.  Mechanically, everything works fine.  The cylinder is tight when locked into position and the ejector is nice and smooth.  The trigger pull is smooth and fairly light.  Other than that, I have no knowledge about this gun.  I'm not going to blow smoke up your butt and tell you it once belonged to Ma Barker or John Dillinger.  No research has been done by me.
I also do not know what the value is.  One collector said it was worth around $300 but that's one opinion.  Dad said he did have it appraised in 1979 for $215 but then again, that is one persons estimate of value.  Therefore, I am putting it online for $275 or ""Best Offer"". Being it was manufactured prior to 1899 it is a legal antique.  No FFL required to purchase.  Feel free to ask questions or request more pictures and thanks for looking."

I will be passing through Knoxville on my way to Dollywood on Saturday if anyone would like to meet up and check it out. The gun is like new with no scratches, wear, or nicks on it. It has had less than 100 rounds down the pipe. I hate to let this one go but I need to free up some funds. For those that dont know, this is the top of the line for Beretta's 92/96 series, and is no longer in production. These guns are IDPA competition ready out of the box. Some of the features include a heavier Brigadier stainless slide, beveled mag well, 4.7"" crowned stainless target barrel, extended mag release, skeletonized hammer, lighter crisp trigger pull, de-cocker only on slide (no safety), and removable dovetail front and rear sights (a feature regular 92/96 pistols never have but should). With the heavier slide, this .40cal shoots more like a 9mm on felt recoil. The gun is very accurate and a true pleasure to shoot. It comes with two mags (with bumpers on bottom), original case, holster, and 100 rounds of ammo (50 hollow points and 50 fmj). I will sell for $700 cash. This is a good price on a rare pistol. Call or text REDACTED if interested. Im not looking for any trades unless its in my favor and it is worth the trouble of trading (since Id end up having to sell whatever it is anyways). Must be legally able to purchase a firearm. Located in Cleveland, TN. Thanks-"

I figure ammo for .380 is such a pita to get, and so expensive, I will value all the ammo at $70, which is way less than I paid for it, the holster at $15, extra mag at $15, and the handgun at $350.

Tactical Solutions has transferred the innovation from the X-Ring‚Ñ¢ series SBX barrel over to the AR-22 conversion.  The AR-22 SBX barrel is a 6061-T6 lightweight aluminum threaded end* barrel with a 4140 button rifled steel liner and Hogue¬Æ free float forend. The SBX barrel has bore length of 12.25‚Äù with a permanently attached shroud for an overall length of 16.5‚Äù allowing the user to attach a suppressor without adding length.  This gives the user all the advantages of a short barreled rifle without the time consuming and costly SBR paperwork. As with all of our AR-22 conversions, it includes our CNC machined bolt assembly with 416 stainless steel bolt and precision ground tool steel guide rails for strength and smooth, reliable, functionality. In addition, the AR-22 SBX includes a forged charging handle with our tactical latch.   Each conversion is shipped with a 10 or 25** round Black Dog Machine magazine.

The magazines were bought approx. 2 years ago when I bought my G36.  Unfortunately, my Glock was stolen while I was on deployment and it has not been recovered yet.  I've bought another gun to fill my needs, and I no longer need these mags.

The mags are in like-new condition and the only ""flaw"" is the sides of the mags where I carved my initials and mag #.  Doesn't affect the mags at all, purely a visual thing.

Anyways, what comes with the mags are:

3 x Pearce +1 Magazine Extensions
3 x Wolff 10% Magazine Springs

The Wolff springs make the magazines function flawlessly with the +1 extensions.  The 6rd Magazine essentially becomes a 7rd and provides a better surface to grip the gun.

The new price of all the mags, extensions, and Wolff springs, + shipping is well north of $125 for everything.

I'm asking $75 for the whole lot.  One of the mags already has the Pearce and Wolff parts installed.

Serial No. 517889","Monument, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 900,"Listed On: Friday, March 21, 2014",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,300 H&H Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is an excellent example of a almost mint condition sporteriizied  M1917 Eddystone rifle.  Eddystone was the arsenal in Eddystone PA where this rifle was originally made ,,the model 1917 and was a retooled 30-06.  The barrel length is 24 inches long and the bore is excellent. The stock is in great shape with almost no wear.  When the U.S. entered the war, it had a similar need for rifles. The Springfield Armory had delivered approximately 843,000 1903 rifles, but due to the difficulties in production, rather than re-tool the Pattern 14 factories to produce the standard U.S. rifle, the M1903 Springfield, it was realized that it would be much quicker to adapt the British design for the U.S. .30-06 cartridge, for which it was well-suited. Accordingly, Remington Arms Co. altered the design for caliber .30-06, under the close supervision of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department, which was formally adopted as the U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30, Model of 1917. In addition to Remington's production at Ilion, New York and Eddystone, Pennsylvania, Winchester produced the rifle at their New Haven, Connecticut plant, a combined total more than twice the 1903's production, and was the unofficial service rifle. Eddystone made 1,181,908 rifles - more than the production of Remington (545,541 rifles) and Winchester (465,980 rifles) combined.
Design changes were few; the magazine, bolt face, chamber and rifling dimensions were altered to suit the .30-06 cartridge and the volley fire sights on the left side of the weapon were deleted. The markings were changed to reflect the model and caliber change. A 16.5-inch blade bayonet, the M1917 Bayonet was produced for use on the rifle. It would later be used on several other small arms like the Winchester M12 trench shotgun and early M1 Garands.
The new rifle was used alongside the M1903 Springfield rifle and quickly surpassed the Springfield design in numbers produced and units issued. By November 11, 1918 about 75% of the AEF in France were armed with M1917s.  Some American soldiers disliked the greater weight and more fragile ejector of the M1917 and favored the M1903 Springfield.
An M1917 Enfield rifle was used by Sergeant Alvin York on October 8, 1918, during the event that would see him awarded the Medal of Honor. 
After the armistice, the M1917 rifles were placed in storage for the most part, although Chemical Mortar units continued to be issued them. During the 1920s and 1930s a large number of M1917 rifles were released for civilian use through the NRA or were sold as surplus. Many were sporterized, sometimes including rechambering to more powerful magnum hunting cartridges, such as .300 H&H Magnum and .300 Winchester Magnum. It was so popular as a sporting weapon that Remington manufactured about 30,000 new rifles as the Model 30 from 1921 to 1940.

If you don‚Äôt have this, you are not prepared.
For sale is a complete, new, in the original carry bag Woodlands ULCANS (Ultra Light Camouflage Net System.) It has never been out of the original Bag and has been kept in dry storage (no vermin.)

Here‚Äôs what the military says about them;
The ULCANS is designed to improve survivability of military hardware as an all weather modular concealment system that provides visual, near infrared, and radar signature reduction. The screens are made of a synthetic, ultralightweight, water resistant material. It is of snag resistant construction and is field repairable and maintainable. It is designed for easy, rapid deployment and recovery by a minimum of two (four for larger multi-screen setup) experienced soldiers. The service life of ULCANS Woodland or Desert, Type III or IV, is estimated to be 112 deployment and recovery cycles.

There are two carry bags. One is the complete two camouflage nets (Rhombic and Hexagon) and repair kit. The other is the complete pole kit, making this one complete kit.

They are made in two colors Woodland and Desert. These are manufactured by Saab and were purchased by the military for over $2,000.00 a kit. If you do a Google search for ULCANS you may find a few Desert screens with holes in them (for a couple hundred dollars,) and not likely with the pole kits. You ‚ÄúGoogle Image‚Äù and will see them set up. They made fewer of the Woodlands, due to the most recent conflicts being in the mid-east. 

I will not go in to much more detail because, you can go to this website and learn everything you ever wanted to know about ULCANS (and then some.) http://tentsshelters.tpub.com/TM-5-1080-250-12P/ As you will see; just the hexagon is enough to conceal your average pickup truck. I‚Äôll let you be the judge if it takes two experienced soldiers to set it up. I‚Äôm old and broken, but quite sure if the zombies were breathing down my neck, I could do it myself.

The last one I could find sold on Ebay, was the Desert and it sold for $600.00.

It‚Äôs pretty obvious; Desert Camouflage is probably not the best way to hide stuff in the Pacific Northwest, and you better hide your stuff or I will find it. Oh wait‚Ä¶ did I just call myself the enemy? No, not yet.

$500.00 and you will have what you need to hide your stuff from the enemy (everyone.)

You can contact me via ‚Äúreply,‚Äù by home phone in the evening (before 9,) by text during the day via mobile (I can‚Äôt respond to phone calls about this during the day.)

Sorry folks but, it‚Äôs first come, first served. Please don‚Äôt ask to come and see it just out of curiosity. If you are for real, you will find it is just as I said.

Thanks

The Taurus Tracker family includes a full range of calibers and sizes to perfectly suit any hunting adventure. Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to .22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near-indestructible construction. 

Exclusive Taurus ergonomic shock absorbing Ribber Grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.

The Transfer Bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

I've own this shotgun for 20 years.....It's is in great condition.  Just been a safe ""Queen"" for 15 years

I worked in a tool & die shop ...so,..drilled and tapped the receiver,...mounted a Weaver base on it,...(which when the scope is off,...doesn't interfere with the aiming...actually acts as a rear site looking down the barrel..)  I topped it off with a 1 1/2 X 4.5 power scope and my EX used it for deer hunting a few years.  I know it hasn't shot over a box of ammo through it in all those years.

I'm throwing it up on here to see if someones wife or young hunter that can use it.

Don't go LOW BALLING it,....these aren't on here everyday !!!  And it isn't costing me anything to keep it.


You have your choice,.....either with or without the scope and sling:
