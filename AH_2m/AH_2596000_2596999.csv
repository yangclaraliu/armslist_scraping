From the manufacturer:
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment."

Fires .22 caseless ammunition, pack of 1000 rnds included. 
Only fifteen thousand of these were made. These are becoming more and more collectable and harder to find. 
The caseless firearm and ammunition system produced was actually made by Daisy, the airgun maker, in 1968. The Daisy V/L Rifle used a .22 caliber (5.5 mm) low-powered caseless round with no primer. The rifle is basically a spring-piston air rifle, but when used with the V/L ammunition the energy from the compression of the piston heated the air behind the caseless cartridge enough to ignite the propellant, and this generated the bulk of the energy of firing. The Daisy V/L Rifle system was discontinued in 1969 after the ATF ruled that it was not an airgun, but a firearm, which Daisy was not licensed to produce.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models"

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of BRAND NEW, factory fresh and hard to find Beretta CX4 Storm .45 ACP Carbines.  These fun and versatile rifles feature a 16.6″ barrel, and use standard Beretta model 92 magazines.  They can also be easily changed to accept PX4 magazines as well.


I have just two in stock, and have them priced to sell for just $769.00 each  (cash price).


The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of spacers (one included). The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The CX4 Storm Carbine includes Two .45 ACP 8 round magazines. The barrel is 16.6″ and has a black synthetic CX4 stock.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of BRAND NEW, factory fresh Beretta CX4 Storm 92 9mm carbines.  These fun little compact rifles are just under 30″ in length and weigh in at just 5.75 pounds.  This model accepts the standard Beretta 92 magazines.

Beretta CX4 Storm 92 9mm Carbine w/ 16.6″ Barrel, Two 15rd Magazines, Bottom 
Accessory Rail – JX49220M

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

The CX4 Storm, 92 Carbine includes Two 9mm 15 round magazine. The barrel is 16.6″ and has a black synthetic CX4 stock.

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. The new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.
Chambered in 9mm for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, Melonite® coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

If you think 10k is a high round count for quality pistols then this is not your pistol. If you know your facts then lemme know what you got. Sorry to be blunt but im tired of explaining to everyone who contacts me why it has a high round count. This pistol was an IDPA pistol and all IDPA legal. It has some holster wear but considering thousands of draws the pistol does not show it. This is a very nice pistol and very well taken care of. So if you want a reliable pistol, unbelievably accurate and very well taken care of custom 1911 then lets deal.
Comes with whats in pics, Original long trigger, Nighthawk custom short trigger and the WC trigger installed, Two les baer mags, box, certificate etc."

 Description

 GLOCK INC 21 Short Frame G3

 The Glock 21SF has some minor exterior design changes as compared to the Glock 21. The Glock 21 a standard third generation Glock pistol, sports the molded-in finger grooves in the grip frame and a mounting rail on the dust cover for mounting lights or lasers. The Glock 21SF incorporates three changes. The first is the ambidextrous magazine release, the redesigned magazines will function in both designs, but the old magazines don't have the necessary cut out in the front of the magazines to function in the redesigned weaon.The magazine capacity didn't change: you still get 13 rounds of .45ACP in the mag, plus one more in your chamber. The second the size of the grip frame, it is noticeably thinner from the backstrap to the trigger (Short Frame) . The third is the modification of a full MIL-SPEC 1913 Picatinny rail system on the dust cover.

The GLOCK 22 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this model of perfection that the majority of law enforcement across the country put their trust in every day. The Modular Back Strap design of the G22 Gen4 lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size, including the popular new beavertail backstrap. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G22 Gen4 .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

In great condition. 

The SP 223 Billet lower features a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. To ease assembly Seekins Precision eliminated the use of roll pins, hammers, punches and replaced them with custom screw in dowel pins. We installed an upper tensioning set screw, a set screw for trigger reset, relocated and retained the rear take down pin detent under the grip. Our ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. The unique magwell design allows positive mag changes and allows the use of most all mags including Magpul P-mag and Surefire high capacity mags.

This Glock features a unique and practical limited edition Olive Drab Green frame. Designed for professionals, the GLOCK 17, in 9x19, is one of the most widely used law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 rounds in the standard magazine, and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers around the globe. With Glock's revolutionary ""Safe Action"" trigger system, the G17 9x19 pistol is safe, easy, and quick-just what you need in high-pressure situations. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

This was my childhood 30-30 Marlin® Model 336 Lever-Action Rifle and is approximately 29-years old.  I recently had the Bushnell Sportview Scope (4X-38, Mod. #: 74-4389-0) professionally-sighted at Bald Mountain Shooting Range & Gun Shop in Lake Orion, Michigan.  The rifle still shoots ""dead-on"" at a 100 yards and was determined to be in 90% or better condition by the firearms department at Gander Mountain in Shelby Township.  

For you aficionados, the rifle has the ""JM stamp"" on the left side of the barrel near the receiver, which is the PROOF MARK that indicates the rifle has been sucessfully fired in the ""proofing box"" using a SAAMI proof load. The rifle must be capable of maintaining proper head space under the ignition pressure of the proof load. The head space is measured before and after the test.

In addition, I will throw in 6-1/2 cases x 20 cartridges of BRAND NEW Hornady 30-30 30-30 Win 140 gr MonoFlex™ LEVERevolution® Ammunition (#82731) valued at $30/box of 20 or $195.00.  10 cartridges were used for sighting in the scope.  This ammunition is temporarily suspended due to limited production availability by Hornady.

Winchester 534REDACTED Carbine Lever-Action .45 Colt Rifle, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. For 2011, this exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

The lessons we have learned in the field are combined with our lesson-plans to assist in delivering the curriculum in a unique and beneficial manner.  Attending any of our courses will send you out the door with the mental tools you will need to be prepared, ""beat the bad guys,"" and/or stay out of jail.  Our Instructors will make sure you receive an education that puts you significantly ahead of thousands of other residents who have the same Certificates, but got them somewhere else.
We've been teaching, concealing, and arresting long before concealed carry became legal.

It has 4 set screws to hold tension and keep it from wiggling or feeling loose. This is a rock solid rail. 

The HK 416 rear diopter drum is left over from another carbine and I'm just adding here to sweeten the deal. It has a single set screw to hold tension on any picattany rail that you'll find on AR's these days.

Together these would retail for over two hundred bucks. I'm looking for $75 cash

I threw in a Troy M7 shield patch (Velcro backed) as part of the deal as well."

This is one of the absolute best models you can buy, regardless of price, for a concealable personal protection piece.  The quality is second to none with the fit and finish world class.  I own two of the 9mm PX4's and 2 of the .40 PX4 pistols.  To be perfectly honest, I do not know if this pistol has ever been fired.  I wiped it down with a white cloth and it came out clean, but that doesn't prove I never fired it because that is how I keep all of my firearms.  Needless to say, the pistol and all accessories are in 100% condition.  Beretta is actually the longest operating company in the world.  They have been in business for 500 years; yes, FIVE HUNDRED years!  Here is a small example of how reliable the PX4 is:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZzJ-gT2jR0  

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Cc6A_Tnbo

The PX4 Storm 9mm sub-compact comes with two 13 round factory mags, one has a little lip that flips down to give you a larger grip area.  A really cool design for a magazine.  This pistol comes with everything that was sent with it from the factory; both 13 round mags, manuals, warranty card, mag loader box and, of course, the pistol.  I've been a Glock fan for decades and the PX4 is finally a pistol that I think may cause Glock to have some competition when it comes to semi-automatic pistols that go 'bang' every single time you pull the trigger whether you take great care of your firearm or not.  The PX4 will have a milder recoil than about any 9mm sub-compact pistol on the market.  Combine that with 13 rounds, proven durability and superior fit and finish and you have a winner!  Check the prices for a PX4 Storm 9mm sub-compact.  You will then see that this is a real deal at $450!  Thanks for looking!

This Glock features a unique and practical limited edition Olive Drab Green frame. Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 Auto round with a 13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21 pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control—especially for shooters with smaller hands.

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case.

I bought these around a year ago. Lightly used, they were installed, but I never shot with them. For my hands, they seemed too thick for my liking. The factory grips fit better for me. These are not a common type of grip, they were handcrafted out of spalted cocobolo wood (if I remember right anyway). I did not make them, it was a user on ebay. You could say they are rare, because of the type of wood. There's a set on ebay now for $50.

Only shot 30 rounds through this awesome AR-15 to sight in the scope and now it’s perfect.  Hate to sell but need to for school.  First the fully mil spec Palmetto State Armory AR-15, cleaned and lubed properly after I sighted in the scope- Mil dot system and illuminated, really sweet UTG scope. 3-12×44.  Magpul flip up iron sight, quick detach scope rings, sling, 30 round PMAG.  Why would you buy a smith and wesson sport or cheaper non mil spec ar without a forward assist, dust cover, or chrome lined barrel?  This is a great AR with a lifetime warranty from PSA.  Feel free to call or text whenever.  REDACTED

The Hungarian SA-85Ms (post -ban sporters) were imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's for just a few years. Not too many of them in the U.S. The gun has a Russian buttstock (supposed to be Russian, but looks Romanian, bought it on ebay), and upper handguard, and has an Ironwood Design lower handguard and pistol grip. Lower handguard and pistol grip are more reddish (Russian red) finished than the buttstock and upper handguard. The gun has enough U.S. made parts for the 922r compliance. Sorry about the pictures. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. Must be at least 18 years old, or older (with proper ID) only to buy/trade this gun. Thanks for looking.

776,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2596776,For Sale:  Model 1809 Potsdam Marine contract percussion conversion musket,"Midwest City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 550,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 22, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Excellent condition model 1809 Potsdam Marine contract musket converted to percussion in the 1840s.  Marine contract 1809s differ significantly from the much more common Army contract muskets to make them seaworthy.  Marine contract musket has same length .75 cal smooth bore barrel, very similar stock, same butt plate, lock plate, trigger, and trigger guard, and same nose cap band.  

Please e-mail if interested in more photos.  Note in the last photo provided here, it is the upper musket.  The one on the table is the standard army model included in the photo just for comparison purposes.
It differs in the following features.  
1.  Barrel is blackened for protection against rusting.  
2.  Steel ramrod replaced by wood ramrod again because wood doesn't rust.  
3.  Bayonet attachment omitted (19th c military philosophy viewed bayonets as a weapon against cavalry, deemed unnecessary for naval combat and an unneeded expense).  
4.  2nd and 3rd barrel bands as well as the inset retaining springs omitted.  These were not removed at a later date, the musket was built without them, so it never had the retaining spring grooves cut, nor the step down notches for the bands to rest against, resulting in a nice smooth stock.   Due to the lack of the 2nd barrel band, it also has no forward sling attachment, another feature deemed unnecessary for naval combat.  
5.  Concave cheek rest omitted.  
6.  Stock is shellacked for added protection against the wetness of the naval environment.  

This really is a beautiful gun and may have been a Civil War import as there are no modern import markings on it.  Thousands of Potsdam muskets were imported by the Union during the war, mainly to keep them from being bought by the Confederacy.   But some did find their way out to western units, some being used by city militias, and some just being put into storage for emergencies.  

Lock and trigger function properly, and the nipple is NOT smashed.  This one has been taken care of down the past two centuries.  The stock is a beautiful shade of brown with standard wear marks.  There is a crack behind the barrel on the right side, but it was repaired in antiquity."

I have never had a jam or stovepipe or any misfire with this pistol. It is comfortable to shoot and fits in my smaller hands perfectly. The Beretta (sold) and the Sig p226 (for sale) which I listed here, are big in my hands. 

It's in decent shape and the price reflects that. $325 is a fair price for this much fire-power. I don't mean caliber, I mean 18 rounds at your disposal! I only have the one magazine, but as you can see, this 915 interchanges with model 59 for greater options in acquiring more magazines. Thank you for looking and please check my other listings.

It also comes with 177 rounds of ammuniton and that includes 25 rounds of hornady critical defense hollow points, all the rest is winchester white box 95 grain and rws matchgrade 95 grain."

I bought the gun for my then fiance, now wife as it fit her hand perfectly and she liked the gun. Fast forward to now when she finally tried to cock the firearm she realized that it's too much of a chore and I've since bought her a fullsized gun that she can cock and run on her own. I've shot the Kahr exactly 10 times, 10 shots to make sure the firearm functioned properly before putting it in the safe for her until we'd go to the range next. Gun is literally like new, because it's as close to new as you can get without being unfired. I bought the gun for $395 plus tax, and I believe the second mag was $37. Looking to get $350 for the firearm and second mag. Will come with factory Kahr box and everything it came with brand new. Buy this and save some cash for a gun that's basically new anyway. 

I do require a permit to purchase or permit to carry upon purchase."

This listing is for a NEW Tan Kel-Tec Sub 2000 G17 folding carbine, chambered in 9mm with a 16.1"" barrel. It accepts all Glock Model 17 magazines, and comes with one mag. This gun is ideal when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available Glock 17 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.

Specs:
