If you want to spend $1,400.00 for a mass produced AR15, go ahead, they shoot just fine, I have 4 of them, all great weapons. If you want to step up to a Wilson COmbat, custom AR that is built and fitted by a pro armorer, it'll cost you !!!This weapon is just eye candy for me, I have shot it once, but it stays in my safe until I bring it out to admire it or show it to someone that's never seen one, which is everyone that's been to my house that I shoot with.

This is one of the original Seattle, Washington guns -- mfg in 1976 or 77, one of the first 1000 Detonics pistols built. I purchased this from the original owner in Seattle.

It currently has the later style blued slide, barrel, and hammer, as well as the later factory checkered wood grips. The original owner explained that the gun originally shot low and left, so after fiddling with it for several years he eventually took it back to Detonics in the 1980s and had them fix it. The result was the gun's current configuration. It still has the original rubber-backed mainspring housing.

Gun is in excellent condition with just the slightest bit of finish wear on the corners. Overall 90+% condition, this gun has been a safe queen with both the previous owner and me. Gun functions perfectly and shoots accurately.

Comes with one original 6-round Detonics magazine, a Bianchi #7L (right-handed) holster, and original Detonics soft case/rug.

$800. Prefer FTF in Enid area, but willing to drive 45 mins (halfway to Tulsa/OKC/Wichita) to meet for FTF.

UPC: REDACTED37
The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a two-tone or Nitron® (shown) finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom rosewood grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

I've got a collection of Harley belt buckles and matching hat/vest pins for most of them. About 20 years old. Below is a list of them individually and if they have matching pin or not. 
A couple of these have been on Ebay for $300.00 each.
This entire collection is worth somewhere between $800.00 and $1,500.00. It would just take the right buyer that wants them to get the full $1,500.00.
I don't know how to find that buyer. I don't know what to expect here, but I'm not giving them away, I'll say that up front. They are all new, never worn/used.

These were a gift but I have no use for them, I don't wear a belt. Had them a few years, want them gone.
Someone makes a LEGIT trade offer, they get them all.

For the Model 36, they sought to design a weapon that could fire the more powerful .38 Special round in a small, concealable package. Since the older I-frame was not able to handle this load, a new frame was designed, which became the Smith & Wesson J-frame.
The new design was introduced at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) convention in 1950, and was favorably received. A vote was held to name the new revolver, and the name ""Chief's Special"" won. A three inch barreled version of this design went into production immediately, due to high demand. It was available in either a blued or nickel plated finish. [2] It was produced as the ""Chief's Special"" until 1957, when it then became the Model 36. The ""Chief's Special"" continued to be manufactured.

I absolutely love it and the results are amazing.  I highly recommend purchasing a Lee Universal Decapping Die and de-priming all brass prior to tumbling.  I have dug pieces of brass that have been barried at the range for who knows how long and made them look brand new.  There is no better way to clean brass, period.

Stainless steel media lasts forever, and will never need to be replaced.  Need only add 3 tbsp of dish soap and 1 tsp of lemon shine.

(From Hornady.com)
     Since their inception, conventional hollow point pistol bullets have performed well, but have never delivered 100% reliability especially in self-defense situations. The patented Flex Tip® technology used in Critical Defense® ammunition eliminates the clogging and inconsistency that often plagues hollow point bullets. Hornady® achieved this by using the same tip material as used in LEVERevolution® ammunition.

All Critical Defense® ammunition is loaded in nickel cases for increased visibility in low-light situations. Premium low fl ash propellants deliver proven performance, even in very shortbarreled handguns, and won't disrupt your vision. Reliable expansion and dependable terminal performance can be counted on for concealed carry/personal protection.

Constructed with a steel housing for strength, durability, and less expansion/contraction deviation than plastic housings. Weighing in at under a lightweight 2.5 lbs., the F-1 folds for safe carrying and storage.

Everything besides the storage container and 2 of the 4 mags are unused. I recently sold my AR15, and therefore no longer have a need for these items. 

The ammo is steel cased and is excellent for home defense and/or hunting. I shot approx. 1200 round of this stuff thru my Colt M4 rifle before I sold it, and it cycled perfectly and was very accurate and dependable. I can say the same for the TAPCO mags as well, although the 4 that are included area essentially brand new. 

The AR15 scope mount is made from a single piece of aircraft aluminum, therefore it is very light and strong. It fits a 1"" scope and has 4 picatinny mounts for additional equipment (such as flashlights, lasers, etc.). It is brand new, unused, factory sealed. I can send additional information if needed. I paid about $60 for it a few mouths back and never installed it. Also come with an Allen key and other accessories.

The price for the entire package is $300. This is pretty much the cost buying just the ammo and getting everything else (approx. $165) for free. I am really not looking to separate this package. 

Must be at least 18 years of age. FTF only, no shipping. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. Not looking for any trades at this time."

Bought as a back up last year when the future of these rifles were undetermined. Gun was broken in with 50 rds.  For the first 5 ahots a patch was run through after each shot.  Then a patch was run through after every 5 shots until a total of 50 shots were fired.  The gun has been fired 160 times in total.
this gun is set up but not customized to any one person.  Here are the upgrades that have been made to the gun....

the chrome lined barrel has been free floated and an aluminum free floated quad rail has  been installed.  A vertical grip is on the rail that has an o ring sealed compartment.

The bottleneck shape of the .357 SIG cartridge makes feeding problems almost non-existent. This is because the bullet is channeled through the larger chamber before being seated entirely as the slide goes into full battery. Flat point bullets are seldom used with other autoloader platforms because of feeding problems; however, such bullets are commonly seen in the .357 SIG chambering and are quite reliable, as are hollow-point bullets.

The ""Accurate Powder"" reloading manual claims that it is ""without a doubt the most ballistically consistent handgun cartridge we have ever worked with"

It's an amazing job & feels nothing like a standard Glock trigger. Super smooth and crisp with no grittiness & no creep. It's unbelievably accurate & practically shoots itself. Comes with the original trigger hardware and the receipt for $195 & extras from Vanek. Also has a heavy, tungsten guide rod assembly, reducing recoil significantly; original guide rod assembly included as well. It has the ""plug"" installed on the grip for smoother magazine feeds. Comes with a total of 5 17 rd magazines, a 5.11 tactical holster w/paddle & belt attachments, an El Paso Saddlery leather holster & a Fobus 2-magazine holster. Also the original box and everything that it came with from Glock. This is everything you should ever need. I've put around 300-400 flawless rounds through it & I never have the time to shoot it anymore so I'm looking for something that I can at least carry. I have a valid Ohio concealed carry license, FYI. The Glock is kept immaculately clean and shows no wear whatsoever. I'm looking to trade, not pressed to sell at all, but I suppose $950 would liberate everything from my grasp. What I'm really looking for is a QUALITY, CONCEALABLE firearm & I'd prefer it come with, at a minimum, a concealment holster & ammo. I have plenty of quality hollow point ammunition to trade for yours, so don't worry it'll be fair. I don't want $700. I don't want $800. I don't want your Rossi/Taurus/Ruger/Kel-Tec/Kahr/Hi-point, etc. with cash. I'm looking for a quality, concealable revolver (like a S&W Night Guard or a snubby Colt snake model...for which I would make up the difference so long as it's reasonable), S&W 686 or 19-4, or a Chiappa Rhino 200DS, or something comparable to those items. By ""concealable"" I don't mean a 4"" barrel; 2 1/2 or less for revolvers, please. I'd also be interested in quality, compact/sub-compact 1911's or 9mm pistols with the aforementioned accessories. Maybe you have something of equal value that I'm not even considering, so feel free to offer. If you see the ad, it's still available. If you're considering offering cash in the amount of less than $950, don't waste either of our time."

Has had about 100 rounds down the pipe, it is in very good condition but it HAS been carried--it DOES show some holster wear on the slide and the slide release. that having been, said the bore is in excellent condition. Comes with 3 mags and 3 backstraps. It is about the same size as a Glock 19. Commentaries and lowballers will be ignored. The only trade I would like is for an HK P2000 with DA/SA trigger. Face-to-face transactions only. 

More information is below:
The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol design, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs.

The P2000 incorporates features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, this P2000 has a LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system. The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system."

First: I have a couple of Black Powder items, I have one full box of 100 Pyrodex 50 grain powder pellets; these are pressed pellets of smokeless black powder made by Hodgdon powder Co. These were $30.00 at Target.

One un-opened pack of 12 Power Belt Bullets made in the USA. These bullets have an areotip and suppose to make bullets & sabots obsolete. These were $20.00 at WalMart.

Second: I have 4 boxes (100 rounds) of 20 gauge shotgun shells. 2 boxes (50 rounds) are “Remington Sportsman”, 2 ¾” ¾ OZ. #7 shot steel loads. These are $7.00 a box at Mijers.

The other 2 boxes (50 rounds) are “Sporting”, made by Noble Sports of Italy (from www.centerfiresystems.com). These are also 2 ¾ but have 7/8 ounces of #6 hard shot. These are $7.00 a box from Centerfire and one of these boxes has not been opened.

Third: I have a couple of knives; the first one is a Winchester Bowie knife. I have read in several ads that these were made by Gerber for Winchester, I don’t know if this is true or not but Winchester is etch on the blade. 

Knife comes with a ballistic nylon sheath with a hard plastic insert. This knife has a full-tang construction with an 8 3/4"" saber clip fixed blade made of surgical stainless steel.
I’ve had this knife a couple of years but it has never been used or sharpened and except for minor discoloration on brass finger guard (from lying in a draw) it is as bought.

 When I got this knife they were $30.00 at Dicks Sporting Goods in Fayette mall.

I also have two knives from Smokey Mt. Knife Works; these knives were made by Frost Cutlery and have 5 inch, stainless steel, fake Damascus blades and plastic handles, knives are still new in box, and included nylon sheaths.

I was into muzzle loading at the time and had hoped to make new handles and sheaths from dear hide and horns. Knives were $20.00 each. 

I have around $150.00 in all these items, I know I’ll not get a new price out of them and I’m not going to double the cost of the ammo because of the shortage were having at the moment! 

But at the same time I bot going to sale the ammo for $3.00 a box or give the knives away ether. 

If you’ve looking for any of this you know what they cost, so make me an offer on any or all!

I might even do some trading on 9mm or 22 ammo, a bow with 40 to 50 lb. draw weight.

Who knows make me an offer the worst I can do is say no!"

This one is used but in excellent used condition. Not interested in trades. The price is firm. 

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models."

This is a used but in good condition. I took it in trade a few years ago. It has a very nice light trigger. Only put about a box through it when I first got it. Been sitting in the safe ever since as I’m not really a hunter. Only light marks as the previous owner hunted with it, still very nice. The recoil pad is a little scuffed up, it looks like it got too hot one day. I never changed it out as it didn’t bother me and I never really used it. It will make a fine hunting rifle. 

It is priced accordingly so someone can change the recoil pad if desired. It has a Nikon ProStaff 3-9 x 40 sitting on it and can be included for $75 extra firm ($675 total). Price is FTF in the Fayetteville/Spring Lake, NC area. Please use the PM function to contact me.

First: I have a couple of knives; the first one is a Winchester Bowie knife. I have read in several ads that these were made by Gerber for Winchester, I don’t know if this is true or not but Winchester is etch on the blade. 

Knife comes with a ballistic nylon sheath with a hard plastic insert. This knife has a full-tang construction with an 8 3/4"" saber clip fixed blade made of surgical stainless steel.
I’ve had this knife a couple of years but it has never been used or sharpened and except for minor discoloration on brass finger guard (from lying in a draw) it is as bought. When I got this knife they were $30.00 at Dicks Sporting Goods in Fayette mall.

I also have two knives from Smokey Mt. Knife Works; these knives were made by Frost Cutlery and have 5 inch, stainless steel, fake Damascus blades and plastic handles, knives are still new in box, and included nylon sheaths.

I was into muzzle loading at the time and had hoped to make new handles and sheaths from dear hide and horns. Knives were $20.00 each. 


Second: I have 4 boxes (100 rounds) of 20 gauge shotgun shells for sale. 2 boxes (50 rounds) are “Remington Sportsman”, 2 ¾” ¾ OZ. #7 shot steel loads. These are $7.00 a box at Mijers.

The other 2 boxes (50 rounds) are “Sporting”, made by Noble Sports of Italy (from www.centerfiresystems.com). These are also 2 ¾ but have 7/8 ounces of #6 hard shot. These are $7.00 a box from Centerfire and one of these boxes has not been opened.

Third: I have a couple of Black Powder items, I have one full box of 100 Pyrodex 50 grain powder pellets; these are pressed pellets of smokeless black powder made by Hodgdon powder Co. These were $30.00 at Target.

One un-opened pack of 12 Power Belt Bullets made in the USA. These bullets have an areotip and suppose to make bullets & sabots obsolete. These were $20.00 at WalMart.

I have around $150.00 in all these items, I know I’ll not get a new price out of them and I’m not going to double the cost of the ammo because of the shortage were having at the moment! 

But at the same time I not going to sale the ammo for $3.00 a box or give the knives away ether. If you’ve looking for any of this you know what they cost, so make me an offer on any or all! I can send more pictures.

I might even do some trading on 9mm or 22 ammo, a bow with 40 to 50 lb. draw weight.

The Leatherwood M-1000 ART Auto Ranging Trajectory Riflescope is an extremely advanced sighting system traced back to the U.S. Army's Vietnam-era ART scope. This Leatherwood M1000 ART 2.5x-10x44mm Camputer Riflescope is designed by a US Armyimage officer, Jim Leatherwood and has a 3-9X variable; it was intended to be extremely quick and easy to employ out to 900 yards. To use the Leatherwood M-1000 ART Auto Ranging Trajectory Riflescope, all the shooter has to do is place the reticle on the target, zoom in to ""FRAME"" an area of known size (i.e. the 18"" height of a buck's chest cavity), AIM, and squeeze the trigger to ""SHOOT"". It all takes less than 5 seconds, and the shooter's eye never leaves the scope! The Leatherwood/Hi-Lux Optics M-1000 2.5-10x44mm Riflescope features interchangeable modular cams that make it simpler than ever to precisely calibrate the scope for just about any center-fire rifle cartridge - from .223 to .50 BMG.

This rifle does have some scratches and missing finish (it does have a wooden stock), but it was like that when I bought it. 

A friend of mine needed cash and I was working then so I gave him $100.00 for the rifle and thought I was getting a good deal! Then I discovered the open sights were missing, they had to be ordered from Connecticut Valley Arms $35.00 Plus S/H around $40.00, plus the ram rod was also gone. I bought a fiberglass rode with brass ends at WalMart for $25.00 making $175.00 in the rifle.

Several of my buddies had muzzle loaders and I just did not like the raw powder (it spilt everywhere) and having to lube the patch before inserting the ball, forget it.  I found some 250 grain bullets & sabots (I think) at WalMart, these were new to the market at the time and I believe I gave $21.00 or $22.00 for them. The bullets came with 50 grain Proxed powder pellets.

I have shot it a couple of times but really don’t have the sights fine-tuned yet. After shooting the rifle a couple of times I was impressed enough that I went back and went back and bought a packs of 300 grain bullet’s & sabots (My wife’s uncle has seen Elk on his farm and I was hoping to use these to harvest one).

There are 11 of the 250 grain bullets & sabots left and 18 of the 50 grain Proxed powder pellets left (9 shots at 100 grains of powder). 

After buying the bullet’s & sabots I discovered that the #11 percussion caps that came on the rifle were not hot enough to ignite the pellets reliability, so I have replaced it with a bigger / hotter # 10 nipple. 

There is one on the rifle and two new ones still in the pack, along with a new box of CCI #10 percussion caps (might be 6 or 8 missing). 

Other accessories:

This rifle has quick disconect sling swivel studs mounted / made on the rifle, a Black Powder cleaning kit, plus an old military pouch I use for a possible bag along with a zippered camo rifle carrying case made by Allen Co.

Another thing I was planning to do; once I had the bullet and powder charge figured out I was going to cut the plastic tubes (the bullets and powder are in) to make a reload tube for a quick second shot. 

I had also planned on re-finishing the stock when I got it shooting like I wanted but as with most plans of mad; sickness and heart surgery curtailed them rather quickly. The best I can figure I have between $240.00 and $250.00 invested.

I can send more photos."

This one is used but in excellent used condition. Comes with 1 10-round magazine. Not interested in trades. 

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models."

974,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2367974,For Sale/Trade:  Man Cave art piece,"Huntley, Illinois, United States","$ 1,995","Listed On: Thursday, July 3, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Man Cave art piece - one of a kind.                                                    .

Real Aircraft ""nose art"", complete and self-contained on the front cargo door of a 1940's Lockheed aircraft.  Genuine. This is NOT a re-creation. It's from an actual, crashed aircraft.

Items of this nature are very hard to find. If they survived a crash, they are usually exquisitely hard to remove intact. This one is completely contained on the cargo door of the Lockheed. It survived it's crash with just a bottom dent - which adds immeasurably to its character.

The piece depicts a cigar-chomping, stinger-forward - Wasp. He's looks like he's had a very bad day, he's holding a Tommy Gun and binocs, all on a red, white and blue banner.   The lettering ""MILE HIGH HONEY"" is a vibrant yellow, and the aluminum background metal has a clean, high-level shine. 

Impressive, colorful and ready to hang. It retains it's T-shape door handle and hinge tabs, and both were professionally finished on it's backside. Size is about 3 feet X 3 1/2 feet and about four-to-five inches thick (hollow-frame / aluminum structure).

For home rec-room, office, man-cave or business accent piece. It's very lightweight for what it is, and easily transportable. You could hang it with just one good-size nail. There are no sharp edges as the door was originally made with both rolled-edges and finished ones all around.

An un-beatable conversation piece.
