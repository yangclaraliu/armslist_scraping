Introduced in 2008, the P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide. Extensively tested, P30L model has been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

It's a great weapon with a tough and manly feel (for lack of a better description). its .40 cal, that comes with two grip back straps, three full mags, and a paddle holster that is easy to get on and off when needed. I included these pics so you can get a good look at it but if you need more or pics of the accessories then I can take them for you. 

As you can see there are no real scratches or anything like that. It doesn't get used because frankly I prefer to carry my XD. I received this weapon on a trade from another Marine, but have never shot it because I'm disabled and mostly bed bound so I very rarely get out to shoot. But even though the Marines have taken my back out of commission, they could never (nor could anyone else) take the Marines out of my heart and spirit. Part of that spirit comes with a love of firearms. So I'm looking to really love

I can't drive because of my injury incurred in the Marines makes it difficult to do so. So whoever I trade with or sell to has to be willing to come to me in Belfair. I'd make you coffee, shake your hand, smile and tell you war stories if you wish. Thank you for your understanding."

Introduced in 2008, the P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide. Extensively tested, P30L model has been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions."

There is one small chip in the wood where the spent round comes out, and that is the only defect I see on it besides general lwear and tear. The last picture shows this chip.

Update:   I put 100 rounds  through it last week without a problem. Very accurate, very fun gun. I also dropped the price cause I got an offer from a local pawnshop for 200$ trade in.  I'd rather have the cash, but I'm ready to sell it soon so I can buy another gun. Price is now  190$ FIRM. I will not take less."

Description:

Manufactured by the Czechoslovak firm Česká zbrojovka the vz. 82 replaced the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 52 pistol in Czechoslovak military service in 1983. It is a compact, double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action. This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series). The low bore axis of the vz. 82 provides for less muzzle rise and quicker follow-up shots. For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous. The vz. 82 was the first service pistol to feature both these features. The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance."

Winchester 74 - This is a bolt action single shot.
Acceptable condition
This and the other Winchester are a bit older. I don't know the year on it. These were built when they didn't apply varnish to the wood on all the guns. The wood is a simple strong hardwood, fairly dark stain.
I believe this and the other Winch. are both collectors guns. Good condition, and will probably never stop working. Shoots straight. As a smaller .22 cal., this may be intended for use with youth and children. (Not all pink though.. >.
This also utilizes both long and short .22 cal ammunition. Something about this gun makes it my favorite to shoot. Wish I could go out shooting to show you!

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, KNS Precision, Tactical Machining, Ops Inc., B5 Systems, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

I put a tactical collapsible stock and better iron sites on it. It also comes with a Dura-Coat guarantee. The paint coloration is the digital Marine Camouflage. The trigger system is also custom with a lighter pull than most manufactured AKs, and is also a more heavy-duty trigger system which always puts lead downrange. 

NEVER JAMS, NEVER MISFIRES, NEVER STOVEPIPES, NO FLAWS! This beast lives up the Avtomat Kalashnikova name, it will fire whether covered in mud or stuffed with sand. The AK74 is the much improved version of the 47 with a 5.45x39 round which is more accurate than the AK-47. The round is more lethal than the M-16's 5.56 and feels more smooth on your shoulder. This elite rifle is in mint condition and can dump a 30-round magazine in just a few seconds. 
With less than 250 rounds put through it, it's barely broken in! Ready to ship to anywhere in the US for FREE!

492,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2112492,For Sale:  Bobcat BW-89 SP 9mm pistol w/ factory German parts with lots of extras H&K MP5k-PDW HK SP89 SP-89 MP5,"New Jersey, Anchorage, Alaska","$ 4,000","Listed On: Saturday, September 14, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an auction for a used Bobcat Weapons BW-89 SP 9mm semi-auto pistol. It is 1 of the best US made clones of the original H&K SP89. It features a 6"" 3-lug, ½x28 RH threaded PDW barrel. I have only put 120rds through it & it functioned flawlessly (perhaps due to the H&K 9mm extractor & spring). It was refinished by On Target Guns LLC in flat black Cerakote. This was completed on 8/23/13. The Trijicon nightsights are pretty dim now, as they're through about half of their lifespan. See the list below for all of the German parts that were installed. The front sling eyelet was removed by Vector Arms when I sent them the gun & the 4-position grip frame to be clipped. This left a hole where the eyelet was installed (I didn't think to ask them to weld it over), but allows using more forends, such as the B&T railed forend, which would not fit with the eyelet installed. The pictured aftermarket MP5-A1 receiver end cap is included, but was split on the top seam when installed on a Vector Arms V93 pistol. It does not have a buffer installed. I'm only including it as I will have no use for it anymore. The receiver extension allows installing an A2 fixed stock, or even an A3 or MP5-F A3 stock, as the receiver does not have the plates welded over the channels on the sides of the receiver. This will require compliance with the NFA."

It is 1 of the best US made clones of the original H&K SP89. It features a 6"" 3-lug, ½x28 RH threaded PDW barrel. I have only put 120rds through it & it functioned flawlessly (perhaps due to the H&K 9mm extractor & spring). It was refinished by On Target Guns LLC in flat black Cerakote. This was completed on 8/23/13. The Trijicon nightsights are pretty dim now, as they're through about half of their lifespan. See the list below for all of the German parts that were installed. The front sling eyelet was removed by Vector Arms when I sent them the gun & the 4-position grip frame to be clipped. This left a hole where the eyelet was installed (I didn't think to ask them to weld it over), but allows using more forends, such as the B&T railed forend, which would not fit with the eyelet installed. The pictured aftermarket MP5-A1 receiver end cap is included, but was split on the top seam when installed on a Vector Arms V93 pistol. It does not have a buffer installed. I'm only including it as I will have no use for it anymore. The receiver extension allows installing an A2 fixed stock, or even an A3 or MP5-F A3 stock, as the receiver does not have the plates welded over the channels on the sides of the receiver. This will require compliance with the NFA."

The 1st is a Kimber Ultra Raptor in stainless steel. It has 3 Kimber 8 round stainless mags, and a leather iwb custom holster. It has around 200 rounds through it, and is in mint condition. The 2nd gun is a Sig Sauer P220R with Night Sights, Hogue Grips, and 3 8 round factory mags. Not sure of the round count because I'm not the original owner, but it has been well taken maintained, and is in great shape. The 3rd gun is the most expensive. It is a Glock 27 Gen.4 with about $1,350.00 in parts and gunsmith labor. If you want a stock Glock this isn't for you, and if you don't think guns should be modified this isn't for you, but I didn't just order parts, and throw them on the gun. It is by far more accurate, better feel, less recoil, and 1000x better trigger than a factory Glock. It is just as reliable as a factory Glock, and is an amazing carry gun. It has a Zev Tech black on black Fulcrum trigger pad, trigger bar, and ejector housing, which is set up with a 3.0 lb. self defense trigger pull, but can be adjusted to 2 lbs. up too 6 lbs.I also have the pre travel and over travel set up for self defense so it isn't a hair trigger, but it can be adjusted as well to have no pre travel or over travel, but i would not use it for self defense or a carry gun if you choose to set it up with no travel in the trigger. that is competition settings. It also reduces the travel reset of the trigger by 50%. This trigger is super crisp, and breaks better than my Kimber 1911 trigger. By far the bet trigger you can put on a glock. It has a 3.5 Ghost Evo trigger connecter, or I can install the Zev Tech V4 race connector, but will come with both. It has a lightning Strike titanium polished safety plunger with a reduced power plunger spring, or I can install the Zev Tech polished safety plunger, but again it will come with both. I also have 3 standard power springs for the safety plungers. It has a Zev Tech polished, skeletonized, stainless striker pin, with a 6 lb. firing pin spring, but I also have a 4 lb. and 5 lb. firing pin spring for it. ( I highly recommend the 6 lb. spring for a self defense set up.) it has a tungsten recoil assembly with a 16lb. double spring captured, that is 5x heavier than the stock polymer recoil spring, and 2x heavier than a stainless steel recoil assembly, which helps tremendously by reducing lock time by 58% and reducing muzzle flip and felt recoil dramatically. It has a 6lb. Trigger spring, and I have a 5 lb. trigger spring for it as well. It has a KKM Precision stainless match grade barrel that was match fitted by a Master Glock Armorer. It still has enough play to digest all ammo, but locks up tighter for better accuracy. It has a Vickers Tactical Tangodown Mag release, and slide catch, and +1 Pearce Grip Extensions on all 3 mags to make them 10 round mags. It also has marine spring cups for better reliability. It makes it easier to shoot in harsh conditions, and an I-Tac owb button release holster. I have all the factory parts I replaced I.e. barrel, trigger assembly, guide rod etc. It was worth every penny I spent on it, but I'm ready to build something else. I can sen pics of any of the guns if interested."

The 1st is a Kimber Ultra Raptor in stainless steel. It has 3 Kimber 8 round stainless mags, and a leather iwb custom holster. It has around 200 rounds through it, and is in mint condition. The 2nd gun is a Sig Sauer P220R with Night Sights, Hogue Grips, and 3 8 round factory mags. Not sure of the round count because I'm not the original owner, but it has been well taken maintained, and is in great shape. The 3rd gun is the most expensive. It is a Glock 27 Gen.4 with about $1,350.00 in parts and gunsmith labor. If you want a stock Glock this isn't for you, and if you don't think guns should be modified this isn't for you, but I didn't just order parts, and throw them on the gun. It is by far more accurate, better feel, less recoil, and 1000x better trigger than a factory Glock. It is just as reliable as a factory Glock, and is an amazing carry gun. It has a Zev Tech black on black Fulcrum trigger pad, trigger bar, and ejector housing, which is set up with a 3.0 lb. self defense trigger pull, but can be adjusted to 2 lbs. up too 6 lbs.I also have the pre travel and over travel set up for self defense so it isn't a hair trigger, but it can be adjusted as well to have no pre travel or over travel, but i would not use it for self defense or a carry gun if you choose to set it up with no travel in the trigger. that is competition settings. It also reduces the travel reset of the trigger by 50%. This trigger is super crisp, and breaks better than my Kimber 1911 trigger. By far the bet trigger you can put on a glock. It has a 3.5 Ghost Evo trigger connecter, or I can install the Zev Tech V4 race connector, but will come with both. It has a lightning Strike titanium polished safety plunger with a reduced power plunger spring, or I can install the Zev Tech polished safety plunger, but again it will come with both. I also have 3 standard power springs for the safety plungers. It has a Zev Tech polished, skeletonized, stainless striker pin, with a 6 lb. firing pin spring, but I also have a 4 lb. and 5 lb. firing pin spring for it. ( I highly recommend the 6 lb. spring for a self defense set up.) it has a tungsten recoil assembly with a 16lb. double spring captured, that is 5x heavier than the stock polymer recoil spring, and 2x heavier than a stainless steel recoil assembly, which helps tremendously by reducing lock time by 58% and reducing muzzle flip and felt recoil dramatically. It has a 6lb. Trigger spring, and I have a 5 lb. trigger spring for it as well. It has a KKM Precision stainless match grade barrel that was match fitted by a Master Glock Armorer. It still has enough play to digest all ammo, but locks up tighter for better accuracy. It has a Vickers Tactical Tangodown Mag release, and slide catch, and +1 Pearce Grip Extensions on all 3 mags to make them 10 round mags. It also has marine spring cups for better reliability. It makes it easier to shoot in harsh conditions, and an I-Tac owb button release holster. I have all the factory parts I replaced I.e. barrel, trigger assembly, guide rod etc. It was worth every penny I spent on it, but I'm ready to build something else. I can sen pics of any of the guns if interested."

The guns has the safety, the slide stop all working correctly. Also this model on the inside of the frame, what is big and also known to have an internal recoil buffer. I guarantee that if you get your hands on this pistol, you will love how smooth recoil and trigger pull is

It's currently set up at 3.0 lbs. and average pre-travel for everyday carry. It has a Zev-Tech stainless steel polished skeletonized striker with a 4lb. Striker spring, and marine cups. It has a KKM Precision match grade barrel that was match fitted by KKM. It has a Tungsten Recoil double spring assembly that's 5x heavier than the factory polymer recoil assembly, and 2x heavier than a stainless recoil assembly. It really does reduce muzzle flip and recoil. It has a Zev Tech ejector housing with adjustable over travel, and a Lightning Strike polished titanium safety plunger with a reduced power safety plunger spring. It has a Ghost Evo 3.5 lb. connector with a 6lb. Trigger spring. Also has +1 Pearce Grip extensions on all 3 mags, and a Vickers Tactical Tango Down mag release, and slide catch. I also installed Trijicon night sights on it, and I have all the factory parts that I replaced to go with it. You can truly tell a huge difference in this gun and shooting a stock Glock. The mods aren't necessary, but are well worth the money if you want a nicer glock. If you are looking for a stock Glock this gun isn't for you. It's for the guy who wants a Glock that is heads and tails better than any other polymer frame pistol out there right now. It shoots amazingly, and has the best trigger of any gun I've shot that wasn't a $2,000.00 or more 1911, and I've shot them all.

1.) Altamont brand J Frame Round Butt plastic(ish) material grip, black/silver in color, never used....BUT, in the close up pic you will see a line going across the top of the grip that blends in with the other white(ish) lines, that very top piece had been snapped off and I super glued it together. This is on the side that the cylinder opens on. It appears that anyone with the know how to modify something with a sanding type tool could snap both sides off and sand them down making them match or just leave it as is. It does NOT affect the fitting of the grips. It simply snapped off. These grips work great with speed loaders.

It has the updated internals/cartridge stop

KSG
The KSG ejects downward and is fully ambidextrous. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 13 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube + 1 in the chamber) 15 rounds of 2 3/4"" (7 per tube + 1 in the chamber). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

So I had a 30-06 & couldn’t use it for small game and bought this. It turned out to be a good deer gun so I sold the 30-06. This year was asked to go for moose so bought a 270. I only need and want 1 rifle so this is for sale. This is the new one with LC6 Trigger and 3 position safety.
It’s a year old and was used for deer season last year. I shot my deer with it and it’s a great deer/varmint gun. Low recoil.
It’s a black synthetic stock with a matte stainless steel, Mauser action. Rings are original Ruger rings also stainless steel.They attach directly to the receiver so no bases are needed.
About 30 to 40 rounds down the pipe. It was broken in properly by cleaning the barrel at the range after every 3 shots (as I was sighting it in).
Currently sighted at 100 yards and a very accurate tack driver. Very light recoil due to the caliber.
Includes the rings, torx wrench for the rings, manual, original box and safety bolt lock.
