This is my last .40 I'm consolidating down to .45ACP and 9mm only. So I'm looking to trade it as a package. It will come with the pistol, hard case, paperwork, two larger back straps, cleaning rod/brush, 4 15rd mags one of which is marked LE/Gov only for you glock buffs about a $50 value. I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol. Due to this being my last .40 I am also adding 100rds of FMJ and 55rds of quality jacketed hallow points. I am putting the specs from glocks web-sight below. I'm valuing the pistol and one mag alone at $600 and $120-$150 for the extras, I will take $700 cash for the package.

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim. The only change from factory is that i replaced the gray plastic mainspring housing with a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have the factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included.

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured.

Depending on the deal offered i have a set of blue and black Carbon Creation carbon fiber flat bottomed grips for a magwell and an extended 10rd ProMag magazine and a Galco black leather OWB holster that can be worked in.

Instead of selling ammo for a small profit on here, all my ammo will now be sold on gunbroker or other local sites.. I haven't bought a single box of ammo from a local brick and mortar store in 2 years so don't tell me I am taking ammo away from local shooters. But from now on it will be sold to buyers out of state. Embarrasing to see the liberal mentality among gun owners where if you don't like the price you whine and cry and start groups (seriously 55s are you 14 year old girls?). And just an fyi there are quite a few more local websites to sell ammo locally where you would have been banned for this bs. So the ammo will continue to get sold while you waste your time and we make money. Have fun

And to those that want to continue to purchase ammo check out ingunowners.com gunbroker etc. Also I still have a long list of emails of previous buyers that still want to buy."

None of these items have been used in any way or fired.  I am just trying to unload an extra rifle.  I will throw in the black forearms and pistol grip that came with the rifle.  Contact me if interested, and the information below is from the Windham Weaponry for your information.  
Windham Weaponry’s attention to detail and the care that goes into each rifle pays off at the range in accuracy and dependability. It also pays off in the pocketbook because it does not come with a hefty price tag like other manufacturer’s offerings. Externally, there are no surprises on the MPC (Military Preferred Carbine) M4 rifle—it looks like it should and all controls are traditionally placed. Underneath the MPC’s hood—if you will—is where the rifle’s quality really shines. For example, you will not find other companies producing rifles under $1,000 that use stronger parts, such as the pressure-tested bolt and 4150 chrome-lined, chrome moly vanadium steel barrel on the Windham Weaponry MPC M4.
In case you have not already heard, Richard Dyke, the previous owner of Bushmaster started Windham Weaponry after Bushmaster sold out to Freedom Group. Though Dyke uses Bushmaster’s equipment, these are not Bushmaster clones. Dyke and all the Windham Weaponry employees are meticulous about building a rifle as close to MIL-SPEC as they can. Their attention to detail from the internal to the external parts of the MPC M4 prove they care about producing a top-quality, dependable gun. With over 20 years of experience building AR-15s—these guys clearly know what they are doing. 
Windham Weaponry is so sure of its rifles, the lifetime warranty is good for the entire life of the rifle and transfers from the original owner to any subsequent owners.

Unfortunately it doesn't list the price online, but I am willing to bet that if you were to call the Sierra Vista Walmart they WILL CONFIRM THE PRICE, and that yes they had it in stock FOR ONLY $949.00. Myself and it seems a few others of my fellow brothers and sisters in arms are noticing a surge in some serious Walmart gun flipping with price gouging, or like that one fella last week trying to advertise a ""NEW"" M&P .45ACP for $400 WHILE USING A STOCK PHOTO.

Now something like that comes down to just being safe, because IMO an ad like that (where when I asked a few questions while making not a single accusation, just asked if the seller had any additional pics as I wanted to see the entire gun, and asked if it had a case, yada, yada...I GOT NO ANSWER BACK!  Come to find out I wasn't the only one that called that ""seller"" out as I met another Armslister who caught onto the same thing and called the ""seller"" out then the ad mysteriously disappeared.

So first and foremost folks, be safe. Secondly, you all doing the Walmart flipping along with some serious price gouging need to just go away. I don't care if you're FFL or not, it's just NOT COOL to be doing that. 

Okay rant off. Sorry folks, had to get that off my chest as I kind of have Armslist OCD and have noticed more and more of this kind of BS as post panic buying stock/inventory is returning to prior levels. AND for everyone's SAFETY in the case of the M&P ad as I wasn't alone in thinking that there was no M&P, but you might have gotten an Jimenez .380 in your face taking your $400 had you shown up for a meet. Take care."

IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE BUT THAT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER TO ME HONEST.  GREAT PRICE FOR A GREAT TOOL, TEXT IF INTERESTED 7 FIVE 7 NINE 9 FIVE 4 NINE 5 ZEVEN

The GG&G Heavy Duty XDS Bipod is perfect for those heavier weapons like the M-14 and AR-30. It offers a greater range of rifle cant than our earlier models. In addition to a much stronger pivot mechanism, the new design affords 25 degrees of cant in either direction of center. Not only does this increase better rough terrain adjustability, but this pivoting capability allows the deployed bipod leg to be used as a vertical foregrip if required for rapid transition. In addition, a tension mechanism and adjustment knob has been added so that the operator does not need tools to make tension adjustments to the swivel.
The GG&G Heavy Duty XDS Tactical Bipod is specifically designed and manufactured to meet current military requirements. The Heavy Duty Bipod is exceptionally rugged; it will not only withstand extreme environmental conditions from -55 degrees Fahrenheit to +155 degrees Fahrenheit, but will be operational under those conditions.
Manufactured from aircraft grade 6061 T6 aluminum alloy with extreme duty connection points and fasteners, this swiveling bipod for the M14, AR-10 and other large caliber rifles and carbines is still remarkably lightweight at only 17 oz.
Features include a 8"" to 10.5"" height adjustment when measured from the dovetail attachment, silent deployment, fully adjustable legs with thumbnut adjustments, and grip tight foot pads. All aluminum parts are bead blasted and Type III hard coat anodized per mil-spec in a non reflective matte black combat finish. The bipod is equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 rail adapter that does not require tools for installation. The Heavy Duty Bipod will also attach to any rifle with a 6 o'clock under barrel MIL-STD-1913 or Weaver type rail."

Paid $750 plus tax last week brand new for it. Looking for $675 as a private sale. Only need copy of Driver's License & CCW Permit. 

The gun is very nice, but also very bare bones. Reason I'm selling: I totaled up all of the toys I want to put on this thing ... and it evens out to the higher end model I kinda wanted in the first place.

Also comes with a mag and an extra rail mount I added to the front end. It is a B Square fore end rail with off-center tops so as to not obstruct the line of view with the red dot (also included). I can text a picture if interested. Perfect for a foreend vertical grip, flashlight and/or laser.

The AR57 Upper Receiver Assembly converts any AR-15 to shoot 5.7x28mm FNH ammunition. The unique upper design loads on top and accepts FNH PS90 magazines (not included) and ejects downward through the AR-15 magwell. This upper is precision machined from a one piece aluminum forging. The integrated picatinny-style monolithic quad rail system allows attachment of various accessories. A parkerized chrome alloy bolt and full-floated barrel ensure reliability and accuracy. The teflon-infused hard coat anodized aluminum upper and rails guarantee durability for years of shooting enjoyment. The updated charging handle and magazine release of the Generation 2 allows for easy manipulation of the controls. New and improved lightening features, such as the fluted barrel, shave a pound off this receiver when compared to the Generation 1 upper assemblies. The top feed and bottom eject also help to make this upper fully functional for right or left handed users.

It is constructed of premium cowhide leather and made to fit belts up to 2"".  Its unique two-piece construction is contoured on the body’s side to the natural curve of the hip, keeping all the molding on the front of the holster, allowing for significantly more comfortable carry and a narrower profile than an ordinary pancake type holsters.  Compact, concealable, secure and versatile, the open-muzzle design of the Half Holster makes it a favorite of gun carriers who own multiple barrel lengths of the same firearm model.

The starter went out on it not to long ago, so I replaced it and everything worked fine started up A/C blew cold and all was well. Then the ignition switch in the steering column went out on the truck, now it WILL NOT START. I have an F250 so I have no need to mess with it anymore. I used this truck for the last 5 years for 2 of them I drove it everyday. Well I am now getting ready to move back to South Mississippi and I need to get rid of the truck. I have it on Craigslist and have had offers but like all things go Money talks a lot more than text messages and phone calls.
So as it stands the PRICE IS MAKE OFFER, cash or items to trade.
YOU WILL NEED A TRAILER OR TOW STRAPS TO GET THE TRUCK! If you supply the trailer and cost of fuel Ill be happy to deliver it. I am not replacing the ignition switch. If it don't go anywhere I will trailer it back to Mississippi.
Feel free to text me any question or offers.

The markers don't work but all they need are new parts.  I was told the seals were shot because of how old and neglected the markers were when I acquired them. The rifle (WG-65) is an amazing marker.  Feels like a real AR15. adjustable stock, removable carry handle, removable actual suppressor (although the noise generated from a paintball gun is from the body), actual sights--aside from the seals this marker has a cracked hand guard which shouldn't be hard to replace.  The ZEUS pistol is in great shape but the seals are also gone as well. Both markers are .68 cal AND THEY COME WITH THE ORIGINAL OWNERS MANUAL!! The manual will help in the repair greatly.  The gear that comes with this is as follows: 2 soft JT cases, 2 cans of CO2 (differing in size), the rest of my paintballs (500 rds), one tactical vest with 6 reload tubes, various other misc parts.
