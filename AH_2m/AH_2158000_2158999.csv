It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured."

The rifle bare bones with no scope in-converted is a minimum of $700 used.
It wears these upgrades...
-A Russian made po4x24 scope calibrated for 7.62x54 r (ballistics nearly identical to 7.62x51/.308) has been spot on for me. It's red illuminated rare current military retical. This scope alone is worth $250 used
-archangel stock adjustible for comb height (cheek) and length of pull. These are tough to get hold of. Archangel produces them pretty damn slowly!
-tri-rail handguard (forget the brand) light weight & plenty rail space.
-awesome bipod (Harris?)
-pistol grip (assault format) conversion with new forged trigger guard.
-mission first tactical pistol grip with finger grooves and slight palm swell.
-custom tapco g2 single hook fire control group. Modified and polished to fit the saiga 308 model (tapco doesn't make a 308 version)

This gun shoots straight as all hell and is POWERFUL!
It absolutely destroys whatever you put in front of it.

It has been used for hunting successfully and has take 4 large bucks in 3 trips.  
The gun is the pinnacle of power and reliability.  It's not ar-10 accurate but its on par or better than the FAL and G3 competition.
Plenty accurate enough for easy kills inside 400yards. Much farther if you're talented. 
aK reliability with a big ass mean cartrage and much better accuracy.  The saiga rifles are made factory new unlike your average AK slapped together parts kit guns.
I DO NOT WANT TO SELL THIS GUN!
But... Times are tough and I have to see what I can get for it.

Partial trades for rifles are welcome.. And NOTHING in .223/5.56. Prefer semi-auto but not absolutely necessary.
Also considering Straight across trades!  I am looking for a motorcycle. Must be 500cc or higher and must be running with minimal to no work needed. Will also entertain running truck offers. Don't want a car. 
I am putting a trade value of $1200 on this gun.
But, as always, Cash is king. ($1100 cash price)
COMES WITH 11 rounds of ball tip 168gr hunting rounds.
Excellent ammo for this gun.
Negotiable. 
*IF THIS GUN SELLS BEFORE THIS  SUNDAY I WILL TAKE $1000 CASH and throw in a rifle case*
I will not lower the price again!
This gun shoots 2moa at 100yards and could probably do better if you wanna put more money into it or you're a great shooter. I'm a amature and I do 2moa all day long. That man-sized targets out past 700yards and deer even further. YES YOU CAN HUNT WITH THIS GUN!  I've already taken deer with it.  I've seen black bears go down with one shot with this gun and half decent ammo.
I'm only selling because of a divorce.

Description:  Factory New Kel-Tec PF9 9mm compact semi-auto pistol! 

 The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      RAJAC FIREARMS POWEL OHIO 614*208*5444

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

The Eberlstock video does the best job explaining this pack and all the many features: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG0Vic8CS-Y 

It has a unique articulating rear interior wall that allows a weapon to be carried near the wearer's back. When not carrying a weapon, the wall is pressed against the frame to maximize conventional interior load space. This pack also has a built-in rain cover that covers the entire pack. 

""Eberlestock F4M Terminator Pack is a high-capacity, versatile tactical backpack that's equally effective with or without a weapon. The Terminator can effortlessly bear all of your equipment like a cyborg, and there's an entire network of PALS webbing for the addition of extra pouches. This Eberlestock pack has been optimized with snipers and scouts in mind, and to that end the Eberlestock Terminator Front Loading Pack includes an innovative method of carrying any man-portable weapon, including high-powered sniper rifles with large rifle scopes. 
While its sister pack, the Eberlestock G4 Operator, has an external scabbard, the Terminator allows you to carry your weapon in concealed fashion, on the interior. That's because the Eberlestock Terminator has an articulating rear interior wall that creates a hollow ""tunnel"" throughout the entire back of the pack. The tunnel is wide enough to fit any Eberlestock gun case or scabbard into the load case, where nothing but the tip of the scabbard peeks from the bottom of the pack. With rifles over 60"" long, the stock will stick out over the top pouch of the pack and can be covered with an Eberlestock Butt Cover. The orientation of the weapon slot allows you to carry your rifle closer to your back, improving the load distribution of the pack. When you're not carrying a weapon, the equipment in your pack will push the articulating wall back toward the frame, allowing you to make full use of all the Eberlestock Terminator Sniper Backpack's interior space. 
Speaking of space, the Eberlestock F4 Terminator has enough pouches and additional storage potential to hold all your equipment, accessories, and weapons and still have room for more. The Terminator is a front-loading pack; the front door opens entirely, allowing you to organize the contents of your pack like you would a drawer. Tuck pouches line the interior of the pack, and transparent mesh pockets along the interior side walls allow you to see all your equipment at once. Eberlestock has even included a radio compartment in the back of the Eberlestock F4 Terminator Backpack. On the exterior, the Terminator has two large, two liter pouches on the front door, plus two long side pouches for tripods, spotting scopes, hydration systems, or other long and slender accessories. 
The Eberlestock Terminator Full Format Pack also includes a fanny top pack which contains three storage compartments (one for a hydration system) and can compress the top load of your pack via the compression straps. The fanny top is removable and can be carried across your chest as a courier bag or around your waist as a fanny pack, allowing you to take a lightweight survival and first aid kit into areas where your pack can't or shouldn't go. If you need extra storage, you can easily attach Eberlestock pouches to virtually any part of the pack since it's riddled with PALS webbing. The two front door pouches, the side pouches, the fanny top pack, and even the weight belt are pouch-ready with multiple rows of Padlock webbing.""

I purchased this pistol brand new on August 24, 2013. This is a 3rd generation/run version of the DB9 (serial number begins with ""YC"", rather than ""YA"" or ""YB""). Since purchased, I have put a few hundred brass encased rounds through it. The gun is in excellent condition and the black finish on the slide is about 99%. This pistol is THE lightest and thinnest 9mm semi-auto currently in existence. Fully loaded (6+1), it weighs 15.5 ounces, which is approximately 3 ounces lighter than the Kel-Tec PF-9, approximately 4 ounces lighter than the Kahr PM9, and about 6 ounces lighter than the Ruger LC9. It is also significantly thinner than all three of these other guns.

Below is the manufacturer's description:

""Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.""

The SIX8™ weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.

As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge.

531,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2158531,For Sale:  URGENT! Gaston County Sheriff Patrol Car break in,"Gaston County, Charlotte, North Carolina",FREE,"Listed On: Thursday, October 3, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"List of items to watch for below along with link to the actual story.

Someone stole a county-issued gun, Taser, Sheriff’s Office badges and other equipment from an officer’s parked car, a deputy reported Monday night. The Gaston County Sheriff’s deputy’s car was parked at Ultimate Fitness on Westover Street in Lowell.  Deputy Crystal Barnes was off duty and working out from 6:30 p.m. until 8 p.m., according to a report from the Lowell Police Department. When she returned to her 2012 Jeep Compass, she noticed her work bag, gym bag and purse were all missing.

Thieves also took her daughter’s book bag. Police believe the vehicle was locked and someone forced their way into the Jeep. Lowell Police are heading up the investigation, but Gaston County Sheriff Alan Cloninger said the Sheriff’s Office is helping.

“We’re doing everything we can to assist Lowell in recovering the items and catching whoever is responsible,” Cloninger said. The first step is sending out a BOLO, or “be on the lookout” alert for the items, which also include a uniform, bullet-proof vest and a now-deactivated courthouse security card.

Those alerts usually go to law enforcement agencies within 100 miles, but Cloninger said local authorities will ask officers across the state to keep an eye out for the stolen county property. It’s important to get the items back where they belong, police said. “Getting them off the street is very important with the Taser and the other weapons, even the ballistic vest,” said Lowell Police Chief Mark Buchanan. “It’s stuff that we definitely don’t want in the wrong hands.”

With recognizable marks such as the Gaston County Sheriff’s logo and Sheriff’s Office star, the items should be easily spotted if the thieves try to sell them, Buchanan said. The deputy’s car was the only one broken into in the parking lot, Buchanan said. But Cloninger doesn’t believe the off-duty officer was targeted. “Anybody can be a victim of crime, including law enforcement officers,” he said.

Police reports say officers will review recordings of video surveillance outside the gym. The owner of the gym said there’s never been a problem with car break-ins before. 

Thieves made away with: A Gaston County Sheriff’s uniform, bulletproof vest ,Glock Model 22 – 40 caliber with a Gaston County Sheriff’s deputy logo and star, a Taser, two Gaston County silver deputy badges, three magazines for the glock 22, pepper spray and holster, six belt keepers, Sam Brown duty belt basket weave, Gould and riches holster, double magazine pouch, police radio, Gaston County Sheriff’s Office silver collar pins, silver name plate with C. Barnes written on it, Gaston County Sheriff’s I.D.’s, Gaston County courthouse security card and large key ring.

Gun has factory wood grips, but I installed a brand new set of VZ G10 Operator II grips ( on it right now – pictured). I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60). I like the gun, but it is just too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice.

I would say 97% condition.
Box and papers go with it.
Next to go with it is my m&p 9mm treated barrel kit.
Is in about 97% 
I like m&p but I'm more of a glock guy if it come down to it.
Papers and box come with it too. 
Also the extra treated barrel and extra magazine.

Interested on getting a nice 1911 full size. 
Only interested on a 1911. 
Thanks."

Wiki entry for the ARM.
The ARM light machine gun variant is additionally equipped with a carrying handle, folding bipod and a larger wooden handguard. The wooden handguard remains cooler during sustained automatic fire and has grooves for bipod storage. When folded, the bipod's legs form a speed chute for rapid magazine insertion; the bipod will form a wire cutter and the rear handguard ferrule, which retains the bipod legs, can be used to open bottles by design, in order to prevent soldiers using magazine lips for this purpose which damaged them.

For sale is my Model 1903-A3 ""Springfield"" rifle.  It was made by Remington during World War 2.  The serial number indicates it was made in 1942, while the barrel has a March 1943 date code.  The stock includes proof marks and is in great shape, as is the metal.  Both are in better shape than my CMP Service Grade M1.  I do not know what the muzzle wear and throat erosion measure, but based on sticking a Greek M2 round in the muzzle, it has plenty of life left in it.

It is an excellent rifle for CMP vintage shoots or as a collector's item.  Comes with black plastic case, .30-06 dummy round/snap cap, front sight protector, and CMP manual as seen in a photo.  I think I also have 2 or 3 stripper clips as well.

Price is $800 OBO.  FTF, cash only.  Must be 18+, Ohio resident, and legally allowed to own a gun.  CCL preferred.  Not interested in trades.  Not interested in shipping unless it is a great offer.

Buttplate, floorplate, trigger guard and front band have no numbers on them, the rear band has a different serial number then the rifle. Stock is a correct, early, pre-war walnut solid wood stock, there are atleast two “dirty bird” Waffenamt stamps visible on the stock, there is a serial number visible on the stock that does not match the serial number on the rifle. There is a repair that was done on the stock, around the recoil lug on the right side, which became visible when I gave the rifle to my gunsmith to cleanup, the stock was almost black. It was cleaned and hand rubbed with boiled linseed oil, also bringing out the stamps. The metal is clean under the stock and not pitted. The bore is especially clean and shiny, unlike most rifles from the period, the bore is not pitted. Rifling is very good to excellent. Very good original rifle with the bolt barrel and receiver having matched numbers. K98, K 98, 98K, 98 K, Kar98, Kar 98, Karabiner.

that I bought 3 of them (one for me, one for my wife, and one for my brother).
They are solid, rugged, and just about fool-proof.
Well my brother is looking to sell his revolver.
It’s still in the original box and has the original cleaning brush with it.

It’s extremely simple to quickly take apart and clean.
Unlike a semi-auto, you don’t have to worry about a mag spring
weakening over time, while the magazine is fully loaded.
So it can be loaded for many years, ready for an emergency,
and still be perfectly ready to fire at a moment’s notice.
It also has a very simple, easy to use, but effective safety switch built into it.

Bottom line:
This is a very simple to use firearm that anyone can use in a dangerous situation,
without fears of it getting jammed or being too complicated to use.

This gun was used for about a month,
and then my brother moved onto other interests.
So it has very little time on it at the range.

Looking for $250 or best offer.
If you're having trouble finding ammo,
then I'll sell you up to 2 (or maybe 3) 100-round-boxes of CCI 22LR

Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.

This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.

The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.

The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

REC7 Lifestyle

The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance."

Unfortunately, i'm letting go of my favorite firearms. This is a quality build that I hate to let go but i'm looking to start a new project and need the money. I'll start off by saying I have only put 200 rnds through this carbine. It has a BCM upper combined with a BCM bolt carrier group with a vortex sparc red dot which has performed flawlessly and is extremely rugged. Backing up the red dot it has a set of Troy iron sights on top of an 11"" troy rail with magpul ladder rail covers. The lower is by far my favorite piece of this gun. It's a Noveske rifleworks gen 2 forged lower with a Daniel defense parts kit. I will throw in 3 30 rnd mags in. Also, I will throw in 100 rnd of 556 with this rifle. I would like to get 1200 for this beautiful, basically new carbine. Not really interested in trades unless it's a precision bolt action rifle.

 Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. 

 This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. 

 The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. 

 The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. 

 REC7 Lifestyle 

 The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance."

Unfortunately, i'm letting go of my favorite firearms. This is a quality build that I hate to let go but i'm looking to start a new project and need the money. I'll start off by saying I have only put 200 rnds through this carbine. It has a BCM upper combined with a BCM bolt carrier group with a vortex sparc red dot which has performed flawlessly and is extremely rugged. Backing up the red dot it has a set of Troy iron sights on top of an 11"" troy rail with magpul ladder rail covers. The lower is by far my favorite piece of this gun. It's a Noveske rifleworks gen 2 forged lower with a Daniel defense parts kit. I will throw in 3 30 rnd mags in. Also, I will throw in 100 rnd of 556 with this rifle. I would like to get 1300 for this beautiful, basically new carbine. Not really interested in trades unless it's a precision bolt action rifle.

The gun looks great with nice bluing everywhere and a spotless bore. It only has two small blemishes.
