I have 2 nice 3rd generation 6900 series S&W that I would like to sell either one or both.  Located in SE Indiana near Batesville / Brookville and can travel 30 miles or so.  Prefer to sell outright but would consider good trades for firearms or a nice fishing kayak, youth atv/dirtbike, ???.  

The first gun is a 6906 in VERY GOOD condition.  This is a aluminum alloy frame gun with a stainless steel slide.  Compact model with 3.5"" barrel and 12 round double stack magazine.  This model has the earlier square trigger guard and is not as common as the later round tg models.  This gun was not a carry gun and is in great shape.  Very accurate and comfortable to shoot.  Asking $425 or best offer.

The second is a 6904 which is the same specs as the 6906 above but has a blued finish instead of the stainless steel. This is a former police trade in gun.  It does show some holster wear but mechanically is in great shape and shoots excellent.  This is a round trigger guard model and also comes with one 12 round mag.  Asking $375.00 OBO."

The serial# is F537XXX which puts the date of manufacture at 1983. I purchased this through a gun auction site in the summer of 2013 and the seller claims it was a safe queen, so I have no idea how many times it may have been fired by the previous owner. I have not fired the gun and have kept it in a gun safe since I purchased it.

I would rate the gun at 95 to 98%. There's a small ding on the bottom of the buttstock and normal wear on the bolt (from cycling the lever) but I could not find any other cosmetic or mechanical defects. The lever cycles flawlessly and is smooth like butter. Winchester no longer makes the 9422, so here's your chance to own a piece of American history. 

I do not have the original box or the owners manual. You can download the owners manual from the Winchester site. To sweeten the deal I will throw in a soft shell rifle case and 400 rounds of .22 ammo. So 200 rounds of CCI standard velocity 22LR, 100 rounds of CCI Mini Mag 22LR and 100 rounds of Federal Game Game Shock 22LR.

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

From Tapco Website:

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine."

If many rounds are shot the bolt face starts losing its black color (especially in a magnum chambered rifle).

In very good condition with very few rounds down the pipe. Has an extra thick super cell recoil pad (which works real well by the way). If you know about bolt guns, an easy way to tell if a rifle has or has not been shot a lot is by looking at the bolt. If many rounds are shot the bolt face starts losing its black color (especially in a magnum chambering). If you look at the third picture you can see that all the color is still there and looking like new. Rifle has not been shot much.

This is a compact .38  special 5 shot revolver with an Airweight frame and shrouded hammer, but the hammer spur can be cocked back so it can be fired either single action or double action.  I bought this gun new in August, 1984 and it was carried in a padded nylon holster in a purse maybe 6 times, then stored in a dry environment.  The finish is 100% original.  There is an almost imperceptible turn mark on the cylinder and of course there is the wear mark on the breech face behind the cylinder from the spring-loaded pin in center of the ejector, which is visible with the cylinder opened.  Other than that, the gun is flawless--it looks like it did when it came out if the box.  There are no defects.  The finish is as new.  The grips are original and as new.  I have the original box and all original paperwork.  Everything.  I have a 30 year old box of bullets that were bought with the gun and the box still has rounds in it, so it has less than 50 rounds through it in its lifetime.   Anything that looks like a finish flaw in the pictures is just glare.  This is really a time capsule gun and would be a prized addition to the collection of any lover of Smith & Wesson revolvers.

It was widely used by U.S. and foreign military, paramilitary and police forces, and has also been a popular civilian firearm.
The M1 carbine entered service with a standard 15 round magazine. 
Due to requests from the field, the carbine was modified to incorporate a bayonet lug starting in 1945.[53] However, very few carbines with bayonet lugs reached the front lines before the end of World War II. By the time the Korean War began, the bayonet-equipped M1 was standard issue. It is now rare to find a non bayonet lug-equipped original M1 carbine. The M1 carbine mounts the standard M4 bayonet, which was based on the earlier M3 knife and formed the basis for the later M5, M6 and M7 bayonet-knives.

Its even still wrapped in the plastic it was shipped in, box has never been opened, sight has never been removed from box. Its as brand new as it gets. I ordered 2 thinking I would have a use for it, but only put one to use, so now this one is just sitting around.

Info from the Aimpoint website:
A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic
• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. 
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking 
and maintenance easy.
• Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared 
to iron sights and magnified scopes.
• Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with 
Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit.
• Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world 
conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
• Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with 
both covers closed in an emergency.
• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. 
(Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
• Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
• QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. 
Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.
• Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage, 
fingerprints and scratches.

 Probably won't trade as I want the cash from this gun but here are some trade guidelines.
 Open to trades but please don't offer junk or surplus guns or a 22 short wall hanger pump rifles like one guy did and some Makarov ammo (and I didn't have a Makarov--that was a real offer and he said he was only getting rid of the wonderful rust stricken barn stored yards sale bought 22 short pump rilfe because he couldn't find ammo--what a joke...)
 I am not a collector necessarily but I like firearms that have a practical and tactical purpose. 
 Generally, No 22s except maybe a new unfired Ruger lcr in 22lr or 22 magnum
 I like firearms that are in pristine condition and of good quality. I will never be interested in a Jennings, Hi point, Kel-tec, Some rusty shotgun (or any shotgun for that matter.) If this ad is up I still have it so please don't text or message to ask if I have it and never respond--Kick tires elsewhere. 
 Lowballers beware if you ask what the lowest I can take then I will ask what the most you can pay--that's a dumb questions.
 Just make an offer. Don't ask my bottom dollar and then offer less than that thinking you are running a pawn shop and that I am broke.
 Annoying offers may be returned with annoying offers solely for my enjoyment.
 Other than that, please feel free to make any offers you want. I am a reasonable man but I tire of the small percentage of scammers on here hence the harsh rhetoric."

These are hard to find!  It uses steel moon clips for rapid loading and unloading (faster than speedloaders), or cartridges can be loaded and fired without them.  The 9MM cartridge is more efficient than the .38 Special out of short barrels, and range ammuniton is much less expensive (at least 40% less) than .38 Spcl. for practice.  Taurus features a security trigger locking system and a lifetime warranty with all of their firearms.  I am including the box, papers, five original & sixteen additional new Taurus moon (stellar) clips (21 total), security keys, and a very nice Cobra Gunskins black leather concealment holster, which is adaptable for both inside and outside waistband use.

My price is $435, face to face in N. Austin.  I'm not desperate to sell, so please don't make lowball offers (they will be ignored).  Trades for one or more firearms, +/- cash may be possible (mostly ""tactical"" weapons), but I'm not very interested in hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, antiques, etc.  No archery equipment, computers, jet skis, etc.  Serious buyers will provide me with a phone number if they want to talk in person.  I won't give out my number or e-mail address unless I can contact you at yours (too many spammers & scammers).
Thank you."

Spikes Tactical dust cover 

This is an amazing rifle, I have had absolutely zero issues with it. about 200 rounds down the tube. I don't really need to sell it, but I plan on doing another build shortly, so I thought I'd see what interest people had in this one. I have put some crazy tight groupings together at 150 yds and 300+ yds. This rifle absolutely will not disappoint. Shoot me an offer and we'll see what we can do.

I just cleaned and oiled it this morning, so there might be a little oil in the pics. I also filled in the letters and selector indicators with some color, but its easily removed if not desired. 

NO LOW BALLERS, but I will definitely entertain all reasonable offers. I've gotten some cool trade offers so far, but nothing that I wanted yet.

Dennis, I'm not getting your math. One day you got 20K rounds, then 30K and then 24K was the latest. But the number of boxes of ammo never changes.  So either your a uneducated idiot that can't count. Or a liar. I'm going with both. And how does somebody get so fat? I mean seriously, how? It looks like you ate a volkswagen. Trade that ammo for treadmill.  Maybe one they use at the zoo to exercise the elephants in the winter or something.  Your gonna need a heavy duty one either way.
