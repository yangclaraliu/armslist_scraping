 I bought this rifle and decided to go with a bolt action instead.

This is one of the best all-around hunting rifles made, perfect for any Florida hunting trip!

 I am really looking to trade for a nice 1911 rather than selling it, but if you want to buy it the price needs to be $700.00. This is less than what I paid for the rifle and ammo so I don't have much wiggle room on the price, please don't try to low ball me this is already a great deal and I am in no hurry to get rid of this rifle.

This gun is almost 20 years old (19 to be exact), and yet looks like it just came from the manufacturer and landed on a Dealers' shelf.  It's in pristine condition, with only a very, very,very slight 1/4 inch straight scratch along the exact edge of the slide where it sat in my computer desk, and another tiny pinprick dot (1/16 of an inch) also on the slide edge where it must've contacted the surface of the desk drawer.   The gun was shot exactly twice in 19 years, probably the first weekend I bought it, and has sat in my computer desk ever since 1994...  This is old school / vintage bad boy Sig Sauer P228 where it all began about 20 years ago, with its then adoption by the FBI as a primary duty weapon. It's interesting to see that the design of this gun has been so successful that it has barely been modified in nearly 20 years. Interesting too is the fact I did notice a few years ago they did try once to tinker with a re-design of the P228, but are now back again re-issuing this classic design calling it their M11 variant, but it is essentially this same gun, just with night sights.  This gun is to Sigs, what the original 80's era Gen 1 Glocks are to Glocks...

That said, though the condition on this is truly mint and it's barely been touched in 19 years, I could see how someone might hesitate spending this amount of money on what is still technically a ""used gun"" (although probably vintage by now), and so I do have a BRAND NEW HK P2000 SK 9mm with night sights  still available, just check my other ad links, it should be there."

Make: Heckler & Koch 

Model: HK-SL7 Carbine 

Serial Number: 24395 

Year of Manufacture: Modern, but prior to 1986 

Caliber: .308 Winchester 

Action Type: Delayed Blowback Semi-Automatic with Detachable Magazine 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked with a Winged Eagle over “N” German nitro proof and “24395”. The left side of the receiver is marked “Heckler & Koch GMBH / Oberndorf/N Made In W-Germany”, and “Mod. HK-SL7”. The screws at the back of the magazine well and trigger guard are marked “ABC / 88” and the screw in front of the magazine well is marked “S / 8.8”. 

Barrel Length: 16 ½” 

Sights / Optics: This rifle is mounted with a 4 position rear sight that is adjustable for windage and a front post protected with a military style ring. The rear sight rotates to provide an open “V” notch at the first position, with peep (aperture) sights at the marked “2, 3 and 4” positions. The front post is held in with a set screw at the front of the sight and is replaceable. The receiver has square hole in the top for mounting factory scope mounts. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is one piece walnut with a separate walnut handguard, both with a satin finish. The stock has a pistol grip, an inletted steel side-mount sling attachment and a thick steel buttplate. The forend and handguard have a steel band at the front which includes an eyelet for a side-mount sling. The stock shows light handling marks with compression marks on the left side of the stock just behind the grip, a few tiny compression marks on the right side, and marks on the underside from the toe forward about 4”. The right side of the stock shows minor compression marks near the receiver, compression marks on the left side at the front of the magazine well and on the underside of the forend. The handguard also shows multiple compression marks. The LOP measures 13 ¾” to the back of the buttplate, which is in Excellent condition with just a few light marks. The stock rates in about Fine overall condition. 

Type of Finish: The barrel and receiver have a matte black finish. 

Finish Originality: All Original 

Bore Condition: The bore has a small amount of fouling in it, but otherwise is about the shiniest we have ever seen, and is an excellent example of H&K’s polygonal bore which really doesn’t have rifling. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This rifle retains about 95% of its metal finish. The front sight band and ring and the barrel show a few minor handling marks. The forend/handguard band shows handling marks with some through the finish on the top surface, with tiny compression marks on its front edge. The chamber ring, the top of the receiver just behind it and the sides of the receiver show a few minor handling marks. The top of the receiver shows marks from where scope mounts were attached. The Allen screws show thinning with faint marks. The markings are clear. Overall, this rifle rates in about Fine condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly and the swing-out bolt handle provides lots of leverage for clearing stuck cases. We did not fire this rifle. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This rifle comes in a black plastic case with a factory scope mount and rings, two magazines and two Owner Manuals, one in English and one in German. The case has a crinkle finish and is marked “HOPPE’S / PROTECTO / CASES”. It has a molded double handle with 4 metal latches on the front and four 4” long hinges on the cover. The latches have a black matte finish, and the two outside have an internal lock, but there is no key. All four latches show handling marks. The outside of the case shows a few minor marks. The inside of the case is lined with egg crate foam which is compressed and shows oil stains where the rifle laid. There is also a small piece of foam missing. The case rates in overall Very Good condition. The scope mount and rings have a black matte finish. There are faint marks around the scope ring screws and a small compression mark on one of the rings. The mount and rings are in Excellent condition. The magazine in the rifle is blued, and appears to hold 3 rounds. It is marked “.243 / .308” on the left side and “2” on the follower. It shows light wear on the sides and is in Excellent condition. The 2nd magazine holds 10 rounds and is marked “.308” on the left side and “3” on the follower. It shows light wear with handling marks on the floorplate and is in Fine condition. Both manuals show no disfiguring marks and are in Excellent condition. Also included is a factory test target, shot at 50 meters and marked with the caliber, load used and serial number of this rifle. The three shot group was about 0.8”. 

Our Assessment: This is a really neat little rifle. Everything is where you want it, from the bolt release you can easily reach with your right thumb to the easy to operate magazine release you can actually release with the tip of your right index finger. Your left hand naturally sits at the front of the 10 round magazine, pulling the rifle into your shoulder, ready for a quick magazine change. If you were looking for a semi-auto carbine, and don’t need a rail system for holding 4 different sights and lights, this is an outstanding choice. It is in Fine condition with just a few marks, most of which will be covered up if you attach the supplied scope mount and rings. Why settle for .223 Remington when you can have a .308 Winchester and really reach out for those 400 yard shots?"

They are 37x12.50x16.50. These are the latest and greatest version of Military Tires used on H1 Hummers. The military replaced both Goodyear versions the MT and MTR with BFG Bajas because of a more versatile tread pattern that yields better grip in all aspects of offroad use. Unlike super swammpers these tires do great on pavement, they are a radial and made with a much harder material that does not wear as fast on pavement, but does not lose grip in offroad situations. They will last at least twice as long as swammpers will. They are mounted on nearly new 24 bolt double beadlocks with runflat inserts, bolt pattern is 8 on 6.5 which fits nearly all one ton and 3/4 ton axles. These tires all have 95-100% tread left. New these tires retail for $550 a piece with no rims. The double beadlocks retail new for $250 a piece. For less than the price of one new tire and rim you can get four that could be considered new or like new. These tires are sold on wartires.com for $999 at 80-90% tread on the weaker 12 bolt beadlocks, plus taxes and outrageously high shipping charges. I do have one extra tire available if anyone would like to purchase a full size spare with a set. The price is 700 per set of four, which is a good deal for what your getting please don't try to haggle me. I know what they're worth and I will sell them at this price quickly. I really don't want any trades unless it is for a quality AR or AK, I will throw in a little cash for a Colt or BCM AR, or an Arsenal AK. I do not want to break up a set but may consider it for the right trade. If someone wants the one single I would be willing to sell it alone, but would rather sell it in a set of 5. If you are interested don't wait to contact me they will go fast. Thanks for looking.

It has 2 top mounted magazines that hold 7 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells or 6 3 inch shells plus 1 in the chamber with barrel mounted below the magazine tubes the recoil is low on the shoulder minimizing muzzel climb. The selector switch allows you to choose which magazine you want to use or can place the selector in the middle which alternates the magazine tubes so you can empty the shotgun of all 15 shells without switching tubes. This gun fires and cycles upside down and sideways. it also takes beretta style chokes. You can get an internally mounted light and laser combo that is actuated by a switch near the trigger. I also have the Beretta breacher choke that was like 80 bucks too with the gun. This is a fantastic shotgun and in my opinion is a better made and designed weapon than the kel tec ksg. My number is REDACTED to arrange a sell. I am firm on 1,050 with the choke included."

This gun is almost 20 years old (19 to be exact), and yet looks like it just came from the manufacturer and landed on a Dealers' shelf .  It's in pristine condition, with only a very, very,very slight 1/4 inch straight scratch along the exact edge of the slide where it sat in my computer desk, and another tiny pinprick dot (1/16 of an inch) also on the slide edge where it must've contacted the surface of the desk drawer.   The gun was shot exactly twice in 19 years, probably the first weekend I bought it, and has sat in my computer desk ever since 1994...  This is old school / vintage bad boy Sig Sauer P228 where it all began about 20 years ago, with its then adoption by the FBI as a primary duty weapon. It's interesting to see that the design of this gun has been so successful that it has barely been modified in nearly 20 years. Interesting too is the fact I did notice a few years ago they did try once to tinker with a re-design of the P228, but are now back again re-issuing this classic design calling it their M11 variant, but it is essentially this same gun, just with night sights.  This gun is to Sigs, what the original 80's era Gen 1 Glocks are to Glocks... Comes with original box and manual 

That said, though the condition on this is truly mint and it's barely been touched in 19 years, I could see how someone might hesitate spending this amount of money on what is still technically a ""used gun"" (although probably vintage by now), and so I do have a BRAND NEW HK P2000 SK 9mm with night sights  still available, just check my other ad links, it should be there."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a fully removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.

The Nano’s various finishes and coatings are designed to ensure your new carry piece not only wears well, but is always ready to perform. The slide and barrel are finished with black nitride, while the internal chassis is stainless steel and major springs are zinc plated.

Like most Beretta pistols, the Nano has a reversible magazine release button. All you need is a small punch and you can easy change it for right or left-handed use.

To disassemble the hand gun, instead of pulling the trigger, simply press the Striker Deactivator with a small punch or ball point pen and you can safely deactivate the striker system.

Taurus CTG29 Semi Auto Carbine combines the easy aiming and shootability of a carbine with the light recoiling and inexpensive 9mm cartridge. Any 9mm load suitable for self-defense in a pistol will have even higher velocities from this 16"" blued barrel. The included 10 round magazine makes for easy handling and provides enough on-board firepower for most home defense or ranch gun needs. The mechanism is a blowback-operated system that fires from the closed-bolt position. The CT Carbine's upper receiver is constructed of aluminum with an integral full-length Picatinny rail with sights attached. The rear sight is fully adjustable and the square-post front sight has a protective hood. The convertible charging handle can be switched for right- or left-handed shooters. The CT Carbine incorporates a versatile polymer handguard that can accommodate 3 additional Picatinny rails in the 3, 6, and 9 O'clock positions for the addition of accessories.

This is a Kahr PM9 I purchased used about 4 years ago. Installed new Meprolight night sights less than 2 years ago, and sights are dead on. Gun has had zero malfunctions, and I have tested many types of ammo including various hollow points. It is light, thin (about 1""), and easy to conceal. It's also accurate out to 25 yards thanks to a great trigger. I estimate the round count to be less than 2000, as I have only put about 1K rounds through.

I'm selling the gun with the box, paperwork, trigger lock, and two 6 round mags, and an unused inside the waistband holster. Gun is in very good condition, with only real blemish being a small nick on front of slide and base of front sight. 

Can send more pics on request, but these belmishes are barely noticeable and resulted from sight installation (don't worry, front sight is solid and gun is not damaged, it was just a beast to install with a punch).

An additional enhancement are the rubber-texture decal grips I installed when I bought the gun. They greatly enhance the ability to shoot this gun quickly as they eliminate movement of the grip inside your hands. The have stayed put despite being shot and carried a lot, but can be removed without any trouble if desired.

Only selling because I splurged on another, brand new PM9, last year. I decided I'd rather have some extra cash more than keep this as a back-up carry gun.

3.8"" match-grade barrel
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

This caliber gives you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.
The rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

I will possibly consider assisting in delivery of this cabinet if it is in the local Cleveland area. Asking 299.00 or best offer.


Details: This is a very well made solid wood (cherry or maple, not sure) cabinet. In addition, the back is solid beautifully finished as well. A must see! It measures 89 3/4"" inches tall. As measured across the back it is 63"" inches long. As measured across the front it is 47 1/2"" inches long. The depth is approximately 16"" at its deepest. The important detail is to know that this cabinet was originally built to display firearms hanging on the back wall. That being said, I bought it some years back with the intention of adding a grooved base to stand guns up in it the traditional way. It is a little narrow to do this unless the guns are angled...So that can be done...Though if you would like to fit a lot of guns in the cabinet, there is a false wall with a large hollow portion behind it, and it could be unfastened and pushed back to allow a wider floor to ceiling space.

I need to sell, unfortunately, due to bills and life. I sent the gun to the manufacturer to get it cleaned and I have it back in my possession now. Never had a problem with the gun with the rounds i did put thru it. It is in great shape and is really really fun to shoot and cheap to throw rounds down range. Great gun if you have a family so everyone can get involved in shooting. I paid around $550 for it and I am selling for $420 or best offer. I haven't seen it in stock anywhere but i haven't looked that hard to be honest. But the going rate seems to be around $500 plus shipping and FFL fees. This is the Umarex version of the MP5 not the GSG. Construction is solid.

I got it from a death in the family, but I already have a .22 rifle. I put a Bushnell 4x32 Scope (brand new) on it , and added a brand new bi-pod. I went ahead and added a new sling, and buttons as well. Took it to the range and shot 100 rounds through it (it took a while). I sighted in the scope at 35 yards. It shoots true! Out of 100 shots I had about 6 shots I had to re-cock the gun and pull the trigger again to get it to fire. Im guess because it was fairly dirty. I came home and cleaned and greased it thoroughly. Nice clean gun with no rust in or out. I was thinking of refinishing the gun, maybe painting it camo, but I know it's just going to sit in a closet. I have 350 rounds of ammo as well.  100 rds of CCI .22 shorts, 50 rounds of CCI .22LR quiets, and 200 rds of Winchester target and range loads. Maybe you have a kid who would love this! Maybe you'd like an extra gun for yourself. Private sale so no need for a Permit. I will however do a bill of sale, that will not take very long. Thank you! Call or text me at REDACTED

This gun is almost 20 years old (19 to be exact), and yet looks like it just came from the manufacturer and landed on a Dealers' shelf . It's in pristine condition, with only a very, very,very slight 1/4 inch straight scratch along the exact edge of the slide where it sat in my computer desk, and another tiny pinprick dot (1/16 of an inch) also on the slide edge where it must've contacted the surface of the desk drawer. The gun was shot exactly twice in 19 years, probably the first weekend I bought it, and has sat in my computer desk ever since 1994... This is old school / vintage bad boy Sig Sauer P228 where it all began about 20 years ago, with its then adoption by the FBI as a primary duty weapon. It's interesting to see that the design of this gun has been so successful that it has barely been modified in nearly 20 years. Interesting too is the fact I did notice a few years ago they did try once to tinker with a re-design of the P228, but are now back again re-issuing this classic design calling it their M11 variant, but it is essentially this same gun, just with night sights. This gun is to Sigs, what the original 80's era Gen 1 Glocks are to Glocks... Comes with original box and manual 

 That said, though the condition on this is truly mint and it's barely been touched in 19 years, I could see how someone might hesitate spending this amount of money on what is still technically a ""used gun"" (although probably vintage by now), and so I do have a BRAND NEW HK P2000 SK 9mm with night sights still available, just check my other ad links, it should be there."

I am offering a nice Springfield XDM, 9MM, in the factory case with all the goodies.
Shoots great, accurate, no issues. Ready for the next owner.
It has a speedloader, a paddle holster, and a mag holder that holds 2 mags.
It comes with all the books, papers, and instruction booklets from the factory.
It comes with a security lock and key new in package too.
It is a nice duo tone gun in OD green, black combo, sharp looking!
It comes with 3 different sized palm swell back plates that can custom fit the pistol to different sized shooters hands or preferences. Makes the gun more versatile so it can be used comfortably by more than one shooter in a family easily.
I am a private seller, so cash and carry deals.
I sometimes trade, if you have something interesting to me.
CASH ALWAYS WORKS.
I live in Washington, but travel to St Charles, and Chesterfield multiple times a week, so meeting is often possible.
