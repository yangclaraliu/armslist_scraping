It takes great pictures, works flawlessly, and everything is legible and crisp. With the Alpha300 you don't have to go into a menu and scroll through options, because most options are right at your finger tips in the form of buttons or switches, giving you ultimate control over each shot. The other nice thing about Sony DSLR's is that you don't need to shell out an extra $80-100 for each vibration reduction (VR) lens, because the anti-shake feature is built into the camera! It also uses most, if not all, Minolta lenses, which can be found much cheaper than the Sony lenses if you're looking for deals. I'm only trading because I upgraded to a new camera. This package includes:

Sony A300 body with Live View and a tiltable screen so you can see your shot before you take it, and don't have to crawl on your belly to see what you're aiming at. It includes a soft rubber eye cup.
Sony 18-70 AF lens with sun shade and Massa UV filter
Sigma 35-80mm F 4.0-5.6 auto focus lens
Remote switch with manual NIB
4 GB CF memory card NIB
Battery & battery charger
1 Sony camera body cap
1 rear lens cap
Sony neck strap
Golla shoulder bag with 3 zipper pockets and main pouch with two moveable divider walls. Magnetic flap closure. Velcro strap on side to secure extras to the bag. Black on outside with a soft green interior

The Compact Flash memory card and the remote shutter release are both brand new in unopened packaging. The CF card is made using OEM Samsung chips. The remote shutter release cord is approximately 3' long and is useful for preventing vibration when you take photos with long exposures, macro (close-up) shots, or continuous shooting. The button can be pressed down halfway for auto-focusing and exposure metering. Also, a shutter release button lock is available for long exposure and continuous shooting so you don't have to hold it down for a long time. It runs off your camera and doesn't need extra batteries.

The lenses are clean of blemishes/scratches/fungus.

I've put about 800-1000 rounds through it and I've never had a single malfunction.  It's reliable, it's accurate, and it has the best trigger I've felt on a 1911 in this price range.  If you've read any reviews on this particular model then you've seen similar praise.  Reason I'm selling?  I'm trying to buy a DW Valor or a Les Baer soon and I need to free up some cash.  

Has a few light scratches from regular handling but in great shape overall.  I painted the front sight with white-out for some contrast.  Easily removable if you don't like it.  Comes with the original box and the original (2) ACT-MAG 8 rounders(which have functioned flawlessly).  

Asking $600 and not looking to travel outside of the greater Charlotte area.  Only trades I'm interested in would be a S&W 686 or perhaps a Ruger GP100 with some cash on your end.

For sale is a Walther PP in 7.65. It was made at the Walter Zella Mehlis plant during WWII. The serial number (292XXXP) is within a few hundred of known GI bring back guns that were ""liberated"" when the U.S. took over the plant. I don't know for sure if this one was one of those guns. It has the Eagle over WaA359 on the left side of the slide and frame. The right side of the slide and the barrel is stamped with the Eagle over N. There are no other importer marks on it. The Walther banner and other factory markings on the left side of the slide are slightly faint but still readable."

Individual Carbine
w/ Spiral Fluted Barrel

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

If you have a nice 9mm, I will consider that also. I am just not really looking for any low end firearms like Hi-points, or Jeminez. Sorry for the stock photo, but I can't find my camera.

Bought it new a few weeks ago, have only put around 300 rounds through it.  Shoots well like all glocks do.  I bought a Ghost 3.5 trigger connector for it which considerably smooths out and lightens the trigger pull, however it caused some reliability issues so I put the stock connector back in it.  Will come with the gun if you're able to do some slight fitting on it to get it working properly.  Also comes with 4 magazines as well as the box and everything that comes in it.  

I've had quite a few different carry guns and I really just prefer the Springfield XD line.  I'd like to trade for an XDm .40, preferrably a 3.8 Compact, or an XD40 subcompact with a matching number of mags.

Prefer to trade but I will sell the package for $550 if not interested in trading. 

FTF in the wichita area only, however I will be in the Winfield-Wellington area on Friday (11/29) if you're around there.  I have my CCL, preference will be given to other CCL holders.

It was made in Czechoslovakia and later in the Czech Republic . Derived from the CZ-36 following World War II, the CZ-45 is currently manufactured by Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod as the CZ-92. 
In 1945 the CZ-36 was redesigned by Jan Kratochvil to make it easier (hence cheaper) to manufacture and became the Vzor 45 (model 1945) but is generally known as CZ-45. The safety lever which had sometimes appeared on the CZ-36 was eliminated (though a few early model 45s were manufactured with a safety lever). The changes included the addition of a side plate to simplify assembly and a magazine safety. The CZ-36 had a connector from the trigger to the hammer that ran on the left side of the magazine, whereas the CZ-45 has a Browning style stirrup-shaped connector that runs on both sides of the magazine. 
The overall design of the receiver, slide, guide rod, and recoil spring are very similar to the earlier Browning .25 design. The barrel mount is also like the Browning, with a single lug that rotates into a slot in the frame. The trigger pivots on a pin. 
When the trigger is activated and the hammer is down, the connector is pulled forward, rotating the hammer backward into cocked position. When the hammer reaches full cock, it is freed to fall and strike the firing pin , which ignites the cartridge. The hammer is not cocked by the slide--technically speaking, this is a self-loading repeating pistol, not an automatic or semi-automatic. Other than the heavy double-action trigger pull, the only safety mechanism is the magazine safety. When the magazine is inserted, it moves a bar which allows the connector to engage the sear. When the magazine is removed from the gun, the bar disconnects the trigger from the sear. 
Disassembly is similar to the Browning. Remove the magazine and make sure the chamber is empty. Draw the slide back about 1 centimeter and rotate the barrel clockwise a quarter-turn. Remove the barrel and slide forward off the receiver. Other than the guide rod and recoil spring, there are no small parts that come loose. 
The CZ-45 holds 8 rounds in the magazine and has a simple groove down the top of the slide for sighting. Its great merits are its simplicity and reliability, ease of field-stripping, and accuracy--despite its primitive sighting groove and double action only trigger. 
The only design weakness in the CZ-45 is a brittle firing pin (like the CZ 52 ). This gun should never be dry fired. 
In 1992 the gun was slightly redesigned, given a magazine release behind the trigger and a futuristic grip, and is now sold as the CZ-92. Unfortunately, due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the gun can no longer be imported into the U.S., as it is too small. After the GCA blocked further importation, US Manufacturer Intratec started producing a near-exact clone called the Protec, though the build quality is somewhat lower. 
CZ-45's are somewhat rare in the US resale market and go for about $250 in good condition and up to $500 in mint condition. CZ-92's are virtually non-existing in the US and go for higher prices, despite the limited applications of the .25 ACP as a self-defense round. 
The CZ Custom Shop in the United States is planning to produce a limited run of US-made CZ 92's. A prototype was shown at the 2011 SHOT Show. CZ Custom aims to have the US-made CZ-92 included in the CZ Catalog at the 2012 SHOT Show. It is not confirmed if the chambering will remain .25ACP or possibly switch to .32 or .380. 
The modern successors to the Model CZ-45 are the Seecamp .25 and .32, the North American Arms .32 and .380, and the Kel-Tec P-32 and P-3AT.

The guitar was made in the USA Gibson factory. (All restore work done on this guitar was done by a professional luthier, no at home rigging crap haha) This guitar was only produced for one year back in the early 90s. If you can even find one on ebay they go for around $1000 before the restore this one had. Basically every part on this guitar is brand new and shiny including new active pickups, floyd, and tuning keys, it was even completely refinished in nitrocellulose lacquer with a white to black sunburst and had a brand new jet black triple bound ebony fingerboard with the Epiphone E inlayed at the 12th. These guitars came stock with a floyd rose, actives and a 24 fret reverse explorer headstock and a set maple neck. The neck is oil finished so it is super fast. It is still inlayed with Epiphone on the headstock and stamped made in USA along with the serial on the back. There is one flaw on the back of the guitar but it is nothing major. This guitar is valued at the $1700-2000 mark after the restore. I am not looking to get that much out of it, rather i am looking for an AR/SKS/AK/FAL or any style of semi-auto rifle. .223 and larger only please. I would be willing to do straight trade for the right rifle and ammo. I am not looking for a $2000 rifle, probably something more like $700-1000 rifle plus some ammo and we can call it good.
