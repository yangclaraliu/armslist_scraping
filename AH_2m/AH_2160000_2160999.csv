This version of the venerable 556 combat rifle is chambered in the more powerful 7.62x39mm (7.62 Soviet) and accepts standard AK47 magazines!  Included is a 30-round Bulgarian AK mag.  This gun is for the black quad-rail version that sports a full-length picatinny-rail across the top for mounting optics.  It came packaged from Sig Sauer with a new Sig-Tac red dot optic, complete with mount, ready to rock.  This battery powered sight has 11 different brightness settings, as well as what appears to be two settings for using with Night Vision devices.  It may not be an Aimpoint,but it’s a pretty well-built little optic. 

Side folding stock, reliable piston system, this gun is awesome and hard to come by with the quad-rail (also includes Ergo ladder rail covers).  Why buy the .223 version of the Sig556 when you can own the 556 R (the “R” is for Russian)….more powerful cartridge, more affordable ammunition, runs with AK-47 mags (millions of cheap magazines to stock up on).  Now you can own the real deal!  This is the 2nd generation of this model, Gen 2, they worked the bugs out of the original design and now they run great."

 The Factory Specifications are as follows: 

 Item #: P3AT
 Manufacturer: Kel-Tec
 Model #: P-3AT
 Finish: Matte Black
 Sights: Fiber Optics, Dovetailed Aluminum Front Sight
 Barrel Length: 2.76""
 Overall Length: 5.2""
 Overall Height: 3.5""

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

Here is the deal....
I have a BRAND NEW UNFIRED Glock 26. ***GEN 3***
That is the 9mm Baby Glock.
Gave it some thought after I bought it and decided that I wish I had gone with a .40 or more.
THIS GUN HAS NEVER BEEN FIRED

I am looking for a DIFFERENT glock.
*MUST BE ANOTHER ""BABY GLOCK""
*MUST BE A LARGER OR MORE POWERFUL CALIBER (Maybe a .40 or .45 or .357?)
*YOUR GUN MUST ALSO BE BRAND NEW (Ill be able to tell)

I know this is a long shot,,,, just thought I would put it out there. 
Maybe someone would be interested because the 9mm is a cheaper shot for someone who likes to go the range.
I'd be willing to add $50 for the upgrade on a .40 or .357, but no more.
 If you have the .45 I will also throw in a 50 dollar box of ammo on top of it. ($100 total, but again, only for the .45)

Thats an extra almost $300 worth of stuff that you wouldnt normally get with this gun. I am just getting rid of this because I am in desperate need of some quick money and I just havent been using this thing like I inteded to. I am looking to sell this locally but will ship to an FFL for $25. I WILL NOT ship to any ban states or where having or transferring ANYTHING in this listing is illegal.
Local face to face ace buyers must provide a copy of their MN permit to purchase and drivers license. The price listed here is non-negotiable. Seriously, this is the best deal on a glock package on here right now, dont be a dick and try to get it lower. 
Also, I will not just ""sell some of the mags seperate"". That doesnt help this listing and would essentially make this ""just another glock 19"". If you think you want the mags from this so bad, buy the package and then sell the gun, you are pretty much guaranteed to make a profit anyways!"

Lightweight and requiring no maintenance, the polymer frame features an integral accessory rail for mounting SIG laser or SIG tactical light systems. The frame houses fewer moving parts than most semi-autos, and those parts fit together precisely, giving you that characteristically smooth, dependable action that has become a SIG trademark.

All controls and the trigger are Ilaflon®-coated for added lubricity, excellent wear and corrosion resistance greater than stainless steel. Chances are the sig pro is the most corrosion resistant pistol available.

It has the updated internals/cartridge stop

KSG
The KSG ejects downward and is fully ambidextrous. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 13 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube + 1 in the chamber) 15 rounds of 2 3/4"" (7 per tube + 1 in the chamber). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I also have 200 rounds of Underwood 185gr bonded jacketed hollow point .45 super at 1300 fps. $40 per 50 ($0.80 per round).   

The .45 super is awesome, however, make sure your pistol can handle it. I used it out of a Springfield XD tactical with a 20lb spring. It worked well and didn't show any signs of over-pressure or increased wear. I called Springfield and asked them it if was safe to use out of their guns, they told me that a lot of people have without any problems and that it won't void the warranty. Don't take my word for it, call the manufacturer of your firearm and ask them yourself.    

If you buy all my ammo I will give you $0.05 off per round, through in a bunch of once fired .45 acp brass, and give you my crappy backpack to take all 80lbs of it home.

We all, like me have also dealt with rude people on this site who never get back to you or they want more money for a trade???? whats that all about?? A gun is worth what its worth and no more. I have been going into West Coast Armory lately and found that they will sell you a brand new gun for pennies more than the used guns on this site. If they dont have it they will order it for you with a friendly smile to boot. So people get real with your prices you are never going to get every nickel you put into your gun that is unless you find a dumb ass who doesnt know a thing about guns or if you really do have a rare special gun. Out of the many guns I have tried to buy  or inquire about here maybe 20% arent rude jerks who think they and there gun is special.
So do your self a favor and check out The friendly people and guns at West Coast Armory. In the long run you could save time and money."

The �Bullpup� design maintained its short overall length, without influencing the barrel length, to meet or exceed required accuracy standards. The STEYR AUG A3 features a number of Picatinny rails (Mil. Std. 1913 rails), which allow the quick and easy mounting of various accessories, such as illumination and target acquisition devices, including a variety of optics or night vision devices.

LWRC
M6-IC Enhanced
16"" Black

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

The Enhanced rifles features a spiral fluted barrel, 2 position adjustable gas piston, and a bayonet lug.

(Cerakoted rifle and plain M6-IC in picture is for representation only. Our M6-IC Spiral Fluted Enhanced is black only and does have the fluted barrel)


Ohio residents add 7.25% sales tax. Can be picked up in person by appointment or shipped to an FFL in your area for $8.99 if needed.

This caliber gives you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots. 
The  rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

Only maybe 50 rounds put through it at the most. In great shape with box and 2 10 round mags. I don't want to sell it but I have medical bills to pay.
The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market.
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."

About the ammo: 
People are pretty lucky to get any 22lr these days, but this is some of the best ammo to get. It does smoke a bit more than others, but will cycle any semi-auto and doesn't have near as many ftf as other types of ammo. Personally, over 4k rounds of this stuff shot in the last year or so and only 2 rounds failed to fire; used in several different guns."

This rifle is in good shape, only some scratches on the finish that were htere when I bought it. Its a century build on a nodak spud receiver with a G2 trigger. All serial numbers match and this rifle dosnt have key hole issues, it shoots like a dream and is surprisingly accurate.

I do not have the original wire folding stock, but it does have a really nice telescopic stock on it (this is not a cheap plastic one, the tube is machined aluminum and it is very well made. forgive me for not remembering brand name). I also have 1,000 +/- rounds of 7n6 steel core surplus ammo, 2 original steel & polymer tantal mags, 4 tapco ak-74 30rnd mags, a hard plastic case, and a few other odds and ends (ergonomic pistol grip, and handgaurd with rails along with their original counterparts.)

I want to trade up for something in 7.62x39, I am not really looking for an SKS unless it is one of the ones that takes AK-47 mags (SKS type D or M I believe). I would prefer a higher end AK-47 or even one of those PAP AK-47 pistols.

This is a package deal, so I am not willing to sell just the rifle or just the ammo. Send me an e-mail if interested and I can send pictures upon request. I may entertain cash offers if they are good.  I expect you to have a valid FOID and to fill out a proper transfer record for both of our records (see back of FOID card)."

This is the last year they called these just the pickup before switching to the Tacoma model name. This one has 166,000 miles on the original 4 cylinder 22RE motor and 5 speed transmission. The motor is in great shape and just had the belts replaced and fluids topped off and oil changed. The transmission shifts smoothly with no grinding. The timing chain was replaced at 130,000 miles. The clutch has plenty of life left. The interior is in good shape. The seats have been replaced with some bucket seats out of a Toyota Celica. There is an aftermarket CD player with an aux. input. The doors had the vinyl covering removed so the speakers could be installed and the vinyl was never put back on. The A/C blows ice cold. There is an aftermarket bed cover/cap installed. The tires are BRAND NEW 70,000 mile Hankooks. They were installed 3 weeks ago and cost 450$. The brakes work great. The truck was originally black and was painted white by the previous owner. Both side mirrors are missing and the blinker on the front passenger side is missing. The low and high beams work great. The driver's door has to be opened using the outside handle as the inside one is disconnected. Car has aftermarket floor mats, steering wheel cover, and center console/cupholder. This truck runs great. It's been my daily driver for a while now but I bought a new car and now need to sell the truck. This truck has tons of life left in it and would make a perfect work truck, hunting truck, or first vehicle. Comes with two used spare tires, one is already on a rim. Also included is a Haynes manual for these trucks. Looking to trade for pistols, with or without cash, over/under shotgun with or without cash, maybe nice guitars. Call Quinn at 864-354-0566."
