All matching numbers on frame, slide, barrel, barrel cap and on one of the 2 magazines.
Matching numbered magazine also has a 1 stamped on it, the other magazine is not matching numbered but stamped with number 2, so it probably has always been with the pistol.

Serial number is correct to be part of the 2nd contract pistol shipment sold to Nazi Germany by Spain but never shipped because of the allied invasion of France. 
After WW II Spain sold this gun with many others for a second time to Germany. 
This time to the West German police force and it is appropriately marked LBPN which indicates Lower Saxony Barracks Police ended up with it in their arsenal. 
This is an excellent pistol with a lot of history, I can only guess how it made it to the US after WW II. 
It will make a great addition to any collection.

The M24 series is a line of Mauser pattern bolt-action battle rifles produced for use by the Yugoslavian military. They are similar to the Czech vz. 24 rifle, featuring open sights, 8x57mm IS chambering, carbine-length barrels, hardwood stocks, and straight bolt handles. All M24 series weapons are designed to accept the M-24/48 pattern bayonet.[1]



THe first Mauser-pattern rifle produced in Yugoslavia was the M24. Its predecessor, the FN Model 1924 had been produced for the Yugoslav army by FN Herstal until the Ministry and FN signed a contract on the purchase of the licence for production of rifles 7.9 mm M 24. Nearly all M24's were produced either before or during World War II, at the Kragujevac Arsenal plant. The M24 and Model 1924 are nearly identical.[2]

The final additions to the M24 family were the M24/47 and M24/52 rifles. Both were produced by reworking existing prewar Model 1924 rifles after World War II at the Zastava Arms (formally Kragujevac Arsenal) plant, which was at that time under the control of the postwar communist government. ""47"" and ""52"" indicate the beginning of the rebuild program for each respective model: 1947 for the M24/47 and 1952 for the M24/52. One common misconception is that the M24/47 rifles were produced only in 1947; actually, the rebuild program lasted into the early 1950s alongside new production of M48 rifles. Minor cosmetic differences exist between the M24/47 and M24/52, but the rifles are nearly identical to one another and to their predecessors, the Model 1924 and M24.[3]

M24 series rifles were used by the Royal Yugoslav Army and the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II.

If you are looking for an all encompassing 1911, one that will fill just about every role that you would need a 1911 for, then the Talon family should be the first place you look. It will become very plain to see that this family not only has everything you need, but also offers the most value for your money.  It’s no surprise to us, because that is exactly what we had in mind when we laid out the list of features that come standard on every one of them.  The 5"" version has been a favorite of law enforcement ever since we introduced it. Its rock solid reliability, inherent accuracy and ruggedness have made it a big hit wherever officers carry a 1911. Its common for us to hear reports of thousands and thousands of rounds being fired without a single malfunction, as well as highly improved officer qualification scores.  Matt Sims, a CDP Master in IDPA, consistently ranks in the top five in the nation, and has won countless matches, all using his standard 5"" Talon that is exactly like the one listed here.
If you are looking for a 1911 that already comes with the best of everything, the Talon is the gun you want.  It's about fit. It's about finish. It's about value. It's the classic style of the gunsmith's art form. The Talon is the embodiment of everything you love about a 1911.

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

Using the book ( Winchester Slide-Action on 1890's & 1906's by Ned Schwing ) for information. The wood is from a very early 1906. The barrel marking is the 6th and a series of 7 markings. The barrel has the proof marking to show it has been rebarreled at the factory and has the crowned barrel done post WWII 06's. Has the 62 receiver that the very last 06's had with no Winchester marking on the tang.

Kholsters are made with Top Quality Leather and durable Kydex. The leather on the body side makes them VERY comfortable - even against bare skin. The Kydex is extremely durable and forms well to the firearm providing superior retention that will last.   All Kholsters come with smartly crafted “Over the Belt” clips to secure the holster on your belt while allowing you to tuck in your shirt for maximum concealment. The Belt clips also adjust to allow almost any cant angle or holster depth while keeping your gun comfortably and safely tucked away all day. Kholster holsters are so comfortable, you will forget you are wearing one.

Gun is in excellent condition considering the age. All serial numbers on the gun match; the barrel, frame, cylinder and ejector star. The grips are SN 73517 so just a few years off, but period correct. These grips are $200+ alone Transitional features: Old style hammer, satin blue, 'Made In USA' one-liner, large S&W logo on right side, five screw frame, larger ejector rod tip with appropriate cutout. 
Lockup and timing are solid, as they should be. Grips are in very good condition, with no major chips. There is a slight amount of holster wear as can be seen, but there are little signs of firing. No torch cutting or other signs of damage near the cone area. Backstrap has some light wear. Handling marks are present in a few places, mainly on the high edges. Still a very nice, fully functioning example of a scarce model with a rich history made just after WWII. No factory work dates, and no evidence the pistol has been altered in any way. The finish is original."

Not only is the handgun completely covered and concealed, but the gun carrier can casually place a hand on the holstered/pocketed pistol if a nonspecific threat materializes and the fastest draw is to have the gun already in hand.

 This premium horsehide pocket holster is designed for front pocket carry in pants or a jacket. It keeps the firearm in the same general position so you can quickly locate the grip when you need to draw.

 It also conceals the shape of the gun so that its outline is not printed through the pants.With practice (using an unloaded firearm) you can draw the firearm while the holster remains in your pocket or falls away (in the proper pants).

 It's made with smooth leather inside against the gun for easy release and the rough side out against the pocket, for retention of holster in the pocket. This is a $64.95 holster, I am selling mine for $20.00.

Will consider all offers. We can work out a deal with cash and partial trades if you like.
I unfortunately I won't drop the price below 900 (unless a trade is involved). This retails for 1300 plus tax and shipping and Handling. Not to mention the 7 week waiting period for it.

You must meet in Oak Harbor, Coupeville, Anacortes, or Burlington. Maybe further for a good deal.

I have for sale a in the box  my SR9c compact pistol Model Number: 3313/Caliber: 9mm Luger. Brushed Stainless.  



It comes with three magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. Two of the magazines holds 10 rounds and features finger grip extension floor plate. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. Also include magazine loading tool, box and all the paperwork from Ruger. 



This is a full size handgun.



The weapon is super clean and operations perfect. This gun has no wear marks or scratches, she is clean!



The gun weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. Delivering the same low-maintenance, rugged reliability as the full sized SR9, the lightweight Ruger SR9c 9mm Luger Compact Pistol packs the features today's shooters demand into a compact package. Perfectly balanced for comfortable and controlled shooting, the SR9c features the same slim, ergonomic grip, narrow slide, and short reach from the blackstrap to the trigger as its larger predecessor.



The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. The structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame features a built-in Picatinny rail for modern handgun accessories.  Adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system provides quick and easy target acquisition with adjustment for elevation and windage.



Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator. 



The SR9c was the 2010 hand gun of the year, awarded by Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence for the third straight year.

This is a Completely Legal classes for which you can submit your paperwork to the appropriate State authorities and obtain your carry permits with my training... 

I have been doing this for a long time: (over 1,000 students trained between our instructors) I have heard the horror stories from other clients.. There are instructors giving Cut-Rate and Questionable classes. Some of my Competitors give you Lunch or other gimmicks and charge $100.. Or say they charge less, until you have to pay a Range Fee. Or have to buy their ammunition.. etc..
* My philosophy is to not price gouge you out of your permit to carry. Providing you a low cost (not cut rate) class, and not charge you every time you turn around. Semi-Automatic, Preferably a Double stack 10 round magazine (NO REVOLVERS) We're just putting holes in paper 
Classes are held up-to-DAILY, (Generally on Saturdays & Sundays noon and Week days 8 or 9 am and again at 5pm) but I will do a class on other days/Times. I Also do individual classes but prefer that you bring a few others with you to make it more worthwhile for me... (I thank you in advance)

Check out my website for additional information;
www.bahrindustries.com/carry.html
If You want me to Leave the Pine City Area to do a class, I can certainly do that, but I may charge up to $100 depending on number of occupants attending the class.. 
(the reason is I have to rent a building to hold the class, and also rent a range, it's certainly not worthwhile for me to leave my scheduled area to do a class. Typically the student is saving upwards of $50 by going to my classes, most all instructors charge $120 and up, I've seen $200) 

It is really easiest to contact me directly, and we can discuss this.
