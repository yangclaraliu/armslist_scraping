It is an AMAZING weapon to shoot, and is scary accurate. It also features BRIGHT siglite night sights, and I will include a second set of houge handall grips. 

I will include one extended magazine, factory OEM box, and perhaps a holster, depending on the deal, as my 226 also fits the holster I use. It is a K Rounds concealment system, straight drop with adjustable retention. The MSRP via sigs website is over 1200.00!

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR

This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart

Bought for a build that I never got around to finishing. The lower is Mil-spec forged aluminum with Mil-spec internals. For those of you who may not know, Anderson Manufacturing is one of the premier names in AR15/M4 style rifles. As a matter of fact, several ""big name"" AR15 manufacturers have, or still do, use re-branded Anderson lowers on their products. The finish and tolerances on these lower receivers are 2nd to none. This is a factory 1st lower....NOT a ""BLEM"" or Blemished factory 2nd with cosmetic issues. 

This complete lower has the PSA LPK (excellent trigger) with the upgraded BlackHawk adjustable butt-stock and pistol grip. It is ready to mount to any compatible upper and head to the range. It is brand new and unfired. 

To purchase you must be at least 18 and have a valid DL or ID to prove it. FTF only, not shipping. Can meet in the Akron area. CCW (like myself) preferred. Not really looking for any trades at this time. 

Price is $250."

It was back in 1975 when the pistol was officially presented as the Model 92. The first military adoption is made by the Italian CONSUBIN (the Italian Navy ""SEAL"" teams) and from the Brazilian Army (1975/76). From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. What sets it apart from the 92FS is: A. Distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number(M9-0001 through 2010) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols. C. ""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the M9.

This is one of the last imports on this particular rifle since now they are no longer being imported. Tapco G2 trigger on it as well as a hogue grip. It has a wire stock side folder. It is light weight and heavy duty. This is the perfect AK to sbr and have some fun with. Lots of mods out there for this rifle as well. Read the reviews about this rifle. You WILL fall in love.

Instructions included but youtube worked best for me.  If you are looking to add a muzzle device to a AK or SKS this is the right tool for the job.  Remember this is a LEFT HAND THREAD so your muzzle device must also be left hand thread.  The thread alignment tool is a real life saver on assuring nice straight threading.

It was back in 1975 when the pistol was officially presented as the Model 92. The first military adoption is made by the Italian CONSUBIN (the Italian Navy ""SEAL"" teams) and from the Brazilian Army (1975/76). From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. What sets it apart from the 92FS is: A. Distinctive military style markings on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols. B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number(M9-0001 through 2010) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols. C. ""Dot-and-Post"" sight system clones that of the M9.

Well, here is the pistol that Mr. B used to great advantage in the never-ending war of good versus evil.....The Wildey Semi-Automatic Pistol !! This is a rare example of the Wildey Hunter grade “Auto-Loading Pistol” chambered in the .45 Winchester Magnum. The Wildey was the first gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol. As you may know, the Winchester .45 Magnum outperforms the .44 Magnum and is capable in semi-automatics of muzzle velocities varying from ~1445fps for 225 grain bullets to ~1200 fps for 300 grain bullets. Intended for serious big game hunters, this massive handgun weighs approximately 4 1/2 pounds with a fully loaded 7 shot magazine. This Wildey is a double action/single action, gas operated, stainless steel constructed pistol capable of consistent, reliable operation with heavy or light loads for the specific caliber for which it is chambered. Using a patented gas system consisting of an air-hydraulic piston powered by the firing gases through six small holes in the barrel. This piston forces the slide rearward, initiating the operation (cycling) of the pistol. Opening or closing the gas regulator adjusts the degree of “kick” the pistol gives the slide. The smaller the kick, the slower the slide moves. The harder the kick, the faster the slide moves. Normally in today’s market the Wildey pistols offered are the Survivor model in polished stainless steel. This Wildey is the much more rare Hunter version with matte stainless steel finish. As such, this Wildey Hunter features the following: matte finish stainless steel construction (frame, slide and barrel); a matte vent rib on an 8 inch barrel (somewhat rare these days); a blade front and adjustable rear sights; a box frame 7 shot magazine; a wide, serrated trigger; a wide checkered hammer; and attractively figured and checkered wood grips. This is one of the first Wildey pistols produced with the “Wildey Firearms Company Inc. / Cheshire, Connecticut” stamping on the right side of the receiver and a “45” prefix serial number. To make this offering even better, this Hunter comes with a red velvet lined wood display case, a 1982 Instruction Manual and Parts Catalog (when only the 9MM and the .45 Win Mag calibers were offered) and a DVD of the Charles Bronson cult film classic, “Death Wish 3”. The condition of this Wildey Hunter is excellent, with light handling marks. The checkered walnut grips are excellent with few very light handling marks and crisp checkering. Mechanically, this rare Wildey is excellent. The display case is very good with a few scratches and handling dings toe the main body of the case, and considerable shelf wear to the felt on the bottom of the case. The Instruction Manual and Parts Catalog is complete but has a coffee (?) stain on the front cover. SN 45-1153"

There is some minoring scuffing on the underside, but you wouldn't have noticed unless I told you. Other than that, it is in great condition, less than 100 rounds down barrel. It was bought NEW at BassPro, and comes with everything you would get from the shop (original box, papers, manual, etc) There is a safe mode for the hammer, so safety can be on with one in the chamber. Original walnut stock is beautiful and from right here in Missouri. 

This rifle is pre-Hurricane Sandy. Sandy destroyed the Henry factory, and their old 20th century machines. New rifles are not as perfect as pre-hurricane rifles. I almost bought two when I bought this one.

 Description The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

 Compatibility: Weapons using AR-15 Mil-Spec style Fire Control Groups
