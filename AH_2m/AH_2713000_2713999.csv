COLT 1883 Hammerless Side By Side 12 Ga Shotgun Damascus Barrels & Engraving,"Norfolk, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 700,"Listed On: Friday, March 7, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for trade a very early all original Colt 1883 Hammerless 12 Guage shotgun. There are three grades of these guns per the year it was made. This is the in the middle of 3 grades model. The Deluxe. All Colt shotguns were custom order one at a time in 1883. I'm too cheap to buy the letter from colt or it would be worth a lot more. VERY low all matching serial numbers throughout every piece of the gun. Tight action. Locks perfectly like a Swiss watch. Real Damascus laid barrels in excellent shape all the way down. There is about 40-60 percent of the finish intact. I'm no expert which is why I left the margin that wide. That's not rust or patina u see on the metal. In 1883 steel wasn't blued. It was either browned or case acid blued. This like all finer guns was browned. So what remains is about half of its browning. Barrels never touched. No major dings. Inside bores are excellent for the age. Heavy engraving in very good shape. The forend is in good shape which is rare for these 131 year old guns. The buttstock has the silver inlay proof coin intact and excellent. Both triggers work very well. 
Now for the bad. The stock is cracked obviously at the pistol grip. It was repaired early in the 1900s according to the former owner. And it shows that age. It's gapped poorly and will either need a new stock which is very hard to track down if original. And the Bakelite? I'm guessing buttplate which is correct Colt, is cracked. A screw in the trigger guard bottom metal was replaced with an obvious wrong screw it looks like decades ago. All the other screws, bolts and hardware on the gun are original and in great shape. I have found a source for buttplate and that screw, correct from colt for under $30 for both. As far as the stock goes...my first instinct was to replace it. And while I did find several colt 1883 stocks, I realized that making the finish shiny in spots and messing with 131 year old patina on most of the gun to do that swap would devalue it quite a bit.  These are rare as hens teeth and on the net from anywhere from $1400 in rougher shape than mine to-$12,000 for perfect.

Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails 
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.

FN SCAR 16, maybe 17
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites

1911 pistols
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.

Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Please note that this is a training rifle and is not intended to shoot live ammunition.  It is said that this type of rifle was used to shoot blanks and even wooden bullets, but I strongly urge that nothing be shot from it.  It was used for training in cleaning the firing models as well as for bayonet practice.  The wood is in good condition as is the metal.  There is neither a chrysanthemum nor an extractor and there never was.  The bore is bright, chrome lined and smooth.  This is a fine example of this type of rifle and an interesting WWII historical piece.  Price is $200."

They started getting guns shipped out abs available for Sale in February 1986. I have one of the First Year U.S. Production Glock Model 17 9mm Pistols, it was produced in September of 1986 and the Barrel in this gun has Austrian Proof Marks Proving it was made in Austria- the Barrel and Frame of the Gun have all Matching Serial Numbers and this is extremely Rare. The Gun Includes the 2 Original Factory Glock 10 Round Single Stack Magazines/Clips. This Gun readily accepts all newer clips with higher capacities, I have personally checked to make sure all Factory Glock 17 Round and 18 Round Clips/Magazines, they fit perfectly and seat perfectly flush with no gaps and look PERFECT.  This Gun is in Great Shape- it Functions Great, and is 100% Mechanically Sound and Functional. It is 100% Original and has an Excellent Trigger that feels lighter, much more crisp, and simply better than any other Glock Factory Trigger I have ever felt, I own several newer Glock Pistols and they don't feel as good nor do they shoot as accurately. The First Generation Glock Pistols have no serrations or finger grips like newer models and they have a much smoother feel, I prefer the feel of this one to my new GlockPistols. This Gun has a Factory Installed Adjustable Rear Sight and Shoots Very Accurately, The Original Finish is still totally intact and looks great with only a few minor scratches, nothing serious at all and I assure you this gun will make its new owner proud. This Gun has a low round count and the internal parts show very little wear and the rifling in the Barrel still looks like new. This Gun is a Piece of History and should appeal to all Gun Fans & Collectors, especially Glock Enthusiasts like myself. This Gun was made within the First Year of Production and is nearly 30 Years Old, it has been in my family since it was new and has been kept clean, maintained and lubricated properly, and is ready for a new home.

This is a Detonics Combat Master with (2) authentic Detonics 6 round magazines.  This particular model has no markings or lettering on either side of the slide, nor on the barrel chamber which means that it was a pistol made for the higher ups, executives, or someone with a special link to the executives. the Muzzle is crown cut which is ultra rare on these pistols. I have never seen another barrel cut like it on any of the Detonics I have seen. These are collectors pistols and dont come up alot for sale, much less at this price. This pistol is SUPER CLEAN, ULTRA ACCURATE, and a blast to shoot. Trigger is tight and breaks like a $3,500 Wislon. The gentleman I bought it from 8 years ago had barely shot it and it looked new in box. I have put 400-500 down range and never had an issue. The magazines regularly sell for $65 and higher on ebay and other auction sites when they come up. Prefer cash at this time, but always open to specialty or hard to find trades. 
This one is stamped Bellevue, WA and all parts have matching serial numbers etched into the gun by hand. This is a handmade custom pistol and was years ahead of the design when it was produced back in the 80's. There are zero MIM(metal injection molding) parts in this pistol. No plastic or other cheap materials. I have tons of pictures and can shoot them if interested. Feel free to TEXT or CALL REDACTED. I have ordered a new WOLFF Recoil spring and firing pin spring just to update the pistol, but they have not been installed yet.

Herbert Schmidt of Ostheim an der Rhon Germany. Schmidt has marketed firearms under a long list of trade names in Europe and the USA including Deputy Marshal, EIG, E8, PIC, Geroco, Madison, Bison, Omega, RG, AMCO, Spesco, Valor, Liberty, LA's Deputy, Liberty Scout, Deputy Magnum, Deputy Adjuster, NATO, Western, Burgo Mod 21, Gecado Model 21 , Indian Scout, VOL, Eusta, Cheyenne Scout, Texas Scout, and Buffalo Scout. The basic Schmidt pattern was a six-shot double action solid frame revolver, with a swing-out cylinder and a short barrel. Schmidt's other principal pattern was a western-style .22 Small Frame Single Action revolver with a rod ejector beneath the barrel. All Schmidt revolvers have the maker's name stamped into the lower edge of the butt grip frame, visible when the grips are removed. As with Em-Ge, Schmidt revolvers were also widely sold in the USA before the passing of the Gun Control Act of 1968.

This revolver is very clean, and tight.
It has the original case, paperwork, test round, Ruger lock, removal pin, ect..
It comes with 50 rounds of hollow point ammo.
I am asking 1100 cash, or a trade with comparable value.
I know it seems like a lot, but wouldn't part with it for anything less...
I love to shoot the revolver.
It is the best concealed weapon I feel you could carry, as far as rugged, dependable, nice looking.
I know there are plenty of supers out there, but to me they look like snub nose revolvers with a barrel sticking out of them...Just my thought.
Looking for high caliber rifles, and handguns.

This is a “Last Ditch” rifle with a completely intact mum, and was most likely manufactured at the Kokura Arsenal.   As a rifle of this type, the wood is roughly prepared but remains in good condition.  As expected, it has a rear peep sight and a wooden butt pad.  The metal is in good condition and the rifle is complete.  The bolt knob, firing pin and spring are from an original rifle, but are not the ones from this rifle.  Those parts, by popular opinion, are probably rusting away on the floor of the Pacific Ocean.  This suggests that the rifle is a captured, bring-back unit, but I can only speculate on this.  The bore of this rifle is not chrome lined, but it still shows strong rifling.  These rifles have some of the strongest actions ever manufactured.  It has been disassembled, gently cleaned and oiled, and re-assembled.  Price is $250.  Rifle can be shipped at buyer’s expense."

Scope is in excellent condition with no scratches, dents, or signs of wear on the outside, glass clean and clear.

Mildot reticle for range estimation, wind adjustment and holdovers.

In addition I'm including a 4"" sunshade and a set of Burris XTR tactical scope rings that are already mounted and leveled. These rings fit picatinny/weaver scope bases

Its in great shape and will come with two mags, the 6 round flush and 7 round extended, but I don't have the box for it.  Also has night sights, talon grips, and POSSIBLY an upgraded trigger.  I picked it up second hand so I am not positive but the trigger feels about 10x better than the stock Shield triggers I have felt, pull is around 4-5lbs.  Depending on trade offers I have 140 rounds of .40 ammo I can trade for different caliber ammo.

I'm looking to trade for a similar gun, primarily pocket sized but may consider subcompacts as well, in 9mm.  Primarily interested in a Beretta Nano, but will consider similar guns in the category.  No Kel Tecs, and I'm not interested in any other calibers aside from possibly .40.  The only .380 I would consider would be a Sig P238.  Not really interested in selling.

The serial number is #15580 in case you want to verify this information. The Gun is as stated above, a 1959 Ruger Blackhawk .44 Magnum Single Action Revolver, it's the ""Flat Top"" Design with an Adjustable Sight that says ""Micro"" inside of the sight in cursive writing and also has the famous ""3 SCREW"" Design. This Gun has the legendary smooth action and perfect trigger these older Blackhawks are known for, this gun cycles so easily and honestly has the smoothest action of any gun I have ever felt, the trigger pulls effortlessly and all of that contributes to this being one of the most accurate guns you could ever own. has the 6.5"" Barrel and has the factory equipped, optional ""STAG"" brand Grips, they are an Ivory Color with Black Accents- the upgrade from the factory Walnut Color Grips cost $16.50 back in 1959. This Gun doesn't have a lot of writing and warnings on it like a lot of the modern guns do, just the Serial Number ""15580"" written under the cylinder on the right side of the gun, on the left side in the same place it says: ""RUGER BLACKHAWK 44 MAGNUM CALIBER"" in small letters and the left side of the Barrel says: ""STURM, RUGER & CO. SOUTHPORT, CONN U.S.A."". The Gun is totally original and hasn't ever been sent back to Ruger for anything. The finish is original also and still looks great and the bluing still shines like it did when it was new. The Gun looks great overall and only has a few minor scratches and some normal wear but still looks great and everything functions flawlessly.The Gun has been shot very little over the years, but is an extremely powerful and ACCURATE gun that should drop anything in its path easily. Thet factory rifling in the Barrel is 100% PERFECT and looks new. This Gun has been in the family since it was new but it's time for it to move on to a new home. This would be an excellent gun for any collection and even though its 55 years old, it'll still be like getting a New Gun because this gun looks awesome, and functions smoother and feels better than any new Revolver I've ever handled, you'll just have to see and feel it in person. I assure you, if this is what you are looking for, or leaning towards getting one, come check this one out and you won't be disappointed. Email me anytime, I check it regularly and will respond as soon as possible, I have an idea of what I want for the gun but I'm open to offers.

Just installed a NOS Weaver one piece #74 Scope Base on it, as well as a Razorback Sling, it is ready to scope and hunt with.

The Burlington, Vermont City Council is seeking to enact gun restrictions that would affect all of Vermont because it would require the Legislature to make an exception to the VT Sportsmen's Bill of Rights (24 V.S.A. Sec 2295).



Burlington's advocates of civilian disarmament have said that they want to see Vermont as a whole enact regulations of firearms similar to those found in neighboring states like Massachusetts.



Once Burlington gets an exception to Section 2295, which requires that only the State can enact restrictions on possession of firearms, other towns will surely follow, creating a crazy quilt of varying restrictions around the State.



Burlington has hired some of the most influential and politically correct lobbyists in Vermont, who have a constant presence in the Legislature throughout the entire Legislative Session, and a track record of success.



These promoters of gun restrictions in Vermont are trying to tell legislators that ""things have changed in Vermont"" and that outdoorspeople have died off or stopped caring about these issues.



The Vermont Federation of Sportsmen's Clubs is having a ""Legislative Mixer"" on Thursday March 13, in the State House cafeteria (enter by the front entrances to the building and keep following the halls to the very back of the building along the hillside), from 4:30- 8:00 PM.



This is NOT a protest or demonstration.



It is a chance to interact with Legislators and fellow outdoors people to show that Vermont voters and citizens care about these issues.



There is free food, and it is good food.


To get a sense of what to expect if Vermont follows the Massachusetts approach often touted by those who want to restrict guns in Vermont, have a look at this:




Burlington's efforts are being steered and advised by out-of-state gun-ban groups, and represent the biggest threat on these issues in Vermont.



Size matters: Legislators will be paying close attention to how many people show up. A small turnout will play into the hands of the lobbyists who say that no one cares. Your attendance matters. Please come, and please tell and bring friends who also care about these issues.

ZT is proud to offer the model 0301, designed by Ken Onion and Strider - a top-quality combat knife equipped with the patented SpeedSafe® assisted opening system.

SpeedSafe® enables users to deploy the blade one-handed - using their choice of an ambidextrous thumb stud or an equally ambidextrous index finger protrusion.

In addition to SpeedSafe, the 0301 features a tough S30V stainless-steel blade with ZT's unique ""Tiger Stripe"" Tungsten DLC coating. The S30V blade steel is designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The Tungsten DLC tiger striping also provides a non-reflective camouflaged surface. 

The 0301's Ranger Green scales are made of 3-D machined G-10 and titanium for incredible mechanical strength and a supersecure grip. The 0301 also features a 3/8 inch hex head pivot shaft nut that makes field adjustments fast and easy with minimal tools.

In addition, this dynamic folding knife comes with a reversible or removable clip for tip-up or tip-down carry - so it remains securely stowed until the user needs it.

It has Pachmyar wrap grips and will come with a few magazines. I would like to trade for a like condition Glock20SF for a hunting companion. For the right deal, I will toss in Black Hawk Serpa drop leg holster, Black Hawk double mag speed pouch, and a cpl hundred rounds of ammo. Want to get this done and shoot my new 10mm at the range this weekend.   Dont have a Glock20SF for trade?  $575 cash takes the Berretta and all mentioned with it.  Legit folks-DL/Military ID/CPL something. And no, I wont except a work visa or greencard as ID."

This is a German police surplus gun issued NEW in Germany.

The SIG P6 is a more compact version of the SIG P220. The Swiss Army wanted semi-automatic handgun, that would provide excellent functionality with a double-action trigger. The 9mm SIG-Sauer P6, debuted with various new and inventive features. It utilized a single column magazine holding eight 9 mm rounds and has a 3.9 in. barrel.

A new German police standard, in the mid-1970s, prompted SIG-Sauer to develop a new pistol that met the standard: The SIG-Sauer P225 (known as the P6) and the Heckler & Koch P7. The SIG-Sauer P225 was the least expensive (due mainly to the inventive design) and received the majority of the orders. To be able to manufacture that many handguns, SIG acquired a controlling interest in J. P. Sauer & Sohn in Eckenförde, Germany to manufacture parts. This is also where all P225s were manufactured. The only difference between the P6 and P225 — the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6's trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6's have fixed sights only. Because of its compact size, the P225/P6 is quite readily usable for concealed carry. In U.S. states where high-capacity magazines were prohibited, the P6/P225 is in high demand."

THE GUN STILL HAS THE ORIGINAL GREASE AND HAS NEVER BEEN ASSEMBLED. THE BOX SAYS 69 BUT THESE MUST NOT HAVE BEEN CHANGED IF EVER TO 69A. I HAVE 2 OF THESE AND THEY ARE BOTH EXACTILY ALIKE AS TO THE BOXES. I'VE DECIDED TO LET ONE GO ALONG WITH A MODEL 55 IN ONE OF MY OTHER AUCTIONS THAT IS NEW IN BOX ALSO. THIS IS A 1 IN A MILLION CHANCE SO DON'T MISS IT IF YOU COLLECT BOX GUNS. BOTH THE 55 AND THE 69 CAME FROM SAME STORE. LEGAL REQUIREMENT- Modern firearms must be transferred through a licensed FFL dealer in your area. Bidder to supply a signed copy of local dealer’s license before shipment will be made. A C&R License is acceptable for C&R firearms only (guns determined to be C&R’s by ATF RULES). Antique firearms require bidder to supply proof of age. Some areas still require an FFL transfer for antique & black powder firearms (New Jersey, NYC, etc.) I ship only to dealers that receive from a private indvidual and I will furnish DL and FOID card pictures. If you need from a dealer it will be an extra $20.00. Shipping will include insurance and will be a flat rate to the lower 48. I reserve the right to stop an auction at any time if no bids have been received as I have put out some sale flyers to my gun clubs.

THE BOX DIMENSIONS ARE 30 3/4"" X 6 1/4"" X 1 15/16"". ALSO I'VE ADDED PICTURES OF THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX AND THE ORIGINAL RECEIPT WHEN THE GUN WAS PURCHASED ALONG WITH A MODEL 55 AT THE THEN LOCAL HARDWARE STORE IN 1966"
