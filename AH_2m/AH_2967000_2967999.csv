Beretta quality and reliability with an affordable price, not some cheap Chinese junk.  When you see this weapon, you can tell the quality.  Just pull this weapon out and the fight will be over.  It looks so ferocious that no one would dare challenge this gun.  This is a perfect home defense weapon or a fun gun to take out shooting for fun.  It has flip up sights and an attachment for a carry strap.  Just flip up the sights and you are ready to go or just fire it from the hips.  Only 2 available so get them while they last.  Don't be fooled by the small caliber, the new 22LR rounds reach up to 1750 feet per second in velocity yields over 200 ft lbf of energy.  A fast 38 special round is 770 feet per second yields 208 ft lbf of energy.  A 38 special usually holds 5 or 6 rounds and this weapon holds 21 rounds.  I don't think I would be afraid of defending my home with this weapon.  The actual fact is that no matter what size round you fire, the fight is over after the 1st shot in 95% of the cases.  You can make your own decision!  There are a lot of people killed each year with 22 caliber ammo.

The out of the box accuracy of this rifle is remarkable.  After purchasing the rifle and doing a standard break in, it was shooting sub MOA right away with 168gr, Federal, Sierra Match King Ammo.  The rifle comes standard with an Accu-Stock, Accu-trigger, 4 round detachable box magazine, and oversized bolt knob.  All of which I have found to be a great asset to the rifle.  The barrel is a limited production 20"" heavy fluted barrel with 11.25 twist.  The barrel is also threaded which allows for a muzzle brake, flash suppressor, or even a sound suppressor.  The scope on the rifle is a Millet TRS-1, 6-14x50mm Mil-Dot with an illuminated reticle which is great for those low light, long range shots.  I am selling the rifle in order to build a new long range rifle.  I have about 200 rounds through it and the bi-pod is included."

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several
intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light
conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint
Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during
critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual
Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light
output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include
other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light
transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and
precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged
construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from
aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled
to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish
eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. It's water
resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging
hunting conditions.

Nothing says freedom quite like the recoil of an evil black rifle and the ring of your AR500 target from ULTIMATE TARGETS letting you know that your round found its mark!

GONGS, SILHOUETTES, DUELING TREES AND MORE!
GONGS:
Gongs are made from AR500 and are rated for ammo at 3,000 fps and slower. A stand and all harware to hang it is included. They break down to make it easy to carry and store. Sizes go from 2""-20"". I also make stands to hang multiple targets from. 
DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick. No tools are ever needed!
STATIC IPSC SILHOUETTE & STAND:
Silhouette is AR500 and 3/8"" thick and is also rated for all pistol and rifle ammunition @ 3,000fps or slower. 1/2 scale, 2/3 scale available. Target stands right at 5' tall. The legs remove to make transporting easier. 
ROUND STATIC STANDS
Round static targets are 3/8"" AR500. Sizes go from 4""-12"". The base accepts a standard 2x4 board that you supply. These are very light weight and easily portable. 

These targets will withstand tens of thousands of bullet strikes. If you are building a shooting range, I can help you get the most targets for your budget! I can offer discounts on package deals. I can do custom builds to fit your exact needs. The sky is the limit to what I can build. We can customize a range to your exact specifications and needs! The fastest way to reach me is by text or call 931-312-912two

Every target from ULTIMATE TARGETS is made by American hands! No robots, illegal immigrants or communist mass production junk! Every target I build is made one at a time, with care, to ensure every target is built RIGHT! I guarantee all of my work. I've never had a target returned for any reason. You can buy these with the confidence that you will get a very well built target that will last you a very very long time for a fraction of the price of other companies. 
I have videos of all the targets I offer in action. Simply request to see one or all of them!

 Boresight designed for fast gun zeroing and sighting 15 to 100 yard sighting range 632 to 650 nm laser wavelength Sturdy brass construction Comes with carry pouch
 The Sightmark Laser Bore Sight provides the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in rifles of all types. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the rifle is aiming; it’s easy to sight in any scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the weapon being sighted in order to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark laser bore sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any gun. It’s easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark laser bore sight is available in several calibers and gages for use with all the most popular rifles and shotguns.

Brief Introduction:
By projecting a laser beam from the center of the barrel axis of firearm, this laser bore sight collimator allows you to instantly&accurately set your sight or scope etc. The laser light emitting from the laser bore tool travels in a straight line while the bullet follows a trajectory. Even though the use of this device will get you very close, final adjustment should be made at the range."

My first choice is to trade, but if I don't find a trade I'll sell.

I have a Gen 4 Glock 19 in excellent condition that I'd like to sell or trade for an M&P9 Compact (no thumb safety), or possibly even a Sig p938. I'm about 80/20 on M&P vs. Sig
Bought it July last year, fired 300-400 rounds, cleaned every time. I only carried it in my Maxpedition pack as my car/home defense gun. Never carried on person.
Comes with all of the factory equipment: 3 15-round mags, hard case, different size backstraps.
Also have extras:
Pachmayr customized grip sleeve ($15)
Basic Galco IWB holster ($25)
50 rounds of FMJ 9mm ammo ($16)

There will be a discrepancy of value so I would need cash on top of trade, depending on what extras you have (Extra mags, night sights, Apex action/trigger parts installed). At retail the Glock is about $80 more than M&P. I can also include some ammo for the right deal. I prefer trade to make things simple but will consider taking cash then just go buy an M&P. Please no other trade offers besides what I listed.

Cash price for everything is $560

I'm in Beaverton and would do FTF in PDX Metro area. I don't plan on putting up photos at this time. It's a Glock, and looks like a Glock"

This is not your average striker, but a customized build to create a great Striker.  The scope is a $450 Leupold VX-3 2.5-8x32mm handgun scope with duplex reticle.  The mounts are Burris Signature 1"" rings on a Weaver-style steel full-length base.  Included is a Harris bipod.

What makes it a custom?  I had the OEM stock and scope coated in Realtree Hardwoods HD Brown by Tarjac, one of the best in camo-coating.  But the best feature is the Muscle Brake muzzle brake, installed by Devin at Sin Arms.  This is the Mini-Magnum Muscle Brake, designed by Neal Cooper and purchased from Piercision Rifles.  What makes the Muscle Brake great is the first ports direct the blast sideways away from the shooter.  The 2nd and 3rd ports direct the blast slightly backwards.  So the magic of this muzzle brake is it significantly reduces recoil and muzzle jump, while protecting the shooter from the concussion produced by must muzzle brakes, including the OEM Savage round brake.  The final touch is the trigger has been worked on by Sin Arms.  Devin cleaned up the trigger, significantly reduce the travel (creep) and reduced the spring tension.  The result is a trigger much better and more enjoyable than the stock trigger.

Also included in this purchase is a Doskosil case, the original purchase receipt for the Striker from 2003, the owners manuals, the original box from when it was purchased, and Butler Creek scope covers.  The case has some rust spots on the latches, so don't expect it to be perfect.  It's simply a good older hardcase for transporting the Striker, but nothing fancy.

This is not your average Striker, and I have a lot of money invested in this build.  It is a very sweet shooter.  My price is $1,100 shipped for the entire package.  The only reason to sell it is I am pursuing other interests, namely purchasing a side-by-side UTV.  I have at least 30 photos from every angle, so please write me and I will email additional photos to you.  I will only ship to an FFL.  Payment must by via US Postal money order (it will take two of them since the max for USPS is $1,000 per money order).  Please ensure you can own this firearm in your state.  It is classified by ATF as a handgun.  Call me at 334 - four five six - 9114 for more information.  Thanks for looking."

.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.

most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

XTP pistol bullets continue to set the standard as the bullet of choice for hunters and law enforcement officers who understand the value of a pistol bullet which will perform over a wide range of handgun velocities. Most pistol bullets are designed to work only at a factory specified velocity and a specific range. At these predetermined specifications, the bullets work just fine. But when bullet velocity begins to change, surprises can happen. Many factors cause velocities to change-gun type, barrel length, distance to target, barriers and more. That's why you need a bullet that you can depend on to perform over a wide range of velocities. You need the XTP."

The pistol is a commemorative pistol from Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) 12.1 with the 2nd Battalion 9th Marines battalion emblem on the slide.

The new ammo was unboxed and mixed with the other stuff in a large .50 cal army ammo can. I don't know exactly how many rounds there are, but I suspect it is very close to the original purchase of 2000 rounds. Purchaser of the ammo gets the ammo can, which is 2/3 full.

Anyone with qualms about using reloaded ammo from LAXammo, the ammo has been great. I've used over 4k rounds of their reloaded 9mm, 500 rounds of reloaded .40, and couple hundred of 38 special and 380. Not one failure to fire, eject, or other error. The ammo has been great and is fantastic practice ammo for the price. 

I used to have a lot of .40 handguns but only one now, don't need all this ammo. I have over $700 into the purchase of ammo and can. Would like to give someone a nice discount and free up my closet space at $500 for the whole package. Willing to drive a short distance."

I have for sale or trade a 1964 Browning A5 12 ga. Magnum shotgun. It has a vented rib barrel. It is a magnum so it will shoot 3"" shells as well as 2 3/4"" shells. It was my uncles gun that was passed down to me. It has a polychoke which lets you change from open, modified, intermediate, and full choke with just a click, which is great for hunting. It has been used to hunt quail, dove, turkey, and ducks for most of its life. It has been used, but it still functions flawlessly. It doesn't have any cracks or major pitting. Everything works and looks good, still nice and tight. I can put cash on top of my shotgun for anything that I like to even out the difference if you have something nicer. Try me, you never know maybe we could work something out.  Feel free to text or call me at REDACTED. Or email. I'm open to anything. Thanks and have a nice day."
