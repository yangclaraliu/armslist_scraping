Press the trigger on this 21st Century 1911 pistol and your jaw will drop at the clean, crisp trigger. Everything you want in a 1911 is here, from the muzzle with its stainless steel 55 inch barrel for accuracy to the grip safety that is contoured for the skeletonized spur hammer to prevent hammer bite.

Up for sale is a brand new unfired Sig Sauer P716 w/ PSB. This is an AR pistol, NOT an SBR.  You will save money going with the pistol option as you won’t have to pay for the tax stamp ($200 additional cost to get an SBR, plus wait time for clearance).  It has a feature called a PSB (Pistol Stabilizing Brace - $150 add on) that comes with it. MSRP on the gun alone is $2,252. This has (1) 20 round Pmag coming with the gun itself. This has the ambi-mag release & ambi-sling mount. All items for sale are factory new in the box/packaging. These items have been stored in my gun safe upstairs in a temperature controlled dry environment. 

I DO NOT/WILL NOT trade anything for this package (please don’t ask), I am looking to get the money I paid back, that’s it.  The price is set unless you don’t want the mags.  Only serious inquiries and please don’t ask/haggle about price, I purchased this package at a discount and simply want what I paid back.  If you can find it elsewhere in stock cheaper, congratulations and best of luck.  If you have any questions, need more pictures, or are interested in buying this package, contact Jason REDACTED or email me REDACTED. I work evenings so I likely won’t respond until after noon. Text or calling will provide the quickest response.  I will only ship/sell this package where legal and it must go through an FFL where required.  If within state, you will be required to get a purchase permit as this is classified as a pistol.  Thanks for your interest & God Bless!

The Yugo M70 is far superior to alot of the other cheaper AK variants on the market today like the WASR. They have a thicker receiver and heavy barrel along with heavier internals. This is not a parts gun like many M70's out there. 
All parts are new manufacture. Manufactured in Serbia at the famous Zastava Military Arms factory. This is a very nice rifle with a cold hammer forged barrel, metal underfolder stock, G2 Fire control group and threaded barrel with removable
muzzle brake . Magazines fit tight with no wobble and the rifle is very well balanced despite being a little heavier (just under 8lbs) due to the thicker barrel, reciever and beefier parts. This is high quality and built solid. Overall length is 35.5"" and only 26 inches folded. The underfolder makes for a compact rifle with a lot of firepower. 
I bought this new last year and have only put 120 rounds through it. I bought a 500 round case of ammo hence the 380.

I am willing to entertain offers as long as they are reasonable.

For sale or trade, I have a used Bersa Thunder Untra Compact Pro in .45 ACP. 

It comes with 2x7 round magazines and 100 rounds of practice ammo (230 grain Ball).
It isn't a Smith or Colt, but it is a good quality, reliable pistol.  

It's a good carry gun with enough stopping power to get the job done and enough capacity to Do The Job.

It isn't new.  It shows it's been around.  There are dings and scratches.  It Functions Flawlessly.  I have put 220 rounds through it and really like it, but I want something else.  I have kept it clean from the day I bought it (like any used gun, it needed cleaned when I bought it).  The barrel is shiny and has clean, crisp rifling.

I am happy to meet in public and conduct business.  If you are concerned about the origin of gun, we can conduct the transaction through a licensed dealer.  Any related fees are the responsibility of the buyer.  I am not a dealer and do not conduct background checks.  I am obligated to ask to see your current Ohio Driver's License well enough to see that it is you in the photo and that it is an Ohio license. I am also obligated to ask that you not contact me about this gun unless you would be able to pass a background check.  I can't run one.  I will have to take you at your word. 

I can ship this gun out of state to an FFL if requested. Payment must be made with Postal Money Order or Paypal and shipment will be done by federal regulations. If I can ship to your FFL, it is $30.  If your FFL requires the shipping originate from another FFL, I can arrange it, but it'll cost more.  

If you are trading a non serial numbered part (Caliber Xchange kit), I still have to ship the gun to an FFL.

Before making an offer, please look at other DA/SA .45 ACP pistols to price out a comparable gun.  This isn't a Hi-Point.  Please don't offer Hi-Point money for this gun.  It isn't a Sig, nor is it a Colt, so I'm not trying to get $1000 for it either.  I'm not desparate to sell.  So far, I have been hesitant to sell because it is such a good gun, but I have other things I'd like to get.  So far I have politely declined lowball offers.  I'm going to start ignoring them now.  Persistent low ball offerers will be asked to stop wasting my time."

Up for sale is a brand new unfired Sig Sauer P516 w/ PSB and 10” barrel. This is an AR pistol, NOT an SBR.  You will also save money going with the pistol option as you won’t have to pay for the tax stamp ($200 additional cost to get an SBR plus wait time for clearance).  It has a feature called a PSB (Pistol Stabilizing Brace - $150 add on) that comes with it.  MSRP on the gun is $1,839 w/o extra mags. This package includes (4) extra Magpul Gen 3 30 round Pmags ($50 + value) that are black w/ dust cover.  This has the ambi-mag release & ambi-sling mount.  I am also including 100 rds of Remington 55gr FMJ ammo that I got with it.  All items for sale are factory new in the box/packaging.  These items have been stored in my gun safe upstairs in a temperature controlled dry environment. 

I DO NOT/WILL NOT trade anything for this package (please don’t ask), I am looking to get the money I paid back, that’s it.  The price is set unless you don’t want the mags.  Only serious inquiries and please don’t ask/haggle about price, I purchased this package at a discount and simply want what I paid back.  If you can find it elsewhere in stock cheaper, congratulations and best of luck.  If you have any questions, need more pictures, or are interested in buying this package, contact Jason REDACTED or email me REDACTED. I work evenings so I likely won’t respond until after noon. Text or calling will provide the quickest response.  I will only ship/sell this package where legal and it must go through an FFL where required.  If within state, you will be required to get a purchase permit as this is classified as a pistol.  Thanks for your interest & God Bless!

The SIG516 Patrol by Sig Sauer is one of the most advanced and versatile AR-based rifles available. The SIG516 Patrol rifles use the innovative Sig Sauer short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. The free-floating military-grade barrel is chrome-lined and phosphated, and the rifle features an adjustable four-position gas regulator. The SIG516 Patrol also features a free-floating M1913 quad rail and flip-up adjustable iron sights.

Up for sale is a brand new unfired FNH SLP 12GA Shotgun w/ 18” barrel, extended magazine tube (6 + 1), and tri-rail aluminum lower front mount.  I ordered this gun during the buying craze and it just finally arrived recently. I’m simply looking to get back what I paid as I have other firearms I was able to purchase.  MSRP on the gun alone is $1,525.  This package includes the case the gun came in, additional butt pads, cheek pads, and choke tubes.  All items for sale are factory new in the box/packaging.  These items have been stored in my gun safe upstairs in a temperature controlled dry environment.   This gun is THE fastest cycling stock shotgun in current production, even faster than Benelli.

I DO NOT/WILL NOT trade anything for this package (please don’t ask), I am looking to get the money I paid back, that’s it.  Only serious inquiries and please don’t ask/haggle about price, I purchased this package at a discount and simply want what I paid back.  If you can find it elsewhere in stock cheaper, congratulations and best of luck.  If you have any questions, need more pictures, or are interested in buying this package, contact Jason REDACTED or email me REDACTED. I work evenings so I likely won’t respond until after noon. Text or calling will provide the quickest response.  I will only ship/sell this package where legal and it must go through an FFL where required.  Thanks for your interest & God Bless!

Only serious inquiries and please don’t ask/haggle about price, I purchased this at the price listed and simply want what I paid back. If you can find it elsewhere in stock cheaper, congratulations and best of luck. If you have any questions, need more pictures, or are interested in buying, contact Jason REDACTED or email me REDACTED. I work evenings so I likely won’t respond until after noon.

The Ishapore .410 is a converted No1 MkIII rifle. This modification, sanctioned by the Indian government, was introduced to provide the Indian police with a riot-gun.

 The essentials of the conversion consisted of boring out the barrel and reaming its chamber to accept the British .410 shotgun shell. The magazine was removed and the magazine well fitted with a wooden plug (which is present in this gun), this acted as a filler and loading platform for the single shell. Finally, the rear sight was pinned to eliminate adjustment.

 The chamber, as stated, was designed to fit the British .410 shell unlike the standard 3-inch .410 chamber. Shells for this rifle would have to be purchased in .410 British or fire-formed .303 cases would have to be used and hand loaded, should the owner wish to go bird hunting.   Item G-30787-8

The .25-35 WCF was a reasonably popular combination deer, antelope and small predator cartridge, although .25-35 rifles and ammunition sales never approached the levels attained by the .30-30 and .32 Win. Special.  Winchester still loads .25-35 ammunition, as do some of the specialty ammo makers, such as Stars & Stripes. Occasionally someone turns out a few rifles in the caliber.  The .25-35 cartridge is liked because it represents the lowest level of recoil in a cartridge suitable for hunting deer and other medium size CXP2 game.  At 200 yards, the numbers are 1545 fps/620 ft. lbs. The maximum point blank range of that load (+/- 3"") is around 200 yards.  Seen in that light, a young or recoil sensitive beginning hunter could do worse than a .25-35 rifle.  Item G-14024-1.

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.   Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.  Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.  Item G-I-7305

A lot of people over look these but having a large gun collection and military background myself I can still say this is one of my favorite weapons to take out to the range for the fun factor. everyone is always curious about it especially after a bump-fire mag dump. it's pretty easy to empty all 32rds before the first casing hits the ground if you use quality ammo and the barrel extension.

A couple of these have been sold on Ebay for $300.00 each.
This entire collection is worth somewhere between $1,000.00 and $2,000.00. It would just take the right buyer that wants them to get the full $2,000.00.
I don't know how to find that buyer. I don't know what to expect here, but I'm not giving them away, I'll say that up front. They are all new, never worn/used.

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not looking to separate at this time.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock
- 3 x Original cleaning rods

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required.

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not looking to separate at this time.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock
- 3 x Original cleaning rods

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required. Again, I will not separate anything at this time, please do not ask. Thanks for looking.

This is a very rare model 39 carbine made in 1964 of which less then 10000 were made. This rifle is described as the ""Cadillac"" of 22's and I agree.

I have been fortunate enough to acquire 2 of these awesome rifles so I am going to pass the opportunity on to someone else. I am only interested in cash unless the trade greatly benefits me. In other words if the trade is less than $1000 I am not interested. May consider trade for a chrome or titanium desert eagle mk 19 or 7. Please do not message me attempting to educate me on the marlin 39's as I am well aware of all things marlin. 

Absolutely no emails as I am not too fond of deadbeat bidders, and for the most part that is all I seem to encounter through email. My phone number is posted so use it.
Price is absolutely non negotiable as odds are I will never have the opportunity to own another.

919,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2843919,"For Sale:  Centurion C39 Milled AK-47 Black-tactical 7.62 by Century  ""New""","Auburn-Opelika, Alabama, United States",$ 698,"Listed On: Monday, April 14, 2014",Rifles,Century International Arms                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Introduced in January 2010, the Centurion 39 is a new semi-automatic version of the AK-47 design, and it retains all the signature AK features, such as the curved 30-round magazine, 7.62x39 mm chambering, and an oversize, right-side safety lever. Unlike other AKs sold in this country, which are usually assembled using foreign-made parts kits, the Centurion is made completely in the United States.
The Centurion 39 conveys an impression of extreme sturdiness, with robust and simple internal components, and a receiver machined from an 11-pound block of 4140 steel. Century Arms states that the rifle is also made to tighter tolerances than the original.
The Centurion, however, incorporates a number of changes to the original design. For example, its 16 1/2-inch barrel terminates in Century’s proprietary three-port Chevron Compensator. Created expressly for the Centurion, this removable unit more effectively directs propellant gas upward to reduce muzzle jump.
Also departing from the original pattern are the Centurion’s sights. On standard AK variants, windage adjustments are performed by moving the front sight. On the Centurion, the square-notch rear sight has been redesigned to allow windage changes by loosening a set screw and moving the rear sight blade laterally. Elevation is adjusted by a slider on the rear tangent sight or by rotating the red-colored front sight post.
The Centurion’s most visually distinguishing features are its polymer buttstock and two-piece polymer handguard. The buttstock has a 1-inch longer length of pull than the original wood stock—better fitting American shooters—and terminates in a ribbed, plastic buttpad. The handguard features four Picatinny rail segments spaced 90 degrees apart for the mounting of optics, lights and other accessories. Molded-in checkered panels on the lower handguard aid grip, while numerous ventilation slots in the upper handguard help cool the enclosed gas tube assembly.
Two TAPCO 30-round polymer magazines come with each rifle. Century Int’l states that the Centurion accepts standard AK accessories, including the company’s own MTL-225 Tactical Fore-end Weapon Light, which combines a 225-lumen light with a vertical fore-grip and mounts on the rifle’s bottom Picatinny rail. Disassembly follows standard AK-47 procedures, as is thoroughly explained in the rifle’s owner’s manual."
