The Original Luminox Navy SEAL watch, first introduced in 1994, is the timepiece that put Luminox on the map. The officer in charge of procurement for the Navy SEALs, Chief Nick North and Luminox worked together to develop a watch specifically for the SEALs. Since then, Luminox has never strayed from its mission and this has been confirmed and validated by the many elite military and law enforcement units that have requested Luminox for their use around the world. The man on the street has also shown particular interest in Luminox, figuring rightly that if the watches are designed for and used by elite troops, they have to be able to stand up to every day use. 16 years later, this series is still one of Luminox' best sellers."

Other info: I purchased the rifle 3 months ago. I'm selling to purchase the Ruger 22LR Tactical Autoloading. I've shot one box of Federal Match Grade ammo through the rifle (325 rounds). The rifle comes with original box, carry case, manual, one ten round mag, Leupold rail installed (I can remove if you want), and one box of Federal Match Grade (325 rounds). Please be advised, while I was installing the scope rail, the screw hole nearest to the barrel, I accidently over tightened, lol. I took the rifle to the gunsmith and he rethreaded, so that screw hole uses one size larger than the other screws, but you can't tell the difference. I just wanted to make the buyer aware. The rifle is like new in box.

The price doesn't include the scope(all installed and sighted in by gunsmith). If you want the scope attached, the Nikon P22 2-7x32 will be $150.00 additional dollars."

It's a lightweight shotgun with a smooth pump action and I've only put one box of ammo through it. I upgraded to a semi-auto so I don't need this anymore. This model runs about $285 in stores, plus taxes and fees, without the shell holder. $175 cash FIRM. I can also include some slugs, buckshot, or a padded rifle case for extra.

I have a brand new SAA Grim Reaper AR 15 for sale. This isn't your typical entry-level assault rifle. It has a 1:7 twist barrel to properly control larger grain rounds, is marked ""multi cal"" on the Reaper lower so you can use it with a wide range of uppers (7.62, 300 AAC, .22 LR, etc), and isn't made of plastic.

It comes with a CP Tactical red/green dot reflex sight with 4 different dot types ($100 at Cabela's), 3 30-round magazines, and approximately 75 rounds of .223 ammo. Everything is brand new, still in the packaging where applicable. The upper is ""factory blemish,"" meaning there are a few minor scratches on the finish.  It came to me this way from the factory, so this is your chance to get a great deal if you plan on refinishing it or care more about function than looks.

This shotgun is in good to very good condition. Everything works perfect and only has a few small dents and minor scratches in the stock. The butt plate has some of the black paint wearing off. Blueing is in good condition, however, there are some scratches on the lower barrel right and left-hand side. It was hard to show them in the pictures but, they are there you should be able to see them if you zoom the picture. Excellent tight action, ejects perfectly and shoots very nicely, shoots 2 ¾ and 3” shells, and has swivel mounts. Great for left or right hand shooters. No accessories. LOP is 14"" and barrel length is 24"".

I would seriously consider trading for a Smith and Wesson 9mm-it must be a 59 OR take the same magazine as the 59."

Since I don't see any more free time headed my way anytime soon, I figured I'd sell this and put the money in a Jeep rebuild........ Anyway, it's an Alexander Arms Overwatch upper mated to a Bushmaster lower, fitted with a Yankee Hill free float handguard, fixed A2 stock, and a 30mm tube Super Sniper scope. (I looked for several weeks to find any negative press on the Super Sniper scopes, but was unable to find any. VERY nice scope) Got it from a benchrest shooter who, having shot bolt guns for years, could never get used to the recoil spring noise and sold it to me. Has a very nice trigger, which I believe to be nil-spec parts worked a little, and an overtravel screw added to the selector internaly. I painted it with Duracoat, which some may not like, but wanted something different. I would love to tell you how it shoots, but I have only put two rounds thru it - just to make sure it went bang, The previous owner was in the process of trying different loads to see what it liked and I still have the remainder of the ammo.

The The V50SS-300 rifle features a massive SAE 4150 receiver and a three lug bolt with a 60-degree bolt throw, cock on opening action, a shell holder type extractor for absolutely positive extraction, and a machined aircraft grade aluminum stock. The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 30” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day. Scope and bipod not included. NEW!!!

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain. The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty. DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9.

Email anytime or text between 9am-1130pm. Will not answer unknown calls. Sorry to be so straight forward but it's amazing the level of intellect some people have. Also, I know there are model 82's for sale somewhere in the world for $250 and if you want a scratched up, wooden grip, fired 5,000 times plus pay the shipping and ffl then by all means, buy that one mine is worth more than what I am selling it for. If you are trading a gun then it must be at least $350. I'm looking for a moss 500 in 12 ga which, used is less than $300 in great shape, so you can add ammo or cash.

If you contact, be ready to come pick it up, it's not being held or the best one is, I will call you tomorrow.  Yeah right."

It comes with the factory box, 2 brand new 30-round AK Pmags, 1 30-round Tapco magazine, Sig Tactical red dot sight, manual, lock, and rails you can attach to the top, sides, and/or bottom of the hand guard for accessories. It has a lifetime warranty with free warranty repair and shipping through Gander Mountain.

This rifle has a side-folding stock, and is a piston-driven 7.62x39 system that accepts standard AK-47 mags.  It's one really cool rifle that was revealed last year.  I'm also including 20 rounds of American Eagle brass-cased rounds and a new BLACKHAWK! Sportster tactical bag.

Do not e-mail me asking what my lowest price is or if this is still for sale - I won't respond.
