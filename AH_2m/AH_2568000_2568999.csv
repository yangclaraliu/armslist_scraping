I am working an article for publication in a national magazine and I am in need of some photo's of First Generation Colt Single Action Army revolvers.  

In particular I am looking for shots of the gun over all from both sides. The serial number location as well as the assembly number on the loading gate.

I need a couple of shots of the bulls-eye head ejector and the half moon style.

If your interested you can take the shots yourself and send them to me or I can come to you.  I will ask you to sign a release for the photo's.

I can't promise any pay for the pictures as this is a freelance work. But if the work sells your guns will be pictured in a national magazine.

These rifles were known to be accurate and this one is no exception.  Comes with spike bayonet as pictured.  I have owned it about 15 years.  Rifle is $130 firm without ammo or $170 with 200 rounds included (corrosive, Russian ammo, steel case ammo).  Thinning out the herd so this one's gotta go.  Unfortunately, due to our President's obsession with banning guns, these and other surplus rifles will soon become more difficult to get as they will no longer be allowed for import.  Email me with a phone number and this fine example of Russian workmanship can be yours.

A SAECO Lead Hardness Tester will pay for itself many times over by allowing you to convert inexpensive scrap lead of unknown composition into casting alloy of known and reproduceable hardness. It provides a standard by which you can check the quality of purchased cast bullets.

The SAECO Lead Hardness Tester measures alloy  hardness by determining the depth of penetration of a  hardened steel indenter into a bullet. Relative hardness of  the bullet is read off a vernier scale.

	Relative Hardness
	SAECO 	Brinell
(Approx.)
Pure lead . . . . . . . . . . . 	0-1 	5

(magnum alloy)
5:10:85 (linotype) . . . . 	9-10 	22

The vernier scale is calibrated in arbitrary units from 0 for pure lead up to a SAECO hardness of 10. We have found  that a SAECO hardness of at least 6 is required for medium velocities in handguns and a SAECO hardness of over 8 for Magnum handgun and gas check rifle bullets. As a point of reference, wheelweights vary in composition and hardness but usually test between 7 and 9, while linotype registers approx. 10.

The Standard Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun.

This standard model allows for fast, easy conversion and works with most railed pistols, equipped with a QD sling mount.

Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock
positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red
dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality.

The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.

Purchased New in December as gift but have several Carbine Platforms for Sig and Glock and this is basically Extra on hand. Carbine with all adjustments to fit most model Handguns as I use on my Sig and my Glock great for multiple attachments and tactical close quarter versatility. Very High Quality, and it comes with a DVD. If you've wanted a Carbine platform this is your a one time steal opportunity to get at this price. Glock makes one as well but the qaulity of Sigs feels light yet indestructible build and of course Sig Quality. At store 279-+tax 300 out the door... I'm listing 
At $180  and price is as listed and very great deal for this Carbine Brand New. Email or text. Please only text if you are a interested buyer knowing what it is and the deal it os and just want to make the arrangement, otherwise email I am glad to answer quickly and can answer any question if you have any.

I purchased on consignment and the gun shop said the owner had only fired once. I've personally fired 50 rounds and cleaned thoroughly afterwards.
This is not your run-of-the-mill $600 Romanian WASR.  They are not very widely distributed and no longer imported.  If you do your homework you'll find they are extremely highly regarded by those who own or know of them.  Some say it is the best/most accurate stamped model available.

Comes with very solid black polymer US-made furniture (9.5"" stock length), and Tapco G2 trigger.  Has Buffer Technologies recoil buffer installed.  No muzzle device installed or bayonet lug.  Came with bag of extra/spare parts including extra grips, handguard, recoil spring and more.

Including 5 magazines: 2 steel surplus (1 I just ordered and still needs to be cleaned up), 1 ProMag waffle, 1 Tapco smooth-sided, and 1 Tapco 20-round waffle.

530 total rounds of 7.622x39 ammo.  20 rounds of lead soft point, 10 rounds of Fiocchi brass case, the rest is Russian steel case with a mixture of FMJ and HP.

It has Pachmayr grips on it and will come with a speed loader and a black leather owb holster that still needs to be broken in. Double action trigger pull is at 8lbs 15oz and single action is at about 3lbs 8oz. The heavy barrel is pinned so I believe that would make this gun somewhere between 1977 and 1982. Pictures show the condition with carry wear and wear through the blueing. Internally and mechanically this gun is superb. $400obo, good guy card, license and bill of sale for my records.  Might be interested in trades but mostly looking for cash. There is a chance I might be able to find some ammo to sell separately as well depending on how much time I want to spend digging for it.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Beretta PX4 Semi-automatic Double Action Full 40SW 4 inch(s) Polymer Blue 14Rd 2 Mags Picatinny Rail Ambidextrous 3 Dot JXF4F21

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.

Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

New Adjustable Sigths Kit
Other PX4 Accessories

8. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).
9. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
10. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. 11. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
12. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction)."

The Inertia Driven system offers lightning-fast handling and superior performance, while maintaining excellent reliability. The Inertia Drive system is one of the world's simplest semi-auto shotgun designs, never requiring adjustment, from light field loads to heavy shot. With only three parts, the bolt body, inertia spring, and rotating bolt head, the Inertia Driven system is fast, and clean, as inertia, rather than gas, is used to cycle the action. Strong steel locking lugs on the rotating bolt head lock steel to steel inside the gun barrel, and firing actually increases the lock-up. With no springs, action bar linkage, or heavy gas cylinders under the fore-end, Inertia Driven shotguns boast the excellent balance discriminating game hunters demand. The slim forend, light weight, and quick-aiming fiber optic sight make this versatile shotgun ideal for any serious shooter."

top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.

It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

B.O.R.S. Sight (For Leupold Mark IV)

The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob.

BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits.

After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant.

The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer.

Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles.

Invector™ choke system. The proven Invector interchangeable choke tube system works hand-in-hand with Vector Pro and back-boring to offer consistent, dense shot patterns with just the constriction needed for the shooting situation. The longer choke taper inside an Invector  choke tube produces consistent patterns with more uniform densities and fewer fliers. The superior design of the Invectors system is far more durable than the choke systems found in our competitors’ guns, especially when shooting steel shot. Invector eliminates gases slipping between the choke tube and barrel that could damage the choke tube and the barrel."

It is in very good condition with only minor nicks or scratches in the wood or bluing.  The most significant blemish is on the front barrel band and I've enclosed a pic.  I bought this almost a year ago with intentions of getting into deer hunting but realistically won't do so for a while.

Yes indeed! Larger handguns carry excessive costs for ammunition and produces huge amounts of felt recoil. Whereas this powerful Super Redhawk 44MAG will put down and keep down what it hits. And, just as important, the amount of felt recoil and the cost of ammo is reasonable. It’s smooth with its light single action trigger pull or its slick double-action trigger pull. While being used “with the rapid fire technique”, its accuracy has proven unbelievable when shooting at aluminum pie plates located 100 yards away. The targets were hit without scope assistance 4 times and in some cases 5 times from each gun load of six .44 caliber magnum rounds. These hits were made over seven different range visits. I liked it so much that I got carried away and bought two of these guns. This clean beauty comes with a medium-hardened rubber grip along with custom wooden grip side panels. There have been less than 200 rounds put through the pipe and looks to be almost new. A fun experience!

I have maybe put 50 rounds through this gun. These really are great guns.  I replaced the factory front dot sight with a Hi Viz fiber optic sight that has interchangeable lite pipes. The original sight is included if you want to put it back on.  (You won't). Also a total of 3 factory 12 round magazines, and a 1/2x28 thread adapter for use with a suppressor.  I'll throw in 300 rounds of CCI ammo as pictured, which is why I am firm on price.  That's a lot of extras on this package with the extra mags, and the .22 ammo."

Lightweight load-bearing support comes from a polycarbonate frame system with twice the strength of aluminum at half the weight. Molded foam suspension is contoured to fit your back. Load from the top or the front panel. 

The new Out Rigger carry system features a zip-out 2,000-cu.-in. mesh bag you can transfer gear into while packing out meat in the main cargo area. It keeps meat and gear separate and places the heavier load close to your body for easier carry. Top lid converts to a fanny pack. Other features include an integrated meat shelf, full-hydration capabilities, ultraquiet zippers and bedroll straps for extra gear. Imported.

The trigger pull is remarkable, and absolutely everything has been hand tuned by the factory. I shoots incredibly well, is absolutely reliable and is very clean. All flaws you can see in the pictures and are only from being holstered. It is all original...with great markings and the screws have never been turned! It comes with the original box, manuals, “Colt” sight adjustment screwdriver, etc. What you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. This is truly a one of a kind revolver and is absolutely the best of the best. Just FYI… In 1979, as a young man, I worked at Stanley Andrews Sports Outfitters in San Diego in the Gun Department. At that time Stanley Andrews Sports Outfitters was THE Premier sporting goods store and included absolutely everything from firearms to fly fishing to snow and water skis to mountaineering…you name it. I ordered this revolver from Pacific International in Sacramento who at that time was THE premier Colt distributor in California and who seemed to get all the “goodies” coming out of Colts. As you can see in the pictures, the outer brown box has a “Pacific International” shipping label to Stanley Andrews warehouse. The orange label shows the revolver being shipped from the Stanley Andrews warehouse to “Store #1” which was our downtown flagship store where I worked at 840 “B” Street. This isn’t just a Colt Python. It is a truly one of a kind item that you will probably never see offered again with a real history. I have never seen another Python like this offered at any price"

It really sucks hearing  that people have been scammed on Armslist. This is not Gunbroker, you have no idea who you are dealing with. If they leave an email to contact them directly, ask to speak to them directly ( pussy scammers won't talk to you on the phone)  If they list Illinois, illinois for location ask them where they are, usually they will say another state. DON'T SEND MONEY ORDERS OFF EXPECTING SOMETHING TO BE DELIVERED TO YOU , 9 TIMES OUT OF 10 IT WON'T BE! There are honest sellers out there, that will conduct an honest transaction but is it worth the risk? Just remember Armslist is great for face to face deals, if you want to order out of state, stick to Gunbroker where you can at least see feedback ratings."

Yeah, you. You, sitting on the couch with your stretchy shorts on with the laptop on your lap reading this ad. Yeah, the lead photo was bad ass huh? You just *had* to stop on this ad... but... unfortunately, this ad may not be for you. You may want to hit the back button now and stop reading, because this ad, and this weapon, well, they'll change your life and you just may not be ready for what's in store for you... or are you? 

Well, you're still reading this so you haven't hit the back button. Good, you passed the second test. The first test required that you know a freakin' straight-up operator's weapon when you see one and, well, you clicked on this ad so there's a spark of operator in ya.  The second test required that your default has to be to NOT follow the damn rules. I told you not to keep reading; you told me to fuck off and kept reading so, you're good... so far. 

Now, listen, you've read this far so that means that together we've already weeded out the gun collector types because this weapon is dirty, it's scratched up and I'm pretty sure there's a little dried blood on the grips. This gun is a collector's nightmare. Congratulations, you're officially more operator than those guys, but, don't get ahead of yourself because you still may be a douche and, frankly, it doesn't take much to be more operator than the gun collector guys. 

Ok, so now we need to determine in you're a mall ninja. Mall ninjas need not apply for the RIGHT to own this weapon, because a weapon like this needs a constant diet of real life ops or at least some dirty ass training for real life ops and, I can assure you that running around your mom's house in your airsoft gear clearing rooms while she's at work IS NOT operator and this weapon will straight up lose-its-shit if it's placed into that type of environment. One doesn't simple *BUY* a weapon with this much character; one *adopts* a weapon like this and you keep it in your care, custody and control until you can find the next qualified owner to hand it off to. So, if you're not willing to keep it for life or be responsible for finding its next qualified home then, please, hit that back button we were talking about earlier because this is simply not your weapon. 

Ok, so, I'm going to assume that you're not a mall ninja because a mall ninja would have pissed his pants at the, very real, possibility of me sniffing his ass out upon our eventual face-to-face meeting. Good, you're still legit and you're getting closer to being qualified so keep reading. 

Now, let me tell you about this weapon. You need to know who she is and what she likes before you can commit. Number one, this is a dirty little bitch. She doesn't like to be fully cleaned after use. Shoot her, come home, run a bore snake through her barrel, a couple of drops of some lube and hit her lower with an air compressor and stick her ass back in the holster. Oh yeah, I should have mentioned, this gun insists on living in a holster. Weapons like this can't survive in some padded ass zipper case or on a felt-padded shelf in a climate-controlled safe. She needs to be in a holster and if that holster isn't on your damn hip then it needs to be in your damn truck , and yes I said ""truck"" (but an SUV is acceptable too, just not a damned Volvo).

Ok, so now that you she likes to be dirty and that she insists on accompanying you everywhere you go, like a good dog (not a Cocker Spaniel either, but a real dog with no papers), you need to know what NOT to do with her. 

Here's the list of things she hates:
1) She won't wear anything from ""Condor"" or ""Uncle Mike's"". If you can't afford to put her in a real holster from London Bridge Trading or Safariland or some other reputable manufacture then please, dude, the back button, now. 
2) She WILL NOT SET FOOT in an indoor range. Please, for the love of all things holy, do not take this weapon to some stupid gun store range where you have to stand stationary in a damed phone booth and shoot one round no faster than every 7 seconds at a stupid ass stationary paper bull's eye target. Just really, stop right here if that's your thing because this beauty has seen too much real-world action and too much hardcore training to go back to the training wheels. This weapon needs to be kicking in doors or rolling around in the damn mud at an outdoor range... preferably not even a ""real"" range but some dude's property out in the sticks. 
3) She won't pose for photos for you to post on some Internet message board forum that is over run by 13yo boys trying to pose as spec ops guys. She bitched and moaned about posing for the three photos you're seeing on this ad and I promised her that it was for a good cause. She's still pissed though. She's not a show off, she's worker. 
4) I promised her you wouldn't put stupid shit on her. That means no lazers, optics, those rubber slip-on grip things, aftermarket magazines or funnel wells or any of the stupid shit you see in gun magazines. 
5) Don't email me asking date codes or round counts. If you have to ask, well, you're not operator enough for a weapon like her. She shoots straight and works. Period. 

Essentially, the rules above boil down to one thing: Don't be that guy. Don't be the guy that takes a weapon with a proud heritage and work history and turns her into a cheap slut or a showpiece. This weapon has had a few owners over her years, and with them she's literally seen conflicts in far off lands in the hands of a security contractor, has stacked-up to be first through the door in real SWAT operations with another owner, proudly protected the family of a responsible citizen and has served homeland security duties with another. She's forgotten more ops than most guns will ever know. She's legit, she has the scars to prove it and she still has a lot to give. 

So, anyway, incase you couldn't tell form the photos, she's an HK USP .45 and she comes with three 12rd German made original HK mags, her original case (which she hates so don't ask her to go in it) and her owner's manual... I'll sum up the owner's manual: Pull trigger = go bang. Her grip has been subtly stippled... trust me, you'll like it."

It came in as a package.  From everything you see in the pictures only the belt is not period.  There are also 4 mags in the pouches which are not period.  I am not sure what the canvas flap thing is.  Maybe it is what the US shipped the Lend/Lease guns in.  Not many were shipped across the Pond and even fewer made it home.  The gun is in great shape.



Let me tell you what I have found out about this pistol.  First it is marked ""NOT ENGLISH MAKE"" and has a British proof.  Both makings should show in the pictures.  Inside the flap of the holster is a name and rank.  After a little reseach I found that man was in fact a Lt. in the Royal Air Force.  Pretty cool.  I haven't researched it further since most days the internet is my enemy.  If you need more pictures just give me a shout!
