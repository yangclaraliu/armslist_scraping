Apologies to the straight shooter, sane, law abiding citizens reading this but wow. Ok anyway, I absolutely love this gun but there's another unicorn out there...the 17L or 24. I've NEVER seen another Gen 4 35 in dark earth except online and even then they're pretty damn rare. It shoots like a dream with zero malfunctions ever. I carry this ""war pistol"" literally every single day but baby it, careful not to bang it around. And yeah the 35 is easily carried open or concealed (if you conceal it right). Open carrying it is a good visual detergent as well, with a 22rd mag in her it screams ""leave this guy alone"". Anyway, Dads got a 17L that he carrys and he's not giving it up for nothing so I was hoping maybe someone had a Glock 17L or Glock 24 that just sits in the safe they'd be willing to give up for my 35. I understand the rarity of the 17L or 24 would probably constitute some cash on my end as well but hopefully we could keep it sane. I did pay a pretty penny for my 35 so it's not like I'm offering a hi point in trade or something but still. I have everything it came with from factory, including all 4 matching color back straps. Bought a used G19 in FDE a while ago with no back straps and can't find any anywhere, black but no FDE, but I have them all for the G35 I'm offering."

The blade is about 5 7/8 in long and has slight corrosion at the tip.  Marble made many hunting knives up until just before WWII when they started to make fighting knives for the Armed Forces.
Remington and Kabar also got into this business and Marbles finally dropped out but they are the ones who originally designed knives with a fullers groove, aka “blood groove”.  They made an abundance of these blades before they went out of business and stored them.  When the company was re-started  recently they incorporated the stock of old blades in the newer knives.  I believe this to be one of those but have no proof except for the Invoice from AG Russell where I bought it.

It's barely used at all, i'll go overboard and say it's had 3 mags ran through it. I took it out on two different occasions, once to zero, and once to shoot groups at ~125 yards. Cleaned meticulously after each day of shooting. 

I'm looking to go with the Noveske hammer forged barrel/N4 barrel for this particular SBR upper. The barrel is not painted at all. It is seen in the picture, rifle on the left. The whole rifle is basically brand new, just wanted a painted gun. The upper and Centurion Arms rail are duracoated. Would consider parting with the whole upper. It's a Noveske chainsaw upper, Centurion Arms C4 12"" quad rail, spike's nickel boron m16 BCG. As I mentioned, whole rifle has seen a few mags, of good brass ammo. Barrel is flawless, shoots under an inch with eotech and American eagle ammo. Shoots just as good as my Recon barrel, I'm just going a different route with this rifle.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World
Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for
competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened
recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced
performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front
sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots.
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load
combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass
which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be
used.

b) they need to be our of current production (I can get new ones at wholesale prices), or you have to offer them to me at well below wholesale
c) I do not resell the trades, so they should fit my personal interests (which only include military as well as highly accurate, competition guns - no self defense guns like Glocks, M&Ps, XD*, and the like)
d) the exchange rate should be fair (see here for more: http://www.preciseshooter.com/blog/PriceGuide.aspx

Q. Is the price firm? Will you take XXX (70% of the asking price)?
A. The price is firm.

Q. Will you ship?
A. I prefer to not ship this gun, but I have made exceptions in the past. If you REALLY want it shipped, please understand that I have not fired it, so I don't know if it works, and that if it doesn't, you will have to work with CAI to repair or replace it. Also, shipping is expensive - $40 via insured Priority Mail. It is a very big and heavy box."

The pistol is in excellent condition. I rate it at 95+ No discernible play at the hood or muzzle. Slide to frame fit is just right; snug, not too tight. Finger tight barrel bushing and shortened solid full length guide rod make for easy and tool free field striping. The rifling is crisp and the bore is mirror bright. It cycles smooth and is very accurate. It has been well cared for and seen very little use.

I have just recently replace the internals of the gun which includes the firing pin, extractor and the springs. I have only put 9 rounds through the gun after I changed the internals just to make sure they were working properly. Along with the gun it will come with the original magazine that it came with, two Ruger Mark I magazines, one speed loader for the magazines and 1 box of CCI Mini Mags. This is a great little handgun to teach people how to shoot but even though it is old it is still a very accurate pistol for its age. I will deactivate this ad once it is sold. 

NOTE: The gun does show some wear on the frame as the bluing has faded in some areas

If you send me a email wanting to argue about not selling or trading to Chicago or Cook county residents I will not respond. I'm tired of explaining my self over and over about this issue. You must be a Illinois resident with VALID foid card, sign bill of sale and wait 72 hours as accordance to Illinois state law."

It's a shotgun based on the AK-47 rifle platform. I've put about 100-150 rounds through it with no problems. In fact I'd be keeping it but I upgraded to a 12 ga.

The shotgun comes with the original manual and factory 5-round magazine.  I'm also throwing in an almost-full box of shells that's missing a few from the last time I went out with it.  I paid $799 plus tax for this.  I realize it's a used gun and I'm not asking anywhere near a new price, so if you don't think my price is fair then go buy one elsewhere and don't bother me.

I can include a new BLACKHAWK! padded tactical rifle case for extra.

Yes, I will ship this.  Within Wisconsin it's legal person-to-person.  Outside of Wisconsin I'll need to send it to an FFL dealer.  If your FFL dealer accepts shipments from a private party, great.  If not, you'll have to pay my FFL fees as well.  Either way you'll pay for shipping, around $25 when last I checked.  If I ship it, you won't get the extra shells.  Sorry, that's just the way the laws are.

NOTE: If you e-mail me asking what my lowest price is, or if I still have this, you will not receive a reply of any kind."

Great shape, around 1000 rounds cycled without issue. Original grips and Pierce Grips included, 1 Magazine. 

The ultimate in concealability, the Beretta Bobcat in .22 LR may be tiny, but it is a reliable defensive arm. The tip-up barrel of this double-action pocket pistol allows rounds to be loaded directly into the chamber without slide retraction. Precisely rifled for accuracy, the barrel is forged out of high strength stainless steel. This compact, rugged frame measures just 4.9 inches overall and weighs only 11.5 ounces. The Inox Bobcat model has a stainless steel slide and barrel with an exceptionally corrosion-resistant and durable gray-anodized frame to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The other metal parts (trigger, hammer, trigger guard, safety, magazine, etc.) are black finished."

Still has original box, manual, and brush. It's only had about 200 rounds put through it and still runs like it did when it was new. Has a rail under the barrel so you can attach your favorite flashlight or laser.

If you don't know about the Rhinos, they have their barrels aligned with the lowest cylinder, so the recoil from each shot goes straight back into your wrist and reduces muzzle rise. A rhino will have much less felt recoil and muzzle rise than a conventional magnum revolver. .38 specials out of the Rhino feel like .22lr's and you can go through a box of .357 mag without having sore wrists afterwards. Designed by the same man who designed the Mateba Autorevolver, the Rhino shares a lot of the same characteristics, mainly the lower axis barrel. 

I'm in no real hurry to sell this pistol, I just don't have the time to shoot it anymore and would prefer to have a semiautomatic pistol for home defense. 

I'd prefer to trade this for a HK 45, HK USP (or compact), or a double stack 1911, Sig Sauer 1911, a glock 34 with some cash, ammo, or accessories on your end, but will also take $850 cash for it. Contact me via email with offers, worse I can say is no and will respond to all offers.

One 20 round magazine is included with (4) brand new 25 round magazines*. Barrel is 18"" long, with a chrome lined bore and chamber. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference."

He took a decent buck with it using Brown Bear 203 grain ammo.

The barrel has been cut to 17.5"" and recrowned.  The bolt was bent by cutting and rewelding it.  The stock was cut down some at the front and refinished.  The buttstock has a recoil pad fitted (although not perfectly), but the original metal buttplate can be included and can easily be reinstalled.  There are no iron sights on this rifle, but it has a Picatinny rail installed in place of the rear sight base.  (The rear sight base on a Mosin sits on a 3/8"" dovetail.  This rail adapter goes from 3/8"" dovetail to Picatinny, and has a set screw to stop it from moving under recoil.)

The only think you need to set this gun up for a deer season is to add a ""scout"" style long eye relief scope.  We used a cheap NcStar 2-7x pistol scope, which worked great.

Selling some guns to raise funds for another project, so snatch this Mosin up cheaper than they can be had from Bud's with sporterizing work already done to it."

The FN 1900 was one of John Moses Browning's first pistol designs, before he went on to create the Browning High Power and the 1911.  Browning couldn't find a US company that was interested in this design, so he sold it to the Belgian firm of FN Herstal.

This pistol was pretty worn out when I got it, so it has been refinished with a modern twist.  The entire pistol was Duracoated black, but the controls are all Duracoated ""German red.""

What makes this pistol unique is that it has a recoil spring and guide rod located ABOVE the barrel.  The barrel sits below the guide rod, and the right side of the frame has an ejection port.  Chambered in .32 ACP, this gun doesn't recoil much and is a pleasure to shoot.  When the magazine is empty, an indicator pops up in front of the rear sight to let the shooter know.  The grips are original, and are black, but they appear almost brownish in the pictures because of the flash.  Not a ""collector's item"" per se because of the refinishing (although it could be stripped and reblued if you wanted), but a very nice shooting example of a reliable old firearm.

The safety must be on ""feu"" to fire, and if the safety is on, the slide is locked and cannot be moved.

Includes one magazine, a few rounds of hollow points and a Blackhawk brand belt holster."
