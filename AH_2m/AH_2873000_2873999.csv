It is in good condition but there are a few pieces missing such as the front and rear sights. These parts can be ordered and put on the rifle without gunsmith assistance to return the rifle to its original condition if desired. However, it shoots great with the attached Bushnell Elite 3200 10x40mm mil reticle scope which is included. The scope mount does not permanently modify the gun and can be removed if desired as well. The scope is nearly brand new and I do have the original box and manual for it.

I am selling this rifle for significantly less than any other No4Mk1 that I can find online due to the few missing components, and the holes in the stock pictured below. I made the holes recently when installing a bipod and then realized I was being an idiot.

The rifle also comes with 207 NEW PRODUCTION 174gr rounds (about 75 cents/rd + shipping new) and 60 rounds of corrosive surplus 174gr ammunition. 

The ammo can, surplus Enfield sling, and hard case are included as well.

I know $475 is steep for an Enfield, but considering the scope is $200+ on its own, not to mention the $160+ worth of ammo plus the scope rings, mount, and case, this is a very fair deal."

I have had this gun for years and it had always had a special place in my nightstand, so it is in great condition, with only about 150 rounds through it. I've decided to sell this because the majority of my pistols are chambered in 40 S&W and the AMT has been collecting dust in my safe since I purchased a Glock model 22 a few years back. 
When this AMT was originally produced, I believe it was the smallest 45 on the market (5 + 1 rounds of pure stopping power) - even today your options are limited if you are looking for a small double action 45. If you intend on using this as a CCW, you will love the trigger - it was designed to be heavy so you can carry with a chambered round without fear of a negligent discharge.  Overall, this is an all metal, high quality, highly sought after pistol for those who know about them. I have 2 magazines (factory 5 round) and a basic holster. If interested, contact me via email or cell REDACTED). The price for everything is $390 - you pay transfer fees at FFL."

I would like to sell as a package deal. If I cannot get $2750 for the package I'll sell just the rifle for $1800 and keep the optic. The rifle only has 250 rounds through it. Using only Sierra match king factory rounds. Very clean accurate shooter. Those who know these rifles know there getting a great package deal. All together this package is worth $5000.  Price is negotiable to a certain extent. Just don't low ball me. Not interested in any trades at this time. Thank you"

(Valor Series Bobtail Commander)

The popular Bobtail Commander is now available in the Valor series. Valor and the new V-Bob are available in a matte stainless finish.

These guns are the realization of all of their desires in a defensive style 1911. They offer everything you need and nothing you don't.

The Valor series features a forged frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back and undercut trigger guard, Heinie Ledge Straight Eight night sights and slim line G10 grips as well as billet alloy steel fire controls and all the other premium small parts you have come to expect from Dan Wesson. While the components are the best available, the components alone do not make the gun. We believe the Valor series is the best built production 1911 on the market.

G10 Master Series Grips:

Machined to fit seamlessly while bringing both artistry and rugged engineering to John Browning's classic 1911 design, Master Series™ Lasergrips® are sure to impress. Featuring ergonomic and aggressively durable G10 side panels with a rubber overmolded activation button; these are the ultimate laser sights. Standard to Crimson Trace Lasergrips, the LG-906 features Instinctive Activation™. This means that the laser sight automatically springs to life when the weapon is held in a natural firing grip.

For those unfamiliar with this gun this is Walther's striker fired DA/SA platform. Aside from the great ergonomics you'd expect from Walther, this gun's trigger is where it shines. The SA pull is very crisp and the reset is incredibly short making follow up shots a breeze. DA is long and smooth, perfect for carry. The sights on this gun are another nice feature, you have complete control over POA vs POI. Rear sight is windage adjustable and you get 4 front posts of varying height for your choosing. Comes with everything from the factory (case, paperwork, backstraps, front sight posts, etc.) plus one extra 15 round mag (3 total). Estimated round count: Around 500.

It was made for a .338 win mag but will work with any other Remington 700 magnum or long action rifle. The barrel channel is for the magnum contour. If you have a varmint contour barrel, you can send the stock in to McMillan and they will open up the channel so the barrel floats. If you have a sporter contour barrel, then you’ll have a small gap on each side and it will surely be floated. I’m not sure what the fill is; I believe it is magnum fill but I cannot be certain. It has been professionally bedded but it’s not a big deal to chip out some it and have it redone. Any competent gunsmith or DIYer can do this. Has a sling swivel on the front and rear and a 1” decelerator recoil pad. The stock wasn’t used very much and is in very good condition with only a few minor scratches and dings. Anyone that is familiar with McMillan knows that their product is built to last and if there are ever any issues, they will take care of you. Any other questions, please ask. If you were to buy this stock new directly from McMillan, it would run you $567 shipped and the wait would be 6 months. I am looking to get $425 OBO for this. Can send more pics upon request.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

I have just the thing for your gun collection. This is a used, but in superb condition, beautiful stainless steel Ruger SP-101 in the hard to find 32 H&R magnum caliber, with a 3 inch barrel and 6 shot cylinder. The 32 H&R magnum is very controllable point and shoot gun with a mild recoil compared to the newer 327 Federal Magnum. A great caliber suitable for people who are recoil-sensitive, such as some women and/or for some older folks (like me), for whom even shooting 38 special in airweight frames is still too recoil heavy for them. In this all steel Ruger, the 32 H&R is pretty tame. The trigger is smooth, and it is a rock solid, super strong revolver. In addition the advantage of the 32 H&R over the 38 special, is that in small frame J style revolvers like this one, you have an extra shot: 6 shots with the 32 H&R compared to only 5 shots with the 38 Special. 
Nice extras included are a Hogue grip installed, two speed loaders, good Ruger case, and 20 rounds of 32 H&R Magnum 95 grain lead semi-wadcutter to start you off. A gun smith has inspected it and smoothed the action. Also I will pay for transfer through FFL. Goodie package worth well over $100.

If you don't get to buy this one find another later.  Great gun despites all the criticism.  I owned one so I know.  Everything in it works like a Glock except the trigger pull that's a little longer.  For 250 to 300 bucks less than a Glock you get a Smith&wesson (life time warranty) that will always go bam when you pull the trigger. Mine did more than 500 times already so there's no reason it wouldn't do so in front of the bad guy. People just don't believe Good things can be affordable sometimes.  Don't drink The kool aid like most and believe that it's the only  good drink. Good luck to all! Cpl requiered.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

The scope has three different turrets for different grain bullets that have the yardages marked out externally for quick, easy, and accurate adjustments without having to try and remember or guess. It also comes with the Harris style bipod pictured as well as 3 new magazines which are over $100 alone. This is a very nice shooting gun with a smooth bolt and nice accutrigger system. I shot 2 mags through it to sight it in and haven't shot it since.  I am also going to throw in a neoprene sling,swivels,a soft case,and  100 rounds of steel cased .223 for the $400 price. You can't beat that deal for all new stuff. Sorry no trades, and don't ask to go down, this is way under what all this is worth.  I wouldn't let it go but need the cash."
