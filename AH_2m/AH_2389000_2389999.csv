FMJ-FN (1350FPS / M.E.931 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Friday, November 29, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=230

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels. This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six. The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber. It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too."

Top of box indicates 1 ounce No. 5 chilled shot.  Front indicates long range short shot string and states ""Progressive Burning Smokeless Powder.  STAYNLESS."" 
Shells are high brass and in excellent condition for their age. 
Box exhibits slight bulging and some fading.  Flaps are intact and all of the writing on the box is clearly legible.  
An inside flap advertises the Winchester model 12, model 97 and model 21.  With these three guns in production, the date of this box would fit between 1930 and 1957.  It is probably closer to the 1930 end of the spectrum and probably pre WWII.  Nice gun room display or for the ammo box collector.

These are old shells and probably should not be fired in your shotgun. All ammunition is for collecting/decorative purposes only and we in no way guarantee or imply them to be functional in anyway other than collecting or decorative purposes.

I bought this from the original owner who stated he bought it in 1975 which would make it one of the first several hundred AKs ever imported. My Research has also shown this to be fact because of the early markings of only a 66 in a triangle designating manufacture at the Norinco 66 factory which was the same factory the Chinese military's AKs were manufactured at. All later imports are marked type 56s for 56 sporter. I have yet to see another one marked like this. As stated this rifle has never been fired by the previous original owner or myself and only displays signs of storage wear. Comes with the 3 mags and the bayonet that came with the rifle from the original owner.  Price is firm as this is a bargain for an Unfired type 56. No trades. E-mail, call, or text, REDACTED."

Reliability, versatility, and value make the Model 2000 the ideal semi-auto shotgun. Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. The Defense version of the 2000 features a matte black synthetic stock with a pistol grip and a blade front sight.

I am open to trades, but mostly interested in handguns such as the xds 9mm (post recall, or already fixed) glocks, 1911s or maybe a S&W 357 Revolver, Ruger Mini 30, SKS, saiga 12, possibly an AK or SKS. I will consider a multi gun trade if it peaks my interest, also willing to trade down with a cash difference on your end. Cash is king!! I would also accept partial trades for Russian Spam cans of 5.45x39 or bulk 62g 5.56x45 green tips, or an EOTech"

Chambered in a 5.45x39, the best thing I like about the 74s are the accessibility and AFFORDABILITY of the ammo! I got this ammo for only 4 dollars per box of 30 rounds! This is the second AK74 I have, and if I didn't have a mini14 I had to pay off of layaway I definitely wouldn't be selling it. Think 5.56 with MORE knockdown power, a larger projectile, and MORE accessibility (5.45s are never sold out) with LESS COST!
 Best thing about this gun (other than being brand new) is that its a direct import, meaning it still has the selector lever on opposite side of upper receiver to change to fully automatic. All that's required is a class 3 license and one simple shear pin and its fully operational. Upgraded with a Hogue pistol grip and vintage Polish sling, also new/never used.

 Buy the rifle alone for 650 - buy the entire package deal for 799 ... this includes the rifle, sling, 8 new mags, and 700 rounds of unopened, boxed ammo. You won't find a better deal.

 Spend 800+ on an AR15 that's probably on the cheap end or spend 800 dollars for a Russian made AK direct-import that comes with 700 rounds and enough mags to hold 230 rounds at one time! 
 Thanks!

Chambered in a 5.45x39, the best thing I like about the 74s are the accessibility and AFFORDABILITY of the ammo! I got this ammo for only 4 dollars per box of 30 rounds! This is the second AK74 I have, and if I didn't have a mini14 I had to pay off of layaway I definitely wouldn't be selling it. Think 5.56 with MORE knockdown power, a larger projectile, and MORE accessibility (5.45s are never sold out) with LESS COST!
 Best thing about this gun (other than being brand new) is that its a direct import, meaning it still has the selector lever on opposite side of upper receiver to change to fully automatic. All that's required is a class 3 license and one simple shear pin and its fully operational. Upgraded with a Hogue pistol grip and vintage Polish sling, also new/never used.

 Buy the rifle alone for 650 - buy the entire package deal for 800: this includes the rifle, sling, 8 new mags, and 700 rounds of unopened, boxed ammo. You won't find a better deal.

 Spend 800+ on an AR15 that's probably on the cheap end or spend 800 dollars for a Russian made AK direct-import that comes with 700 rounds and enough mags to hold 230 rounds at one time!

She asked if I could wait a few days while she got the money together, and I did. She texted me a few times over the next few days just to keep in touch with me and she seemed like a very nice person . Well I ended up waiting 8 days for her and then she texted me and said she was ready to meet with me to buy gun . I suggested a place fairly close to her to meet to transfer the pistol. Here is the good part , she didn't want to transfer the pistol she just wanted to meet somewhere and give me money and take the gun. So once I told her that she had to transfer the pistol into her name she vanished and was never heard from again. So do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM VIOLET IN WHITEHALL PA."

The Walther PPS has been said to be the best compact ccw on the market. Any review of this weapon system holds it in high remarks. The Police Pistol Slim (PPS) packs Walther innovation into an unbelievable 1.04""-wide profile. Available in 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS has several notable features aimed at better fit and safe performance in its narrow dimensions. From your choice of perfect-fitting backstrap (small or large) to the patented QuickSafe™ innovation, the PPS sets the bar high for competing designs. Ambidextrous magazine release is easily located by right-and left-handed shooters. Loaded chamber and cocking indicators show when a round is chambered and the pistol is ready to fire. Three safety systems ensure peace of mind. A trigger safety and internal striker safety prevent accidental discharge. Simply remove the QuickSafe™ backstrap when storing the pistol to prevent the PPS from firing. The 9mm caliber comes with a seven-round magazine."

SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Stabilizing Brace, a shooter's aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil
when using an AR-style pistol.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols
equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" -- 1.2"" in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the
operator's forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A
flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features
- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- ATF compliant*
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA
- Quick and easy to install

* ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control.

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of every SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace goes to support the veterans of HAVA (Honored American Veterans Afield).

It says its made at the Waffen factory in berlin, which adds a nice touch of history, but it has been sporterized. Heres what I found out about this rifle due to the markings it has on it, I believe it was made in 1901 based on a mark on the stock, It was exported from germany where the 7mm never really caught on cause they loved theyre 8mm, to argentina or chile in south America then imported here at some point, unknown year. I shot it thanksgiving day and its incredibly accurate. It comes with about 70 rounds of milsurp ammo and three stripper clips, and other ammo is available at a pretty good price online, good deer gun. The action is beatuiful, smooth and solid, rifling is good and well defined, metal has some color differential but no pitting. Stock has a few chips but ill include everything you need to refinish the stock if you want it. Including sand paper, varnish and brush.

I need to sell this so please make an offer. Due to its make it was valued at 300 in its current condition. I would like to get 225 out of it but make a resonable offer. No lowballers. Thanks,

I'll start by saying this pistol is extremely reliable and and very accurate. I bought the PX4 from a friend of mine, who was the original owner, about a year or so ago. This PX4 is a ""Type-C"" which basically just signifies it as a DAO pistol. No safeties,  and a bobbed hammer from the factory. Otherwise, it is the same as the rest of the PX4 line. It is a full sized firearm,  chambered in 40 S&W to give you 14+1. Comes with Trijicon night sights installed (still glow nicely), 4 Beretta Mags, and a Fobus holster. It has very minimal holster wear and some barrel hood wear from cycling (the usual). I am taking offers at this point, but please don't low ball. If you would like more pics, just send me a message and I'll send them over to you!  Thanks for looking.

I would like to meet FTF as I do not want to ship the pistol, and preferably local. I am free for morning-early afternoon transfers, and weekends are no problem. Buyer pays transfer fee. Any questions on anything you see, don't hesitate to ask!"
