Why am I selling this black pearl you ask ? because im not man enough for this monster and it currently doesn't start haha. The battery died a week ago cause i left the lights on and when I asked my girlfriend to help me jump it she accidently crossed the jumper cables, so after putting a brand new battery in it theres still no power I've checked all the fuses and replaced two of the inline fuses but honestly im done dicking around with it, I was told its more than likely the starter solenoid but I just dont have the time or resources to keep messing with it so my loss is your gain cause when you get the power working again the 350 purs like a kitten and the transmission shifts smooth.

The action is still intact and working.  It also has the original pushrod on it.  This particular rifle originally had a nearly full length stock.  At some point long ago, the stock was either shortened or replaced with a shorter one.  Whoever did it did a very good job and it looks as if it belongs on the rifle.

I'm interested in an 18 inch or longer barrel (bull, heavy or standard barrel) model (not especially interested in 16 inch models). 
The rifle doesn't have to look nice, as long as it functions well  (scratches, scrapes not a problem). I'm looking for something I can scope, accurize and shoot (scope not required). If you want to include a scope with your rifle, we can talk about what it is and what you want for it.
I'd prefer to trade for your rifle, if possible. Here's what I can offer for trade:

-Rifles to choose from (I might consider selling any of these, as well)-
1 Springfield M1A Loaded .308 (with Archangel stock, 6-9 inch pivoting bipod, and VLTOR full length top rail)- includes 5 magazines....est cash/trade value $1600

1 Mosin Nagant rifle 7.62x54 (with Rock Solid scope mount, Primary Arms 4-16x50mm Mil-Dot scope, and a custom SV98 wood stock w/aluminum pillars- barrel is fully free-floating)...est cash/trade value $400

-Night Vision Gear-
1 NV monocular (US Gen 2), head, helmet or rifle mountable, will fit the bullpup AK rear sight rail with included PVS-14 Rail Mount), pocket-sized...est cash value $400
1 ATN MO3-2 monocular (US Gen 2), basically a mid-sized pocket scope...est cash value $300

Will accept straight-across (gun-for-gun/value-for-value) trades, your rifle+cash (or ammo/accessories to make-up the difference), or possible multi-gun trades (more than one of mine or yours). 

If you have a .308 AR, or know someone that has one and wants to trade or sell it, let me know. I've had a few offers, but would like to see what else is out there before the choice is made (I'd like to wrap it up within the next week, if possible.

Has 26"" barrel with Weatherby Accu-Brake. Also has Weatherby Supreme 3X9 Scope. 

Rifle is in very good condition, scope has a few marks from years of hunting in the mountains of Montana and Alaska. Rifle has taken 3 Moose, 24 Elk, 17 Mule deer, 1 Grizzly and 9 Black bear. I purchased new from Weatherby custom shop in 1989 with accurizing and lapped lugs and long throat options for large grain bullets.  is originally came with the fancy european exhibition grade walnut stock but the recoil lug kept breaking loose when I would shoot 250gr bullets, so it was replaced with a custom medalist stock that is free floated and aluminum pillar and bedding block system. 

Rifle was freshened up (de-fouled, action tuned, and barrel checked) 2 years ago by Upper Missouri Trading Company in Creston, Nebraska (Weatherby's Midwest Service Center). It took its last Elk, October of 2012 in Montana. I am too broken to hunt but the rifle is not!

A set of reloading dies, bullets, brass, reloads go with the rifle. If you do your homework you will see that the .340 mag is one of the flattest trajectories out there. Only a 7"" arc from muzzle to point of impact at 400yds with 165gr ammo.

A new Ultramark is $2500-$5500 depending on options. I will let this go for $1,000 or best offer."

It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public.

The Stoner Rifle 15 series are semi-automatic rifles featuring a 16"" chrome chamber barrel, a URX free floating barrel system, an ambidextrous control system, a two-stage trigger, an improved multi-lug E3 bolt and integral front sight and sling mounts.

Round count prior to that is unknown, but it functions perfectly, has a good bore, is extremely accurate, and cylinder timing is correct and tight. There is a small amount of light freckling/rust on the backstrap of the frame/grip, as it was that way when I bought it, but in no way affects function, and is merely cosmetic.

I think it was made it 1923 but I would have to dig again to double check. Either way it was made in the 20s. This gun has about 85-90% of its bluing left on it. Action is smooth and this rifle shoots very nice. The but plate has some pitting on it but that is the only part of the gun with any. This is just a very nice rifle for its age and it is only going up in value. The grade ""c"" is the lowest of the higher grade guns.  The Blue Book of Gun Values Lists this rifle for about $800 plus 20% for the thumbnail safety on the bolt. Thats $960. When I contacted the Remington Society of America and asked them what the grade ""c"" premium would be they said add $400 to the blue book value. So the appraised value of this gun is $1360. I would like $800 cash or $1000 on trade for a nice crossbow or other rifle or pistol.

This is a Nikko model 512 12 gauge O/U 26"" rib vent made in Japan. These guns were made of some of the highest quality walnuts and were made at the same factory as the Winchester 101's with the better parts before they made the Winchesters for them. I have not had a chance to shoot this one yet but I have another O/U from Nikko and it is hands down the best O/U I have ever had the opportunity to shoot. 

There are very few of the model 512's available for sale across the internet ranging from $700 to $850. This one is completly original with no parts being changed out as far as but plate and what not, from the looks it has been shot very little although there are signs of use. Easily a 90% if not 95% gun.

This is a Kowa 88mm High Performance TSN-884 Spotting Scope with Kowa TE-10Z 20-60X Zoom Eyepiece, and Gitzo Carbon 6X Tripod for sale or trade. Asking price is $2,500. This is about a $3,600 value.  I would consider a trade for either a nice watch, or a Remington 700 with a Leupold Mk IV scope.

The 884 features the pure fluorite crystal “PROMINAR” 88-mm objective lens, the Kowa TSN-884 offers simply unsurpassed light throughput for the brightest, aberration free images. Despite the huge lens, the durable magnesium frame helps limit the weight of the Kowa TSN-884 to less than 54 oz. Kowa’s inner focus system shortens the prism box on the TSN-884 scope, giving it a compact 13.5 inch length. The Kowa TSN-884 spotting scope features a dual focus system with separate knobs for coarse and fine focusing, an eyepiece locking mechanism, and a tripod mount that adapts to accommodate either a 1/4- or a 3/8-inch mounting screw. With its superb optics and Kowa’s special adapters, the TSN-884 makes a great digiscoping rig. The Kowa TSN-884 scope is completely waterproof and nitrogen-purged to be internally fog-proof. 

The Gitzo tripod features a 6X carbon fiber tube, made of a unique structure of 6 crossed layers that maximises rigidity, vibration absorption and lightweight performance. 6X tube has a high density structure made of top quality ultra-thin carbon fibers (7mm or 0.007 mm). Built-in Anti Leg Rotation is now a feature of the whole carbon fiber range. Tripod also has a Gitzo G1177M series 1 Center Ball Head.

 Asking $2,500 or will consider a trade for a Springfield M1a, or Remington 700 with a decent optic like a Leupold Mk IV.

From a review in Accurateshooter.com by Danny Reever: 
One of my tests included a Snellen Eye Chart, just like the one at your optometrist office. Instead of it hanging on a wall, I placed the Snellen Chart at 500 meters along with some previously-shot paper Ground Hog targets. Conditions were hazy and humid with moderate mirage. My Nightforce 12-42x56mm Benchrest riflescope set at 42X could read line 6 on the chart and I could distinguish only a few of the 6mm bullet holes. My Pentax PF100-ED set at 60X (to match the Kowa’s maximum power) was better. With the Pentax I could read line 7 on the chart and see more of the bullet holes. With the Kowa set at 60X, I could read line 8 on the chart and see all of the bullet holes on the white parts of the targets.. FYI, line 8 on the Snellen Chart defines 20-20 vision at 20 feet. Reading that at 500 meters (1641 feet) is pretty impressive!"

With the P938, Sig Sauer offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm
cartridge in a platform similar in size to the P238 pistol. A
single-action-only trigger coupled with full-size Siglite Night Sights

concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP
counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal
frame and the most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line. The
cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy
in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine
release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety
makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Item 90021 comes
with the standard 6 round magazine & holster.

A sturdy, rubber-coated, folding wire-frame stock with integral rubber buttpad collapses easily over the receiver for convenient storage and mobility in tight spaces such as vehicles, motorcycles, hallways, and entryways. Shooters testing the SpecOps Folder with magnum buckshot loads found that there is virtually no muzzle rise and that recoil was significantly reduced in both the open and folded positions.

Selling my lightly used Glock 22, Gen 3 with Glock factory installed night sights..

I love this gun, but I'm looking for something a little smaller that will print less for EDC. 

Gun is in excellent condition, comes with the hard plastic case, two 15 round factory Glock magazines, and cleaning brush as well as original owners manual. Gun has a polished factory connector, makes the trigger firm and crisp, but a little lighter than factory.

 After WW2, from 1945 to 1957 no P38s were produced for the German military. However, when the newly formed ""Bundeswehr"" (German Defense Force) announced it wanted the P38 as its official service pistol, Walther resumed production of the P38 and the first ones were delivered to the West German military in June 1957. This particular gun was produced October 1957 (10/57 stamped) for the Bundeswehr. It bears the eagle markings and ""BW"" stamp.
