The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

ERGONOMIC

Superior design features give the XD-S™ capabilities that not all pistols of its size can claim. Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

Picatinny Rail System
A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Short Reset Trigger
The new XD-S™ trigger has a short travel along with a short reset which helps to keep you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots.

Snag Free Sights
The rear sight on the XD-S™ is low-profile and holster friendly. Easier and faster target acquisition is achieved with a fiber optic front sight.

Making the XD-S™ easy and comfortable to fire is one the highest priorities of the XD® line. Many characteristics of the XD-S™ model are especially beneficial to those with a concealed carry license, like the less bulky frame and ability to customize the grip.

Mould-Tru Backstraps
With two interchangeable backstraps, Springfield Armory® has stayed true to their focus on providing the user with the most comfortable, and easy to point pistol possible by allowing you to custom fit your grip.

Slim Contour Frame
The ideal grip angle of the XD-S™ is accented by the 1” single stack frame.

Sure Grasp Slide Serrations
The serrations on the XD-S™ not only make this firearm more attractive, they are functional. The slightly rounded design, extending to the top of the slide, limits the possibility of a snag when drawing the pistol."

3.  SIXTEEN new C batteries - the correct amount to stock all 4 cams with new batts.

I bought these this last year then ended up never having time to use them.  Not gonna hunt for a few years.  Comes with the instruction manual as shown.  These are the model GSC30-30.  3.0 MP cams with strobe & infrared.  Good cams; lots of features.  Each cam has bungi cords to hang them - everything to need to put them up now.

New Price:  Everything is yours for $130 FTF, or $155 shipped to your door.

Oh, although never used, as you can see from the pics, I numbered them 1 through 4 with a permanent marker.  I also added some redneck camo to 2 of them, to make them look more like branches.  My idea was that I'd place two along trails down low, but then at each location, put the ""camo'ed"" one hidden up high in a branch, pointed down watching the normal one, so that if stolen, I'd have the evidence.  The marked up ones ARE actually harder to spot hung on a tree limb in the woods than the ""normal"" ones, believe it or not.  I checked it - as I say, just never actually used these.

The tires still have a lot of tread on it, however one of the tires has a small slit on the sidewall. I measured 9/32 and they come new with 12/32. These tire get great reviews for tire wear so I would guess they still have over 50,000 miles left on them.

 The tires new run around $225 (Wal-Mart) and I couldn't find the wheels for less than $400 each. So new would cost around $2500. Asking $1150 obo.

I've been making holsters for a little while now. Its all been word of mouth and its all going pretty well. That being said I've been limited to making holsters for firearms I currently own or for friends who leave me their handgun so the holster is fitted to their firearm. I've made several rigs for the Glock 17 family but I'm wanting to do a 92fs/m9. In the past I've only been charging what my cost is (usually between $9-$18 per holster) Since I don't own a 92fs I'm looking for someone who wants a free custom holster for their gun. All I need is to keep your gun for 4-5 days to get the mold right and do up all the fitting. I can provide pictures of past work as well as a few contacts if you want to check me out. I would be willing to sign a receipt for the firearm and provide a drivers license or whatever proof you'd like to verify who I am.

It has a 24"" barrel, Bushmaster lower receiver, it has the pepper pot muzzle brake, a Midwest Industries hand guard, an adjustable butt stock and a bi-pod. It has been professionally finished with Cerakote.

Although much has been written about its tactical uses, the .50 Beowulf is gaining recognition as a sporting cartridge. By virtue of its ballistics which are similar or superior to those of the venerable .45-70 Government[6] cartridge it is becoming more widely recognized as being usable for a wide variety of North American game, including deer, moose and black bear.

The cartridge utilizes a rebated rim, sized to match the rim of the 7.62x39mm and 6.5 mm Grendel rounds. The case body is very similar in dimensions to the .500 S&W Magnum revolver cartridge, being slightly longer and fully tapered for automatic feeding in the weapon.
The round is intended to improve stopping power greatly at short- to medium-range as compared to the standard 5.56x45mm NATO round. One of its advertised uses is at vehicle checkpoints, since the heavy bullet's flight path is not easily deflected by auto glass or standard vehicle body panels.

I am open to trades, just let me know what you have and we can see if we can make it work."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size; (subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

-Pristine bore and gas system, none of the corrosion issues that plague these rifles from a lack of protective hard chrome. I've only ever fired commercial ammunition through it, no corrosive surplus
-Receiver/barrel finish is original and in fantastic shape
-Metal and wood have both been extensively cleaned of cosmoline
-comes with 20 stripper clips

The bad:

The previous owner decided to try to turn this rifle into something it wasn't instead of just buying the WASR-10 he wanted to begin with. The original stock and dust cover were long-gone when I got it, replaced with Ramline composite and a useless Chinese scope mount cover respectively. I've replaced the stock with surplus Yugo wood and removed the mount from the dust cover, but up front the mag and receiver serial numbers will not match the stock.

The rifle has a shallow crack on one side of the buttstock and like most of these guns has a repair splice at the top of the butt. Aside from that the stock has no dings or gouges and has some of the most beautiful wood I've seen on a surplus rifle, with blonde highlights and intermittent striping. The barrel, bolt, and receiver have some finish wear as is to be expected from a 48 year old surplus rifle but the metal shows no pitting or corrosion damage. The bore is shiny and the rifling sharp as can be seen in the images below.

It is in excellent shape, 10 out of 10. Still have the box it came in. Here is some information I pulled off the internet on the rifle, if you are not familiar with this shotgun. 

The Akdal MKA-1919 is semi-automatic, magazine fed, 12 gauge shotgun made in turkey by Ucyildiz Arms. Resembling an oversize AR-15 the MKA 1919 utilizes the M16 style safety selector, bolt release, magazine release and has a removable carry handle rear sight, making it the perfect companion shotgun for 3 gun, home defense and even hunting. The self regulating nature of the gas system enables the MKA 1919 lightweight shotgun to effortlessly run 2 3/4 and 3 inch shotshells, while not punishing the shooter with excessive recoil. The interchange choke tubes allow for versatility both in the target bay, in the field and in the home. 

Three internal chokes, Full, Modified and Cylinder Bore. Chrome lined barrel. Gas operated-piston driven below the barrel. Self adjusting gas system. Carrying handle sight is removable with a Picatinny rail on upper receiver ready for your optics. Front sight is also removable to facilitate optics on the rail. A svelte 6.5 pounds empty.

The barrel will be cleaned, refinished and then coated. The turn around time will be under 3 weeks from the time we receive the barrel. It is usually even much shorter than that. We offer better pricing, better quality and a faster turn around than any of our competitors. 

For those not familiar with Titanium Nitride it is unique in terms of firearm finishes as it not only gives a custom look to your firearm it also adds durability and reduces the friction on the coated part. This allows you to run your firearm with less oil/lube, vastly increases the durability, and makes cleaning much easier. Another plus with Titanium Nitride is the average coating only adds 3 micrometers of material, so it will not change the function of your firearm only enhance the look and performance of it. It is applied in a cathodic arc chamber which ensures a uniform coating. This is the same coating that is used by high speed cutting tools to give you an idea of its strength.

If you have any questions please let us know. Thanks for taking the time to look!

Frequently Asked Questions:
1. What other colors do you offer? We offer gold, rose, carbon black and silver.
2. Does this include a barrel? No, this is for the coating of your existing barrel. Once you purchase, we will send you the information on where to send your barrel.
3. Can you coat threaded barrels? Yes we can, it doesn't alter the threads and actually offers them some protection.
4. Can you coat aftermarket barrels? Yes we can, in fact aftermarket barrels coatings are a large part of our business.
5. Can you coat my slide or other small parts? We can coat any part that is steel, stainless steel, or titanium. We do not coat aluminum. Contact us for more information.
6. Does this coat the inside of the barrel? If will coat inside the crown and chamber, the areas where most wear occurs.
7. Is there any difference in the colors hardness? No, they are all equally durable and in the 80-90 range on the Rockwell Scale. The Titanium Nitride is much more durable than the steel it coats."

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

If you are not familiar with the SU-16, it is a lightweight rifle that uses AR magazines and is piston operated much like an AK-type rifle. A hybrid that provides the best of both worlds. A clean running rifle that uses AR-15 magazines. They are fairly basic rifles from the factory that beg for lots of user improvement. This rifle is one of the most improved that you will find while still being easily converted back to a basic SU-16 rifle if needed.

This rifle has seen light range use, about 500 rounds total fired. It is in Very Good condition, and was cleaned well after each use. This rifle has spent most of its life in the safe. Some wear marks in finish on front sight post from rifle case.
