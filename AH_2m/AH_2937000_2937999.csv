It looks like the front pivot pin is .250 in diameter, and I can't really tell what size the fire control pins are. I have a set of calipers but I'm hesitant to go poking pins out because this thing is in such great shape that I don't want to take the chance on scratching it up. The previous owner reported that there were 40 rounds fired since it was made in 1994, but to me it looks as if it's been fired even less, if it's even been fired at all. I paid $1,200 for it, that's all I'm trying to get back out of it. I've never shot it, I just bought it, cleaned it and stuck it in my safe."

Stock # MMH195211EE. Serial # 113xx. This is also one of many P-38 Pistols we currently have in stock. We will briefly describe the weapon, but if you need more details, call our in-store Military Firearms Expert, Randy Thompson, during business hours @: 3239292378. This is a fairly RARE Walther HP (Heers Pistole), this gun was the forerunner of the P-38. Looking just like a P-38, the pistol is chambered for 9mm, it has Walther markings on the left side of the slide and a Nazi waffenamp on the right side. The magazine is not marked. The magazine has a polished commercial blue factory finish and dark brown plastic factory grips. The pistol has 2 issues – it is very unobtrusively import-marked on the top of the backstrap. More glaring is the SN (“11345”) that is crudely scratched on the right side of the slide. The pistol aso has some scratches and service marks on the finish. The de-cocker/safety works correctly, it has a crisp bore. Despite the obvious flaws, this is a rare handgun, and it’s a significant pistol in the history of the P-38. This is a chance to pick up a genuine Walther HP at a real “bargain” price, relatively speaking. We do not have any accessories or a box for this gun. .***Please contact us with specific questions BEFORE bidding on an item**"

This particular rifle is the older version of the 25 with what is called the ""reverse/backwards"" safety. Basically you pull the switch back to fire instead of the push style. The rifle shows some signs of use, but not in that bad of shape. The stock could use some attention probably sanded and refinished. You can see in the photo by the butt plate the discoloration is what needs work. Not a hard thing to do, I just do not want to mess with it.

415,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2937415,For Sale/Trade:  Price Lowered - 22LR Ammo / 9mm Ammo - Possible Trade - Need To Sell ASAP,"Newburgh, Evansville, Indiana",$ 100,"Listed On: Sunday, April 13, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"-MORE IS MENTIONED THAN SEEN IN PICS- 

All unopened in box, will take $100 for the lot and will consider trades if I see they are worth it. 

Will also take offers for each type,  wasn't really wanting to get rid of the 9mm ammo but I am sure I will get offers now that I included that.

Due to popular request(s) and interest(s) in the 22 ammo, here is my breakdown on pricing so I might get bites. I think it works best for both ends to buy it all together but if I have to I will break it all up though;

9mm  - $50 for both boxes - This price is very warranted if you look up the ammo (look em up, add tax) These are no BS rounds and have serious quality stopping power. 

The Hornady rounds will go for 25$ by themselves, the Gold Dot's will go for 30$.

Am now open to trades but would really like to get some money to feed the family, my contract was terminated last Friday and I am trying to figure out my next move on what to do but nobody is biting on what I am throwing out there yet with the ammo.

I may have some other ammo that I can throw in that are 22, maybe a 22/45 magazine as well, but I don't really want to get rid of this stuff, just trying to provide for the family.

So that leaves the big pile of 22 ammo going for 50$ which is probably what I paid for them including gas plus tax.

The price you see is less than what I saw for loose ammo from less reputable ammo companies at the last local gunshow. People are fine with buying at gunshows 22LR 50 rounds for 7.50 a box. 

I can be emailed or texted at 
collaboratingcollective @ gmail . com    just delete the spacing and you are good to go.

Can meet or deliver within a reasonable radius, will only accept Cash unless you can convince me to trade.

Please don't flag or remove this, there is definitely enough mentioned to warrant a 100+ price tag, I know how people get about 22 related posts but I am selling over 75% of my stash of it and if you consider a collection that is under 1000 rounds of 22LR excessive then you are a bit crazy.

Have a good one, I have a baby, my wife, and myself to feed and as of today I have another bill that I need to get paid."

This is a REAL 1958 Chinese Military Type 56 SKS made in the famous Jianshe /26\ factory, war used, time tested, and as tough as nails.  It is a Jianshe Factory rifle with the original and desirable /26\ factory marking! Complete numbers matching rifle!

This is a 1958 Type 56 SKS, one of the early ones that were made under Russian supervision on Russian set-up equipment.  These are of the highest quality of SKS's, with all milled parts.

Was a Century import.  Thorough removed all of the cosmoline from the entire rifle and sweated the cosmoline out of the stock.  Sanded and refinished the stock, and kept the bumps and bruises for character, and clean/oiled the metal.  Overall in EXCELLENT shape!  The stock has no cracks and the bluing is in great shape!  A few small pits under the stock, but that's it.

With the early blade type Bayonet.  The Blade type was the original bayonet style, not the cheap spike!

Here is your chance to purchase an original Chinese military Type 56 SKS with the /26\ factory marking!  You'd be hard pressed to find a better SKS.

I have the trigger and box tag from importation with the ORIGINAL test-fire case from the 50's!  I took the butt plate completely off and the round was in the upper hole in the stock.  Not the hole where the cleaning kit goes, but another hole that is not accessible with the butt plate on.  A pretty unique find to have the original test-fire cartridge!

Looking for $450
E-mail me, and I'll respond to every offer.
If this ad is still up, I still have the rifle."

Someone did an excellent job of polishing and plating and the finish looks to be an easy 98%. The only thing they seem to have missed was the “dummy scratch”. Then they plated everything down to the grip screws and the two tone lanyard loop magazine. For contrast the hammer and thumb safety are gold plated. The bore is excellent and the grips look like an excellent quality reproduction of the double diamond Colt grips. The plating is in super shape and has no bubbles or pealing. This is a nice shooter Colt with a little bit of flash. It will require an FFL to ship and a C&R will be fine where legal. A 3 day visual, non loading, non-firing or dis-assembly inspection is given with returns only if not as described and returned in condition shipped. Since even if I have shot the gun I can't attest to the strength or suitability of the gun for modern ammo, this is being sold primarily as a collector's item. This in no way relates as to the safety of the gun, but just means that you should have it checked by a competent gunsmith before firing and that shooting is at your own risk. It is too bad that in today's society that a disclaimer must be stated for something that should be obvious. Shipping will be $30 to the lower 48 and include insurance to $300. Alaska and Hawaii may cost more. EXTRA INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE AND OPTIONAL AT BUYERS DISCRETION BUT IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED AND RECOMMENDED AS SELLER ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOST OR DAMAGED MERCHANDISE BEYOND ORIGINAL $300 & PROOF OF SHIPPING IF THE ITEM IS NOT INSURED."

Offered here for sale (not trade) is a fine example of a post war Hi-Power.  This is a well maintained, fully functioning, original pistol with only one part replaced. Conservatively, about 90% + condition. This comes with one original, aluminum follower 13 round magazine. This has not been refinished or monkeyed with and has an intact magazine disconnector. It's been kept in a silicone gun sock when not in use and always cleaned and oiled after use. For me, it's functioned without flaws since the internal extractor (similar to a 1911) has been carefully tuned and replaced. Original extractor is included with the sale. Pistols of this age and quality are quite scarce and sought after by those who really like this pistol. As this is a tad below true ""collector quality"", yet in outstanding condition for it's age, you can still shoot it!   Okay, here's what you really want to know: Price is $800, FIRM. NO-TRADES. Must have OHIO driver's licence, be willing to meet in Columbus or FFL to FFL transfer with you paying the shipping. You must be eligible to purchase a firearm and be willing to sign a bill of sale for my records. As always, you should have this pistol checked for safety by a qualified gunsmith before firing, however it's been flawless for me and I can offer no warranty, nor be held responsible should something go wrong. I'm not in the firearms business, just a shooter as I imagine you are as well. Please contact me if you're serious and I can try to answer any questions or arrange to meet up. Low ball offers/trade offers will be ignored, so please don't bother. If there's no interest, I will be posting on gunbroker.com in a few days."

This is an original Hi-Power clone with the oval on the frame, meaning it uses the original Hi-Power barrel locking system!  A very rare pistol here in America with a GREAT reputation!  Most Hi-Power clones don't use the original locking system.  The oval on the frame is the indication that it is a TRUE Hi-Power!

This is truly a rare bird! It is a MkI Kareen Hi-Power, which you don't see many of.  It is of stainless steel construction with a hard chrome finish.  It is the ONLY Stainless with Hard Chrome finish I have ever seen, or been able to find online!!! It is a 100% numbers matching pistol. Slide, Barrel, and Frame all match! With the original Kareen plastic grips!

It is in the early B serial number block.  Polished barrel with 6 crisp lands/grooves!

It is in very good shape.  A few dings here and there with some holster wear.  While most Kareens look like they have been run over repeatedly, this one just looks used.  The hard chrome finish helps reduce the wear.

The magazine safety has been removed, with giving it the ability to fire without a magazine in, a free-dropping mag, and a 1000% better trigger pull.  I have the magazine safety still, which will come with it, if you want to put it back in.  Most that have had it removed don't keep it.

The magazine will fall out from the recoil when you shoot it or you can do what I did and tape a small piece of plastic to the side of the magazine to keep it in the Magazine well. Sig was no help in resolving my problem. You can keep your hand under the magazine when you fire it but at sometime you won't hold it tight enough and it will not cycle properly. Other than that it work fine as long as you can hold the magazine in. It is not the Magazine, I have tried others. Use CCI MiniMags.
I turned down offers of $200 so don't even offer. I paid $300 in Snellville  used and the guy either didn't know the problem or didn't tell me.

Spring Cleaning of the Garage, Storage & my Gun Room and decided it's time to sell a few things that I have Doubles and Triples of. I have 3 of these V-Line 2912-S Top Draw Pistol Safes that Retail for $170-199 and I’m asking $120 for 1 or $#220 for Both (2). I bought 5 or 6 years ago & I had them in my office and Cabin but never used them. They have no Pistol or Gun Outline pressed into the Foam and the Combo is still set at the factory Combo (Pointer & Ring Finger at the Same Time and Then the Middle Finger).

http://vlineind.com/PDF/REDACTED11560.Lock%20Instructions%208-2013.pdf

Both Safes do have some small scratches on the bottom (from being pushed on the floor I assume) but that cannot be noticed by anyone unless you pick them up. 
I assure you that both safes are in next to perfect condition and I'm asking a firm $120 for 1 or $220 for both (2) of them. As you can see that is a great deal since they're all over the net from $170 on Amazon. 

Be sure not to get the V-Line 2912-S Top Draw Pistol Safe which measures 12""x9""x2 3/4 mixed up with the V-Line 279-S Top Cpmpact Safe that is 9 1/2X7 1/4x2. As you can see the 279-S is much smaller than the 2912-S Top Draw Safe.

Here are the specs for the barrel: 1 in 7"" twist improved polygonal rifling, carbine length gas system, extended feed ramps, 1/2x28 TPI muzzle threads, bead blasted finish, pinned Switchblock with gas tube, medium contour, weight = 29oz.  All NFA rules apply, if you don't know, it must be installed on an SBR registered lower or an AR pistol.  If you plan on running a suppressor, it doesn't get much better than this.  This is a top of the line AR part."

Chambered for .30WCF (.30-30) the rifle was made in 1919. It has a saddle ring on the left side of the receiver, and a 20” round barrel ( we think the barrel has been cut down). The rifle has seen a lot of use during it’s long life, and that is reflected in the condition. Most all of the original blue finish is gone, the rifle has lots of ptina, freckling, and even some mild pitting on the barrel. The wooden stocks have been sanded, and they look pretty good – overall, the rifle rates about 70-75% condition. The bore has strong visible rifling, however there is also some pitting.. so therefore the price is affordable.."

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."
