I don't have to sell it, it is just taking up safe space. The Super Black Eagle II is the ultimat waterfowl, turkey, or buckshot gun because of it's reliability and fast cycle action.

The solid-steel tube allows you to really clamp down on the scope without adverse effects to the parallax mechanism. The Horus reticle allows you to unleash the accurate long-range potential of your rifle and ammo. the reticle is in a grid format allowing you to use the intersecting lines on the reticle instead of turning your turret knobs and taking your focus away from the target, also their are illuminated points on the reticle for greater accuracy during low light conditions. i bought the scope with the intent of getting into distance shooting but ended up selling the rifle. the scope comes with
-larue tactical 30mm picitiny lever mounts, some of the best mounts you can get with the ability to change out optics in seconds- $210
-horus vision angle and slope indicator to adjust your formula if shooting at an incline or decline target while keeping the reticle leve-$100
all put together its worth about 1700 but i would be willing to take 1400 for the lot as i am selling to finance new equipment for my small buisness
the scope is a great peice of glass without the high dollar name and pricetag attatched to it like other quality optics

There is heavy pitting on the slide from where it sat in the holster.  ""Navy"" is marked on the back of the capture paper, so more than likely the pitting is from while he was on his ship.  The bore is like a mirror with sharp rifling.  The action seems to function fine.  The holster was modified by the veteran to use as a shoulder holster.  It is marked ""39"" on the back which is likely the year it was made.  All in all it's a nice identified set with provenance.  Asking $400 or best reasonable offer.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
      The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Features: Hogue overmolded black stock with rattle-can paint job (old USMC habit, can't stand black guns). For those who don't know, this rifle is basically a Weatherby Vanguard without the price tag. Howa rifles are known for their high quality and accuracy.  I purchased this rifle in 2009.  It sits in the safe, only to check zero once a year.  I just haven't had time to hunt the last few years, and the near future is not looking promising either.  The Nikko Stirling scope has impressive crisp and clear Japanese glass and holds a very solid zero.  The barrel has been properly broken in. Internals are spotless. Bolt is silky smooth. <60 rounds fired through it, all quality factory ammo.

Ayoob feels the Glock 30 is the best pistol ever made by Glock. He emphatically states it is Glock's most accurate and tactically/practically perfect pistol! Massad Ayoob is internationally known as a renowned author, columnist, and instructor on the subject of firearms and self-defense. He is Glock Talk's resident expert in the GATE Self-Defense Forum. 

On several occasions, Ayoob has made very compelling and positive statements about the amazing accuracy of the G30 which he has chosen for one of his carry guns. Ayoob favors the G30 over the G21 and G36 Glock 45ACP pistols and calls the G30 his favorite Glock. In his book, ""The Gun Digest Book of Combat Handgunnery"", Ayoob writes the G30 ""may be the most accurate pistol that Glock makes."" In his personal experience, the stock G30 with factory ammo is capable of under 1.0-inch groups for 5 shots at 25 yards from off the bench, performing better than the Gen3 G21 or G36. The G30 is freakishly accurate for a combat pistol with a 3.78 inch barrel. 

""Mas wrote a comprehensive review of the Glock 30 that was published in the American Handgunner 1998 Combat Annual, titled ""Fist Full of .45"". The impressive result he obtained on the firing range with the first G30 he received for evaluation is very interesting reading. After firing three boxes of ammo to break in the pistol, Ayoob shot a 1-3/16"" group of 5 shots at a measured range of 25 yards from a righthand barricade standing position using Federal 230gr HydraShok HP factory ammo. The best three of five shots were just 3/8"" apart. He was so favorably impressed by the G30 that he couldn't resist the temptation to buy the test pistol for his personal use."" Also see: http://www.glocktalk.com/forums/showpost.php?p=20109903&postcount=11 . 

And, unlike many Glocks, its Gen 4 and ""SF"" frame will fit your hand! The GLOCK 30 Gen 4 and Glock 30 SF in the legendary .45 Auto offer excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30 Gen 4 and Glock 30 SF .45 caliber are the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. 

The Gen 4 and SF model reduce the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands. 

SPECIAL OFFER: I can perform the popular recessing of the trigger guard where it intersects the back-atrap. This further improves the ergonomics of the grip PLUS it helps correct the well-known, aim-point of Glocks, which is universally acknowledged as high for the majority of shooters. I charge $20 while framesmiths charge $30-40. 

I can also install the highly-acclaimed McNally Trigger System for $139 (retail $160 and increasing to $180 in 2 months); I will install it with FREE LABOR! 

I will not sell to a person in any state that has unique restrictions (i.e. California), so check your ability to legally own this weapon before you bid!! SHIPPING: $19.50 paid by the buyer for USPS PRIORITY MAIL with insurance and Delivery Confirmation, directly to your preferred FFL-holder.

ACCEPTED PAYMENTS include: PayPal, USPS Postal and other money orders, and Bank Teller's Checks; the item will be shipped to you immediately upon my receipt of this type of payment. PERSONAL checks are also accepted BUT shipment will be delayed until your check has cleared my bank. 

If you are an AZ resident, the State compels me to collect its 5.5% tax for them.

If you possess an AZ CCW (or possibly one from a state recognizing reciprocity) and desire to pich up the pistol directly from me, I will not have to perform a NICS Instant Backgrounf Check upon you; otherwise, I will.

If you would like the pistol shipped, I will ship it to the verifiable FFL of your choice.

Excellent rifle, always taken great care of it. Very accurate and never had any issues. Low round count with no hiccups. Had lots of fun but need to pay bills.

Barrel is 16"" with a 15"" Troy Industries Battle Alpha Rail (Very expensive and high quality)

The rifles are about $800 brand new and the Troy Industries rail I installed was $200, plus with the few extras and magazines you can probably do the math on how much all this is worth so I feel $900.00 is a solid deal for a pretty great and reliable rifle.

The SIG Mosquito is a blowback-operated, semi-automatic pistol based on the SIG Sauer P226, but 10% smaller in size and chambered for the .22 LR cartridge. The pistol is manufactured with an aluminum-zinc alloy slide and polymer frame. The controls are similar to those present on full-size models and include (from front to rear) a left takedown lever, a left decocking lever, reversible magazine catch and ambidextrous manual safety. In addition, the pistol is provided with an integral safety lock located at the rear of the magazine well which when enabled prevents cycling of slide, hammer fall, and trigger action.

Truly one of the premier self-defense pistols available from any manufacturer. The XD(M) line by Springfield has gathered huge acclaim, and here is your chance to own one at way below retail in a merket that is selling way above retail!

DESIGN
Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.
(M)odel Contour Frame(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations
(M)ega-Lock Texture

TECHNOLOGY
Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. 
With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory®.(M)elonite®(M)atch Grade Barrel
(M)inimal Reset Trigger
Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 
The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. 
Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. 
The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. 
Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. 
New! 3.8 model with slip resistant slide serrations.
The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 
The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. 

INNOVATIONS
The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD® is now captured in the all new XD(M)® line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M)® series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.
(M)aximum Reach Magazine Release
(M)inimal Error Disassembly
(M)ega Capacity Magazine
The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. 
Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster. 
The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag 
X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

PERSONALIZATION
Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.
(M)ould-Tru Backstraps
(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™
(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case
(M)agazine X-Tensions™ (USPAT.7191556)
With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. 
A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. [Zoom]
With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions™ , SPRINGFIELD ARMORY® has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)
Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols.

Specs from Sig site: 
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

 The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

It's deadly accurate and very quiet with the bull barell. Mr.Rhineland made 500 of these guns to present a contract with Ruger since this gun is like a Ruger 10-22 on steroids. It's a fully machined gun so it cost over $500 to make and Ruger would have to sell it for over $1,000 and they did not know if there would be a high demand for a high quality but pricey 22 Long rifle. It will only go up in value and it's one of my favorite guns I have ever owned. It weights close to 15 lbs so it has some weight to it. This gun will take and Ruger 10/22 mags and I currently use Pro mags that work just fine. It also has a vertical grip."

Here are the specks from sig. Introducing the new SIG SAUER Classic centerfire pistols in .22LR Rimfire models. The same Classic pistols that have been used by civilian, law enforcement, and military personnel the world over, can now have these same models factory built in .22LR. The SIG SAUER® Classic .22’s are built on the same frame as their centerfire counterparts. All Classic .22’s feature the same SIG SAUER Four-Point safety system which employs a decocking lever, a patented automatic firing pin safety block, a safety intercept notch, and a trigger bar disconector. The new machined slides also feature a front sight adjustable for drift and a rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

With the purchase of a new SIG SAUER Classic .22 shooters can now enjoy hours of serious training at the range for a fraction of what they would pay practicing with full recoil centerfire rounds. SIG SAUER Classic .22’s are shipped in a lockable case with one 10-round magazine. 

$525.00 cash

Be sure to check out the new SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit™ is the perfect accessory for your SIG SAUER Classic .22 rimfire pistols. Now shooters can add SIG SAUER centerfire performance with just the change out of the slide assembly, barrel, recoil system, and magazine to any of the standard production pistol calibers; 9mm, .40 S&W, and .357SIG. Exchanging components does not alter the reliability or accuracy of either assembly.

Owning a SIG SAUER Classic .22 and a centerfire X-CHANGE Kit provides the added benefit of owning two pistols in a single premium package. More shooting at a lower cost with the full size SIG SAUER pistol you’re accustomed to; the SIG SAUER Classic .22 caliber pistols that now include the option for centerfire performance with a SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit."

It has all matching five digit serial numbers and threaded barrel. Everything is about this rifle is right and tight and works as it should; it has not been modified in any way or had any aftermarket add-ons installed. The story on this rifle is a California firearms import firm by the name of K-SPORTS in the late 1980s brought in SKS barreled actions made by Norinco and applied a very nice full parkerized finish to all the metal parts then put it in a top of the line Butler Creek stock that has a nice rubber recoil pad with molded in K-SPORTS markings and has a sling stud and and a unique ventilated hand guard and nicely done checkering front and rear. They only made 1000 of these so they are far and few in between and much sought after by collectors. It has the Cowboy Companion/Para model 16"" barrel. This rifle has been a safe queen with just a couple of minor handling marks and appears to have been test fired only. Bore is mirror bright with sharp and crisp rifling and lands with no signs of ever having been fired with corrosive ammo. This rifle is classified in Maryland as a Non Regulated firearms so there is no sales tax, no paperwork, no waiting, no FFL fee, and it's perfectly legal between Maryland residents not prohibited from owning firearms, which is how this sale has to be. Pls do not contact me if you have any kind of criminal record or have ever been in trouble with the law. Buyer must be legal MD resident or active duty military stationed in MD with orders. Will meet buyer in a public setting during daylight hours for a FTF cash and carry deal. I am in the Brandywine area and will drive as far north as Upper Marlboro or as far south as Charlotte Hall to meet the buyer. Price is firm, not interested in trades or lesser offers of any sort; I'm not desperate to sell, just a guy approaching retirement with too much stuff.

The ammo can be sold separately at 10% below retail, as offered locally at Eastern Outfitters. I will not sell the ammo before the gun.
