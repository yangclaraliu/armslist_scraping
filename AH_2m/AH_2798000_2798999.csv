*Retails for $30, plus shipping*

Because of numerous changes in the dynamics of the current fighting techniques we now virtually square off with the bad guy when engaging the target. The Gun Fighter's Grip by BCM allows for a reduced angle and improved ergonomics when shooting in the modern gun fighting stances.

The BCM Gun Fighter's Grip (GFG) features:
-Reduced angle for improved ergonomics
-Hinged trap door offering storage inside the grip with a water resistant rubber gasket
-Each grip includes both an extended modular insert to close the gap between the trigger guard and pistol grip, and a smooth modular insert for use with some rifles with larger built in trigger guards. (user can decide which one to install)
-Made in the USA and manufactured from high quality impact resistant polymers.
-Test fit to ensure proper function (may display attributes consistent with this QC process)"

The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet."

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desirable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.

Seven diagonal grasping grooves are at the rear of its wide ejection port, and each side of the slide has been given the SIG look with a centered relief cut running from the muzzle to the rear of the ejection port. A passive firing pin safety of the Colt Series 80 design is used.
The frame has a decent-sized beavertail, relieved at its top to allow the exposed grooved and skeletonized hammer to move down into it when the gun cycles. Both front and back strap as well as the supplied grip panels are longitudinally grooved, which combined provide very good gripping surfaces without any sharp edges. The grip panels are attached using two allen screws to a side.
The slide stop, thumb safety and magazine release are all in the 1911 positions—left side only (Update: You can now get an ambidextrous safety as well. —ed.). (Important safety note: The slide can be manipulated for loading, unloading or chamber inspection with the safety in the up or on position.)

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. Steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control. 
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

This pistol was re-engineered to adapt the military Hi-Power to the requirements of international competition. The design starts with parts which are more closely toleranced than standard production. It features a longer, 6-inch barrel which is specially contoured to accept a special muzzle weight. The front sight is mounted on the weight, thus extending the sight radius. A special rear target sight was designed which features click adjustable windage and elevation. The magazine safety was completely redesigned so as not to affect trigger pull. The hammer was also modified for an improved trigger pull. Overall condition is excellent. I'd grade the original matte phosphate finish at 97-98% overall with only minor handling wear and surface marks. There is no rust or pitting. It comes with factory installed Pachmayr wrap-around checkered rubber grips. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. Looking at the internals, it appears that this pistol is factory test fired only. It comes with the original styrofoam box which still has the original end label. Two factory 13-round magazines, owner's manual, cleaning rod, and allen key are included as well. According to the serial number, this pistol was manufactured in 1987. A fairly scarce pistol with a reputation for excellent accuracy and reliability alike!"

410,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2798410,For Sale:  Beretta 92FS 9mm (NEW),"sacramento, Sacramento, California",$ 625,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 10, 2014",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time proven design. Steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

No serial number. Manufactured in 1870. NRA Condition: Very Good. 36"" barrel with a very good bore which shows strong evident rifling but with scattered minor pitting. The barrel and bands are a mix of plum brown and pewter patina with a few minor dings and handling marks. The frame is a mottled case-hardened pewter and brown patina. The butt stock and forearm rate about very good as slightly refinished, retaining the minor dings and handling marks from the years. There is a legible left-side cartouche and the butt is rack numbered ""14"" while the right side of the butt is also numbered ""Gn 95"". This example correctly lacks the locking action hammer of the Model 1871 and is marked only on its right side of frame ""U.S./Springfield/1870"", this beneath a federal eagle, there is no left-side frame marking as found on the 1871 models. Remington patent information is on top tang. The correct ""single stop"" cleaning/ram rod is present. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: The United States Army contracted for 1,008 Model 1870 rolling block rifles, and 313 saddle-ring carbines, to be used for field trials (these guns are quite scarce). The results were favorable enough that in 1872, The U.S. Army ordered a full contract of 10,001 Model 1871 rifles, but no carbines."

EVEN IF YOU ALWAYS CLEAN YOUR GUN AFTER USE, THIS IS STILL VERY USEFUL AND IMPORTANT.

I am very skilled with guns, and I do not take short cuts. Basically, if you have a gun that needs a good cleaning and want to look good or even better than new, and work better than new, I can help. Get your gun cleaned for hunting season. This is especially useful if your gun doesn't get a lot of use, or even if you are trying to sell your gun. This increases and maintains gun value and is great for gun enthusiasts. If you have an older gun that you want to get cleaned up and in great condition to sell, this is a great option. I use premium products and don't take short cuts.

PROCESS:

I begin with stripping the gun completely, and soaking all parts in a very heavy degreaser. This removes any and all grease or grime on the surface of the metal as well as in the pores. I then hand polish all internals and any parts that need it to ensure a smooth operation. All rust is removed as well. Once everything is absolutely spotless, I pressure cook all parts in a deep penetrating lubricating solution to ensure that the lubrication gets into the pores of the metal, rather than just coats it. I then polish and all parts that need touching up, and repeat the process. Then all parts are dried and then the gun is reassembled. I use premium products, and I do not take any short cuts! All polishing is done to great precision.

My prices are very fair and reasonable, and if all of my work is ensured by cash payment, so basically if something happens (which it never has), I will pay for the gun, no questions asked.

I have a very good reputation amongst my customers, which you can verify with them if you would like.

650,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2798650,For Sale:  Professional Gun Cleaning,"Near LSU, Baton Rouge, Louisiana",$ 50,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 11, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE CLEANING. EVEN IF YOU ALWAYS CLEAN YOUR GUN AFTER USE, THIS IS STILL VERY USEFUL AND IMPORTANT.

I am very skilled with guns, and I do not take short cuts. Basically, if you have a gun that needs a good cleaning and want to look good or even better than new, and work better than new, I can help. Get your gun cleaned for hunting season. This is especially useful if your gun doesn't get a lot of use, or even if you are trying to sell your gun. This increases and maintains gun value and is great for gun enthusiasts. If you have an older gun that you want to get cleaned up and in great condition to sell, this is a great option. I use premium products and don't take short cuts.

PROCESS:

I begin with stripping the gun completely, and soaking all parts in a very heavy degreaser. This removes any and all grease or grime on the surface of the metal as well as in the pores. I then hand polish all internals and any parts that need it to ensure a smooth operation. All rust is removed as well. Once everything is absolutely spotless, I pressure cook all parts in a deep penetrating lubricating solution to ensure that the lubrication gets into the pores of the metal, rather than just coats it. I then polish and all parts that need touching up, and repeat the process. Then all parts are dried and then the gun is reassembled. I use premium products, and I do not take any short cuts! All polishing is done to great precision.

My prices are very fair and reasonable, and if all of my work is ensured by cash payment, so basically if something happens (which it never has), I will pay for the gun, no questions asked.

My cell phone number is 504-322-0985, and my email is batonrougeguncleaning@gmail.com, or jonathanvherbert@gmail.com. Looking forward to hearing from you!"

This is a one of the very first 3rd models, being manufactured in 1882. It comes with a faxed yellow sheet from the Cody firearms museum confirming its configuration. With a total production of only 63,871 there were 15,274 rifles produced with an 28"" octagon barrel in a 45-60 caliber. As for condition the receiver, 28"" barrel and full magazine retain 90% of their original bright bluing with the only real loss on edges and the top tang from carry use. The original walnut stocks are in very good condition and retain nearly all of their original finish with some typical handling marks. The wood to metal fit is tight and proud. The action is tight and smooth, mechanically perfect. The lever and hammer springs are as tight as new. The bore is in very good condition with a mirror like shine and only very light scattered pitting. I would rate it at 80%. The dustcover slides flawlessly and snaps into place. The pin, bolt and extractor still retain much of their original bluing, showing little use. Dust cover rail retains much bluing as well. The hammer shows muted case colors. The brass carrier retains sharp corners. The screws are in good condition and most appear unturned. The barrel address and caliber markings are perfect. The rear sight is an original sporting leaf and the front is a period Lyman (possibly factory). In all this is a very rare old rifle as you don't find many with this much original finish. All photos were taken outdoors in natural light and provide a very accurate depiction of its condition."

lowered to $260 
This is an all matching (except bayonet)1946 91/30. I have done some research on this rifle and it appears production of infantry rifles ended in 1945. The 91/30 was still produced exclusively for sniper rifle so its not to uncommon to find a 1946 or 47 exsniper rifle. This on the other hand is a standard infantry rifle from Izhevsk made in 1946. These only pop up here every once in a while and I could not find any record of one sold. It is in Very God condition rating determined by the crate it came in. It is in great shape with only a few typical dings in stock and some minor scratches to the bluing. The wood finish is great only some wear on handguard. Bore is typical grey but still shiny and the rifling is very sharp. The crown is in good condition and it has not been counter bored. Bolt and chamber are perfect no corrosion at all and the action work great. This gun is better off with a collector as I just need a Mosin to put a lot of lead down range.
Will not Ship.
Also comes with a bayonet, oil can, mosin tool, and standard issue cleaning accessories.

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality. 

 The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

 In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine. 

 The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.

I bought the slug barrel with plans on deer hunting with it, but never did. We've moved from the country to town and the guns not been fired in over 3 years. Although its been taken out of the safe to clean and oil it from time to time. 
Here's what you get:
BENELLI 12GA. Black Pump Shotgun with a 28"" Barrel
23"" Cantilever Rifled Slug Barrel 
Simmons Shotgun Scope
150 to 200 rounds of 12g a. ammo, game loads, buck shot and slugs
Gun case
700. or best, but don't waste our time with low ball offers, I don't need to sell it. I would rather have some have who will use it, instead of letting it set in a safe unused.

Yes, I will sell slug barrel and scope 345.00"

I just bought 80 rounds of ammo thinking I would like to start shooting it some, but decided to get a pistol instead. I have more pictures that I can send.

22 inch barrel.  Last shot auto hold open bolt.
Three hole stock.  This is a RARE combination.

In doing some research on this rifle, I found it has both the ""last-shot hold open"" and the 18 round capacity - 22 inch barrel is rare.  Add in the 3 hole stock, a third hole behind the trigger guard and this is one unusual Marlin.

This weapon is NOT a cherry.  Some earlier owner genius painted the metal with black paint. It is functional, firing and feeding flawlessly using Winchester .22 LRs.

INFO FROM THE INTERNET:
Since 1985, the Model 60 has included a patented automatic ""last-shot"" bolt hold-open. This latter feature is a safety feature that locks the bolt half-way open after the last cartridge is fired, thereby allowing the safe inspection of the now-open action. This also notifies the user when the gun is empty.   During the late-1980s, the capacity of the rifle was reduced to a 15 round maximum limit, to meet New Jersey's firearms law for semi-automatic assault weapons. For a few years in the mid-1980s the Model 60 rifles had both the ""last shot hold open"" feature and also held 18 rounds in the tube magazine. Those rifles with those two features are among the most sought after Model 60s.
There are a few 1985 models that were a mixture of 22"" barrel, 18 round capacity, last round bolt hold open feature and the third reinforcing screw. Different wood is used for the stock itself.

Google ""Marlin 60 stock"", there is a pic showing the standard stock and the three hole.
