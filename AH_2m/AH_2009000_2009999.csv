 The Selbestladepistole Unique: Unique Kriegsmodell: Until the outbreak of World War Two, Manufacture d'Armes des Pyren'ees at Hendaye produced a simple blowback pistol, the Model 17 in caliber 7.65mm. After the German occupation of 1940 production of the Pistol in an unmodified form was recommenced. Approximately 50,000 were produced before it was decided to modify the weapon. The result was the Kriegsmodell, the War model, that was very similar to its predecessor but had an external hammer. About 25,000 of the Kriegsmodell were produced with WaA stamp 251. The grips were often marked 7.65mm/m9 Schuss which indicated the caliber and cartridge capacity of eight in the magazine and one in the chamber.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

Local pick-up is available. I'll also trade this stock set + cash for a Springfield Trophy Match .45 ACP 1911 locally.


Up for sale is a custom woodset I had made for my Browning 425 sporting clays 12ga O/U. The blank woodset came from Umbergers guns a few years after Mr. Umberger had passed on. The quality of wood is WAY above anything I've EVER seen on a Browning O/U, including my 2012 shot show special hertitage 16ga and the 425 golden clay models.

This woodset was fitted/shaped/checkered by Macons Gun stocks. I waited 6 long months and paid close to $1K to have it completed in addition to the price of the woodset. It has been finish sanded prior to checkering. You can install shoot and modify this stock set then have it finished any way you would like.

FORESTOCK:. The forestock is approx. 1"" longer and 3/16"" wider than factory but it still retains the snabel design and factory checkering pattern. It is pre-cut for all hardware to drop right in place.

REAR STOCK:  Features a citori standard 14 & 1/4  Length of pull with factory butt pad installed ( included but not pictured). It also features a right hand palm swell similar to the 525 model Citoris. This could be removed and recheckered prior to finishing if the buyer prefers the traditional 325/425 ""feel""

Why am I selling? While I was waiting for the stock to be completed, I purchased a 725 Grade III for sporting clays use. I'll be keeping my 425 and modifying its stock for my son to use in a couple years.


Disclaimer:  It will fit ANY 325/425 model gun but may require minor fitment by a certified gunsmith. This set may also fit earlier model citori guns. This wood set will NOT fit model 525,625,725 guns. I am not a gunsmith nor stock maker so I can not confirm model interchangeability. It is being sold AS IS and require final finishing once fit is confirmed on your firearm."

It was my wifes gun and she only put 50 rounds through it to test it.  It was her carry gun and mainly stayed in her purse.  She just decided she wants something different.  Go figure.



This gun comes with:



2-7 round mags both with pinky extensions.  It also will have the stock mag plates you can put back on if you don't want the extensions. One mag originally came with gun.  The other was purchased seperate.



All paper work and gun lock.



Zippered case.



Sticky pocket holster.



After she shot the initial 50 rounds I installed a Galloway Precision heavy recoil spring and stainless steel guide rod.  It has not been fired after the new spring was installed.  It also will come with the factory spring and factory plastic guide rod.  I also have a Galloway blocker spring and lifter spring for it that will come with it and you can install if you want.  These will help smooth out trigger pull.  Its not hard and there are multiple youtube videos to show how to install as well as videos on Galloway Precision's website.



I also put Galloway Traction Grip Overlays on it as well.



This is a great carry gun and a great shooter, my wife just decided she wanted something different.



I am asking $400.  Sorry no trades, as she is unsure what she wants at this time.

OLD - pre-serial number H&R 922 revolver.  9 shot (of what? no clue, only know 22.  May be shorts, rifle, I dunno).  Given to me by my uncle, so it has zero history.  Bore looks clean and cylinder looks super clean.  Finish ok, but metal dings on the metal from either a lazy gunsmith, or someone using it as a hammer. Bakalite grips. 
Function?  Yea right.  Missing the pin that holds the cylinder in place.  Pulling the trigger yields questionable results.  SA does not catch, DA is kinda 50/50.  
Trade this as a non-functional firearm - or a fully functional paperweight. 
If you are not a gunsmith, don't expect to be able to make it work without one.  

be willing to meet me in Joliet area, bring a FOID!  Even though the gun is broken, you still have to wait three days to get it.  Call it the cooling off period, before you get really angry trying to make it work."

I have an aversion to looking like an idiot so I want to get out and try to shoot some since I have never done it before.  I have two months to practice up.

So if you have a good used shotgun in the sub $300 range I would be interested in looking at your pictures.  I am new to skeet but by no means to guns so please only reliable guns.

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

As close to mint as one could expect from a gun fired about 150 rounds and carried. Barrel hood wear as you'd expect from the action running through its paces. Gun carried daily either in my pocket or the factory paddle holster.

We all know these guns are slowly coming back onto the market and this edition was selling for $1250 at the recent gun show, plus tax, transfer fees, etc. Ammo was bringing ~$300/500 rounds at Georgia arms.

I'm certainly not trying to gouge or over price. Get it all for $1895, no tax, no paperwork. I have other mags available that I can sell to the buyer at a discounted rate.

The blue is dark and deep, way better than you find on any modern production firearm. Original factory grips are in great shape as well. They have a couple of light dings, no chips. They have great color and the checkering is very good as well. The only area of noticeable wear is on one spot at the end of the barrel. The blueing has word a little, there is no pitting or rust. I have added a picture so you can see it. With the cost of Colt revolvers going through the roof over the last 5 years, now is your chance to still get an excellent Colt in .38 special to shoot and enjoy, all while watching it go up in value.

I have been looking on Gunbroker for a while now and still haven't seen one pop up. This is a rare H&R revolver, it is the model 905. Which I believe is the electroless nickel version of the 904. This is a 4"" bull barrel, 9 shot revolver. It is in excellent condition. I have personally put 50 rounds through it without a hiccup. It functions in single and double action no problem. It is also very accurate. The cylinder locks up tight and the action is in time. The finish is excellent condition, except for in one tiny spot. At the base of the grip by the panel, there is a tiny chip in the finish. I have added a picture so that you can be aware of it. Other than that it is gorgeous. Grips are a smooth factory wood with no checkering. There are two very minor dings in the wood, not very noticeable at all. The revolver also has target adjustable sights. This is an outstanding piece that you really don't see everyday. I imagine that most of these are locked up in people's safes as I am a gunbroker junky and have never seen one.

This is known as the ""Escort"", why it was called that I'll leave to you to decide. Basically this was a very revolutionary design and change up for Smith as they were experimenting with semi autos. This particular model was designed with concealed carry in mind. Initially thought of for women but many men became interested in it as a potential back up gun. The pistol was designed to compete with the Colt Junior, and the idea was that it would be cheaper to shoot (.22lr) and maintain similar ballistics. The original model 61 suffered some reliability problems but by the last variation, 61-3, they were able to eliminate those issues. What that translates to is that there were not a lot of Model 61's produced period. They were only made for 3 years basically, this one being a 1973. This is the blued version, the finish is very nice with a little thinning occurring on the edges of the gun. The pistol has bakelite or plastic grip panels. They are in very good shape as well. There appears to be 2 minor scuffs on the left panel. The right is very nice. The pistol comes with one original magazine. The mags hold 5 rounds for these guns. I have not shot the pistol but I have done function tests and it feeds and ejects rounds perfectly. From what I have read if you are planning to shoot the gun, just use high velocity ammo (mini mags, stingers, etc) and it should be flawless. These guns with the box go for about $500-600 because many Smith and Wesson collectors are grabbing them up. This is a great opportunity to get this one for a reasonable price as they are just beginning to rise! Any questions, feel free to email me."

-The original spring (Recommended for standard and +p)
-5x total 13 round mags
-2.5 gallons of uncleaned brass. Not sure how many

Asking $560 

I also have the following ammo for sale:
641 rounds of assorted 230 grain ammo at  $0.45 per=$290
3x boxes of 50 Underwood 185 grain .45 super bonded JHP at 1300fps $40 each

18x buffalo bore 250 grain +p hard cast lead $10
19x core-bon 165 grain +p Pow R Ball $10 

The pistol is several years old and has about 1000 rounds of standard pressure .45 ACP through it without any problems. The XD .45 is a very robust and reliable firearm and can handle limited amounts of .45 super without a problem. With the heavier spring, firing .45 super is a non issue. I have fired about 100 rounds of 45 super through this pistol. it seams to like the 185gr version better. This pistol has been carried and shows minor cosmetic wear.  

The ammo is also mostly several years old. It has been stored appropriately. I just fired off a few rounds and the ammo is good to go. Ammo will last 100 years or more if it's stored in a cool dry place like I store mine. The Underwood ammo is about 10 months old.      

If you want everything it would cost $970. I would sell it as a package for $920.

Buyer must show a valid MN DL and a PTP/PTC and be at least 21. Cash only, no trades or offers.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.

SureFire High capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Noveske K9 Barricade Support Part Black Spiked K9556 - NEW!

The K9 was developed by the Noveske Shooting Team to address the problem with shooting off, through, and around flimsy or otherwise non sturdy barricades. The K9 also is very effective when used in port windows and doorways. Through stage design and course of fire (COF) freestyle rifle shooting is made more difficult by dictating which targets can be engaged through which ports and over what barricades. To add to the problem, ports are generally too low to kneel and too high to go prone and more often then not, too frail and inadequate to take shots out past 200 yards with any confidence. 

Another problem when bracing up against a barricade is the shooter must readjust the support grip and pinch the wall and forearm together to steady the rifle. This must be practiced against every style of barricade and material thickness presented in order to become proficient. 

The K9 addresses these problems quickly and effectively. When used as a brace or support the ""teeth"" bite into the barricades or ports positively allowing faster follow up shots. When anchored into a support structure, awkward positions are no longer an issue as the rifle is now solid and the flimsy barricade can now be pushed into position for steadier shots. 

The K9 also takes care of the problem with readjusting the support grip. The forward facing teeth allow the shooter to push the rifle into position without ever removing the grip on the forearm and start taking shots as soon as the sights are aligned.

Manufacturer Description:
The PMAG 10 GEN M3 is a 10-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Incorporating new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability, the PMAG 10 provides next-generation performance for those needing lower profile magazines.

 Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® MR556A1 and FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S as well as AR15 mag wells with tighter tolerances. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

 The PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit.

 Made in U.S.A.

Features 
• True 10-round capacity that does not require limiters, pins, rivets, etc. 
• Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction
• Wide compatibility with non Colt-spec platforms
• Anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for increased reliability
• Long life stainless steel spring
• Over-travel insertion stop on the spine
