They are a one piece injection-molded housing allows complete disassembly for cleaning and maintenance.  Replaceable nylon feed lip insert, with patent pending feed control spring, eliminates rim lock and other feeding issues associated with other high capacity rim fire magazines.  Housing, feed lip insert, follower & base plate are all constructed of a proprietary impact modified glass filled DuPont® Zytel™ based polymer to ensure a long service life.  Magazine & feed control springs are made from heat treated chrome silicone wire for increased reliability and smooth feeding.

It runs like brand new, you would not be disappointed.

I have a dark green 1997 Chevy Tahoe LT 4x4 Four door truck. 5.7 L v8. The LT was the luxury edition and it has the off-road capabilities with it also being a 4x4. It has Buckshot Mudders (75% left) (They drive really well for off-road tires, not too loud, and they last much longer than other mud tires. I have been impressed with them) and nice off-road wheels and a lift kit. It has push button 4 wheel drive. It has a pair of KC SlimLight Daylighter 150 watt a piece off-road lights mounted with protective rock guard covers and a switch nicely installed for them on the dash (yes, they are very, very bright). It has aftermarket high performance bulbs for the low beams that don't look stupid, but put out a lot of white clear light through the factory headlights. It has window shade covers all the way around. It has straight dual exhaust (has good/deep sound but not too loud) with nice stainless tips. It has factory cargo rails on the roof. It has Leather interior (driver's seat has a tear in it). Electric everything. Cold A/C and hot heat. The truck is used by me to travel dirt roads and on the hunting land, but has not been ""mudding"" or anything and is mechanically perfect. It has some cosmetic problems like the electric mirrors no longer work and the trunk has a dent from where a trailer has came undone and popped it. But it is a good truck with many new parts. New transmission was installed, A/C compressor, and others where installed right before I purchased it, and it has recently had a new alternator installed. Cranks perfectly, shifts smoothly, runs great (tuns of power). It has a nice rubber trunk mat to protect carpet, a 10 inch sub-woofer and amp installed (stereo sounds good and full, but not made to be ridiculous loud or annoying to other drivers, and mildly tinted windows. I also have the factory privacy cover for the trunk. It obviously has a tow package and the hitch will go with it. It has 154,*** miles on it but runs like new. The Chevy truck I owned before this one with the same year and engine was retired with over 275,000 miles on it. These engines last forever. It will be a dependable, good truck for many years and miles to come. This truck is not in perfect cosmetic condition. The paint is wearing out, the leather is not perfect, it has a few dents. But I am not pricing it as perfect condition and it is in perfect working order and is comfortable to drive. It has expensive accessories to make it better suited for off-road use. The truck was not abused and it still has a lot of life left. I am just looking to buy the wife a new SUV and this truck is more of a toy than a necessity, but is perfect for what it is.

It’s chambered in .22 Short which, as you may know, was introduced in 1857 and preceded the .22LR by 14 years. Interestingly, though Winchester made the M1906 through 1932, they stopped making the .22 Short in 1908. Despite its age and apparent wear, the mechanics are smooth and lively making this a really fun recreational “plinker”. The hardwood buttstock has been redone but is very nice.  This rifle has very low felt recoil, its inherently accurate, relatively lightweight, and the mag tube holds up to 12-rounds. . Asking $500 OBO. If interested please call REDACTED.

From the HK website
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol."

NFA Ownership Frequently Asked Questions 
1 .Machines guns and suppressors are illegal 
While your state of residence may not allow the possession of such weapons; they are not unlawful under federal law. NFA 1934 makes the transfer of such weapons taxable, and created a registry of such weapons. 
No machine guns made after May 1986 can be entered in the registry creating a de facto ban on the production of new machine guns for civilians. This de facto ban does not apply to other NFA items. 

2. You need a license to buy an NFA item. 
No License is required. What you need to do is pay a tax on the transfer of each item in your possession. The tax is currently $200 for machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles/shotguns, and destructive devices. The transfer tax for Any Other Weapon is $5. 

Some states may have permitting or licensing requirements that have to be met prior to the purchase of NFA items, but there is no Federal ""Class 3"" license. That term is usually used to refer to a Class 1 FFL who has paid the SOT (Special Occupation Tax) fee to allow them to deal in Title II weapons and devices (NFA). 

3. I have to pay the NFA tax every year 
Another common myth; the transfer tax is paid once per transfer of the weapon, whether you own it for 10 days or 10 years. 

4. Owning an NFA item means agreeing to give up your 4th amendment protections of unwarranted search and seizure. 
This is an oft repeated myth. No one can search your home (or whatever location you used for your ATF tax form) without your permission or a warrant just because you own NFA items. 

5. If I buy an NFA item I’ll have to buy a safe to store it in. 
While you are required to maintain control of your NFA items at all times (and a safe to which only you have access goes a long way to meeting this requirement), there is no law that requires you to buy a safe to store your NFA items. 

6 .No one else is allowed to use my NFA weapons 
As long as you are maintaining control (which means you don’t leave the NFA items in the sole care of someone other than yourself) your friends and family are welcome to use them, as long as you are physically present
7. Why are machine guns so expensive?
In 1986, the United States government banned the future importation and domestic manufacture of machine guns for civilian consumption, and the already limited inventory of Class 3 weapons has since diminished substantially. At a rate now more accelerated than ever, these weapons are ending up in the hands of collectors who have no intention of ever selling them. The effect is twofold: Class 3 arms are growing increasingly scarce, and their prices are rising accordingly. Further Federal bans in 1989 and 1994 relating to semiautomatic clones of military weapons have spurred similar trends in that arena as well. Thus, the price of a quality, collector-grade Class 3 or semiautomatic weapon has spiraled beyond the comprehension of the average buyer. 
8. How do I register my nfa item?
You can own these weapons and possess them registered in different ways. We prepare and provide all paperwork. There are three distinct ways to register ownership of these weapons which we will describe here. 
Registration in your name:
This used to be the most common form of registration. Fingerprints, background check then Once the proper forms were prepared the applicant would go to their local chief law enforcement officer or other authorized official and request their signature on the form. Sometimes the applicant could get a signature. Most times the signature was refused. The application required a signature before the forms could be submitted to the BATFE for processing and approval. In the event the applicant could not get a signature they could not own NFA weapons registered in their name. This left applicants looking for alternate routes to own these weapons.

Corporate registration:
In the event an applicant could not get the required chief law enforcement signature, many people formed corporations strictly for the purpose of purchasing NFA weapons. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register ownership to the corporation. If the applicant already had a corporation they did not incur additional expenses forming one strictly for this purpose. The negative side of forming a corporation strictly to own NFA weapons is that this form of ownership comes with additional costs. Most states require an annual fee. In Florida the annual fee is $450  It varies by state. Over the period of ten years that amounts to $4500  (in the state of Florida). If you own two suppressors which cost a total of $800 or $900 this alternate form of registration appears to be economically foolish over long periods of time if the corporation is held strictly for ownership of NFA weapons. The annual corporation fee far exceeds the value of the NFA items and it continues to increase each year. 

Trust ownership:
Trust registration has become one of the most popular forms of NFA ownership. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register it to a trust. Other benefits include no fingerprint cards and no photographs. Skipping these two steps saves a LOT of time. This is NOT a loophole nor is it a ""short cut"". It is simply a way to take legal possession as the law was intended. Unlike corporations, trusts generally do not have an annual renewal or the fees associated with them. In the State of Florida, for example, there is no recording of a trust nor are there any fees required.  There are various options to setting up a trust. If there are a lot of beneficiaries and the trust involves other items besides NFA it might be best to consult an attorney. If the purpose of the trust is strictly the purchase and registration of NFA items there are various ""do it yourself"" kits available at your local software/office supply store."

The negative side of forming a corporation strictly to own NFA weapons is that this form of ownership comes with additional costs. Most states require an annual fee. In Florida the annual fee is $450  It varies by state. Over the period of ten years that amounts to $4500  (in the state of Florida). If you own two suppressors which cost a total of $800 or $900 this alternate form of registration appears to be economically foolish over long periods of time if the corporation is held strictly for ownership of NFA weapons. The annual corporation fee far exceeds the value of the NFA items and it continues to increase each year. 

Trust ownership:
Trust registration has become one of the most popular forms of NFA ownership. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register it to a trust. Other benefits include no fingerprint cards and no photographs. Skipping these two steps saves a LOT of time. This is NOT a loophole nor is it a ""short cut"". It is simply a way to take legal possession as the law was intended. Unlike corporations, trusts generally do not have an annual renewal or the fees associated with them. In the State of Florida, for example, there is no recording of a trust nor are there any fees required.  There are various options to setting up a trust. If there are a lot of beneficiaries and the trust involves other items besides NFA it might be best to consult an attorney. If the purpose of the trust is strictly the purchase and registration of NFA items there are various ""do it yourself"" kits available at your local software/office supply store."

1 .Machines guns and suppressors are illegal 
While your state of residence may not allow the possession of such weapons; they are not unlawful under federal law. NFA 1934 makes the transfer of such weapons taxable, and created a registry of such weapons. 
No machine guns made after May 1986 can be entered in the registry creating a de facto ban on the production of new machine guns for civilians. This de facto ban does not apply to other NFA items. 

2. You need a license to buy an NFA item. 
No License is required. What you need to do is pay a tax on the transfer of each item in your possession. The tax is currently $200 for machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles/shotguns, and destructive devices. The transfer tax for Any Other Weapon is $5. 

Some states may have permitting or licensing requirements that have to be met prior to the purchase of NFA items, but there is no Federal ""Class 3"" license. That term is usually used to refer to a Class 1 FFL who has paid the SOT (Special Occupation Tax) fee to allow them to deal in Title II weapons and devices (NFA). 

3. I have to pay the NFA tax every year 
Another common myth; the transfer tax is paid once per transfer of the weapon, whether you own it for 10 days or 10 years. 

4. Owning an NFA item means agreeing to give up your 4th amendment protections of unwarranted search and seizure. 
This is an oft repeated myth. No one can search your home (or whatever location you used for your ATF tax form) without your permission or a warrant just because you own NFA items. 

5. If I buy an NFA item I’ll have to buy a safe to store it in. 
While you are required to maintain control of your NFA items at all times (and a safe to which only you have access goes a long way to meeting this requirement), there is no law that requires you to buy a safe to store your NFA items. 

6 .No one else is allowed to use my NFA weapons 
As long as you are maintaining control (which means you don’t leave the NFA items in the sole care of someone other than yourself) your friends and family are welcome to use them, as long as you are physically present
7. Why are machine guns so expensive?
In 1986, the United States government banned the future importation and domestic manufacture of machine guns for civilian consumption, and the already limited inventory of Class 3 weapons has since diminished substantially. At a rate now more accelerated than ever, these weapons are ending up in the hands of collectors who have no intention of ever selling them. The effect is twofold: Class 3 arms are growing increasingly scarce, and their prices are rising accordingly. Further Federal bans in 1989 and 1994 relating to semiautomatic clones of military weapons have spurred similar trends in that arena as well. Thus, the price of a quality, collector-grade Class 3 or semiautomatic weapon has spiraled beyond the comprehension of the average buyer. 
8. How do I register my nfa item?
You can own these weapons and possess them registered in different ways. We prepare and provide all paperwork. There are three distinct ways to register ownership of these weapons which we will describe here. 
Registration in your name:
This used to be the most common form of registration. Fingerprints, background check then Once the proper forms were prepared the applicant would go to their local chief law enforcement officer or other authorized official and request their signature on the form. Sometimes the applicant could get a signature. Most times the signature was refused. The application required a signature before the forms could be submitted to the BATFE for processing and approval. In the event the applicant could not get a signature they could not own NFA weapons registered in their name. This left applicants looking for alternate routes to own these weapons.

Corporate registration:
In the event an applicant could not get the required chief law enforcement signature, many people formed corporations strictly for the purpose of purchasing NFA weapons. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register ownership to the corporation. If the applicant already had a corporation they did not incur additional expenses forming one strictly for this purpose. The negative side of forming a corporation strictly to own NFA weapons is that this form of ownership comes with additional costs. Most states require an annual fee. In Florida the annual fee is $450  It varies by state. Over the period of ten years that amounts to $4500  (in the state of Florida). If you own two suppressors which cost a total of $800 or $900 this alternate form of registration appears to be economically foolish over long periods of time if the corporation is held strictly for ownership of NFA weapons. The annual corporation fee far exceeds the value of the NFA items and it continues to increase each year.

At a rate now more accelerated than ever, these weapons are ending up in the hands of collectors who have no intention of ever selling them. The effect is twofold: Class 3 arms are growing increasingly scarce, and their prices are rising accordingly. Further Federal bans in 1989 and 1994 relating to semiautomatic clones of military weapons have spurred similar trends in that arena as well. Thus, the price of a quality, collector-grade Class 3 or semiautomatic weapon has spiraled beyond the comprehension of the average buyer. 
8. How do I register my nfa item?
You can own these weapons and possess them registered in different ways. We prepare and provide all paperwork. There are three distinct ways to register ownership of these weapons which we will describe here. 
Registration in your name:
This used to be the most common form of registration. Fingerprints, background check then Once the proper forms were prepared the applicant would go to their local chief law enforcement officer or other authorized official and request their signature on the form. Sometimes the applicant could get a signature. Most times the signature was refused. The application required a signature before the forms could be submitted to the BATFE for processing and approval. In the event the applicant could not get a signature they could not own NFA weapons registered in their name. This left applicants looking for alternate routes to own these weapons.

Corporate registration:
In the event an applicant could not get the required chief law enforcement signature, many people formed corporations strictly for the purpose of purchasing NFA weapons. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register ownership to the corporation. If the applicant already had a corporation they did not incur additional expenses forming one strictly for this purpose. The negative side of forming a corporation strictly to own NFA weapons is that this form of ownership comes with additional costs. Most states require an annual fee. In Florida the annual fee is $450  It varies by state. Over the period of ten years that amounts to $4500  (in the state of Florida). If you own two suppressors which cost a total of $800 or $900 this alternate form of registration appears to be economically foolish over long periods of time if the corporation is held strictly for ownership of NFA weapons. The annual corporation fee far exceeds the value of the NFA items and it continues to increase each year. 

Trust ownership:
Trust registration has become one of the most popular forms of NFA ownership. No law enforcement signature is required to purchase a NFA weapon and register it to a trust. Other benefits include no fingerprint cards and no photographs. Skipping these two steps saves a LOT of time. This is NOT a loophole nor is it a ""short cut"". It is simply a way to take legal possession as the law was intended. Unlike corporations, trusts generally do not have an annual renewal or the fees associated with them. In the State of Florida, for example, there is no recording of a trust nor are there any fees required.  There are various options to setting up a trust. If there are a lot of beneficiaries and the trust involves other items besides NFA it might be best to consult an attorney. If the purpose of the trust is strictly the purchase and registration of NFA items there are various ""do it yourself"" kits available at your local software/office supply store."

1 .Machines guns and suppressors are illegal 
While your state of residence may not allow the possession of such weapons; they are not unlawful under federal law. NFA 1934 makes the transfer of such weapons taxable, and created a registry of such weapons. 
No machine guns made after May 1986 can be entered in the registry creating a de facto ban on the production of new machine guns for civilians. This de facto ban does not apply to other NFA items. 

2. You need a license to buy an NFA item. 
No License is required. What you need to do is pay a tax on the transfer of each item in your possession. The tax is currently $200 for machine guns, suppressors, short-barreled rifles/shotguns, and destructive devices. The transfer tax for Any Other Weapon is $5. 

Some states may have permitting or licensing requirements that have to be met prior to the purchase of NFA items, but there is no Federal ""Class 3"" license. That term is usually used to refer to a Class 1 FFL who has paid the SOT (Special Occupation Tax) fee to allow them to deal in Title II weapons and devices (NFA). 

3. I have to pay the NFA tax every year 
Another common myth; the transfer tax is paid once per transfer of the weapon, whether you own it for 10 days or 10 years. 

4. Owning an NFA item means agreeing to give up your 4th amendment protections of unwarranted search and seizure. 
This is an oft repeated myth. No one can search your home (or whatever location you used for your ATF tax form) without your permission or a warrant just because you own NFA items. 

5. If I buy an NFA item I’ll have to buy a safe to store it in. 
While you are required to maintain control of your NFA items at all times (and a safe to which only you have access goes a long way to meeting this requirement), there is no law that requires you to buy a safe to store your NFA items. 

6 .No one else is allowed to use my NFA weapons 
As long as you are maintaining control (which means you don’t leave the NFA items in the sole care of someone other than yourself) your friends and family are welcome to use them, as long as you are physically present

Cash please and in person.  Here is the breakdown: AR15 Semi Auto Rifle
20"" Barrel, Heavy Contour (.920), Air Gauged, Cryo Treated
Two Stage Match Trigger
Forged Upper Receiver, flat top, optic ready
A2 full rear stock
Free Float aluminum hand guard 
Comes with their fantastic two stage match trigger system, and Hogue pistol grip. Also includes the winter trigger guard- nice touch!

The heavy 20"" bull barrel is 1.05 inches thick underneath the aluminum Free Float hand guard- allowing great heat dissipation. You can shoot all day long and still drop that last round thru a coyotes glass eye.

This rifle features the .223 Wylde chamber: designed as a match chambering for semi-automatic rifles. It will accomodate both .223 Rem and 5.56mm NATO ammunition. It is relieved in the case body to aid in extraction and features a shorter throat for improved accuracy.
Note:  I am not the original owner so I do not know how many rounds have been shot through the rifle.  I can tell you the inners are very clean and the upper and lower receiver are tight.  As you may know guns that have been shot quite a bid become loose a bit, but like I mentioned, this gun is tight and the trigger pull is great and requires very little effort.  Thanks.

I bought it as a package with an EXPS-3 but don't have any use for it. Magnifier retails around $500 in most places I'm asking for $350 obo.

From the manufacturer:
The G23 offers fast transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, incredible field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. The G23 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

It offers a comfortable eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand. The Flip to Side mount is incredibly durable and operates by pressing the lever on the side of  the mount causing the magnifier to ""flip"" to the side and out ofthe way. The G23 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.


 3x magnifier with Flip-To-Side mount and quick detach. Works with all existing HWS units.

Information from the manufacturer

From the combined effort of Legion Ltd, the custom shop of the legendary Izhmash Factory in Russia, and Arsenal, Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada comes a new SGL21 (Saiga) rifle in 7.62x39 caliber. Initially manufactured by Legion Ltd in Russia and re-manufactured by Arsenal, Inc. in the United States, the SGL21 rifle has everything that collectors and shooter have been looking for. 

Hand-select premium components, custom-shop-like attention to details by Legion Ltd, and Arsenal, Inc.’s highest standards of workmanship, give this rifle its superior quality.

Arsenal, Inc. re-manufactures the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles. Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Arsenal, Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer. The end result is the highest quality SGL21 rifle with the most desired features which have not been available before. 

Every unit is laser sighted and test fired to make this rifle the perfect Russian AK available in the market. Arsenal, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to ensure all the components and features are true to its original configuration.

The receiver of SGL21 rifle has the proper markings on both sides without any extra commercial markings, including the legendary Izhmash Factory logo, the upward pointing arrow in triangle. The markings on both sides of the receiver are done with the correct font type and size and placed in their proper locations. The receiver of
SGL21 features proper magazine dimples on both sides and original “X” and “Y” shaped reinforcement stampings.

On the right side, it has correctly positioned notches for the safety lever, marked with letters “S” and “F” and no additional openings at the bottom forward portion of the receiver.

The components and features on the new SGL21 rifle resemble true Russian AK rifle, including the safety lever with correct shape and properly positioned dimple, the correct trigger guard with magazine catch and the correct bullet guide enabling SGL21 to accept any standard AK magazine, the 1000 meter rear sight leaf, the highest quality Arsenal, Inc. double stage fire control group (hammer, trigger and disconnector), original Arsenal, Inc. mil-spec polymer furniture, including the handguards, pistol grip, and the original Warsaw pact length buttstock, the retainer
for lower handguard, the correct gas tube, original gas block with the correct vent holes, a guide hole for the cleaning rod and accessory lug, correct AK-74 type front sight block with 24x1.5mm right-hand threads and bayonet lug.

The quality comes from the true custom RUSSIAN STYLE Kalashnikov! and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience. All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes.

Slip it right into the pocket of your PJ sweatpants at night while taking out the trash. You won't have to keep yanking them back up. Conceal it in the front or back pocket of a pair of jeans. The small frame leaves no profile and the light weight keeps your strut natural and comfortable through out the day, instead of slowed down just to keep your gun from rocking on your hip and throwing your balance off. Match all that with a dependably lethal caliber and you've got yourself a pistol that you can count on any day of the week.

My hands and wrists were grateful for the comfortable rubber grip and the big, bright sights made lining up my target a breeze. The hammer and trigger actions were so smooth that the pin-pointedness of each shot was almost startling to me. Not once did I find this powerful revolver uncomfortable to shoot, even with a 3"" barrel.

This one is chambered for .40 S&W, the 9000S makes for an ideal carry pistol.

The 9000S has a unique magazine floorplate design, with two positions. The floor plate can be extended, giving you a rest for your little finger, or it can be kept retracted for a more compact package.

Just looking at this compact pistol, you'd find it hard to believe that it has a remarkable magazine capacity of 10 rounds of .40 S&W. 

The frame of the 9000S is made from a fiberglass refinforced polymer, and has two steel alloy rail inserts embedded in the frame, giving the frame a perfect alignment with the slide. The embedding of the steel rail inserts is radically different than the rails on other polymer-framed pistols.

The 9000S utilizes Beretta's patented locking system, with a tilting barrel and open slide. Beretta employs two lugs on the barrel that lock up with the slide when in the firing position. This simple design requires very few components, making it strong and reliable. 

As with every Beretta pistol, the 9000S has also been designed with looks in mind. The styling of the pistol is by Giugiaro Design, and is very distinctive. 

The grips of the pistol are integrated into the grip frame. The grip area has rubber molded over it for a slip-free, comfortable hold on the gun no matter what the weather.

The 9000S is disassembled quickly for cleaning by use of a disassembly lever. When the barrel and slide are put back on the frame, the disassembly lever is locked into place to prevent the pistol from accidental disassembly.

All 9000S models feature an automatic firing pin block that prevents the gun from firing in case of inadvertent drops or strikes against hard surfaces. It is de-activated only when the trigger is pulled back. The manual external safety lever is frame mounted and can be activated when the hammer is fully armed or in half-cock position. This lever interrupts the trigger linkage and prevents the rotation of the sear.
 This same lever also acts as a decocking mechanism, dropping the hammer to the half-cock position by simply rotating the lever past the safety position. From this position it is possible to fire the pistol in double-action (after disengaging the safety). The safety/decock lever is ambidextrous.

Features:
 1)The distinctive Giugiaro design is both functional and attractive.
 2)Light weight and compact for easy carry
 3)Refinforced polymer frame for light weight 
 4)The barrel is sandblasted steel, with a chrome lining for corrosion resistance.
 5)The slide is manufactured from steel alloy, sand-blasted, phosphated and Bruniton finished for maximum corrosion resistance and durability.
 6)The pistol has a white 3-dot sight for quick target acquisition. Both the rear and front sights are dovetailed to the slide for windage adjustments and may be replaced.
 7)An external hammer retains the traditional Beretta design with through-hole and gripping serrations. 
 8)Ergonomic Grip. Featuring a soft yet durable overmolded polymer, the grip absorbs vibrations and ensures positive pistol retention.
 10)The 9000S magazines are interchangeable with the full length magazines of the 92 Series pistols with the use of a special polymer sleeve available as a special order."

961,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2223961,"For Sale:  HEAVY .44 SPECIAL AMMO - 190 GR. SOFT CAST HP-GC (1,150FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX","azusa, California, United States",$ 36,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 15, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=271

Our purpose in developing this HEAVY 44 SPL load was to duplicate our renowned 38 SPL +P 158 gr. soft cast HP @ 1000 fps out of a 2 inch revolver, (Item 20A) but with a 190gr. 44 caliber bullet. This load was designed SPECIFICALLY for defensive use against humans. You can see our below velocities fired from my real world stock revolvers. We use only real world firearms in developing our published velocities and feel it is dishonest to use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocities that over-the-counter carry guns cannot duplicate. You need to know what your ammo is doing in the real world, not a lab.

1156 fps - Ruger Super Blackhawk, 5.5 inch barrel
1098 fps - S&W MT Gun, 4 Inch barrel
1046 fps - S&W mod. 696, 3 inch barrel
1057 fps - S&W mod. 396, 3 inch barrel
1005 fps - S&W mod. 296, 2 inch barrel

We developed this bullet to be soft (6 BHN) enough to mushroom at impact speeds around 750 fps, yet we wanted it hard enough (pure lead is 4 BHN) that it would not lead a normal revolver barrel. This bullet accomplishes both requirements. Depending on impact velocities, expect about 18 inches of penetration is living mammalian tissues, which should give ample penetration at bad angles to disable even very large men.

This bullet was also designed with a special crimp groove and the case mouth is heavily crimped and this bullet will NOT jump crimp in the lightweight alloy revolvers, provided you rotate the unfired rounds and thus do not expose unfired rounds to the recoil of more than about 10 firings.

We are using a flash suppressed powder so you won’t become blinded by your own gunfire in the likely event you drop the hammer in a low –light defensive situation.

This ammunition is for use in ALL 44 SPL and 44 MAG. firearms except the Charter Arms Bull Dog. No, this ammo won’t blow up your Bull Dog, but if you shoot more than a few hundred rounds of this ammo in a Bull Dog, the gun will get looser than it already was, will go out of “time” and stop working."

The above link is a listing on Armslist VT for a broken, non functional SR9c!  The seller is claiming he bought the gun brand new a month ago, has put less than 100 rounds through it and is only asking $400 (he was going to include a leather IWB holster for $425 for me)... He will not tell you why he is selling the gun.  When pressed, his answer was ""philosophical reasons"".  I was supposed to meet him this morning, he was going to drive 2 hrs to me to deliver it, and supposedly had to go to work right after, he told me therefore he had no time to shoot the gun with me before I bought it.  When asked if he would guarantee that the gun worked, in writing, on the bill of sale, he immediately became very mean spirited and was upset at me for not trusting him, a complete stranger. Even when I moved up the meeting time so we could shoot the gun he would not agree to sell it to me because of my skepticism. PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!! THIS SEEMS LIKE A GOOD DEAL BUT THERE IS SOMETHING OFF ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION AND REALLY OFF ABOUT THIS GUY!!!
