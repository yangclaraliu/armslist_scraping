224,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2355224,For Sale/Trade:  Remington Nylon 66 AB (Apache Black) Chrome.,"Dayton Athens Cleveland Ootewah Chattanooga, Chattanooga, Tennessee",$ 390,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 19, 2013",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a Remington Nylon 66 AB (Apache Black) Chrome. I bought this as a collectors piece (Because I owned one as a kid), but its just sitting in the safe so Im offering it for sale or trade. 

The Remington nylon stocks were made of a DuPont Nylon 66 series plastic called structural Zytel-101 that Dupont developed specifically for these rifles. (Remington Arms was then owned by DuPont.) The basic DuPont Nylon 66 polymer leant its name to the rifle. Just as with today's synthetic stocked rifles, the Remington Nylon series rifles were advertised as having lightweight, waterproof, essentially unbreakable stocks that would not warp, crack, chip, fade, or peel for the life of the rifle.

Introduced in 1959 and produced until 1991, it became the most popular Remington .22 of all time. Like the other Nylon series rifles to follow, it was a hunting and plinking rifle. This was a blowback operated, tubular magazine fed semi-automatic rifle chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge (only). The receiver of this rifle was actually nylon, with the bolt running on ""self lubricating"" nylon rails. (The Owners Manual advised not to lubricate the action with gun oil.) A slipover blued sheet steel cover was used to give the receiver a more normal appearance and also concealed a pair of stock reinforcing machine screws and nuts. The 19-5/8"" barrel was also blued.

For those who wanted something even more unusual, in 1961 Remington introduced the Nylon 66 AB rifle with a black (""Apache Black"") stock and chrome plated barrel and receiver cover. This was supposed to be the deluxe version of the Nylon 66, but most customers felt that the Mohawk brown version was actually more attractive and it was certainly a more practical hunting rifle. Never the less, Nylon 66 AB models accounted for almost 221,000 rifles sold and today the Apache Black/ Chrome bring about a 30% premium over other models.

The Nylon 66 action was a good one, very reliable in function. This was proven by Remington's extensive testing, in which over 100,000 cartridges were fired through individual rifles. It was capable of an extremely high cyclic rate of fire.

Details on this particular gun:

This Nylon 66 condition I would call around 80-85%. From the numbers and lettering it appears this rifle was manufactured in May of 1972. Based on the serial numbers it was definitely manufactured before 77, in 1977 Remington started adding an A at the end of the serial numbers.  The bore is very good, there are some scratches on the chrome receiver (looks worse in the photo than it really is), The receiver  and the barrel chrome are both good, there is some wear at the very tip of the barrel chrome (not all the way around and not large). There are no cracks or chips on the stock but there are some scratches. The front blade sight is missing, obviously for the scope. These AB/Chromes came with and without scope packages. This is the original Bushnell Sportview Scope that came with the gun when it was new. The front blade sight can be purchased from Midway for $16, Ebay for $20 (Chrome with screws) or Marble Arms for around 20 bucks and a thousand other places. 

Pricing and trades:

I see Nylon 66's at shows going for $300-$400, not the AB/Chromes and in not too good of condition. (Compared to this one). Last year Gun Values Board valued this gun at between $400-$450. Tonight looking on GunsAmerica and Gunbroker they are asking $600-$900. (Ridiculously high) and according to Nylon Rifles the Apache Black Chrome can bring up to 30% more over other Nylon 66 rifles."

No CA sales,know your own state law! The Newest Sig model in the awesome looking EQUINOX MORE POWER PER SQUARE INCH The new, remarkably ergonomic SIG P227™. It’s a .45ACP that holds 10+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip. Take hold of this high-power, high-capacity pistol and you’ll see first-hand how we’ve stacked the odds in your favor. The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P227® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P227 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. Firearm is factory new in box. Pictures are for general reference only.

Completely new design, the new RIFFE Euro Travel Series spearguns were designed for all levels of divers. Manufactured by RIFFE with the new MAG-TRACK (patent pending), a magnetic track for ease of loading and free-shafting. The low-profile stocks are made with 5 vertical laminated teak strips and bolted front muzzle for added strength. All models come standard with threaded stainless steel inserts for reel installation. The new uniquely designed Euro Traveler speargun and spearshaft breaks down for travel in mind. Each section of the speargun has a matching rod and sleeve assembly which inserted using Epoxy and machined with a close tolerance fit to eliminate any unwanted movement. The support plate and stainless steel threaded inserts (10-24 SS Screws) holds the sections together to ensure a close fit. The 9/32"" (7.1mm) spearshaft has been threaded and taped so that both ends make up the spearshaft length needed to fit each model.<"

The resulting gun was chambered in .32 ACP and designed by two brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl. It combined elements from both the Walther PP and PPK. The pistol is fed from an 8-round single-stack magazine, located within the bakelite paneled grip. Small fixed sights are located on top of the slide. The pistol functions via the blowback principal - recoil causes the slide to move backwards, thereby compressing a spring around the fixed barrel. After it reaches the end of its rearward travel, the recoil spring returns the slide to its forward position, stripping and chambering a new round from the magazine as it does so, rendering the gun ready to fire again. Hammer and trigger operation is double-action - that is, the hammer can be cocked and released by a squeeze of the trigger."

Micro H-1 - These sights are the lightest red dot sights tough enough to bear the Aimpoint name. Small enough to be used anywhere that you cold put iron sights, these sights can be used on any type of firearm or archery equipment. A lightweight rifle with an H1 Micro mounted on it remains a lightweight rifle! A hunting revolver with an H1 Micro installed remains as easy to carry as with iron sights and is much quicker to aim. On a bow, the parallax-free H1 Micro eliminates the need for a peep, allowing you to shoot accurately in lower light.

Unique features for Micro H-1

• Its weight – 84 g without mount and 105 g with mount
Ideal for rifles, shotguns, handguns or archery equipment.
• Integral Weaver-style base allows easy attachment.
ACET technology allows 50,000 hours of operation on one battery.
• 2 MOA (minutes of angle).
• Submersible to 15 feet (5 meters).
• 1X (non-magnifying) parallax free optic.
• Patent pending mount is keyed to the sight body to absorb recoil.
• Precision adjustment for windage and elevation. Top of protective caps fits into holes on adjustment screws – no other tool required.
• 12 settings for use in daylight and low light conditions.
• Color Black

The XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

""The design of the AccuBond®-LR allows for the highest B.C. possible in a bullet of the same caliber and weight. Designed with an optimum performance window ranging from 3,200fps to 1,300fps, the unique tapered jacket geometry and proprietary bonding process of the AccuBond®-LR allow it to expand rapidly for effective energy transfer and significant tissue damage while retaining sufficient weight to ensure deep penetration into the vitals. The AccuBond® bonding process allows the AccuBond®-LR to perform reliably on game throughout the entire velocity range, eliminating the problem of being “too close” often encountered with other high-B.C. bullets. The high-performance boat tail, long ogive, and polymer tip combine to make the AccuBond®-LR the sleekest, flattest- shooting, bonded, hunting bullet ever created. The ogive of the AccuBond®-LR is designed to provide excellent accuracy in a wide variety of firearms without the necessity of being loaded close to or in contact with the lands. The new AccuBond®-LR will be packaged in 100 count boxes, and will initially be available in the following calibers and weights."""

I've only put 250 rounds through it and no hiccups whatsoever. Super reliable and very accurate for a DAO gun. Love this gun but getting rid of it because it doesn't quite fit into my current carry strategy.

The gun comes with a manufacturer's lifetime warranty that follows the gun. Impossible to beat! I'm also throwing in one box of Hornady Critical Defense 115 gr ammo (25 rounds). It's basically fully broken in and ready to go - you can arm up within minutes of closing the deal (assuming you're a CPL of course!)

The electronic components in the CompM4 improve upon Aimpoint's existing state of the art ACET diode circuitry, allowing this new sight to run constantly for over 8 years on a single AA battery. The CompM4 features an internal voltage regulator that allows the sight to operate on any AA size battery available worldwide. This sight features a 2 minute-of-angle (MOA) dot size, making it perfectly suited for use with Aimpoint's 3XMagnifier scope module. The CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, and features an extremely rugged and easy to use 16-position manual switch with 7 night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings. The CompM4 sight body is designed to protect both the optics and adjustment components against hard use, and is waterproof to 45 meters (150 feet).


The CompM4 also features an improved QRP2® Picatinny rail mount, eliminating the need for a separate mounting ring. This mount has over twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and features a lower and wider torque limiting knob to improve ease of use and lessen the chance of the sight base becoming snagged on other equipment. The mount is keyed into the sight to absorb recoil forces. Vertical and cantilever spacers are available to allow the sight to fit on all M16 rifle and M4 carbine variants. The sight can also be used on any other weapon with a Picatinny rail mounting system.

Product Information:
The Adams Arms gas piston conversion is a complete retrofitting kit that brings a standard AR-15 rifle into the 21st century by replacing its dirty direct gas impingement operating system with a cooler, cleaner, short-stroke gas piston design. With the piston conversion installed, hot combustion gases are kept out of the upper receiver and vented forward, resulting in a gun that remains cleaner and cooler during operation for increased reliability and decreased maintenance.

The gas piston kit installs easily, requiring no permanent alterations to the rifle, and adds virtually no additional weight to the gun. The kit comes complete with a replacement gas block (with integral single Picatinny top rail), piston and piston return spring, operating rod, solid steel one piece replacement bolt carrier , handguard cap, properly relieved M-4 style handguards, installation hardware and complete instructions. The low profile of the Adams Arms piston design makes it compatible with some free-floating handguards, however removal of some material from the upper portion of the free-float handguard may be required for use with this operating system.

Technical Information:

Kit Contents:
Gas block
Piston
Piston return spring
Operating rod
Drop in Quad Rail Handguards (Requires NO Modification, direct Drop in)
Handguard cap
Upper Receiver Bushing
Installation hardware
One piece bolt carrier
Back Up Iron Sights Front and Rear
Pelican Carry Case

The one piece bolt carrier features an integrally machined, solid steel strike face to absorb the operating rod's energy, and eliminates Carrier tilt, as opposed to the modified bolt carrier key as with most competitors piston system.

When I spec'd this out, I thought it would be the last pistol I needed.  Boy was I wrong.  I took a 1911 course this past summer, built a pistol, and at the end of the course was ready to build another. In order to keep that up, I need to free up some capital.  This is a Springfield Stainless TRP, my first 1911 actually.  I shot 1000 rounds through it quickly, and I was very pleased with it.  Then I decided to use it as a base gun for a dream build.  I got $1400 worth of work done by SACS, not including new parts I sent in with the pistol.  Since the work was completed, I have fired 600 rounds and carried it occasionally.  Here is a list of the work, as well as pictures below, including the build sheet.

I have a like new in box, pretty little diamond back db 380 that I'm looking to trade or sell. This weapon is flawless as the day it was made, and I will be including extras. I have a spare ported barrel to add that makes it a heck of a lot more fun at the range, and I also have three quality Italian made mags to add in. Of course, all box, lock and papers go with it as well. 

This pistol has a very, very low round count, and no wear of any type. It has been my constant pocket companion from the time I've gotten it, and I would have to say that it is hands down the best CC weapon I've ever owned. The trigger is surprisingly smooth, and this has been nothing but fun reliability in a very subtle package. Toss it in a pocket and go! 

I will top off the mag with hydra-shock hollows for a good trade. 

The spare barrel was almost 100.00 by itself, so please consider that when making offers. The ported bbl only has seen about a box of rounds down range, just as many as the flush fit barrel. All flawless. No stack fires or double feeds."

Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

PATENTED RUGER REVERSE INDEXING PAWL allows for easier loading and unloading, while the traditional
beveled cylinder simplifies holstering.

INTERNAL LOCK unobtrusively located beneath the right grip panel, provides an added measure of security.

HANDSOME, LARGER CRESCENT-SHAPED EJECTOR ROD HEAD boasts traditional form, perfect for every

See discription below. 
 The CZ 82 magazine is a staggered box magazine that we had designed specifically . The magazine holds 12 rounds of 9x18mm Makarov (9mm Makarov) ammunition and is manufactured entirely from steel, save the floor plate. The steel body has been fully heat treated and features a rear seam that has been laser welded to ensure your magazine remains durable and reliable for years to come. Additionally, the inclusion of a follower spring that is 7 percent stronger than surplus magazines ensures that our magazine will properly feed upon each discharge. Upon closer inspection, you will notice that our CZ 82 magazines include the thicker, milled floor plate that was used on the original magazines (as opposed to the thinner – arguably less desirable – stamped floor plates). The floor plate was milled from aluminum."

Now the same Benelli M4 Tactical Shotgun used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan."

The Extar EXP-556 is a polymer AR-15 pistol produced by Extar in the USA. 


The EXP-556 utilizes a polymer lower which is mostly standard other than the buffer tube area which is solid and unthreaded compared to a standard lower. Other than the pins and springs the entire lower is comprised of polymer parts. The trigger is marketed as a 5.5lb trigger. In testing, the trigger is very good considering it is polymer. There’s no real takeup or slack and it breaks very crisply. The lower has an integrated winter trigger guard to ease gloved shooting. The pistol is shipped with one 30 round Tapco magazine.

BoltAssembly

 The upper is also polymer and features a proprietary recoil spring system sitting over a somewhat familiar looking bolt assembly. Since it is spring dampened there isn’t a long bolt carrier like a standard AR, it’s carrier has an abbreviated length. The upper is also unique in that it features a reciprocating charging handle on the left side. There is no dust cover or forward assist on the right side of the upper.

The front gas block has an integrated front sight post machined into it and the rear sight is a ghost ring fitted into a dovetail in the polymer top rail. Between the upper and gas block is a stabilizing rod which helps keep the upper aligned and supported.

The 8.25” barrel features a very effective muzzle brake. The brake pushes the barrel length to 9.25” overall. Its so effective that when shooting, the gun actively pushes down and back against the shooter. This creates a flat shooting pistol with minimal recoil felt to the shooter. The flipside of this effective brake is an engulfing muzzle flash and a deafening concussion. This is definitely not a gun you would ever want to shoot without hearing protection.

AMT Automag II chambered in .22 WMR, 4.5"" barrel
All Stainless construction, only the springs, sights and grips are not Stainless.
Excellent Millet sights, fully adjustable rear and orange blade front.
Slim, light, very accurate, and well-balanced.

Comes with original owners manual and  2 9-rd. magazines, one orange follower, one black follower.
Also comes with 40 rds. of ammo for local buyers.

AMT polished the feed ramp and reamed the chamber in 1994 when a previous owner sent it back in. As far as I can tell, this is a Hi-Standard built model with the H-prefix serial number, and incorporates improvements to the original M-prefix and 2nd gen. C-prefix serials. I believe this serial to be dated in the early-90's.

Limited test firing done by me with Remington Premier Accutip-V showed no failures to feed, fire, or extract with either magazine.
Fun to shoot! Makes a nice fireball and a healthy boom.

Very good condition with some minor handling marks in the finish, very low round count based on the polishing and wear present on the frame rails, barrel, bushing, slide, etc.
Bore is clean and bright with well-defined lands and grooves.

Up for sale is a *like new*, simply broken in with 100 light target rounds, semi-automatic shotgun. The box and manual are included, I believe the 5-year warranty would still be useable too.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with it, and it will fire every single time. I will show you at the time of sale, a video of me shooting it, shooting it fast enough to make most guns jam, and shooting it slow. I 100% guarantee functionality, or money back within 1 week, and I'll show you everything I know about it. The pictures are stock photos, but I can text you photos of the real one (I can't get my iPhone to connect to my PC). The gun is completely stock, and nothing has changed about it, I seriously doubt if you could find a scratch.

I am selling it because I will be moving, and moving in with people who would be uncomfortable with firearms in the house, especially since they wouldn't know me very well, and I'm young, so your purchase would be much appreciated in that sense.

The shotgun was $350 after tax at Wal-Mart, and I'm including a $20 Plano padded hard case. I'll include 5 shells of Remington 00 Buckshot too.
If you can explain to me why it's worth less than the asking price, then you are welcome, and I'll reason with you, and drop it if you can make a point, or show me a store that has it for a better deal, or only slightly more. But otherwise, please no offers, they are only insulting to the value of the gun.

 I am open to trades of any kind but prefer revolvers in 357 mag with barrels in 4"" or 5"", may consider a 6"" barrel but nothing longer than 6"". Semi autos must be 4"" or longer barrel with a max mag capacity of 10 rounds. My wife and I are relocating for work out of country and can only bring with us guns that meet this requirement. 
 No low ball offers, no trades plus cash accepted, I want something of equal or greater value. 
 If no reasonable offers are received than I will just place them in cold storage until we return to the good ole USA in 5 years."
