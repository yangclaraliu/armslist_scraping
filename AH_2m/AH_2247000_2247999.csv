The gun is a Waffen Werks AK-74 which is built on a Bulgarian parts kit and finished with KG Gun Cote. It is in overall great shape with 570 flawless rounds of 7N6 down the barrel. The barrel and chamber on this gun are chrome lined and have been properly cleaned after shooting corrosive ammo. This is certainly a high end gun and is by far the nicest AK I have ever owned.

There are also a lot of accessories included in this sale. First off, I have nine magazines for the gun. One black Tapco mag, two East German Bakelite mags, four polymer Polish Tantal mags, and two sanitized Bulgarian mags. All are in excellent shape and have functioned perfectly. Next is a surplus Bulgarian Bakelite bayonet which is in great shape. I also have a surplus web sling on this gun. Lastly, I have 3,750 rounds of Russian 7N6 ammo. There are three sealed spam cans, one partial can, and all of the mags are loaded. Oh, I also have a damaged but still very functional spare buttstock which will be included.

I think that covers everything for sale. I am asking $1600 for the package. This is a cash only sale. I am not interested in separating right now as I'd like to get rid of everything at the same time. I am located in Hickory NC and am willing to drive a reasonable distance. If interested, contact me and we can hash out a definition of reasonable.

I believe that I'm the third owner or so but I've only fired it twice.  It has a problem with the dust cover where it popped off and I couldn't get it back right.  Because of this, gun is sold AS IS hence the price.  I will throw in another dust cover that I bought that didn't fit properly.  The gun will still shoot without the dust cover if the owner really wanted it to.  As you can see in the pictures, there are engravings in the gun in the receiver.  I didn't mind them but you could always just buy another one if you didn't like them.  I also have about 500 rounds of Golden Tiger ammo for it if the buyer wants to add some more to it since.  Will come with one 30 round magazine and about 7 or 8 rounds of spam can ammo that they won't let me shoot at CSA.  I don't know what brand it is or how to tell, my apologies about that.

127,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2247127,For Sale:  1866 Chassepot Rifle Chatellernault Armenment Carbine,"Bluff City, Tri-cities, Tennessee",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, October 27, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a 1866 Chassepot Rifle Carbine by Chatellernault Armenment. This is the first gun of this age I have had and I don't know a lot about the gun except what I've read on the internet and I'm not sure if I will get all the language correct for listing. I'm going to list everything the gun reads for a description. I don't know if this gun was modified from the ones captured by Russia in the war and modified by them. I know there was close to a 1,000,000 of these guns captured, redesigned and reissued to the Russian army as carbines.
The gun measures 37 5/8"" long, the stock has a small crack below bolt. The barrel itself does have some dings along the right side, that look to me like it has been stored with other guns. The blueing has turned to the metal tint as a older shotgun does. Its missing the original ram rod and the military sight, the inside of the barrel is very clean, no real signs of pitting.
Here's how the gun reads starting with the barrel:
The left side- F 19731 P.G. with letters B & D in a circle
Right side- S 1870 & S 1876
Reciever Left side- 1866 Chatellernault Armenment M 1866 underneath that
 (?) 1870-1871 France cal. st Alb VI
I believe gun bolt has been replaced with a striker and gas vent, there's no needle, but looks to have a firing pin like a shotgun. 
Would be willing do some trading on the rifle for newer rifle or shotgun."

This is a LE trade-in.  It has night sights that are a little dim, but still usable.  There is some slight holster wear on slide, and someone scratched FPD GL113 on the bottom of the trigger guard.

There is nothing wrong with this pistol, I bought it a month ago and it was my first Glock.  I now know they are not for me.  Lol.

I am a meticulous gun owner, i make a day of cleaning my guns.  I clean with mil-comm products and clean so good i use qtips to get in the tiny areas.  I treat my guns great because their mine and i take care of whats mine.  That said, i noticed some surface rust(surface only) on the gun a few months back.  I took some 00 steel wool and lightly rubbed the rust with some high quality rust remover.  The finish came off a bit in a few areas, nothing that you couldn't fix easily if you chose to, it does not affect the functioning of the gun at all and I have never had a single issue with function.  The rubbed areas have been treated with a rust preventer.  Note that these are NOT scratches, they are minor rubs.  Once refinished, they would never show."

This replacement magazine is a factory original from Mossberg. Factory replacement parts are manufactured to the exact same specifications and tolerances and use the same manufacturing materials as the original parts which guarantees excellent fit and reliable operation. 

Keeping a few extra factory magazines around is never a bad idea; extra magazines save loading time at the range and also serve as a backup for those days when you simply cannot remember where you put your primary magazine.

As you can see by the pictures, it does have some use wear but this scope is a tank! It was designed to withstand the rigors of the modern day battlefield and it has held up very well with U.S. soldiers and special forces. Another plus is the lifetime warranty that comes with U.S. Optics scopes, regardless of whether or not you are the original owner. I cannot say enough good things about this scope.

The U.S. Optics SN-4s is a terrific choice to mount on an AR-15 or similar semi-automatic rifle (will not mount on a FNH Scar 16s). At 1x magnification, the user can shoot with both eyes open at point blank range and at the maximum 4x magnification, the user can rely upon precision shot placement at much longer ranges. The fully multi-coated Schott glass lenses allow full transmission of 94.6% of available light, which when paired with the red illuminated reticle, makes them ideal for use from dawn until dusk. The illuminated reticle is also adjustable via an 11 position rheostat to allow the user to adjust intensity. Windage and elevation knobs are U.S. #1 5/8 MOA Slimline which are finger adjustable to allow for quick adjustments whenever the need arises. Each U.S. Optics Rifle Scope is hand-built by one person to ensure that the utmost care is taken in producing a quality scope.

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is Very Different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. 
The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand perfectly.
Something these little Taurus pistols have been praised for is the tip-up barrel design. What looks something like a slide release on the left side of the gun is actually a barrel release. Press it forward and the rear of the barrel pops up for loading a round directly into the chamber. To load the PT-22, then, simply load the magazine with cartridges, fully insert the magazine into the butt of the gun until it catches, pop up the barrel, insert a cartridge, and snap the barrel back down into the closed position.  
There is no need to rack the slide, which is a benefit to those who, because of arthritis or other hand weakness, are unable to operate conventional auto pistols.

I called originally from their listing on the scratch and dent sale.  I spoke with Dee, who was EXTREMELY nice and helpful.  Hands down head and shoulders above 99.9% of employees at ANY business in regards to attitude and customer service.  She went to the back to check the inventory left before I drove out to the location by the hard rock in Catoosa.  I ended up driving in that day (a busy Saturday mind you)  and patiently waited while they diligently tended to previous customers.  I was helped by Dee's son (it's a family affair), who was more than helpful in answering my questions and I mentioned the ad to get a free dehumidifier.  I couldn't take it home that day due to the vehicle I was in.  They replied ""no problem!  We'd be happy to hold it for you until you can arrange pickup"".  

That being said, they close at 5 on weekdays.  I NEVER get off before 530 during the week, but today had a Dr apt for my daughter so I was off at 3pm.  I called and said I was going to try to make it today (10/21).  Ended up that it was 430 and I was just able to head that way from deep south BA.  I called and the owners gladly and willingly stayed until after close to aid in my safe pickup.  The owner even helped load it with me, as the rest of his staff was gone for the day.  This is going above and beyond imo.  

Moral of the story is if you're in the market for a gun safe, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not at least giving SCI a shot.  I'll tell everybody I know in the gun world about them and their service!  Top notch service, top notch products and prices.

**I have zero affiliation or ties with the company, or any of its employees and they had no idea I was going to post this ""review"".  I received no discount aside from the scratch and dent prices and the free dehumidifier."

No Magazines are included in the sale and there is now a Bullet Button installed! The EOTech Zombie Stopper is also not included!

For sale is a custom complete AR Pistol built from a Calico Jack Spikes Tactical 5.56mm lower. I have invested over $1,400 into this build that I finished earlier this year out of state in Colorado. I was planning on keeping it for myself, but alas... bills.

This is my ninth custom AR15 type build in the last 12 years. I have never had any issues with any of my builds as I am an experienced & certified Armorer (Active Duty Military). Again I built this specific pistol before I moved from Colorado and threw in a CA Bullet button before I left. It is 100% legal! I have yet to test fire it, meaning the pistol has zero rounds through it.

Major Component list:
Spikes Tactical Calico Jack Lower with CMMG Lower Parts Kit
Complete Pistol Buffer Tube Assembly - Can't remember brand, perhaps Phase 5 
Magpul ASAP
Magpul MOE  Polymer Trigger Guard
Magpul B.A.D. Lever
Magpul MOE Punisher Logo Grip (Not Pictured yet...) 
CA Bullet Button

Complete Mas Defense Upper 7.5"" 5.56 / .223 Barreled Upper 
TROY Alpha Battle Rail 9″
Noveske Krink KX3 Flash Suppressor with Pig (Authentic with packaging!)
Magpul PTS Flip Sights(This is the only Magpul PTS anything on this rifle...)

This pistol is new! There are only signs of wear from tightening the locking ring on the pistol buffer tube when my wrench slipped and also on the Noveske flash suppressor from sliding the Troy Rail over it (which was unavoidable). The Noveske is hidden inside the rail so it is not noticeable.

I am not a manufacturer or dealer and this AR pistol was brought in from out of state so I can legally possess and transfer it as a private party in California. Also, as I am currently active duty military, I did not need to register this pistol when I brought it into the state. I am aware of all the California Gun Laws and I have consulted a firearms lawyer, I can refer you to him if you're concerned, but they charge per the hour, so it's best to do your research on calguns.net.

Asking $1,200.00 FIRM. CASH ONLY! NO TRADES! NO LOW BALL! No Return! You may of course inspect & function check before buying! You must be able to meet me at a FFL near Long Beach, CA. Buyer pays all transfer fees. Email, call or text Nate at REDACTED if interested."

Includes upper, bolt, buffer spring, tungsten buffer, HK iron sights, new HK high-reliability 30 round magazine, and two HK rail covers.  I've shot less than 200 rounds through it and it is basically brand new.  It is a BB date code.

The upper kit has an MSRP of $2,195, but I'm asking only $1,750 OBO.

This kit can be mailed directly to you, if you are not located near me in Reno, NV.

From HK:

The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit includes a complete upper receiver/barrel assembly, bolt carrier assembly, buffer, and buffer spring allowing most high-quality 5.56 mm AR-style rifles to be retrofitted to HK’s pusher rod system. The Upper Receiver Kit is the core of the HK 5.56 mm proprietary gas piston operating system. It employs a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

The same operating system is used in the combat-proven 5.56 mm HK416 as well as the G36, XM8, HK417, and a variety of other Heckler & Koch arms. The MR556A1 Upper Receiver Kit is designed to be fully interchangeable with all high quality AR-style firearms, simply by attaching it to an AR lower receiver using the standard takedown pins."

i am also throwing in a brand new front site as the one that currently sits on it lost the illumination piece, so I ordered a Trijicon H3 front site directly from FNH.  I decided not to install it because I am already under water but couldn't in good faith sell it with a bad lume.

Price is pretty firm, only potential trades would be for something really cool (non pistol as I have what I need there) , maybe a sweet skeet shotgun (can be pump or OU/SBS, both probably too expensive.  I really prefer cash cause I'm getting a tattoo, so if you work for Black Cat tattoo in Lawrenceville and can ""trade time"" for the gun I'd be cool with that.

Not interested in shipping now, so i'm looking for a local buyer.  Buy pays transfer fees.  I know of a few local cheaper ones if you don't.  Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you."

LOWERED PRICE!!! Less then what a new one costs AND this is a CUSTOM with accesories!!!

I bought this gun in mid 2009 at a gun show from a Hamilton dealer, NIB with a custom trigger job and cylinder polish and bead blast. The action is SUPER SMOOTH  with a very light poundage single action mode. This is by far the nicest 500 I've seen and handled. It was meant to be my bear gun when on horseback in the mountains, however, I've been on very few outings with it. It's mostly seen the occasional range time and has been replaced by my Ruger Alaskan 454 casull, so this has to go. For such a beast of a gun, it is actually fun to shoot, even with my smaller hands. I hate to sell her, but I could use the fundage for other toys that would get used more often.

This gun has been treated with the utmost care like all of my possessions are and has ridden in it's own gun rest in my gun safe when not out to the range. Other than the typical cylinder rotation marks and the small powder burns/stains at the cylinder and ports, there are no blemishes. The gun functions flawlessly as expected. 

Included is a custom right hand cross draw shoulder holster with bullet scabbard made by Montana Chaps & Gun Leather in Great Falls. This rig rides very comfortably for toting such a heavy revolver! I'm also including about 160 Hornady bullets that I never got around to use for reloads, a bunch of once spent shell casings, pretty much representing every bullet shot from this gun, which is very little a 50 cal bore brush, case and all the original paperwork. The ammo boxes seen on picture are shell casings as well. I have maybe 5 Hornady bullets left is all, non reloads.

It does have the markings on the barrel indicating it was or could have been a Sniper. Does not have a bent bolt. All numbers match. Only fired a few times. It came with the Bayonet, both Magazine Pouches, cleaning kit, oil can and had the Laminated Stock in almost perfect condition. I changed the Wood stock out for an ATI composite stock so that I didn't have the original stock ruined. I also took of the rear ""leaf"" sight to add a tri-rail and a NcStar 3X9 40 power long eye relief scope. The side rails can be removed if you prefer just the top rail. I have also added a bi-pod. All changes I have made are NOT permanent and can be changed back to original stock. I also have 20 stripper clips the original sling and roughly 400 rounds of 7.62X54 R that comes with it. I bought the rifle for $150 before the prices started sky rocketing and have over $200 in accessories plus ammo. I don't need to get rid of the rifle and don't really want to sell but would be interested in trades. I also do not want to seperate any of it. I prefer other firearms but can't hurt to ask."

""The Enhanced version Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun.

ACP will accept most railed guns with barrels up to 5"" in length.

This enhanced model includes the new SIG SAUER Mini Red Dot Sight, a quick detachable sling swivel and a Single Point Bungee Sling.

Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock
positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red
dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality.

I have a 1982 Goldwing GL1100 Classic (that means naked). I LOVE this bike, but I am going in a different direction and I'm going to be on the coast soon. I was going to supercharge this bike and run a 1983 final drive unit so I could run it at the strip and have a comfortable ride whenever I wanted to cruise around. 

It's an 82 Goldwing (Naked obviously). Brand new brakes (not even a mile on them), new tires (less than 1500 miles), new valve cover gaskets, new spark plugs, new oil, all lights work, new battery, new speedo cable, comes with one new head gasket (just in case), final drive gasket, timing belts, as many of the new valve cover bolts I can find (bought the last eight in the springs), has full bags (sides, front and small rear for the sissy bar), Harley pipes that have been cored (nice, loud, deep, but won't make you go deaf), highway pegs, shifter seal done with oil, idle adjusted properly for pipes, Road Krome windscreen (AWESOME in the rain, cold, and on long trips). I planned on new grips in the next few months, rebuild and supercharger next year (rebuild would have only been to ensure reliability), custom grips, mirrors and pipes at some point. As you can see, I have a lot of time, thought, money and myself tied up into this bike, I just need to prep for the future and a bike isn't in it for right now. If you're interested, text me at 719-659-626 and then add a four on the end.
