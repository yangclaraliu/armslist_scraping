The gun's trigger group, bolt, slide and magazine tube show minimal wear, indicating this gun has been fired little in its 35 yr life.

It was purchased because I have an AP15 and figured the parts were interchangeable but they are not. It is sighted in for a bit farther than the average .22, but considering this particular example was formerly a training rifle for the Thai army, I can see why they might shoot to farther distances than the average shooter. Sights can easily be adjusted, has adjustable front and rear sight. This Italian made gun has the added bonus of field stripping just like an M16; remove the rear pin, pull the charging handle and the bolt will come with it. Also uses a buffer tube like a real M16. Has some blue paint on the front face of the gas block, probably to designate it wasn't a trainer and not a real one. Magazine is new by Triple-K and thus very tight, I suggest if you want it to function with 15 rounds instead of 10 like I've been loading that you load the magazine completely and l let it sit for half a year. These rifles are rarely seen in this good of a condition as commercial examples imported by Mitchell Arms almost always have broken dust covers that won't stay closed and most of the commercial rifles people are selling have a broken firing pin or extractor.

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE night sights. This pistol ships with a flush fit 8 round magazine and a 10 round extended magazine. Combat ready and built to last.

These are exact copies of the earlier Browning Hi-Power with completely interchangeable parts. Chambered in 9mm Parabellum, it is a former police gun, most likely from South Africa, it has a distributors renaming on it that's fairly worn off labeled as ""LUGER M80"" it is lightly pitted in some areas, when I first got it it was nickel plated with most the plating coming off. I sent it off to be cerakoted professionally (no part that is cerakoted will ever rust! No need to wipe down after handling if unfired.) they stripped and cleaned it thoroughly and refinished it black and white, including the magazine, the barrel (inside and out,) and every part of the gun on the inside and out except the firing pin and face of the bolt. Still has magazine safety, and is impressively accurate. I have been using it as my carry gun and not 100% sure I want to get rid of it as I sold it before and bought it back but I wouldn't mind having a Springfield XD or a Glock, maybe a S&W M59 and I don't have a lot of money right now.

If sale I'm asking: 275 (the friend I had sold it to had it in his shop at $450, so it's definitely worth at least 275!)

If there are large trees that must be felled, more than likely, this is the saw that gets the nod. The MS 660’s amazing power-to-weight ratio gives you a whole lot more power (a 15% increase in engine power over the MS 460!) with only a marginal increase in weight. Small wonder, then, that it’s been the chain saw of choice for so many professionals, and the saw chosen for use in the STIHL® TIMBERSPORTS® Series.  I will include a 28"" brand new bar and two loops of 72jgx chain(the pro stuff). Nothing home owner quality here. This is the cream of the crop chainsaw, ask anybody. Whether you're a pro timber feller or just want the baddest saw on the block this is for you. I have larger bars as well, and can do combos, say you want a 36"" bar and a 28"" I can make it work. I will include the owners manual, a pair of Kevlar chaps,  the illustrated parts list(these pro saws are meant to be built up, fixed, etc..) basically you'll be getting the whole shabang.  This aint no husky rancher...this is the real deal.  The saw alone retails 12-1500 bucks. Chain loops go for bout 30 per and chaps will cost you an easy 100-120. We can work out the small details if you're interested."

It was then cleaned and put in my safe and it's been there ever since.  There is still the copper looking stuff from Glock inside of it.  I don't play games and say a firearm hasn't been fired and later claim ""Oh, I just 'test fired' it"".  If it's unfired, I state it's unfired.  If you can't tell, like this one, I admit that it has had 9 rounds down the tube then cleaned.  It comes with all the stuff that was shipped with a Gen3 Glock 27.  It basically looks like a new Glock 27.  I apologize in advance for those who haven't bought from me as I've been cleaning out some of collection; I price my firearms at what I feel is a very fair price and stick to that price.  I just don't want to play games.  The first $450 cash with proper IN ID and preferably a LTCH takes home what is arguably one of the best personal protection weapons made.  If it doesn't sell, then it doesn't sell.  Someone 'bought' this last week and then wanted to include a Raven on trade when they met to pick it up.  So, I figured I'd go ahead and list it one more time.  You can tell from the pictures that it's nicer than many ""new"" firearms that have been on a dealer's shelf.  Honestly, if you can find a nicer Gen3 Glock 27 in it's original box with all it shipped with from Glock for less, buy it.  I assume you could probably find a great G27 shooter that is well worn for $400, but this one is like new.  IMHO, it's worth an extra $50, but that's just my opinion.  Either way, thanks for looking!

Hornady® LEVERevolution® Rifle Ammunition


•Designed for lever-action rifles 
•Elastomer Flex Tip bullet is safe in tubular magazine 
•High ballistic coefficient increases range
•Expands reliably from 800 to 2,000+ fps
•Delivers up to 40% more energy than traditional flat-point rounds
Hornady, a leader in ballistic innovation, now introduces a new line of ammunition for lever-action rifles that dramatically increases velocity, energy, trajectory and downrange terminal performance. Lever guns with tubular magazines have been hindered in the past by their inability to fire pointed bullets safely. Now Hornady has perfected the Elastomer Flex Tip™ bullet that can be safely fired from such rifles without fear of a chain reaction discharge in the magazine. The Flex Tip puts enough give in the bullet tip to prevent detonation of the primer ahead of it in the magazine. It also increases the ballistic coefficient of the round by using a pointed bullet design and permits the use of propellants that can turn popular 100-yard ""brush gun"" rounds into deadly performers at 200 yards and beyond. For example, LEVERevolution .30-30 ammunition shoots a 160-grain bullet that is 400 fps faster and has 400 ft.-lbs. more energy at 250 yards than conventional .30-30 ammo, and bullet drop at 300 yards is about 12"" with a 200-yard zero. LEVERevolution similarly enhances the performance of other popular lever gun calibers and delivers up to 40% more energy compared to conventional flat-point ammunition.

460,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2628460,For Sale:  Antique Retro 1911 Pistol Replica Toy,"Monkey Junction, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 50,"Listed On: Thursday, September 18, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an incredibly realistic 1911 pistol replica. It's heavy weight metal, with plastic grips. The grip safety works, the thumb safety works, the slide functions, the hammer functions in conjunction with the trigger, it's an amazingly realistic little replica. 

It is not a gun! The metal is cheap and wouldn't even remotely hold up to firing, the barrel is plugged and there is no firing pin mechanism, don't even think of using this as a gun, it simply wouldn't work! 

It needs a little bit of repair, the grips are broken and there's a spring missing just in front of the thumb safety in that little tube on the left side of the frame that puts pressure on the thumb safety. Priced cheap compared to what I see selling on the internet.  I don't want to ship this, local sales only."

Bulletproof Model Slide release ($61)
Match Grade Trigger ($30)

Full Length Stainless Guide Rod ($30)
Just had a brand new Wilson Combat spring Kit ($15) installed in December including recoil spr.
 I planned to have it cerakoted in Raleigh to cover up some idiot marks, but it really didnt need it and I figured the person buying or trading can either do it or leave it be. 
the sell or trade will come with 200 rounds of high end self defense HP ammo mostly hornady,gold dot, remington precision.
Have box and papers and bill from gunsmith for add ons and additions.
This pitsol has no MIM (metal injection molded) parts and it ultra accurate. Over $700 worth of parts, magazines, and work.
 You can buy a basic used Springfield 1911-A1 for $550-650 depending on condition. I know I will never get the $400 in parts and accessories or the cost of the installation, sight zero, and other costs, but I am trying to price fairly. I have carried and shot this pistol alot, maybe 2,000 - 2,500 rounds. Never an issue with any amm or anything whatsoever. I trust my life with this gun. Shows some wear but no abuse or anything that affects safety or operation in any way. I treat others like I want to be treated and expect the same. I have plenty of pictures if interested. 

I am open to trades. I also have a very nice Glaco COP series and Galco magazine pouch for sale seperately or included in a trade I really want.

This rail was only used on an M1A scout for about a month before it was put back and unused.  This rail is "" AS IS ""It is pretty much brand new the only scratch is on the close up picture of the bolt mounting hole from the screw hitting one of the rails.

This item comes with;
 Brand new hardware, 8 bolts and 4 barrel clamps from UltiMAK
 It also comes with 2 spare bolts and installation instructions from utlimak

Compatibility:
The UltiMAK M8 mount fits only standard, GI spec barrels. In the current Springfield line-up, the compatible models are; M1A Standard, M1A Scout Squad, SOCOM 16, and SOCOM II. The ""Loaded Standard"" and all of their ""Match"" and ""Tactical"" models have heavier-than-standard barrels, which will not allow M8 mount installation. Chinese M1A clones have standard barrels and fit nicely with the M8 mount. If your M-14 or M1A does not fit any of the above descriptions, you should call the manufacturer and ask if the barrel is of standard M-14 outer diameter specs, including the size and location of the op-rod guide. As a side note; the original U.S. military production ""National Match"" M-14s had standard weight barrels. Among the differences was that the bore tolerances were halved.

Ok folks, I'm going to do my best to answer all the questions you may have about this rifle in this ad. If it's not in this ad, I either do not know or will be unable to get the information.

The history of the rifle is as follows, it was assembled by a custom barrel maker. The bolt is a Winchester action on a 29"" stainless steel barrel. I acquired the rifle to financially help out a retired police officer experiencing congestive heart failure. I have no use for the rifle and would like to just break even at 850.

I am unable to tell who the scope is made by, all I see is 4-14 x50mm long range. I live in the Waynesville, Fort Leonard Wood , St Robert area. If you are interested, please e-mail me."

These are the more sought after versions before they were made in U.S.A by Magnum Research.  Comes with 2-7rd mags.  It's had very low rounds thru it and has been professionally Cerakoted in black which cost me $280 and has the trigger chrome polished.  Also has a Houge grip installed for better comfort and control.  Since it's been Cerakoted it was cleaned and put in the safe.  It is in new condition with no scratches or marks of any kind,  it is a beautiful work of art and monster of a gun!  I guarantee this will be some of the most fun you ever had shooting a pistol!!! The IMI Desert Eagle .50 caliber handgun is considered by many to be the ultimate weapon. With a bullet large enough to stop a truck, it's hard to deny that a hand cannon like this makes a statement. A gun this big is more like a rifle, and not just because of its huge dimensions; the technology on the inside resembles them as well. Most semi-automatic pistols use short recoil or blow-back systems but the D.E. uses a gas-operated mechanism more commonly found in assault rifles. The rotating bolt and locking mechanism also bear a strong resemblance to those in M16 rifles.
This is more than a gun, it's a wave of destruction. Shooting one is less like firing a bullet and more like launching an artillery shell, which is exactly why it has been banned in many parts of the world!!!

I'm also adding 250rds of Hornady XTP .50AE  hollow point 300gr. 
These go for $40 a box of 20rds. And are by far some of the best ammunition for the Desert Eagle XIX.  

It will also come with custom case with take down tool and cleaning tools. 

The Cerakote coating will insure a lifetime of durability and lubrication.  The coating self lubricates and withstands any chemicals or cleaning agents you may use.  Look it up on they're website @ www.cerakoteguncoatings.com

Will only sell as a package with ammo.

I bought the extra mags and holster new as well. I put about 500 flawless rounds through it and carried it for about a week. It was a little noticeable at work so I got something a little smaller. This one has sat on my nightstand since then aside from its monthly oiling. Last week I bought the full size version of the gun I carry for mag compatibility. It will be my nightstand gun now so this one has to go. Reply by email. Thanks for looking.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage.

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. With the optional SteadyGrip™ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip.At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn’t just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core.

Real low round count, as close to new as used can get. I have the BSA red dot off the gun but can add it for the right trade. Has a primos jelly head .655 turkey choke in it.

I am a student at MSU Denver and am currently taking a class called Animal Behavior, or Ethology. My lab group has been tasked with designing an experiment concerning the behavior of animals, conducting said experiment, and then writing a scientific article about it. We chose to write about coyotes, specifically their behavior in regards to their proximity to urban development.
We are planning on setting up a game call in several places close to well populated areas (Aurora, Lakewood, Golden, etc) and then recording the response time of the coyotes to this call Then, we will conduct the same experiment in areas much more remote (Pawnee, Commanche, etc), and compare the data. What do you think, will the city coyotes be less timid and respond quicker out of curiosity, or will the wild coyotes with far less scavenging options than their city-dwelling kin come running to the sound of a free meal? We aim to find out!

So if you have any decent game cameras or remote-operated coyote calls that you won't be using between now and May, let me know, I would love to work out a rental arrangement and put some cash in your hand!

Thanks for taking the time to read this!
