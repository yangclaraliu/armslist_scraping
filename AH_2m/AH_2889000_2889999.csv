The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine 16"" barrel length in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Seven round magazine.  In its entire life it probably has seen somewhere around 1,000 rounds.  I have all of the original GI parts for it (minus the trigger, but I will look for it if needed), the green carrying case with the holster and mag holster.  This is an awesome gun, but I'm going back to school in the fall and am trying to get some money saved.  This is my ""fun gun.""  I have no real defensive use for it.  It's too big for me to carry, and my Glock 23 surpasses it in capacity, so the G23 wins as the home gun.  It comes with two magazines, but one of them has been stove piping the 6th round.  The other one is fine, don't worry, there is nothing wrong with the gun.  I marked the bad one with a sticker.  I'll give you both, anyway, since 1911 mags are usually easy to repair, or you can buy however many you want from Wilson Combat for $20 a piece.  Also, this is my only .45 so I have 32 rounds of match grade RWS and 10 rounds of Blazer that I'll throw in with it.

This isn't a pistol for the boring range goer with a collection of safe queens, this is for the man or woman that carries a pistol daily and developes a relationship with their weapon.  This 1911 is super reliable, and has eaten every type of ammo I've given it with a smile, and asked for more, including every type of hollowpoint I could find. The slight holster wear, adds to the character of the pistol, and shows that it has been loved and carried often.  This is a single owner gun, which has been maintained by myself - a US Marine. If you know one of us, you know how serious we are about weapons maintenance, and should find peace concerning the care of this 1911.

The Silver Pigeon 1 marks the dividing line between Beretta’s more economical double guns and the highly decorated luxury models. While popularly priced, it offers the aesthetics and materials of the premium over-unders. The frame has extensive, but refined, floral and scroll decoration that will make this shotgun a source of pride for years to come. The oil-finished stock is select walnut finish. It has the same dual-conical locking mechanism that lets Beretta over-unders stand up to years of constant shooting and to be passed on from generation to generation. Placing the locks between the barrels allows a low frame profile that gives Beretta over-unders an unmatched lively feel and natural pointability. Befitting of a field gun that will be used in exciting hunting situations, the safety is automatic, resetting each time the Silver Pigeon is opened for reloading.

It has the fiber optic front sight, adjustable rear sight and comes in the box with ppwk and 2 – 8rd. factory mags.  Overall very nice condition, the only issues/marks are very light handling marks on the polished slide area, the ones where you have to tilt it back and forth to see, anyone that has or has had a polished stainless pistol/revolver knows what I am talking about.

Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too. 
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,

.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

If your into really long range rifles we have one for you! This is the Desert Tech HTI. It is a switch barrel rifle that has conversion kits in 50 BMG, 416 Barrett, 408 Cheytac and .375 Cheytac. The benefits of this rifle is that it is a bull pup which significantly reduces overall length. While it is expensive it only cost 1/4th the cost of a complete rifle  to run  a new long range caliber and you can run the best long range calibers in the world with one chassis and one optic. The accuracy is unsurpassed with the Lother Walther barrels. Here is more from the manufacturer.
The Hard Target Interdiction (HTI) sniper rifle was developed at specific military customer request. The HTI’s bullpup design makes it the most compact and portable Hard Target Interdiction rifle in the world, 10.5 pounds lighter and 11.5 inches shorter than the US M107A3 .50 BMG rifle currently in use. The HTI sniper rifle is a convertible multi-caliber extreme range Hard Target Interdiction weapon. Caliber options include .50 BMG, .416 Barret, .408 CheyTac, and .375 CheyTac. All chamberings are capable of 2000+ yard engagements with phenomenal penetration. When you want to take out targets really far away, behind light cover, or stop light-skinned vehicles in their tracks the HTI is your rifle of choice. CALL FOR BEST PRICES!!!

Smashing the paradigm that small close protection weapons be relegated to pistol-caliber submachine guns, the PSD brings the 5.56mm NATO round to bear on threats out to 300 meters! This means that personal security teams can reach farther and hit harder while maintaining the concealability and portability of the current, leading SMG.
The LWRCI™ PSD™ rifle is outfitted with our patent-pending ARM-R™ rail system, featuring a removable top platform and return-to-zero reinstallation with no tools required. The carbine- length rail over a low profile gas block gives the operator their choice in rail-mounted BUIS and is ideal for optics.
The PSD™ rifle combines submachine gun size with a battle rifle cartridge and our ultra reliable gas-piston operating system, offering the professional shooter never-before realized capabilities in one sweet little package.

This is the ultimate assault shotgun. If you are seriously considering buying this, you probably already know there are only about 180 of these that made it into the country before the 1989 import ban. 

I am the second owner, it was bought new by a gentleman in (of all places) California right before both the import ban and the first CA assault weapons ban went into effect (talk about being in the right place at the right time...) 

I have taken it to the range one time to test it for proper function, and I believe the previous owner did the same, so it is as close to brand new as you can get without being technically ""unfired"". I ran two mags of #4 through it, and two mags of slugs (about 24 rounds total.) The gun functions absolutely flawlessly, fires as quickly as you can pull the trigger. No jams, failures or anything like that. The action is as smooth as you would expect from a gun that probably has less than 50 rounds though it since new.

Comes with one mag, as pictured. 

If you are familiar with both the SPAS 12 and 15, you know there is one part which is subject to failure (even if the guns are never fired) which is the shock absorber. The absorbers were originally made of a rubber type material which would break down over time and cause the bolt to slam back into the receiver, which could eventually break the receiver. The newer style are made from a hard plastic or polyurethane material and do not decompose, so they basically last forever. The shock absorber in this gun has been upgraded to the newer one. I checked it both before and after firing the gun and it looked like new both times, so there is nothing to worry about there. 

I am aware there has been some scams going on lately with supposed auctions/sales of  SPAS 15 guns on other sites. This is the real deal. My name is Brandon, call me on the phone at REDACTED, or come by in person to look at the gun. I would prefer to do a private sale to a NV resident for cash, but I would be willing to ship to an FFL in another state if necessary. 

Please don't bother offering less, I really am not particularly thrilled about selling it as is, but I want the money for some Class III stuff. Thanks for your time."

This is the real deal.  I bought this scope for hog hunting but never got a chance to use it.

I had the scope completely gone through and refurbished.  The tube was tested and reset (found to be in excellent shape), focus was reset, all new gaskets, seals, o-rings and nitrogen purged.  This scope is in used condition but comes 100% ready to go with no functional issues at all.  I also purchased brand new ARMS #5 and ARMS #11 base mounts for it that allow you to put it on a rifle and get the correct eye relief.  These were over $300 on their own from Aurora tactical.  I spent over $700 dollars with them to have it gone through.  Scope comes with original hard case and operator manual.Here is some additional information on the scope. Do your research.

Up for sale is my Hornady Lock 'n' Load Auto Progressive Press. I have had this press for approx. 6 months now. Due to me obtaining a job that requires me to travel 3 weeks a month minimum, I have lost the majority of my free time I spent at the range. For the very few times I get to shoot its more ideal for me to just buy a couple hundred rounds every 4-6 months now where before I was shooting 2k rounds a month easy.

This setup is absolutely everything you need for the ultimate reloading experience. It comes with all the high end accessories such as a dillon case trimmer for trimming long neck cases (such as the .223/5.56) completely automated in one of the 5 stages of the press. you can hook up a shopvac to the trimmer to collect all metal shavings for a mess free experience.

I also include a (guestimate) 250Lb reloading table that is heavily reinforced that i spent approx 200$ building. I actually stood on the table and lightly jumped on it (im 210lbs) and it didnt bow the slightest bit. It will be able to handle all your reloading pressure. It has a raiser made for the press so the lever is ideal arm height when sitting in a normal computer/office chair.

The SIG516 Patrol by Sig Sauer is one of the most advanced and versatile AR-based rifles available.

DLP Tactical doesn't have the name recognition yet but I have trained with them and they are very good guys building their brand... according to them these are the exact same bipods produced at the same OEM factory that produces them for VLTOR, only without the sticker shock from the Gucci label. 

These rail mount bipods are $190 through VLTOR, DLP Tactical sells them for less at $135, which is a VERY good deal. I'll even beat DLP Tac's prices though because I just want it gone so I'm asking only $99 AND I'll ship FREE.

Manufacturer description:

Designed by Vltor & Tango Down, the DLP Tactical MP-1 is a sturdy and lightweight unit that mounts to the left and right side rails of the weapon. It locks at every 90-degree angle to fold out of the way when not in use and is adjustable for height. Unlike the first generation TD bipod, DLP MP-1 bipod legs fold forward and rearward, locking into each 90 degree position. This gives the operator multiple mounting options."

It must be picked up in person by the actual buyer.

2010 Dodge Challenger RT fully loaded with the performance package. This car was bought new at Kelly Dodge with a sticker price of 39k. If you want a Challenger better get one now since 2014 is the last year of production. Sorry, can't take any trades. I feel the price is fair as you will be hard pressed to find a Challenger this well cared for at this price.

This car has new high performance tires, alignment, and was just state and emissions inspected April 2014. New Hawks hire performance brake pads and rotors.  Fluids and all other preventative maintenance is up to date. 

16 city 25 Highway MPG. She averages 21-23 MPG's.

-Special order inferno red not regular Dodge red.
-Power heated seats.
-Black leather interior.
-Tinted Power moon roof.
-6 speed Tremec TR-6060 manual transmission option.
-Factory Boston Acoustic 6 speaker sound system with CD and MP3 hookup.
-Satellite radio.
-Power locks, windows, everything.
-Factory neon interior trim.
-20 inch factory rims with performance tires.

Factory race package which includes:
-Ability to turn off ESP and traction systems for track use.
-Rare factory posi rear end so both wheels spin. Most Challengers are not posi.
-Doesn't have engine cut off like many of the auto's have. No lag in performance.

Professionally installed SRT grille emblem, SRT trunk emblem, and 392 fender emblems professionally installed. This has the cheap maintenance of an RT with the look and sound of a 392. Dodge sales people who sell these things can't tell that this is an RT. 

I'm pretty sure the Dodge 5 year 100,000 mile power train warranty transfers.

51,000 highway miles.

Windows professionally tinted with lifetime tint.

Custom Stainless Exhaust has Cats and passes PA emissions inspection. This car is legal as it still has cats but the huge heavy performance robbing resonators are gone. This thing is loud and sounds mean!

You will get looks and compliments every time you drive this car. They say this is the last true American Muscle car. Big, loud, and fast. But with awesome suspension and modern day comforts. 

This car has the factory functional MOPAR hood scoops installed. 

K&N direct replacement lifetime air filter. 

Two Guerrilla guard locks on every rim.

This car is in awesome shape and has the hard to get 6 Speed Tremec manual transmission. 


She bought the car new and is the original owner. Has up to date service and was garage kept. Was driven mostly on weekend highway trips.  Adult owned never raced or taken to a track."

This robust and powerful battle rifle is one of the last in a long history of standard issue battle rifles and was replaced by the FAMAS in 1972 but kept in French reserves until the 90's when the lot of them were sold off to private organizations.  Century imported thousands of these rifles and then ruined most of them by haphazardly converting them to .308, this is one of the few that were NOT ruined.  The stock is very nicely refinished and the rifle functions perfectly and includes the original 1962 dated MAS grenade launching boot.  One of the coolest (although now useless) parts of the rifle is the flip up grenade launching sight.  Comes as is with 1 10 round magazine (more magazines available for pretty cheap).  This rifle has been rearsenaled twice and is in absolutely immaculate condition.  Ammo is fairly hard to come by but is still manufactured and loaded ammo is available for relatively cheap online and brass for reloading is readily available.  Reserves of these rifles have run dry forever and no more can possibly be imported so they are getting very hard to come by and the price of these rifles reflects that and has been steadily going up (check Gunbroker.com) so here's your chance to own a piece of 20th century history which likely served with French forces during the French-Indochina war which was the prelude to the Vietnam war!"

I did the ""youtube redneck"" modification to the stock that included epoxying lead weights to the inside forend of the stock. These weights were added to reduce recoil and are estimated to weigh about 1 pound total. The inside front synthetic stock around the barrel was also sanded down to float the barrel for better accuracy. There are some scratches on the stock near the barrel. Only the stock has been modified- the rest looks almost new. The recoil pad was replaced with a limbsaver type.

The gun has been my bedside gun since I bought it in 2/05/2009, and has not been carried (not exactly a pocket pistol!).  The gun functions flawlessly and has never had issues with any type of ammo.  It probably has about 2000 rounds through it, all indoor range with factory ammo, no reloads.  I've trusted this gun to protect myself and my wife for years now, and I trust it completely.  It has never been sent to Taurus for any repairs or adjustments, but the lifetime warranty still applies to the next owner.  The gun comes with everything pictured, and the items are:

1. Taurus PT92 - I have receipt from BudsGunShop showing I was the original owner in 2009, and that the firearm was brand new at purchase.  
2. Pachmayr Wrap Around Grips - Built in finger grooves on the front, and reinforced with steel to maintain shape.  Grips come with backstrap (also pictured), but I personally thought it made the grip too thick, so I left it off.  The backstrap is included though.
3. Two Factory 17 Round Magazines - Both original with first purchase in 2009.  I'll also include the self defense ammo I have in the mags now, which is 24 rounds of Federal HST, and 7 rounds of Remington Golden Saber.
4. Original Factory Grips - Self Explanatory!
5. High Powered LED Flashlight - I'm unsure of the brand (it was a gift, and I don't have original packaging) but it is an LED light designed for firearms, not airsoft.  
6. Combination Lock Bulldog Metal Case - Combination is changeable, I'll help you change it before you leave with your new firearm!
7. Beretta D Hammer Spring - I had a Beretta D Hammer Spring installed in place of the factory.  This smooths and lightens the double action trigger pull, and smooths the single action pull as well.  Overall the trigger is buttery-smooth, with very little takeup, a crisp break and a smooth, distinct reset.  UPDATE: I DO have the original hammer spring to include as well.
8. Taurus Integral Locking System Key - All Taurus firearms have a patented locking mechanism that uses a small key to completely disable the firearm.  This makes it one of the safest firearms I've ever encountered.  When engaged, you cannot retract the slide, cock the hammer, or pull the trigger.

Overall, I love the firearm and believe a 92 (Beretta or Taurus) is a necessary part of any gun collection.  However, I've had the itch to dive into the CZ market for years now, and will go without a 92 for the time being."
