My local gun shop insulted me with what they said they would give me for it and I want it gone so I have dropped the price. The best way to contact me is to call or text at 618/806/9629

Lots of research shows that a better picture has higher chances of selling an item.

For a very reasonable fee, I can use my high end professional camera to photograph your item as you'd like it done. Image editing included to really make the picture stand out.

If you're selling an old VCR, a cell phone picture or $100 sony camera might work. When you intend to represent a near thousand dollar (or more) item in an attractive and detailed manner, my opinion is that the picture SHOULD do it justice.

I am not a professional photographer... I bought a nice camera for a hobby and I also enjoy firearms... This is a fun and interesting blend of the two, at a much lower cost than a professional studio.


I charge $20 for up to 30 mins and $25 for a 30-45 min session, with editing included afterwards until you are satisfied.

NOTE: For safety reasons, I require a copy of your valid FOID and matching Illinois ID before we meet, and I will provide the same.

If you want to display a particular firearm as an artistic piece in your home, I can do that as well. Instead of taking ""product"" shots, I can take artistic or interesting shots of the firearm that will be sure to get noticed. I have several resources for printing that you can choose from (at an additional cost.. I don't print them)

Whether you intend to use it on armslist or elsewhere, high quality photographs are a must for any serious seller."

Item Description: Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear. When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds. Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics. The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight."

I purchased this pistol brand new some time ago. I sent it to Robar for the custom finish shortly thereafter (a little over $300) and have maintained and babied it ever since. This pistol has never seen the inside of a holster. The throat of the chamber is polished and the bore is exceptionally clean. I attempted to demonstrate this in the photos but it's hard to see. There are some very faint marks from the squeeze cocker which you can see in one of the pictures at the Imageshack link below. I took a close up of it.

Comes with two magazines, original serial-numbered box/case, documentation, originally-supplied cleaning tools, and a cool vintage HK/Benelli patch that I got elsewhere.

This weapon has never misfired even when limp-wristed (it's an HK, come on.) It is honestly the most accurate non-scoped handgun I've ever shot. I'm a piss-poor shot with a handgun and this P7 made me look good every time I fired it at a target. I hate to part with it because I love it but I'm getting out of gun-collecting. I only need one and I couldn't bear to stick a pistol this nice in a holster inside my waistband.

I prefer local pickup in the Portage Wisconsin area. You can examine it and be pleased without a hassle. (I will *consider* shipping to your FFL in another state but be advised: I will not play games. I require the postage and insurance to my PayPal as well as the cost of the pistol and you will immediately get exactly what you see. There will be no returns and BS after somebody else beyond my sight handles it for obvious reasons.) 

It actually looks *better* than the iPhone photos. You will get what you see and it will be fully-functional. You may examine even more photos at higher resolution and detail here:  http://imageshack.us/g/1/10286780/

Thanks for looking and I hope you find what you're looking for regardless of whether you buy this firearm or another. Have a great day."

Winchester Model 94, 30-30 Win., New, Nice Wood. I did the research and this gun was made in 1980. This is the last of the real Winchesters. Winchester was bought out in late 1981 or early 1982 by USRA. USRA discontinued there Model 94AE in 2006. The collectable Winchesters are pre-64 models because they were made from billet steel and machined parts. Winchester for whatever reason in 1964 went with a less expensive process whereby they used cast and stamped parts. (pot metal) In 1979 Winchester got there crap together and went back to making guns the right way. From 1979 thru 1981 they were made from billet steel like the pre-64 guns. (NICE) That's when things went astray for Winchester and they were bought out by USRA. So there you have it.

Item Description: Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear. When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds. Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics. The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

--UTG Tactical light, 120 lumens, compact, fits anything with a rail to include compact pistols; was a bit too large (by about 1/16th of an inch!) for an XD subcompact I had...mounted to an AR, but never fired with it on, like new with box, paid $60 plus tax at Sooner Guns on Mingo.

--Walmart tactical laser with picatinny mount and optional pressure switch; these are $30 at W-mart.  Works perfect, mounted just for looks on an AR.  Will of course fit pistols, but don't like the way that looks...just upgraded to more compact version.

--HK-Style low profile STEEL sight system/pair, on bottom of pic.  Mounts to any rail, great for flattops or a good co-witness sight without having to buy the $99 Magpuls.  May also work great on a 10/22 tactical?  Quality sight w/ peephole rear sight, I paid $55 before tax.

The only issue with this rifle is it's missing the spring to hold the safety in safe, which can be purchased at gun parts Corp for $5. As it stands, either don't chamber until ready to shoot (who carries a loaded chamber in a .22 rifle anyway?) , replace the cheap spring, or use something to hold the lever back e.g. tape.

Those familiar with David Higginbotham custom rifles knows he built rifles well. I believe his business is no longer in operation, due to his passing. I sent him two rolling block receivers a number of years ago, and 2 sets of MVA front/rear sights and he did the rest. The two rifles I received back are almost identical. Both, according to Dave at time or order can handle modern loads. According to him, he sat some sort of distant record with his own 50-70 Rolling Block. He adored that caliber.

Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end.  This 12 gauge model comes with a 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

Our PA-08™ offers all of those qualities in spades, along with a limit-busting measure of value. The dual bar action is simple, smooth, overbuilt and has passed through more than 6,000 rounds of testing to assure season after season of performance. And, when you compare the quality of wood, fit and finish, and features of the PA-08™ vs. other mass-produced shotguns, you’ll see there’s really no comparison at all.
All Weatherby® PA-08™ pump shotguns feature a ventilated top rib and brass bead front sight to aid in target acquisition. The vent rib works to dissipate heat in the barrel, promotes a smoother ""swing-thru"" and gives the shooter an excellent sight line for acquiring fast-moving targets. Each PA-08™ gun comes with three application-specific, screw-in choke tubes.

Simply turn the end of the stake and the bullets slide out. If owning silver bullets and a Vampire Stake weren't enough then you will especially enjoy the list of hilarious warnings on the back of the package which made us laugh.

This is not only a great conversational piece, but potentially useful should vampires arrive at your door at night or the zombie apocalypse occurs. If you've seen the movie Zombieland then you know this can happen. Please keep in mind this package features live ammunition and this should not be considered a toy or given to your child.

This is also a collector's piece for any one who is a .357 Connan Classic 1911 fan!

I am discounting this item due to a sleight blemish in the packaging from the point of the stake piercing a small hole in the clear plastic from shipping."

I built the rifle in late 2012 and it has no more than 100 rounds of brass ammo through it. (Price drop to $780 FIRM) I have only used this rifle at the range in order to sight in the scope and it was thoroughly cleaned after the trip and stored in a climate controlled safe. The scope in the picture is NOT included as it is my primary hunting scope, however I will include a pmag with the sale. Thank you for looking and please e-mail or call me if you have any questions. I have several other pictures upon request.

The Leftside Integrated Non-reciprocating Charging Handle is a serious tactical add-on that is a drop-on accessory that allows for left side charging.  The left side charging handle is folding and will lay flat along the receiver when not required.  No modifications are required on the rifle for the LINCH Cover to install or function.  Original top-cover also included.  

One issue with rifle:  The detent pins in the rear trunnion for the original folding stock have been drilled by the previous owner.  Issue is cosmetic in nature and function is perfect.  

I have fired this rifle and function is perfect.  The sights are dead nuts zero at 50m and on the right side of the bull at 100M.  NO KEYHOLES which is a huge concern with Century contract built rifles.  

I replaced this in my collection with a SGL31, so this one needs to find a new home and with 5.45x39mm readily available and fairly inexpensive, this is a rifle that you will enjoy shooting at the range. 

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king.  I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional).  All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll. 

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly.  If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply.  I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.
