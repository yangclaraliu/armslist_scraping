CHECK YOU LOCAL LAWS AND LISTINGS.


This is a 5-shot top break .32 revolver. The timing is perfect. It is in excellent condition, there is no rust on it, barely any patina. It looks like a large gun but it is actually very small and compact, no longer than most cell phones and has a smaller profile than most wheel guns. The barrel is about 3 inches long.

Despite being an antique, this gun is actually very modular.

This is due to it being top break, so unlike most revolvers, it is very easy to change out the barrel and cylinder.

You could shoot .32 ACP out of it so long as it was lead ammo, and not FMJ.

There are tons of parts for it on ebay. You could get a spare snub nose barrel and a spare hammer, then grind the spur down to make it the ultimate carry gun, you could get a cylinder and barrel set chambered in .38, which you could also probably shoot lead .380 out of.

You could even get a .22 barrel and cylinder for it.

Came with the Hogue stock which I didnt really like the color of and the X-Mark Pro Trigger that is actually really nice once adjusted down.  I have always wanted a sexy rifle and that was my goal in mind when I started building it.  First to go was the stock which was changed to the Bell & Carlson Medalist which is fully adjustable. Second was a scope that ended up proving a point I read on the internet (a decent scope is only a doorway to an expensive scope LOL).  Long story short, I purchased a Nightforce 20 MOA 1 peice scope mount and a Sightron SIII 10-50x60 scope.  I LOVE THIS SCOPE!  It is clean and reaches WAAAY out!.  I spend half the time at the range spotting for my friends.  I then got a cheap bipod that just didnt look right so again, found what I should have gotten in the first place.  Atlas Bipod BT10-LW17...is it wrong to get excited about a bipod?? Because this thing is awesome!! I got the one with the quick attach/release lever which also required a short weaver rail on the bottom slide of the stock.  New was to get ride of the thread cover so I got a Yankee Hill Machine Muzzle Brake.  It lives in a Pelican Storm Case.  I love this weapon and want to see it go to a loving home.  Face to face cash only please.  I'm not really interested in any trades."

The shells are new in mint condition, protected from humidity and temperature. I used some in Canada before on a 1 week goose hunt in western Saskatchewan, and it absolutely knocks the crap out of all geese.  I doubled on specs, meaning I got two with one shot, and the shot was 40-45 yards. This is great stuff. It knocks down honkers as well (Greater Canada's).  This is top of the line stuff, I just need some extra cash to go towards a gun purchase. These rounds cost about $190-$200 or more for a case. I will let this one go for $150 plus shipping, or if you are local, you can pick them up for $150.  

NOTE:  I also have 150 rounds of Federal's High Density (denser than lead or Hevi-Shot) in 12 GA, 3 inch mag,  1 3/8 ounce of 4's at 1450 fps. These are made of Tungsten Iron, they come 10 to a box. I will sell them at $20/box, or $275 takes them all. Plus add the shipping if I send them to you. This stuff is better than Hevi-Shot. 

RIFLE AMMO:  325 WSM,  Winchester Supreme CPX3 (for elk/moose)  , 200 grain Nosler Accubonds, premium ammunition.  5 boxes of 20, plus 12 more rounds. It is lubalox coated, which is not moly, it reduces fouling, raises the ballistic coefficient slightly (a good thing), and doesn't leave a residue in the barrel. This ammo sells for $69-$72 box new. I will sell these at a deal at $50/box, plus throw in some once fired brass.  So the price is $275, plus shipping, and you get an extra 28 rounds of nickel plated brass with it, just in case you reload now or start reloading in the future. Brass for a 325 WSM is $1- $3 per round depending on who you get it from. This is all premium stuff, and it's at a deal.

Because I sell so many of these, I'm not able to drive all over the country to deliver them face to face. I use PayPal because it is a secure method that protects you as a buyer and me as a seller. If you are not willing to purchase these this way, then please do not waste my time or yours. It's cheaper to mail them than to drive 30 miles one way. I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund. These retail at over $30.00 Be prepared for an immediate response because I respond to emails as soon as I get them. For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

UPDATE: This is from a customer who bought a pair of these for his brother who is a U.S. Navy SEAL currently deployed:

-My brother informed me that your gloves held up in combat without any glitches. I guess you can say combat proven. Thanks again."

THE ULTIMATE PISTOL.
It's not an official title, but it perfectly describes the Beretta 92FS.
Selected by a multi-national roster of defense and law enforcement organizations, each pistol must pass a battery of more then 3,000 quality control check and measure that includes complete interchangeability of parts before leaving the factory... and proven in the field in countless defensive confrontations, the 92FS is in all respects the ultimate.

92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARM.
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.

BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS FOR THE BERETTA 9mm PISTOL.
- The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage.
- During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction.
- The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta.
- Two-thirds of all M9 pistols endurance tested at Beretta U.S.A. fired 5,000 rounds without a single malfunction or, at most, with only one malfunction.
- The average durability of Beretta M9 slides is over 35,000 rounds, the point at which U.S. Army testing ceases.
- The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds. The average durability of M9 locking blocks is 22,000 rounds.


PRECISE, SAFE, RELIABLE.
92 Series Pistols are semi-automatics and operate on the short recoil, delayed locking block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability.
Each features a lightweight, forged frame made form aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
All 92 series pistols feature unique safety refinements.
On FS models, the manual safety also functions as a decocking lever.
A firing pin block secures the firing pin.
The chamber loaded indicator is visible or can be felt by touch."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 is available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Unlike other polymer based pistols the steel frame on the P250 controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with lasers, lights, or other accessories mounted to the polymer grip's molded in accessory rail.

 Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

On a personal note, I really like this pistol. It has a bobbed no snag hammer design and the smoothest D.A.O. trigger pull I have ever felt on any semi- auto pistol.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 is available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Unlike other polymer based pistols the steel frame on the P250 controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with lasers, lights, or other accessories mounted to the polymer grip's molded in accessory rail.

 Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

On a personal note, I really like this pistol. It has a bobbed no snag hammer design and the smoothest D.A.O. trigger pull I have ever felt on any semi- auto pistol.

I've had several folks back out of a purchase because they didn't feel comfortable. I understand this and I am not offended by it at all. But this is not a scam. If you send me money via PayPal, you WILL get your gloves. I have sold these from California to New Jersey to Afghanistan and everywhere in between without a single disappointed buyer. They are sent via USPS with tracking. If they don't arrive, I'll send you another pair or a refund.

For an extra sweet deal, buy 3 pairs in one order and get them all for only $40.00! They don't all have to be the same size if you wish to purchase a pair as a gift for a friend.

Unfired FRANCHI SPAS 15, which Has the Original Hang-Tag. Approximately 230 units of the SPAS 15 were imported into the USA in Mid-1989. Shortly thereafter, Importation of the SPAS 15 was Banned by Executive Decree. According to F.I.E. Corp., the former importer, fewer then 190 units made it into the hands of firearms collectors. SPAS 15's all came with an internal receiver shock absorber which would dry up and disintegrate over time, even if the gun was never fired. You can read about all this at Chris's SPAS Site. http://spas12.com/index.htm. I had the receiver shock absorber in this SPAS 15 replaced with a New Polyethylene Shock Absorber by a qualified gunsmith. The Gun comes with Four (4) Magazines, three (3) have the original paper wrap. It also comes with an Original SPAS 15 Manual, SPAS Tool, and a Very Rare SPAS 15 Italian Military Tactical Sling. Few minor handling marks. Shipping is $85.00, Ground, Insured

NIB. NEVER FIRED. This XDs has not yet received the recall as Springfield was backed up during the winter, the current turn around time 1 month. Also free shipping and a free mag extension while sending you weekly updates on the gun as it goes through the process.

I have been watching this site for a while and have yet to see a single XDs listed. Don't waste my time with low ball offers. As for the price... $850, unfortunately many of you will either flag this post or come up with your own post telling people I suck. DONT LIKE IT?!? STOP VOTING FOR LIBERALS AND THOSE WHO WISH TO LIMIT OUR LIBERTY. I fought tooth and nail just to be able to bring this gun into the state upon moving here, believe me I don't like it any more than you do.
 Now I apologize for the rant to you conservatives out there who had to read that. I would consider trades of .357 Mag or .22 LR lever action firearms preferably but if you have something else try me. (depending on value cash may be involved as well). 

If you would like more information about the recall or anything let me know.

It comes with an EOTech holographic sight and an EO Tech tripler, as well as forward broom handle. This weapon has fired less than 500 rounds and I am selling it as I prefer my Mk 17.

-Rifle comes with eight mags, the painted factory 30-round mag, a windowed 30-round PMag, a 10-round mag, and five unopened gray 30-round M16 mags. 

-The rifle has less than 500 rounds through it. I had 500 rounds reloaded in 5.56 and I have two rifles that use the round. I still have about 120 left and most were shot through the Mk 16 that I have listed, so that puts it in the mid 300's or so, which is negligible when you consider the 20,000+ round rating of the chrome lined barrel. 

-This rifle does not come with a case, but I do have the original factory box that will come with it if you would like.

-The rifle is in pristine condition, no marks, scratches, gouges, blemishes, or any other kind of damage except for the marks left on the casing deflector from fired rounds. Even that is quite minimal with so few rounds having been fired from it. 

-The same pristine condition applies to the optics. 

-The holo sight is EO Tech's 517 and is less than six months old and in pristine condition. 

-The EO Tech 3x magnifier is mounted on a Samson Quickflip and is about a year old and is in pristine condition as well. 

-This rifle is stored in a dehumidified gun safe when not in use, and is handled appropriately when used. As such, every part on this rifle is in nearly brand new condition. 

-Package deal only, I will not be separating any portion of this listing. 

-Price is $3,000 firm.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

the scope is a 2-7 x 32 red and green illuminated scope with MOA click windage, 100 yard increment elevation, and focus. It all sets on a quick detach mount. (you can use the scope without the illumination turned on, looks like a normal cross haired scope) this scope is totally capable of very short range shooting as well as long range. in my opinion a perfect sight for an ar 15.

Selling together as slides are interchangeable and they make a great pair. The New Gen 4 G30s is a G30sf frame with a G36 Slide. Glock created the G30s because so many people put this combo together. If you are lucky enough to find a Gen 4 G30s... well then F%$# you. For everyone else, here's your shot to own basically the same gun (Less the funky back straps, grip texture, and extended mag release).

 I am looking for 1500 for both, two firearms that you will very rarely find in this condition in MA (Never Fired that is). $800 each if sold separately. Don't like that these guns are listed over retail? Blame the AG for his compliance Bull$#@!. Either way I really don't care will keep these fine firearms.

Additional Features Include: (per springfield website)
Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots and Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber, A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position.

Also included is approx. 300 rounds of Ammo. Local Sale or Trade only. Asking $750 OBO"
