5.7 ammo is out there. .22lr is not as we know. I could sell and go buy 5.7, I figure this way someone with overstock in need of .22lr can help me and I help them. I take into account 5.7 ammo 50rd $25-27 but take into account the quality of .22lr ammo I have left and with a little negotiating I'm sure a reasonable and mutual deal is easily made and hope someone can help me. Do not send ignorant hate mail. I can't get any .22 either. So don't act like I'm any different. I just can't go shoot it cause...I need 5.7x28 ammo more now. Ill be happy when it is stocked to root and .05/rd trust me. So serious buyers only reply of your not offended throw an offer. As low as supply my price is simply what it's worth to me considering I own 5 .22LR firearms."

It is no small thing for a company with Fabrique Nationale’s reputation for quality manufacture to license another entity to manufacture one of their products, but in the case of Precision Small Parts (PSP), now known as Precision Small Arms (PSA), quality of manufacture is not an issue. This gun simply exudes quality. Even the low-end Traditional model is beautifully finished both inside and out. You hold it in your hand and it “feels” right. You work the action and you know immediately it is a well made weapon.
Since I’m praising the gun so highly, I don’t think the PSA company will take it amiss if I quote from their brochure: “Le Bébé is a single action, semi-automatic, self-loading, blow-back mechanism manufactured of all steel alloy components. It is striker fired and utilizes a smooth faced, single stage draw bar trigger with pull weight of 5.25 lbs. It can hold six rounds in its magazine and one chambered. Le Bébé’s barrel is 2.13 inches long, has 6 lands and grooves and is right-hand twisted with a radius of 3.54 inches. Le Bébé is 4.11 inches long, stands 2.88 inches tall and is .88 inches thick.” In addition, the PSA website states: “When utilized with modern high-velocity ammunition, this pistol can achieve the effectiveness of a .380. It should not be underestimated with regard to lethality.”*

The above stated pistol is stone mint. It is unfired and free of any rust, scuffs, dings etc.
The action is very very smooth and the finish has a very high luster, just tits. 
I am just testing the waters to see what is out there."

180,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2754180,For Trade:  Streamlight TLR-2s for pocket gun,"West Wichita, Wichita, Kansas",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, March 1, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a Streamlight TLR-2s in basically new condition that I'd like to trade.

This is the latest TLR-2 model from Streamlight, is the 2s model which has light/laser/laser+light functionality as well as strobe for the light. 300 lumen rated LED light, runs on two 123 batteries. Had it on my G17, but will fit any hand gun with a standard rail, or on a picatinny rail of a rifle for that matter.

I have no real use for it, so I'd like to trade it off. These run between $250-300 depending on where you look. I'm looking for a small pocket gun of similar value for summer carry, something along the lines of a SCCY Gen 2 CPX-2 , Kel Tec PF9, Kel Tec P3AT, Ruger LCP or other similar pocket sized guns. Might also consider a snub nosed .38 revolver like a Taurus M85.  Only looking for something in .380, 9mm, or .38 special, no .22's or .25's

Feel free to call/text three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers. Texts preferred as I sleep during the day, but I will get back with you ASAP if I'm interested.

Thanks!"

The forte of the Series 70, of course, is the lack of a firing pin block or firing pin safety, and the crisp single action trigger pull that only comes without the trigger having to depress a plunger. Factory specs are as follows. The pistol is the classic 5 inch barrel all-steel Colt Series 70 Government, catalog #O1970A1CS .45 ACP. It's entirely blue steel, 8 1/2 inches overall length, classic spur hammer, aluminum combat trigger, flat black combat sights, with classic Double Diamond Rosewood Colt grips. Both grip safety and thumb safety are standard configuration. Serrated trigger is standard, and it has two factory 7 shot magazines. Finish, as the photos show, is matte blue vertical surfaces with classic Colt bright blue side features. The pistol speaks for itself. Each one comes in its original blue box with its padlock, extra magazine, and instruction manual. In a market awash with plastic, here is the original real thing, all 36 oz. of it.

There have been a lot of semi auto shotguns imported from Turkey. We are proud to say that the SARSA is one of the best. This product has duel smooth reliable action bars, a Traditional machined, thread on barrel extension, a Traditional cross trigger block, a Traditional machined locking block and bolt, and Aircraft quality machined, not cast, aluminum receiver (Machined aluminum is traditionally much stronger than cast). These shotguns also feature Solid drilled and honed barrels. The Stocks and forends are produced from the highest quality polymers, with the proper thickness throughout the part. The SAR shotguns use common modern choke tubes in a well known thread pattern (Hint: Italian and begins with a B). This same gun was previously sold under expensive brand names. Now the SARSA is available through USSG direct from the manufacturer so you can bypass the name brand mark up."

Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

It has very few pictures on it- as I bought it thinking I was going to get more into it and decided I did not have the time. I spent way too much on the camera, lens, flash and more and this is to your advantage. I looked at the receipts and have more then $3200.00 in everything. I took it to a local camera shop and they gave a good cleaning and look over everything. They even told me it is in A+ condition. 

I was told to sell it all for $1200. But right now I am motivated to let it go for $950.00

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.

Check these out on gunbrokers, very hard to find especially this variant...it's not the gen one crap you hear about. This is not a polymer gun, it's made of carbon fiber composite, which doesn't scuff and wear like traditional forged and stamped receivers. This weighs in at 3.5lbs unloaded w/out brace.

Very very sweet shooting and fun gun.

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function."
