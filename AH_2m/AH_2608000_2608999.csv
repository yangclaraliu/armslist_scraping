The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

For sale is a near pristine M44 mosin carbine. Manufactured in 1946 it has a 3 digit all matching serial number. All metal is in excellent condition. Bore is shiny and looks brand new.  I cleaned the cosmoline off of it myself.  The laminate stock has NOT been refinished, that is the original shellac.  Only two minor blemishes, a small divot in the side of the stock and a scratch on the tang. The sling is modern. 

I have personally fired only 10 rounds through her for a function check. It has been a safe queen. I don't think it was used much before being imported, those could be the only rounds it ever fired.

Price is reasonably firm, only 200,000 m44's were made in 1946 compared to the almost 7 million made in 1944-45. You will be hard pressed to find one in this condition."

Custom Cerakote - Armor Black base with Blue Titanium/Tungsten mix snakeskin effect overcoat.  This is the H series Cerakote, not the less durable C series.  If you don't know what Cerakote is, it's the most durable firearms coating on the market.  Sig and Kimber (among others) use it for some of their factory finishes.  It's not paint - it won't wear off, solvents won't hurt it.  The only way to remove it is to grit blast it.  I tried to get pictures to show it, but the small pics on armslist won't show it well.

Includes one 30-rd USGI magazine

Gun is Brand New and Unfired.  Easy conversion to install threaded barrel devices.

The P22 is a 3/4-size rimfire rendition of the famous Walther P99 center-fire pistol however, besides the size difference the P22 has an external hammer. Its frame is made of polymer giving this pistol a very light weight of only 19.6 oz. The barrel is threaded and will accept an adapter to allow for barrel extending accessories such as a noise suppressor. The magazine is constructed of stainless steel with a polymer follower and bump pad. An interchangeable backstrap allows the grip to be customized to the shooter’s hand. Sights are three dot sights with windage adjustment on the rear sight and included different height front sights to adjust for elevation. The P22 features a novel ambidextrous magazine release located at the bottom rear of the trigger guard which can activated with the either the thumb or index finger. When the magazine release is depressed the magazine drops free and is completely ejected from the hand grip. I have owned several of these and they are good shooters. And now with the latest P22Q model, they have also proven to be very reliable with many different types of 22LR ammo. Another P22 I have with about 2,000 rounds fired now even cycles perfectly with subsonic ammo.

He sent the barrel off to PO Ackley and had it bored, rifled and chambered to 357 magnum and he found one of the most beautiful pieces of walnut for the stock and fore end I have ever seen.  After he moved and then later passed away, all of the internal parts and the forend were lost.  I searched his home and gunsmithing shop but never found the rest.  So sad.  So I have the barrel, action and butt stock and that is all.  Though it is hard to photograph you can see from the pics the figure in the stock.  Unfortunately, he let some rust develop in the barrel near and in the chamber.  I think it would clean up ok and be quite useable but it is there.  I am not really sure where to price this so I will start at 250 and see where that leads me."

Up for sale is my extremely nice condition 1942 dated and Tikka barreled M39.

This is a low production M39 that does not come up for sale very often due to there rarity and condition.

The bolt is clearly stamped and numbers matching on the cocking knob, the floor-plate and butt-plate are unumbered as is correct.

 The stock is a nice Sako, wartime, rounded finger joint, example that has been recycled/refurbished by the ""Finn's"" that still has it's original stock shims as setup by the Finnish armory.

 This rifle also has bright and shiny bore and should be an excellent shooter, however I personally have never shot it so I can only go by condition.

 The overall pic.s really did not do it justice so I have included a couple of closeup condition pic.s.

 If your into vintage rifle matches maybe this one would be ideal for you.

 I would prefer a local face to face deal but I would also be willing to ship an FFL of your choice for a mutually agreed trade.

Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

Armalite Inc. is now offering a special discount program for first responders in the Southern Nevada area. I have recently become the sales rep for Armalite Inc. and will the ""beta tester"" for a new program. We will have a few select Armalite Rifles for sale at a discounted price for anyone who is active law enforcement, military, fire, or medical first responder. You must have proof of your current status with that unit and be able to legally purchase a firearm. As the sales rep I will verify your credentials,collect the payment (and hold until sent to the factory), and then place the order with the factory once 10 rifles of any kind have been purchased. The factory will then ship the rifle to a FFL holder (retail store, not just a person) where you may pick the rifle up and pay the transfer fee accordingly. The program will be expanding in the near future, but for right now we have two models on overstock that we are pushing out at a discounted price. 

Attached photos are the spec sheets for the two models. The 5.56 model is priced at $799 and the .308 model is $1199. The .308 model is a ""B"" variant which means it uses the proprietary Armalite magazines NOT Magpul magazine compliant. We will offer those variants at a later time. Models do NOT come complete with optics nor rear sights. All rifles will be shipped with a cardboard box, ONE steel magazine, and the rifle. Accessories shown are NOT included. No limit to how many rifles per person. 

Please pass this on to your friends or anyone in a related field who is looking for a great deal! I will be happy to verify my credentials with Armalite and give you the FFL's we will be shipping to if you are interested.

This gun is deadly accurate from a long ways off.  I just don't need something this long range given I typically hunt in the woods.  If you are looking for a fantastic, accurate deer or target rifle this could be it.  The synthetic stock stays like new, the action is sweet and as you would see, the barrel looks like it hasn't been shot inside.  $369 is just below book value for a quick sale.  Save me from haggling and I might just throw in a new box of ammo.  Would consider a nice crossbow in trade.  Call or text me at REDACTED."

History (excerpts from Wikipedia)
The Model 36 was designed in the era just after World War II, when Smith & Wesson stopped producing war materials and resumed normal production. For the Model 36, they sought to design a weapon that could fire the more powerful .38 Special round in a small, concealable package. Since the older I-frame was not able to handle this load, a new frame was designed, which became the Smith & Wesson J-frame.

The new design was introduced at the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) convention in 1950, and was favorably received. A vote was held to name the new revolver, and the name ""Chief's Special"" won. A three inch barreled version of this design went into production immediately, due to high demand. It was available in either a blued or nickel plated finish.[2] It was produced as the ""Chief's Special"" until 1957, when it then became the Model 36. The ""Chief's Special"" continued to be manufactured as a separate variant.

For many years, the Model 36 was the standard police detective and ""plainsclothes man"" carry weapon for many police agencies including the NYPD. Many police officers still use it or one of its newer Smith and Wesson descendants as a ""back up"" weapon to their primary duty pistol or as their ""off-duty"" weapon."

Trade Nano + cash for Kimber Ultra, Walther stainless PPK.
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
