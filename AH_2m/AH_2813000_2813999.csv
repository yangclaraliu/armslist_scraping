Ejects out the bottom and has ambi controls for the safety, so it's lefty friendly. It has the optional muzzle brake which takes recoil extremely well.

Very small and easily concealable pistol and the color is somewhat hard to find.  I put approx 200 rounds through it without a problem however I purchased it for my wife and it's just too snappy for her to use.  If you haven't shot this gun before, it does have some kick due to it's light weight and small size.  Not really a range toy, but makes for a really nice deep concealment pistol.
There was some bad press when these first came out due to one of the trigger pins walking out and some spotty reliability reports.  This is the latest generation with 3 reinforced trigger pins (instead of 2 in the previous gen), the reliability issues have also been fixed by working the feed ramp and I believe they adjusted the spring weights.  All I can say is this particular gun has been flawless and would keep it if the recoil were more manageable.

I will NOT consider any trades, I already purchased the replacement for this gun.  Cash from AZ residents only.

I'm asking $380 which includes the firearm, magazine and original box and documentation.  This is a fair price considering the local gunshop asking prices and sales tax, not to mention the rare color and no 4473 ATF form to fill out."

ACS has a little storage compartment, and is fully adjustable.  Its a flat top so you can pick and choose optics style you like, I have it outfitted to suit my likes with magpul pop up / back-up sights (So you can run them up or down).  Also has a BAD lever from magpul to release bolt without taking your hand off the pistol grip.

Come with 2) 30 round P-mag's, loaded.  Also included is a TRS-25 red dot, co-witnesses with pop up iron sights.  80-100 rounds thru rifle total since new (4 months old).  No failures to fire/feed/or extract, ran great.

At the end of the page just copy and paste the link.   The gun is brand new I have and sitting in my safe.  I bought it a few months back being new to shotguns and was not aware of what I was buying.  I wanted a shotgun to get into trap shooting and something to swap out a barrel for home defense also.  This has the barrel in between what I needed it is only a 24 inch barrel so really not what I was looking for after all.  I did not realize this at the time.    I have original box and everything that came with it and it has never been fired and is still in its original state brand new.  Turkey Season is around the corner.  Gun ran me a little over 400 and will take trade offers on guns around 425ish or will take 350 cash.    Thank you Link to details on shotgun.  http://www.ableammo.com/catalog/mossberg-ulti-maggrand-slam-turkey-shotgun-62235-gauge-ported-chmbr-mossy-ulti-full-choke-fiber-sights-p-84719.html

It has a nice sharp clear arsenal marking and not one of those that was poorly struck or refurbished into oblivion.

This is an interesting piece as 1929 was a transitional year where the Tula arsenal changed from using the Tula script logo to the Tula star logo during the year so as a result the production numbers of 1929 dated dragoons with the Tula star stamp are lower than if the production had been continued for the full year.

I also have a 1944 dated Tula ex-sniper with the matching bayonet available for FTF sale for the same price.

This isn't your standard, run of the mill C93. The story I got was that a gentleman who goes by the screen name Ghillieebear over at the HKPro forums did the work to this rifle. It has wooden furniture instead of the factory plastic stuff. It also has the metal trigger housing (complete with all three selector positions, but only fires semi-auto) and the paddle style magazine release. The receiver and cocking tube have a gray colored finish while most of the other parts are black. (Was told this is cerakote). 

I haven't had a chance to shoot it yet but the previous owner said it runs like a top on everything he fed it.

This is a fresh safe queen.  I purchased it new and have kept it locked in my gun case ever since.  I'm sure it is a sweet firing pistol but I thought is was just too darn pretty to use.  

These are very hard to find locally and they usually come with a steep price premium.  The only reason I am selling it is because I already have a stainless Gold Cup and I need to make room in the safe for more toys.  My lack of space is your gain.

I am offering this pistol for a very reasonable $900 cash price firm.  No trades please and no shipping.  I will only sell face to face, preferably to an Ohio CCW holder, but I will sell to any Ohio resident who is legally able to buy a firearm and who is willing to fill out a Firearm Bill of Sale with a copy of your driver's license.

It has a brand new factory installed Magpul PRS stock and a Surefire 7.62 MB762-211C Muzzle Brake/Adapter. It also includes - LaRue Tactical A-PEG Grip, Black furn, 3 rails, 2 mags, target, lock and manual, SWAG including OBR hat... and more. LaRue Tactical OBR 7.62 Overview: The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. Machined from billet 7075-T6, the receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy. The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. The barrel is Stainless Steel 20"" length. All gas blocks feature unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Suppressor Compatibility: LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. Internals: The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. The trigger group is the excellent Geissele SSA Combat Trigger. The SSA provides an average 4.5lb pull weight.(2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage). XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy."

The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 7.62 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original. PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods. The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor. The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system. Specifications: Caliber: 7.62 x 51 mm NATO Barrel Lengths: 14.5”,16.1”and 18” Rifling Twist Rate: 1/10 Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas System: Direct Impingement with LaRue PST™ port selector Accessories: 2ea, 20-Round LaRue Magazines 3ea 3” Rail Sections Operators Manual Barrel Wrench Suppressor Compatibility: LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire."

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.
With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.
Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

An affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets.
