The reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. Unique to the L5AWM is the one piece wrap‐around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use. The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non‐tilting follower for trouble‐free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET. The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160, to name a few, and available in 10, 20 and 30 round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body. FEATURES: Hardened steel feed lips Impact resistant polymer body Available Translucent or Opaque Top of magazine catch is steel Non-tilt follower Constant curve internal geometry Stainless steel spring Aggressive texturing on body for positive grip Slim body design Slide on bottom, easy to dissemble Translucent bodies have round count markers Designed, Tooled, Manufactured and Assembled in the United States of America"

It is an original Series 1 gun so no Schwartz safety like the current versions. I am the original owner and would estimate that the gun has had maybe 400 rds fired through it. 

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim a bit. I had a magwell on it at one time and put a set of blue Carbon Creation grips on it. Magwell has since been put on another of my 1911's and in it's place is a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have the factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included. I also have the factory rosewood grips. 

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured and an extended 10rd Chip McCormick not pictures.

I dont have any particular trades in mind but know what it is worth. Any trade offers +/- cash should include the cash figure

I just had a new Walther-Lothar barrel put on it by Larry at State Arms. I've only put 16 rounds down the pipe on it since. The stock is completely adjustable and the bi-pod is super beefy. The trigger is factory set right around 19 ozs. The rifle is in great condition and shoots like a dream.  State Arms rifles are responsible for several world records for long distance shooting.  

The scope is a Zeiss Conquest 6.5-20x50 with the Rapid-Z 1000 reticule in it, super clear glass. The rings are Warne Maxima quick-detachable with a guaranteed return-to-zero. I have tested that feature extensively and have never had a problem with the zero shifting.  The scope base is a 20 MOA taper unit.

I have 110 rounds of Singapore M33 ammo and 15 rounds of 750gr A-Max ammo that are included.  The A-Max's are reloads that were set up for the old barrel.

Also included is a $200 Pelican 1750 long case.  I haven't set up this case for the rifle yet, but by easily removing two screws the stock comes off and the rifle will fit inside this case.  This case rolls easily and is very heavy duty.

The reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. Unique to the L5AWM is the one piece wrap‐around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use. The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non‐tilting follower for trouble‐free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET. The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160, to name a few, and available in 10, 20 and 30 round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body. FEATURES: Hardened steel feed lips Impact resistant polymer body Available Translucent or Opaque Top of magazine catch is steel Non-tilt follower Constant curve internal geometry Stainless steel spring Aggressive texturing on body for positive grip Slim body design Slide on bottom, easy to dissemble Translucent bodies have round count markers Designed, Tooled, Manufactured and Assembled in the United States of America"

Like the MR556A1, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, developed by H&K as a premium commercial/civilian market rifle with match capability. Like the HK416, the MR762A1 offers many improvements over conventional AR-10/LR-308 pattern rifles and carbines.

The MR762A1 uses H&K's proprietary gas piston operation system, employing a piston and a solid rod in place of the gas tube found on typical AR-10/LR-308 pattern firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since the hot carbon fouling and waste gasses do not enter the receiver. This keeps the receiver much cleaner and decreases heat wear to internal componentry. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR762A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components, and uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series, including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The upper receiver has a Picatinny rail machined in to it's top for mounting optics and BUIS. Like the HK416, the MR762A1 uses a Cold Hammer Forged barrel, in this case measuring at 16.5"". The highest quality steel is used, and Cold Hammer Forging produces some of the longest lasting, most accurate barrels available. This barrel features a popular 1:12"" twist rate, perfect for most commercial ammunition.

A precision enhanced two-stage trigger is equipped for significantly improved accuracy, and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a scope easier. The stock is adjustable, and can be locked in place with an allen screw for complete security.

The MR762A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.A soft range bag, 10 round magazine, and allen key tool are included.

The model one, was the first firearm the newly formed Smith and Wesson company produced. It was one of the world's very first cartridge revolvers and it was also the world's first gun to be chambered in .22 rimfire. The design was popular enough that the patent had to be defended (successfully) in court.  What a great time to start a firearms company with the Civil War starting a few years later. The model one may have been an effective close  quarters self defense gun in a world of mostly single shots with laborious reloads. 

This particular revolver was made early enough that is was likely carried during the Civil War, but it is still in working order! It was recently fired using ORIGIONAL BLACK POWER ONLY .22 SHORT cartridges. Though most of the original silver plating is intact, some of the brass frame can be seen on the wear points. Some of the original bluing is still on the barrel and cylinder and the bore is clean with sharp rifling. As a point of interest, the rifling has no twists but is straight. The butt has a few dents... isn't in funny how some people will use a fine firearm as a hammer? Also one of the grips may have been chipped during the aforementioned hammering and was repaired. The revolver appears to have been disassembled and a few of the pins were replaced. All in all this is a very nice relic of the Civil War era and of early S&W revolver development. Feel free to ask questions or make corrections to my commentary. Asking $350. including shipping. First ""I'll take it"" or trade, I like Glocks and military pattern firearms and silver.

Also features last shot hold open. I literally just purchased this on Gunbroker (New Old Stock) with with the intent for it to be used by my daughters for Appleseed, CMP Rimfire type shooting, but it is too heavy for them to be practical at their age. Comes with manual, lock, mags, red dot, box etc. This gun retailed for $419 from the seller I purchase it from. So I'm losing money right out of the gate. But it's more important my daughters have an appropriate rifle for its intended use. I have been on Gunbroker for nearly 6 years with nearly 100 buys/sells with 100% positive feedback.  I would prefer to sell locally (Western Washington) and skip the headaches of shipping. I do request that any buyer I meet in person, be willing to show me a copy of their Concealed Permit, FFL (C&R is good too), or willing to sign a receipt with your name, address and phone number that matches your I.D. at MINIMUM. That way if cops ever coming knocking on my door, I can have them come knock on yours.  ( = If you can't walk into a gun store and legally purchase a firearm, skip this ad please."

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Includes a box or 2 of defensive ammo.
Bought this new a little over a year ago. About 30 rounds fired. Has the pistol grip for home defense, the way I bought it. I also have the Houge soft rubber, overmolded stock for it. No fore end just the butt stock. Still in the package. There are some scratches on the receiver/magazine tube at the far end. I covered them with Birchwood Casey touch up pen, however (see pics) someone with a little experience could do a much better job than did I. Thanks Not interested in trading."
