Comes with 6 - 33 round Glock factory magazines and 4 - 17 round Glock factory magazines - includes a 3 mag pouch for the 17 round mags, a Fobus holster, and comes with Glock factory case and ammo loader.  This gun with all these mags would be great for a shtf scenario or if you're looking to get into IPSC or IDPA. Get these Glock factory mags before the price goes up again on them! There are many other pistol chambered carbines that take glock mags, so definitely a plus there to own 6 - 33 round mags. Do the math - if you have all the mags full, you'll have 198 rounds of 9mm ready, which should be plenty for whatever might come your way. Looking to trade for an AR pistol in 556 or 9mm or cash - Will throw in 100 rounds of 147 grain subsonic 9mm ammo.

Just wanting to sell it to afford other things. Interested in trades for other modern guns(No 1911s). The 4th 17 round mag is in the gun. If this posting is still up, that means it's still available."

Extremely accurate and reliable.  I took it out this past weekend & put about 100 rds thru it - the first it has been shot since the sights, trigger work, & Cerakote.  Adjusted sights & made sure it functioned perfectly with different types of ball & hollowpoint ammo.  Barrel, frame, slide, grips, grip safety, hammer, extractor, ejector, mainspring housing, &  firing pin safety have about 500 rds total.  Remainder of parts have 100 rds.  

CCW or PPP & bill of sale.

Price is firm - a lot of time & money went into customizing this gun and making it an ultra-reliable, tack driving, carry gun.  I'd rate the condition 99% overall. Very minor finish wear on the barrel from firing and very slight marks on the sights from adjusting but overall looks like a brand new gun.

I'm not in any rush or desperate need to sell.  If I end up keeping it I won't mind.  I won't respond to lowball offers.  Only interested in very few specific trades listed below.  Might be interested in a few other things in trade, so just ask unless it's something I specifically don't want listed below.

I purchased this used last year to let my mom keep and shoot low recoil 38spl ammo out of for a nightstand gun. She decided she wanted something different and now is wanting to sell this one. It is in overall good condition and locks up nicely. I have shot a few rounds of .357Magnum out of it and it shoots great. I am selling the gun and the left over Blazer Brass .357 I have. If interested shoot me a pm or text REDACTED. I will be glad to meet in Garner, Willow Spring, Fuquay-Varina, or Holly Springs for a serious buyer. Thanks."

Springfield Armory SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Original Owner. Shot 93 rounds through it for the break in process. 
9th round failed to fully eject (stovepipe) Was not jammed. The next 84 rounds cycled perfectly. This is a good gun with no issues. I feel I got lucky on this one.
I just spent over 1 hour cleaning this gun with the Frog Lube Heat Lubrication Process for the second time since I owned this gun. This gun is slicker then any other Kel-tec you ever felt.
I also carefully filed off all the sharp rough plastic edges that all Kel-Tec's have, so it's nice and smooth and doesn't look so cheap. 
Always kept inside the holster as I pocket carry this gun every day. Has a little wear mark on the back corner of the slide, but if you carry all the time, this would happen to any gun with this holster. Not really noticeable unless your really looking at it.
Concealed carry package deal. Only selling because I am upgrading to something different.

1 Kel-tec 380
1 Desantis pocket holster
7 rounds of range ammo. Same ammo I did the break in process with on this gun. 
All shown in images for $220 cash only. Local pickup only. Location Marysville.
Also included is the lock, manual and plastic case that came with the gun.
You must be over 21 and have a valid Wa concealed to carry permit and Valid Wa ID or I will not sell to you.

Since that ammo was expensive I also purchased a factory .40SW barrel. This pistol will shoot both calibers with a simple barrel change. Takes about 10 seconds to swap them out. It uses the same magazines for both calibers. Very low round count. The .357 barrel has about 100 rounds through it, the .40 barrel has about 50 rounds through it. The pistol also has Trijicon brand night sights. It has an ambidextrous slide release. It only has a trigger safety, no slide mounted safety. This would be a fantastic competition pistol. Comes with all the original factory hardware (case, lock, 3 different backstraps, 3 (15) round magazines, manual).

Smith & Wesson no longer produces the .357SIG model. It had a short production run and will likely become increasingly difficult to find. 

The Trijicon sights would run you $80 to $100 alone. This pistol retails for $569 without the Trijicon sights and without the extra barrel. I really like this pistol, just not as much as some of my other ones so it is time for it to move on. I am under no pressure to sell so please don't hit me with dumb offers, I will respond with dumb answers.

It was originally CM9 and then I acquired a new PM9 upper for it.  The frame and all the internals are the same between the CM9 and PM9.  The CM9 upper has roughly 500 rounds through it and the PM9 upper has roughly 200 rounds through it.  They both are reliable.  The CM9 upper is completely stock.  The PM9 has had the striker, barrel, and extractor polished.  The slide stop has been smoothed out and ground down to sit nearly flush on the right side of the gun.  The trigger bar is also polished.  It is also wearing XS Big Dot sights.  I have (2) six round mags and (2) seven round mags.  

**I will part out some of the accessories/extra upper if you want**

In addition to the gun, extra upper, and slides, I also have a bunch of spare parts for it.
I will list the parts here in rough order of price (Kahr website msrp).

Kahr CM9 - $517
PM9 Slide (completely built)- $427.90
Extra PM9 Barrel - $140.80
XS Big Dot Sights (x2) - $120  (‘13 on PM9 slide, ‘12 used pair spare)
New Trijicon Night Sights ‘13 - $80
CM9 Trijicon Night Sight -$49.99
CM9 Fiber Obtic front sight - $46.00
Extra PM9 Slide Stop (x2) $24.2
Desantis Pocket Holster $5.00
Extra Trigger $15.4
Extra recoil assy. $23.1
Extra trigger bar - $14.30
Extra mag catch - $12.10
Extra Striker - $15.40
Extra Striker block - $28.60
Extra small parts (cocking cam, striker, small springs, ect, pretty much every spare part)  $10

Total is over $1150 at full retail.  Obviously the entire package may only appeal to a very small group of people, so if you want just one or two if these parts just let me know.  I would estimate a fair price to be about 60-70% of MSRP give or take a little.

There are two notable scratches....one on the frame where the slide stop rubbed against the frame while reassembling the gun.  The other is a small nick on the top of the PM9 slide, just to the rear of the front sight (not noticeable while aiming)

I have more hi-res pictures available on request armslist only lets me upload 3)

I am not in a hurry to sell this gun, just selling it to fund other purchases.  With that said I am very open to offers and not looking to squeeze every penny I can out of this thing.  I am interested in trading for a Sig 938, S&W M&P Pro 5' 9mm, maybe a G26, G19, PPQ, Shield or XDS (9mm) or maybe something else, who knows.

If your interested, send me an offer for the whole lot, or just the parts that you are interested in.  I will ship if required (FFL for the gun). Thanks"

Blueprinted with Geissele trigger installed and live fire tested, NP3 all internals and controls, Poly T2 OD Green exterior. NP3 PLUS has a 1000 hour salt spray protection level per ASTM-B-117 and Poly T2 exceeds 1000 hours. Robar logo stamped for bona fides, rail system marked w/ alpha numeric system, 4 sling swivel attach points, Magpul furniture, Samson BUIS (back up iron sights).. One of the most tested and proven weapons systems in the world achieves ultimate refinement with the introduction of this Robar/Rocke platform. With its Nitride treated, military grade barrel and adjustable, four-position gas regulator it incorporates all of the most desirable mechanical improvements. Add to these a free-floating aluminum forend, and you have the most advanced, versatile gas pushrod pistol available. NO SBR STAMP NEEDED! The BATFE has classified this as a pistol. With the addition of the adjustable stock for length of pull it is still legal as the BATFE has classified the stock as a forearm retention device; yes you can legally shoot it the same as an SBR in the same position you shoot any carbine! You get a letter from the BATFE confirming this is a pistol and you do NOT need a stamp.. that said this for all practical purposes is an SBR and operates exactly the same way as any other carbine or SBR.. but legal w/ no stamp; get it? This platform engages silhouettes out to 250 meters no problem topped with the Swedish Aimpoint Comp M4S military issue red dot system; runs continuous for 8 years on a single AA battery, waterproof, military edition units come with Tenebraex ARD (anti- reflective device) and ocular and objective covers. System is awesome for 0-250 meters. We chose this optic over the micro systems as the durability of the M4S is unsurpassed. This SBR/optic combo is built to take abuse and continue to function.. it is tough! When Dorothy tells you an SBR cannot engage and terminate threats at these distances have him go to Cowtown with us. We'll shoot at 300 plus.. Unit delivered zeroed at 100 meters.

 NOTE IT IS ILLEGAL TO PUT A FOREND HAND GRIP ON A PISTOL.. THE HANDGRIP UNDER THE BARREL IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE SALE..

It has the lightweight polymer frame, 2 speed loaders, 1 LEFT SIDE IWB ccw holster, Ruger factory carry/storage pouch, and the original paperwork (with spent cartridge). 

Gun has the kind of wear you would expect from being carried (some) and practiced with on occasion. There is a bit of wear where the cylinder contacts the framework (when closing the cylinder) and an almost unnoticeable amount of wear on the parts where the clothing rub against it. 

Lets be real here. I carry this pistol daily. If you are looking for a safe queen, go look elsewhere. If you are looking for an emergency rescue tool to utilize at a half moment's notice with 100% reliability, inquire within."

I bought this gun in November of 2013 from sports world (a local firearms dealer). When I purchased the gun it was NEW, and still has never been fired. Upon buying the gun it was taken from the box and put straight into my gun safe and has only been taken out to admire or show off to friends. I had planned to use it for multiple purposes but have been too busy to take it out. This gun is in perfect condition and has no scratches, dings, or blemishes of any kind. The only reason I am selling this gun is because I have a baby on the way and could use the money to go towards that.  With that being said I am not strapped for cash, I don't need to sell this gun, but would like to to help out with baby fund, I know what this gun is worth and how hard they are to get (being that their sold out in stores, or on a waiting list online). I am only looking to get my money back nothing more. About the gun- it is a black semi automatic Arsenal SAIGA 410 shotgun, it comes with a standard 4 round clip, as well as a pro-mag 30 round drum. It shoots 3 inch 410 shells only. I have 25 Winchester super X brass game loads that go with the gun as well as 6-5 round boxes of Winchester super X slugs, and 1-5 round box of Winchester super X buckshot. All ammo comes with gun being that I don't have any use for it.  This gun would be great for a boy or girl to squirrel, rabbit, or dove hunt with, Or for an adult. The gun is not heavy in weight although when you have the 30 round drum attached it adds a bit of weight to the gun. If interested or you have any questions feel free to email me. Thanks"

I have an original part for it, but have neither the tools nor the skill to replace it.  Other than the crane  the pistol is in great condition with good blue, good bore, and tight lockup.  It could actually be fired the way it is, but would jam upon reloading.  A gunsmith friend out of state says it is about a one hour job to remove the peening, swap the parts, then crimp or peen the extractor star back in so it does not unscrew with use.  Replacement crane with ejector rod and spring is included.
Repaired, this gun is easily worth $600. plus.  It is a target version of the Official Police made in relatively small numbers.  I believe it is the Third Model, made in 1932.
Current unemployment causes me to take this off my project list and sell as is."

Is actually NOT a legit listing.  I text the number listed in the Ad  REDACTED And found out this is a SHADY person with who know what their intent is....

All start by trying to get info on the gun more to see if it was the actual weapon mention in the AD but after poor responses in return from this user they started sending me pictures of a DIFFERENT gun.  More of a older model Smith and Wesson j-frame revolver.  Anyways they wanted me to meet tonight 1am at a Courthouse.....LOL WTF

This person is trying to sell a firearm on Federal/Government property that is NOT their duty weapon so after telling her i wanted to meet first thing in the morning locally,  she continues to say she will have her ""husband"" meet me,  i'm thinking why is their more then one party for this transaction already.  After several attempts on trying to get his info she then tells me it's her friends gun now.

They kept giving me poor lame excuses why they can't meet locally and will only meet at a Courthouse after and business hours is a HUGE CRY for TROUBLE!  I don't know what kind of scam this is but BEWARE of this person.....she also didn't want to give me any names including he/hers,  stay away from this lisitng posted above and flag it for removal it is IS too good to be true!!!!"

Type: Semi-Auto Pistol

Barrel Length: 4""

This pistol is in great shape.  The finish on it is excellent, the bore is superb (as there has been less than 100 rounds through it), and the over all appearance is absolutely nice.  This pistol was taken to the range and tested, and I was pretty amazed as to how it handled.  A very smooth trigger pull, pretty accurate, and all of the controls are easily activated when needed.  This pistol field strips quite easily, can be cleaned without much effort, and put back together just as easy as it tore down.  This beast has a take down switch, a slide stop/release, and a de-cocker which puts the pistol in “SAFE” mode.  It also has a built in compensated barrel.  The slide and frame are made of alloy metal which will give you years of use.  It also incorporates a 3-dot sighting system on a set of low profile tactical sights.  It also has a built-in frame rail so that you can mount a flashlight or laser.
This pistol would be awesome for concealed carry as it is a little smaller than a full size pistol, but yet it be loaded with high capacity magazines.  If you should decide to not use it for concealed carry, it would make a great ZOMBIE back-up pistol because of the accuracy and high capacity (LOL  for those of you who believe in the ZOMBIE APOCOLYPSE).  For you preppers, this would make a great pistol to store in your bunker.

Includes:
5 15-round magazines.  These magazines were originally Beretta 92 mags that were notched appropriately for the CS9.  These magazines function flawlessly and are in great shape.  Not only will these magazines fit and function in the CS9, but if you have a Beretta 92, they will also fit and function flawlessly in that pistol too.
1 21-round magazine
Go check out YOUTUBECOM and type in ZIGANA TISAS CS9 and see what pops up.  You will be amazed with the factory testing for these pistols.  
Interested in purchasing????  If so, you can text or call REDACTED (Rich).

$860 cash firm or higher in good trades.

f wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

Not in need of anything at all right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of since I know cash can be tight for folks, not limited to:

FN SCAR 16 or 17
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers or complete rifles in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf or .450 Bushmaster would be cool. 
Daewoo
Colts 
FAL 308/7.62 
Sig 556 or 556r piston models ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers. 
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal. (Please do not tell me an unconverted Saiga 12 goes for $1,200, even converted models don't go for that unless they have lots of extras).  I will give $600-$700 trade value for unconverted, depending on condition and what is included, this is what they sell for NEW!
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models.
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one. 
Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know.  Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top, maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm or other 1-6x optics.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,
.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area, sometimes make it to Arlington and Lewisville area or will ship."
