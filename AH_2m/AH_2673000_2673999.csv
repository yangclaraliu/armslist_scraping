 ""Under"" the age of 18 with varying circumstances, as well as those 21+. That means a  person 18-20 can legally ""posses"" a handgun.


 O.C.G.A. § 16-11-101.1
 Furnishing pistol or revolver to person under the age of 18 years

 This law relates to the sale of handguns in Georgia through a private party (you and I) sale. Once again, it only refers to those ""under"" the age of 18. The rest of the laws that apply to the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in Georgia are federal laws which only apply to an FFL or manufacturer. (http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/articles/2004/citizen%60s-guide-to-federal-firearms-law.aspx> 

 O.C.G.A. § 16-11-126
 Having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons; license requirement; exceptions for homes, motor vehicles, and other locations and conditions; penalties for violations

 A person of age 18-20 is treated as an adult who does not have a Georgia Weapons Carry License, and must abide by those same rules. Those rules, in short, mean that the handgun may not leave the confines of my home (property of said home included), motor vehicle, and/or place of business."

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired exactly 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a very slight paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

It is a Do All White Wing Thrower with the Do-All Traps® Aerial Assault Wobbler Kit and Do-All Traps® Aerial Assault 40 Target Extension Kit on an The Ironton Utility Trailer  40x48 in. with a welded steel floor.  I had the trailer painted with an abrasive skid resistant coating and marine battery box installed. All is in working order and trailer is road ready. I usually pull it with my vehicle to friend’s houses for afternoon fun. Included is both a hand held release and foot pedal release to throw the clays.
The Do All White Wing Thrower features a 25-target auto feeder, steel arm, a two-second cycle time, powder-coated steel frame, and a foot pedal release. The Aerial Assault Wobbler Kit is a motorized launcher mounts to the Aerial Assault, throwing targets in random positions to simulate real-life shooting situations. Presents incomers, away shots, fast quartering, and passing shots at random. Left-right movement of 45º, up-down at 15º-45º.
Below you will see what I have invested in this machine and have provided link to Do All out doors. I think my asking price is fair compared to investment. Selling due to non-use and taking up space in garage lately. My loss is your gain.

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

It obviously is in the same form factor and will take ar 10 accessories.

Now,it needs to go.....

It's a 1978 by the barrel code, and I'm pretty sure the Redfield 2x-7x scope is of the same vintage. No rust or scratches on the metal except for the trigger guard, which is shown in the pic's. Wood has the normal handling/safe marks, but nothing really stands out....the finish and wood grain is excellent. The scope has very fine reticles and is super clear, considering it's age. The trigger is fantastic and breaks like glass!

It's been a safe queen since purchase and needs a good dusting/cleaning,lol.

I'll include the 2 new boxes of factory ammo shown in the pic's.

I'd like to get $500 for it all.

CHIAPPA RHINO 60DS 357MAG 6"" BLACK
Target Shooting version, featuring a new standard in competition. Different grips size and finish available for maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment.With choices from 2""to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

This rifle is chambered in the well-known, widely available, and cost effective 7.62x39 cartridge, making it both extremely versatile and cheap to shoot. I have owned this rifle for about a year or so, bought it brand new. Took it with me down south to hunt feral hogs and here in the NE to hunt whitetail, coyotes, and ground hogs. It's essentially a 30/30 round out of a bolt action rifle, at a fraction of the cost to shoot. Great for someone who already has a 7.62x39 firearm (AK, SKS, etc.) that doesn't want to add a new caliber to their collection. 

Both the bluing and stock on this rifle are deep and rich in color. The Monte Carlo all wood stock is absolutely gorgeous. Overall this piece is in exceptional condition, can hardly tell it has been used. Accuracy is outstanding, have personally taken out 2 deer at around 200 yards and coyote/ground hogs at between 100-200 yards. I haven't had to opportunity to see what it can do past 200-250 yards, but according to the owners manual and various YouTube videos, 400-500 yards with decent ammo is well within its effective range.

Included in this package:

- Zastava M85 rifle ($525)
- Vortex Crossfire 2 (2-7x32). Great optic, zeroed at 100 yards ($150)
- Burris signature 1"" Zee scope rings (medium) w/ ""floating"" self-centering inserts. ($50)
- bi-pod (pivots, and each leg is individually fully adjustable) ($65)
- neoprene gel sling (very comfortable and durable) ($35)
- soft rifle case that fits this rifle, along with the bi-pod and scope ($30)
- 50 rounds of high end Hornady SST (polymer tipped hunting ammo) ($45)
- 100 rounds of Wolf brand ammo (either soft point or hollow point) ($30)

Comes with owners/operating manual for the rifle and the retail box for the scope (including users manual and warranty info). 

I have over $900 invested in this package. Obviously, I want to be realistic and therefore I understand I'm not going to get that out of it. However, I think $550 is extremely fair for everything here, and the condition it is in. 

FTF only, no shipping. Must be at least 18 yrs old with a valid OH ID. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. CCW and/or NRA card holders (like myself) are preferred. 

I would consider trades, however i am currently only looking for a 12 gauge tactical shotgun (remmy 870 tactical, mossberg 590 or 590a1, mossberg 930spx, etc.) Cash to even out either way if needed."

- Free Float Aluminum Handguard.
- Lo Pro gas block

Lower is a New Frontier Armory Polymer Lower.  Very lightweight and will accept all other uppers designed for milspec lowers.  Commercial buffer tube.  Check out the videos of the lower on their website, its quite impressive.

Gun will also come with a UTG Red Dot, Flip up irons, 2 Troy battlemags,  and 160 rounds of ammo.

I built this to see what type of AR you could build on a budget.  I was never impressed with DPMS budget guns and have had issues with everyone I shot. So I built this.  It worked out to around the same price as a DPMS however this gun runs infinitely better, cycling steel ammo as well as brass. I own a Stag, a RRA, and a Armalite and I can comfortably say this gun runs good.  It is also incredibly light.

Asking $650 or best offer.  Interested in trades for Ak's.

I'd prefer at least 10mm in a semi-auto and 41 Mag in a revolver at a minimum, but I might consider a 357 Mag with a long barrel if it's a good enough deal.

Brand new, never used. This is the latest and most compact EOTech magnifier that's shorter and has a quick detach base. Great for quickly switching from long range to CQB shooting. 

$475 OBO.  I am willing to ship.



From EOTech website:
The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.
