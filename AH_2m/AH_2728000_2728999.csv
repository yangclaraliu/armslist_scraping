I got this as a collectors item and thought it was time to let it go to someone else who would appreciate it. 

Serial number places the gun as a 1959 model.  I fired it once to ensure that it was in full operating condition and then it's been in the safe ever since. 

As this is a collectors item, the value isn't as straight forward as newer guns so make an offer for cash sale or trade and I'll give it consideration but don't low ball. This is an original pistol made in 1959 that is no longer in production.

Fair condition includes needing some mechanical work, bad tires, and bad paint.

The good:

-Only 144,000 miles

-5.7 vortec 350 v8

-1-ton truck, utility bed, and ladder rack

Never been wrecked other than being bumped from behind a few times at very low speed and backed into on the passenger side door. This truck belonged to a family member, and I attest to this. 



The bad:

-Needs a fuel pump, fuel pressure is extremely weak. It will start with starting fluid and stay running/driving until you turn it off, but it feels like it is limping around at 1/4 power.

-One of the front breaks is making some noise, nothing extreme though.

-The truck was smoked in for the first 12 years of its life, it has not been smoked in for the last 2 years or so.

-Drivers side door handle broke and the door panel is off. I have replaced this once before and the new one only lasted about a year. I never got around to fixing it again.

-Tires are not bald but they are pretty low on tread all around

-Small dings and scratches

- It is currently dirty as hell. I will sell it as is or wash it sometime later this week or this weekend."

FEG HI Power. Uses the same browning locking/firing system, not the S&W 59 system that later fegs used. This gun is a 100% part for part swappable with a real FN/Browning Hi Power. I know this for a fact because I have swapped the slides, mags, springs, safeties, etc with my 2 actual IDF contract and FN Hi powers.

This pistol functions flawlessly,very accurate and reliable. This gun does have holster wear and nicks here and there on the grips etc. Overall though the bluing isnt too bad and it is a great shooter and not that bad of shape. I was debating on having it reblued but have decided to put the money in more ammo and grips for my actual Hi powers.

It comes with the gun, 3 mags, Nice old school leather thumb break holster, soft zipper case, it also has had all new springs in the pistol. 

I am asking 375$ for it all. I will be back in town tomorrow afternoon and can meet anytime thereafter."

It is a good rimfire but requires the shooter to be extra diligent in cleaning the bore.  You need to clean it every 20 - 25 shots to maintain accuracy.  Performs well and is accurate to around 250 yards on prairie dogs in 15 mph winds. We have only tested the 25 grain ammo that the manufacturer claims 2600 fps velocity.  4 rifles left in stock, cash or check, no credit cards.  Ammo is equally hard to find and we are currently sold out of our stock.  These rifles require buyer to complete a form 4473 and have either a valid Nebraska Handgun Purchase card or Nebraska Concealed Carry Permit.

It runs through 7.62x39 ammo like champ, very reliable. It has the proper roll marks that indicate it was made and used in China by their military or security forces (you can see these marks in the photos). This makes it more desirable than the SKS model specifically made for export.

It has a clean bore with great rifling (again, check the pictures). It has a nice trigger (for an SKS), which has a two-stage feel and is very predictable. You'll notice in the photos that it has a lot of character, and the stock looks awesome, which is why I bought it. I'm able to get about four inch groups at 50 yards with it, but I'm no sniper, and I've only put a couple hundred rounds through it.

I'm including 320 rounds of 7.62x39. It's 123 grain hollow point ammo from Brown Bear. It runs well in the gun.

You'll also receive a tactical case that fits the length of the gun really well. In addition to that, you'll get a front sight tool for precisely drifting the sight for windage and adjusting it for elevation. The cherry on top of this package is a set of six replacement front sights (in addition to the stock sight) so you can set up the gun exactly how you want it. They screw it really easily with the tool.

I'm listing this gun for $450, but I would also trade it for a Marlin 336 in .30-30. That's the only thing I'd be interested in trading for."

Brand new in the box, never fired Steyr AUG/A3 SA USA bullpup rifle with original Steyr scope. Includes the box, manuals and 1 magazine. This uses the Steyr/EMAG magazines not NATO mags. This is a bullpup rifle so it has the legal 16"" barrel but is much shorter than a standard AR-15 carbine. The barrel is chrome lined and can be switched out with a different barrel in 30 seconds or less. Feel free to email me with any questions. No trades, money only. Thank you.

I have a new un-fired Savage ""Hog Hunter"" in .223 for sale or trade. I bought it originally to plink groundhogs with but ended up getting a 22-250 for the purpose. Regardless, this is a sweet rifle and I was intending to get a muzzle break and a nice optic for it but my gun collection is lacking in the handgun department so I was looking to sell or trade this rifle. It is 100% new in the box, nothing was opened or touched since it left the gun store.

Its basically a savage model 11 heavy barreled action with a 1-9"" twist 20"" threaded heavy barrel with high iron sights to see over your scope bases and suppressor/barrel device. It has an internal magazine, large bolt handle, accu trigger, and a thread protector to protect the 1/2x28 threaded barrel. Takes standard 1/2x28 muzzle devices just like an AR15. Rifle is factory made like this by Savage.

When I bought this rifle I wanted it in .308 which was on sale for 399 but they only had it in .223. The .223 version was not on sale, so I paid 469 plus tax for it, so keep that in mind with trade offers.

Keep it local. I don't want to drive across the state."

The modern SIG SAUER® pistol story began with the P220. In 1976 the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of ""the most accurate 45s right out of the box."" Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.

""AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."""

This started out as a Waffen Werks Bulgarian AK-74 (5.45x39). It was a great shooter but i wanted something a little more functional. I added the following; MI AK two piece hand guard, Magpul MOE stock and forward grip, US Palm pistol grip, CAA buffer tube and extension, an Attero optical mount with steel shroud and a Burris Fastfire III (which does co-witness)I have fired maybe two or three magazines worth of ammo out of it without issue. 3 Tapco polymer magazines included. Ammo is still very cheap and plentiful for this rifle. At least half the cost of 223 / 5.56 The total cost to assemble is a good bit more than my Buy it Now price.
