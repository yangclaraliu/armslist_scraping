They have reduced the weight of the rifle by wrapping parts of the rifle in carbon fiber. I was amazed at how much lighter this CA-15 with bipod and scope was compared to other AR's that have no accessories added. If you wanted to shoot this rifle with a glove on, they have allotted plenty of space by the trigger to do so. The flash suppressor not only looks great, but is made of titanium, which is durable and light. My favorite part of this rifle is the fore end that has been contoured perfectly to fit your hand.

From Christensen:
The Christensen Arms™ CA-15 platform is a truly custom-built AR-style rifle. Hundreds of configurations ensure you have the exact precision AR you desire. Whether you desire a lightweight SBR for SWAT team use or a long-range precision rifle for prairie dog shooting, each Christensen Arms™ tactical gun is built with the same commitment to excellence. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles.

From Leupold:
Leupold Mark 6 1-6x20mm Rifle Scope is a small, nimble, and powerful rifle scope that meets the needs of law enforcement, tactical, and sport shooters.image With an objective lens that's no wider than 20mm and a light weight of just over a pound, these small Leupold riflescopes won't hinder your weapon with a bulky profile or heavy load. The versatile 1x to 6x magnification range of these rifle scopes is ideal for close-range operations, with a wide field of view, fast target acquisition, and pinpoint precision at longer ranges. The professional-grade lenses of the Leupold Mark VI 1-6x20 34mm Tube Riflescope use the Xtended Twilight Lens System for edge-to-edge clarity, and their DiamondCoat2 lens coating excels at light transmission and scratch resistance. Fine-tune your measurements with the low profile Zerolock locking windage and elevation turrets, complete with tactile and audible 2/10th mil per click movement. Leupold has equipped the Mark 6 rifle scope with an illuminated reticle on the front focal plane, visible under any lighting settings with the right position on the 7-setting brightness adjustment. Smaller, lighter, and faster than most rifle scopes, the Leupold Mk 6 1-6x Xtended Twilight Scope is a versatile tool for any job."

BURNT BRONZE CERAKOTE. INCLUDES 500 ROUNDS OF FEDERAL 6.8SPC 90 GRAIN AMMO. The SIX8 weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges. Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when LWRC designed the SIX8 family of weapons, they started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, they designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, they designed the SIX8 platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, they have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications. As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8 family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8 rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge. The new SIX8 family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge."

255,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2785255,"For Trade:  100 Rounds of Chest-Hair-Growing, 185 Grain, Testosterone-Producing .45 ACP","Winter Park, Orlando, Florida",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, March 30, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello fellow firearms enthusiasts.  What I have before you are two boxes of the famous Winchester White Box line of target ammunition.  In each box, you will find exactly 50 carefully crafted, precision manufactured, and highly deadly .45 caliber, 185 grain, full metal jacketed, make my day bullets for a total of 100 rounds.

Yes, you read correctly, 185 grains.  Does your wife or girlfriend (or wimpy boyfriend/husband) not like your .45 because it kicks too hard?  Before slapping them across the face with your hardworking, stick shift driving, hammer wielding, man hands… Try presenting them with the new and improved Diet 45™ rounds: the 185 grain slug from Winchester.

These may not be the big ol’ honkin’ 230 grain pain makers that shooters are used to, but these are STILL a .45!  They mean business.  They will put holes in your paper target so big that the inferior life forms around you at the range sporting their 9mm, .380s, .22s, and more will bow at your feet in utter respect for your decision to become a man (or badass lady) and shoot a .45.

WARNING!  Using these rounds may cause the following:
-	Increased testosterone
-	Chest hair growth
-	A feeling of satisfaction
-	A feeling of purpose
-	Turned heads at local ranges
-	A better girlfriend
-	A better wife
-	A better mistress
-	All three of the above at once
-	A feeling of patriotism
-	Desire for a 1911 (or another if you have one)
-	The urge to challenge Bear Grylls to a survival competition
-	Chance of being recast for the next Dos Equis commercial
-	Understanding the meaning of life
-	And more…

If you want to be the owner of the rounds that will make your girl wet, then send me an email.  I am looking to trade these.  PLEASE read what I am willing to trade for…"

     I think that about does it. This rifle is not only sweet looking but it also shoots and feels perfect (I fired a total of 20 Rounds Downrange to Test and zero it as with every firearm I build and sell). This is a great rifle and I will include all of the receipts for every part on it so The New Owner (YOU Hopefully,lol) will have them for not only warranty purposes but also so you know that I am selling it for way less than it cost me to build.  But it's time for me to start my next build so no matter how much I love it I have to sell it so I can start the next build. (Wife's Orders). I am asking $1600 cash or $2000 Trade Value which is the approximate cost of the build and would like to get close to that if I am going to except a trade offer.  You can reach me on my cell phone with any questions or offers at REDACTED. Again feel free to contact me with any offers or trades I am open to most any reasonable trade!!!

This is NOT a cobbled together repro. It is a soviet arsenal rebuilt 1943 sniper rifle with all original parts. 

The scope is not the original issued to it (which probably means the original was beyond repair and, therefore, used in wwii) but was refurbished with in the post war years. The scope is also a 1943. 

The rifle has never been shot after import. It has excellent rifling but shows signs of use. 

The stock isn't laminated but it is made out of some interesting wood.

The upper receiver has the enhanced charging handle for ease of use. The upper receiver itself is monolithic meaning that the rail system and upper were milled out of one solid piece of aluminium. This means that there is no gap on the top rail and it also eliminates the need for a barrel nut. The piston system is a one piece piston system that can be switched from normal firing to suppressed firing modes.
The rifle has also been installed with a geissele SSA trigger and KAC rail covers. The original lmt trigger is included as well.

Great full metal DPMS build quality, Magpul CTR stock, Magpul PMags, Trigicon Acog Style optic with magnification, aluminum quad rail with UTG grips throughout give it phenomenal quick target acquisition.
Best of all, this comes with a brand new $400 SlideFire Solutions fully ATF legal bump fire stock.  Go check out the youtube videos.  This will easily dump a full 30 round PMag in 2 seconds and only a tenth of a second slower than a true full auto M4 goes through a mag.
The SlideFire stock features both a semi auto and full auto selector in case you want to try both at the range and the switch to the CTR stock takes less than a minute.
If you are looking for a really cool full auto capable battle rifle set up that has the reliability and accuracy of an AR, this is it.
I just moved from Utah and have my Utah CFP and prefer those with their CFP.  Must be 18 years or older and legally able to own and operate a firearm."

Surefire X300 Ultra Weaponlight LED 500 Lumens X300U-A

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X300 Ultra is also versatile and can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X300 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon.

The HK P2000 provides a platform that is reliable, stable and easy to carry. The first thing that I find with the P2000 is the stability of the grip and balance. With the option of 4 different size backstraps this handgun will fit just about everyone. 
In my opinion, the best overall feature of the HK P2000 is the balance. With a 12 round magazine loaded I have not found a handgun that sits better in my hand or maneuvers better in tactical movement.
Unless you have an HK already, something less honestly is a compromise in my opinion. 
A great duty weapon for law enforcement or military."

I may be willing to include a new box of Studs/Backers for the track for the right deal, currently the track is not studded for trail riding.

I also have a removable johnson cargo system ice fishing rack with quick disconnect and auger mount that is not included in price but will sell for $150 if sled purchased.

Model 1884 Springfield Trapdoor .45-.70
S/N xxx404  serial number is stamped, just do not want to include it in listing
 I was told that this gun was shot before I acquired it.  I have had it for 2 years and have no desire to fire. It does not appear to have been modified, looks pretty original and I have not taken it apart. The rifle's iron surfaces wear a flat dark plum patina and show almost no original bluing or color casehardening; The low-arched breechblock bears the stamping ""US / MODEL / 1884"" at the hinge. Stamping clear. Mechanics are tight and crisp. Bore is good and should clean to bright. Lockplate markings show the spread winged eagle and ""US / SPRINGFIELD"" forward of the hammer.  
Walnut stock never cleaned and exhibits a dark pleasing smooth finish along with its share of normal handling marks and scuffing. ID invites further research. Stock shows inspector stampings of single, fancy script initial "" P "" within a circle on the underside of butt near trigger guard tang. All iron mountings standard and present. Rear sight is the long-range type with the adjustable slide leaf, blade front sight on the muzzle. 
	""xxx404"" on the top of the recoil plate. 
	""US Model 1884"" on top of the trapdoor.
	An Eagle & ""US Springfield"" on the right side lock plate.
	""V"" over a ""P"" over an eagle's head and over another ""P"" on the left side of 	barrel & an ""A"" on top of the barrel between the trapdoor & rear sight.
	""US"" stamped on top of the butt plate.
	""U"" stamped on the side of barrel band.
The walnut stock has the following markings:
	""14 "" in large print on the right side along with a smaller stamped ""2"".
	""D"" over ""90"" also burned into the stock.
 	“216” stamped on top of stock by hammer.

This EoTech is the model that includes the night vision mode and uses AA batteries with the controls in the rear of the unit.

Due to EoTech having the dot within a 65 MOA circle reticle nothing is faster on targets up close. This model, will mount in seconds without tools and if placed on the same slot as the one used to zero will return to zero.

This one has been on my shotgun and to the range many times. This item has some scratches on the one side of the protective hood as shown in the photos but is in otherwise excellent condition with clean and clear un-scratched reticle. Even though it shows normal wear from use it functions in every way as it should; I did not want to repaint the cover as there is no need to hide the scratches. I do not have the box or the paperwork for this item.

The stippling job in particular has proven to greatly increase the purchase of the grip on the receiver (both in terms of controlling recoil while firing and for tighter retention for better follow ups, as well as for added grip during holster draws).  I can also stipple the front of the trigger, which results in a tighter, ""less pull"" perceived action, as well as under the trigger guard, which also aids in retention of the gun while firing.

The custom chrome job to the slide is mostly cosmetic, but there added benefits I have found that come along with doing this to certain parts.  For instance the sights are WAY more visible under various light conditions, as the reflective surface gathers more light for the eye to focus on more quickly.  I've also discovered that polishing the part of the take down lever which comes into contact with the spring that holds it in place leads to a MUCH easier/smoother field strip.  No more using tools to wrench the thing loose or killing your fingers doing it!  I can pretty much customize the slide to your liking, depending on what you want done (i.e. what parts you want to ""shine"")."

When I was comfortable enough to move up to a larger gun I thought the Shield would be all I could conceal on my 150 pound frame.  The gun of my dreams was an M&P Compact and after carrying the Shield for a week I was convinced I could do it.

I purchased this 9mm Shield new from a dealer in Tennessee on Gunbroker 2 weeks ago and carried it for 1 week in a cloth Uncle Mike's holster.  I never fired or modified it, never even registered the warranty on it.  It will come freshly lubricated with a few drops of CLP on the frame rails.  1 week ago I purchased an M&P Compact, have been carrying it since and have decided this will be my everyday carry gun and can't afford to keep both the Shield and the Compact.  I will be happy to meet you at the FFL of your choice for the transfer so long as it isn't terribly far from Pittsburgh.  Below are details for everything that is included, if you could use more details or pictures don't hesitate to email me.
