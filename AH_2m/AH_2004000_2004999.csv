It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Its an excellent carry gun that will literally disappear into your pocket, but its also a fun plinking gun if you don't carry.  

Comes with two mags, a second set of rubber grips, and around 1300 rounds of .22lr.  This is a package deal with the ammo, I know .22 can be hard to find so I wont sell it separately before the gun is sold.
Feeds CCI Mini mags and Remington Gold Bullets reliably, the ammo that comes with it is Remington Golden Bullets.

Asking $250 for everything.  Not really interested in trades, but I MIGHT be willing to trade towards a compact or subcompact .40.

I paid 550+tax for the gun less than 9 months ago and I feel 450 is a fair price. I like this gun a lot because of the ability of the 22 kit (you can see the pictures) super fast to swap slides, just the same way you would as if you were cleaning it. The gun is in great shape and cleaned after every use and stored in case when not carried on me.

The G&L Comanche® is Leo's final word on the traditional double-cutaway bolt-on axe. Fact is, the first thing you'll notice about the Comanche is the distinctive shape of the Magnetic Field Design™ Z-Coil™ pickups designed by Leo Fender† himself. These pickups deliver a bright and sparkly top end while offering a robust bottom end, all without any 60-cycle hum.

You'll find plenty of power in the Z-coil pickups, but what's surprising is how glassy and detailed they become as you roll back the volume and bass controls, the latter a part of the Comanche's PTB™ (Passive Treble and Bass) system. What's more, the Comanche includes a mini-toggle expander switch to allow neck+bridge or all three pickups together. In a pinch, the neck+bridge combo does a convincing faux ASAT® Special. Talk about versatile!

Making the most of this delicious combo is Leo's Dual-Fulcrum vibrato, a work of engineering art which allows bending up or down with unsurpassed stability, while offering a silky feel through its beefy aluminum vibrato arm.

The Comanche was the very last double-cutaway bolt-on guitar designed by Leo Fender, the culmination of everything he had learned during his amazing lifetime. Founded by Leo Fender in 1980, the Comanche and all G&L USA instruments continue to be made in the historic G&L facility on Fender Avenue in Fullerton, California, the Birthplace of Bolt-on™.

Due to the offset pickup design, the Comanche is available in Right-Hand only.

The Bushmaster Arm Pistol was a 5.56x45mm firearm, categorizeable as either a long pistol or short rifle or submachine gun, produced the Gwinn Firearms Company, and later Bushmaster Firearms Inc.. The firearm was a new design, having a tipping-block bolt system combined with a gas system similar to the AK-47 rifle.
Production ceased in 1991 following Bushmaster's acquisition by the Quality Products Company the previous year;[1] the company now known as Bushmaster is primarily known for making the more common AR-15 type rifles.

The .45 Automatic was the historic sidearm of the American soldier for nearly 80 years. This 8mm pa side firing blank replica features a durable steel alloy frame, hardwood grips, and realistic weight. True to form front firing action exemplifies how realistic this replica really is. Perfect for training, reenactments, films, and display. Popular with many military and police organizations throughout the world for realistic training scenarios. This front firing blank replica cannot fire projectiles nor can it be converted to fire any sort of projectile as the barrel is not drilled all the way through. Approved by BAFT as a ""non-gun.""

The SN 311383 which according to Frasca & Hill's ""The 45-70 Trapdoor Book"" puts it in the right year of manufacture by the Springfield arsenal. There is also the No 76 stamped behind the Trigger Guard and as other examples of 1884 Cadets show there is no year cartouch on the left side of the stock. Also it has the 1873 Breech block and Buffington rear sight which is correct. This rifle is over all excellent condition with some loss of bluing at the muzzle presumably due to the atachment of the bayonet. The Case hardening, Bore and Stock are in excellent condition as all the pictures indicate. This rifle has been in my collection for 33 years, and was purchased at The Lock Stock And Barrel in Pasadena, CA. With USPS MO I usually ship within 24 hours all others means must clear my bank first. Please ask any questions that you may have. No FFl is required. Shipping is non refundable.

The condition of this is very fine plus with 96% to 98% strong blue on the barrel, 95% original blue with some freckles of light rust on the Receiver. The wood is sound with minor nicks and scratches and a hairline crack in the butt stock behind the butt plate attaching pin escutcheon, it retains most of its original fine hand rubbed oil finish. The mechanics are excellent with a bright and shiny bore. If one has any question please feel free to ask. This CR OK, IF paid with MO or Certified funds I usually ship within 24 hours with a MO, personal checks and Certified have to clear. Buyer to pay shipping, Weight of this rifle is 14 lbs and WILL HAVE to be shipped USPS REGISTERED MAIL to insure it adequately. Reasonable offers will be entertained. This is a rare and hard rifle to find,it could take years to find one let alone one as nice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5/9/12 It has recently been brought to my attention that several of these Springfield Hammerillis (SN 434 and SN 456) have been sold at auction for substantially less than my offering price. After closely examining the auction catalogs multiple photos it is very clear that one has a large crack in the stock at the back of the Receiver, has a non configuration Springfield barrel and in general the condition of the stock, receiver & barrel and small parts in particular the Trigger assembly DO NOT tell the same story. It therefore appears that one of the two is REFINSIHED. The second ones pictures are a bit too vague to determine exactly what is going on with that rifle however again the barrel appears to be a replacement and the stock and metal parts condition seems to be at odds with each other. Also both rifle appear to have been shot either not at all or very little after they were blued. One MUST REMEMBER that Springfield Hammerillis rifles WERE SHOT both before and after they were sold through the DCM in the 1930's and to be in original condition need to show some commensurate wear. Again to quote Brophy, ""Very few of these scarce rifles have survived in ORIGINAL condition."""

I have 3 used Colt .45 barrels for sale. Each are in goo shape, but were replaced by Wilson Combat match barrels. The markings are different for each as well. 

Barrel 1) Marked Colt .45 auto on top w/ 7791193 underneath. Has S&W on the right of lug, M P on left lug, and P in front of the lug. This barrel is parkarized w/ crome lining. This barrel will have a stainless Wilson Combat bushing. From my understanding this means this barrel was made by S&W for a military contract as replacement barrels. 

Barrel 2) Marked Colt .45 auto just above the left lug, a P on the left lug, and a G in front of the lug with a small F above it. This barrel is parkerized and has a parkerized bushing w/ no markings. 

Barrel 3) Marked Colt .45 auto on the top of the barrel. The only other marking on this barrel is a small box w/ a C in it on the left lug. This barrel is also parkerized w/ parkerized bushing.

 Brand new in box; unfired, DPMS Panther Arms LR-308 Oracle. AR-10 variants have long held an important place on the battlefield as special-purpose rifles for designated marksmen. Now DPMS Panther Arms has been one of the manufacturers leading a new resurgence in the tactical use of the 7.62X51 NATO round with its Long Range 308 line. The .308 Oracle is one of DPMS’ most popular rifles due to its compact size, rugged military carbine features and .308 firepower. Side-by-side the LR-308 and the M4 look almost identical, but inside the LR-308 is a powerhouse. This AR-10 is fully equipped to take advantage of the power and precision for engaging long-range targets as well as the versatility of the 16” barrel to excel in the CQB role as well. Includes an uninterrupted quad-rail, recoil absorbing grips, adjustable bipod, and 3X magnifier for the sniping role; and a red dot sight, twist-off magnifier mount, battle-ready buttstock, and a folding foregrip, for the control and flexibility needed for sweep & clear mode. Compare the quality and accuracy of this rifle to a Colt, LWRC, Bushmaster, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson, Windham, Daniel Defense, Troy, Ruger, LMT, HK, CMMG, Rock River, Stag, Delton, POF, Core, Adams, Double Star, Knights, Spikes, Christensen, Olympic, Yankee Hill, or any other manufacturer’s AR – 10  and you will not be disappointed.
