The standard flat top version requires you to mount a scope to a plastic rail system that is incorporated into the shell that surrounds the receiver/guts of the rifle.

I chopped the front sight setup and flipped the hand guard, dremeled the top of the shell, and installed a weaver to picatinny riser system that actually mounts to the top of the receiver. 

This will allow you to mount optics with a lot better zero.

Probably 1500 rounds through this.

It is used to adjust your gas pressure on your AR to one of three settings, High (0.055 inch) Low (0.1 inch) and Closed.  You simply turn the switch which clicks to any of the three settings.

I used it on my 300 Blackout for switching between full power and subsonic ammo with a suppressor, but it is really designed for a higher pressure round like 6.8 SPC, .223 / 5.56, or 6.5 Grendel.  It worked great for the 300 blackout though.

Our ballistic steel plate is unmatched in the industry and is formulated and treated specifically to our specifications for improved consistency, durability, and then certified to NIJ standards. Our ballistic plate core is stress fracture resistant, features an ultra-low profile of only .25”, and is designed to handle extreme abuse in day to day use, training, and less than ideal storage conditions. AR500 Armor® body armor will outlast alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic, Dyneema, UHMWPE, and raw/uncoated steel trauma plates.

Level III Rating: AR500 Armor® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-Hit capable. Designed to defeat rifle threats up to 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,780 feet per second and all pistol calibers.

Our 10” x 12” ASC body armor offers adequate coverage of your vitals which include your heart, lungs, and surrounding blood vessels on most people. 10” x 12” is the most common size and fits the widest selection of plate carriers available on the market.

Featuring and ergonomic form, our curved 10"" x 12"" plate further improves ergonomics over standard flat body armor plates. The curve contours to your body and is recommended if you wear your body armor on a regular basis, or for duty use. A specific radius has been chosen for maximum comfort as a front or back plate for operators of varying height and weight; our curved 10"" x 12"" body armor can be used in either position in your plate carrier. To achieve the best ergonomics possible we recommend a curved front and back plate.

I think it is a model MPA1 but I really don't know for sure. This gun is from the estate of my late Brother-in-law. I don't know a whole lot about it. Here's what I do know.
Barrel length is 15"" with the flash suppressor. 
Included are:
-4 30 round steel magazines
-Vertical fore grip
-Accessory rail (that doesn't fit the barrel)
-NC Star bipod, 10"" extended
-NC Star 1x45 red dot sight that does work
-Laser sight that may or may not work. Needs batteries.
-Nice UTG Tactical case in digital camo
Overall, this gun looks nice. I have not shot it. I do not own any other .45s and am not spending the $$ on a box of ammo so I can. However, I have no reason to suspect that there is anything wrong with it. With the accessories, I think $500 is a more than fair price. If you are interested, give me a call or text and we can go from there. REDACTED"

	Taurus Security System (TSS)b
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

Sent about 100 rounds down range testing it out and found it be extremely accurate, soft shooting, and easy to carry. This pistol is fully ambidextrous, has a bunch of safety features (but no external trigger safety), has a rail, is mfg approved for +P ammo, and holds 8+1 rounds in a slender single stack. IMHO, it's the most ergonomic, reliable, and accurate 9mm semi-auto in its size. All in all, it's a fun gun and perfect for concealed carry.

This particular PPS includes the 7 and 8 round extended grip factory magazines, all original materials (including unfilled out warranty card), an added new limbsaver grip, and a 25 round box of Critical Duty ammo. It really is a sweet gun, just feels a little too easy to shoot as after some soul searching I've decided I'd rather have a revolver with more firepower.

The SIG SAUER® P232® is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.

I've carried this almost daily for the last 3 or 4 months and it has about 200 rounds through it...enough to ensure it was 100% reliable.

I painted the sights with red enamel paint since the stock black sights are terrible, this helps incredibly with low light acquisition.  I also added an aftermarket belt clip, which is high quality spring steel and has held up really well.

Included is an extra 6 round magazine and 119 rounds of FMJ.

I'm asking $385 for everything, which I feel is a great price including the extras and the pristine condition."

For those of you who want to tell me my price is too high, save your typing fingers; here is my response to a previous intelligence-impaired individual.....
""Wow,
They do say that the uneducated are the first ones
to embrace a communist economic system. I guess you are living proof.
Here in the US, our system in based on Capitalism. That means....
Acquire your goods or services for as low a cost as possible...
then sell them for what price, demand dictates. Free economics vocabulary lesson for ya, 
it's called..... ""Supply & Demand"". Gee, do you think that Wal-Mart buys ammo for the same price it sells to the public? Nope, in fact if you are upset at my mark up, you would lose the last brain cell you had if you knew theirs:) Here's something else to make your head spin....
Have you ever bought something on sale, Buy-1-Get-1 Free?....Ya know, the thing that Publix does all the time? Stop and think a minute... They are selling that item to you for half of what you paid last week.... AND they are still making a profit off you:) So, that means that when that item is not on sale, you are paying more than twice what they paid for it. The figure is usually around 4 times. 
So, I guess what you are telling me is that when you bought your
house last year for $50,000 and your neighborhood became really popular... and your
 house is now valued @ $100,000. You, are going to put it on the market for $50,000!
Of course you wouldn't. So, my little commie friend.... either understand that it just 
upsets you that you either do not have the means, brains, or resources to purchase ammo at a reduced rate......OR MOVE TO CHINA. Cause that's where people think that everyone
should make the same thing, and everything should cost the same thing. 
As for your tort about the unemployed.... I wonder how I have so much to invest in ammo???? 
Again, another ode to your superior intelligence. 
I hope when you get over the anger of my sarcasm, you really will sit back and rethink the situation. For our country's sake.

Shoots well for 3.5"" 1911. I installed a non-permanent Kimber Recoil Spring assembly in place of the factory assembly, as I heard they work wonders for the gun. When i have shot it had no feeding problems, or recoil problems. Recoil is light, people say the shorter 1911's have more recoil, but this one dosent.

Only been shot a few hundred times probably, finish is good, its been maintained well, and no rust or other problems i could see.

Comes with
-Hogue Rubber grips, and separate elk horn grips
-Bianchi Holster, synthetic retention belt holster, and Synthetic mag holder
- (3) 7 round mags. 1 factory, 1 kimber, and 1 colt
- all original factory parts the gun came with."

The rifle is the highly acclaimed Czech version of the large ring 98 Mauser.  1938 date is stamped on the receiver crest which is not ground like many on this model.  The serial number is: E10129. The number on the bolt does not match the rifle, which is typical for the VZ 24.  The stock appears to have been refinished very nicely, there are very few dings and minor scratches in the finish, but no cracks and the wood has a very nice pattern with what appears to be an original type of oil finish.   

The rifle has both of the trigger guard capture screws, and there are no obvious missing screws or parts that I can see other than the cleaning rod.  The rifle includes a front sight hood, although it is not shown in the photos.  There no sling or bayonet included in this sale.

I have not shot this rifle, but the other 2 I have are great shooters, and neither has a bore this nice.  The bore is in very good shape, shiny with minimal pitting and well defined grooves, which is unusual for VZ 24s. The muzzle crown looks good and the rifle easily passes the ""bullet"" test with about 5 mm of bullet showing.  

The rifle is import marked on the right side of the front of the barrel in small letters.  No markings are peened.  The bluing is about 80% by my estimate.   

I've tried to describe the rifle to the best of my ability, but if you have questions or need to see more photos I can email them.  Armslist limits me to posting 3 photos.

Please contact me via email if you are interested.  I'm looking to do a FTF sale around the Winston-Salem area.  I can travel some if necessary to meet you."
