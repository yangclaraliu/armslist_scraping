Ruger 3604 SR22 Threaded Barrel 22 Long Rifle 3.5"" 10+1 Black Poly Grip & Frame

The Ruger SR22 pistol is the do-it-all .22 pistol for the shooter who
appreciates style and demands reliability. Packed with versatile features,
the SR22 pistol is lightweight (just 17.5 ounces) and perfect for just
about anything - plinking, target shooting and even small game hunting. It
is easy to field-strip, fun to shoot, and will reliably accept a variety of
ammunition (not just high-velocity). This is the threaded barrel version.   The barrel tip unscrews and the threaded barrel screws on (in package with wrench in the case photo).

LaRue Tactical PredatOBR™ 7.62 
The PredatOBR 7.62 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 7.62 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. 

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the supplied Roll-Bag and Tool Box. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.

PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/11.25 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.

The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.

The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system.

Suppressor Compatibility:
LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire.

About the “Black Gold” Trigger:
We are very proud to announce that we’ve selected the American Trigger Corporation AR Gold trigger to be installed in LaRue PredatOBRs going forward. These are a single stage trigger with take-up and a super short reset, similar in feel to a best-grade 1911 trigger, providing the optimum trigger action for a wide variety of shooting styles and disciplines. AR Gold Triggers have been used by some of the best competition shooters in the world for the last few years and dominate the top of the 3 Gun competition world. 

We have been testing and evaluating these triggers for well over a year, to ensure that they're up to our standard of quality. Our evaluation has shown the AR Gold to be magnificent and we're proud to include them as part of our new product line. One thing that is unusual about these triggers installed in our LaRue PredatOBRs, is they are treated with an IonBond black instead of American Trigger’s normal IonBond Gold. This is a custom color that is only available on LaRue Tactical rifles. These triggers will be standard in the LaRue PredatOBR in both 5.56 and 7.62 caliber."

816-888-GUNS

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement."

From LaRue's Website:

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

XTRAXN™ is a proprietary chamber feature added to reduce frictional forces caused by pressure-expanded cartridge cases bearing against chamber walls. Facilitates reliable extraction through a wide range of temperature / chamber pressure extremes. XTRAXN™ extends extractor life, while having no effect on the firearm's accuracy. All this, and it dovetails well with the OBR's world-famous accuracy.


Caliber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATO
Rifle Weight: 6.25 lb. (based on 16.1” barrel version, unloaded without optics)
Barrel Length: 16.1“
Barrel Material: Stainless Steel, Blackened.

The tactical rail attachment you see on it will not come with the gun. I bought it off ebay to try it out and it SUCKS! The weapon is stamped Detroit Police Department and is numbered 00453DPD. By law I will only sell to Ohio residents and if your record prohibits you from owning a weapon do not contact me. Like I said im a police officer which means it would not go good for you. Other LEOs to the front of the line.

Obviously, they do not have a life, so they wait at Wal-Mart, purchase the ammo and try selling it for double the price.  Do your homework before you buy ammo here. Take the initiative and go to Wal-Mart yourself. Many websites are selling ammo cheaper than these Wal-Mart flippers. Many of these sellers do not own pistols.  Let them drown in their ammo; do not buy from them anymore. Use Google to search for cheaper ammo too. Call your Wal-Mart and speak to management, and if they do not do anything about it, call their regional managers. They will implement rules for ammo.

I put a box of ammo through it and never had any issues and it is seriously accurate for a pistol you can carry in your pocket and just a really beautiful/cool piece. Comes with three holsters (shoulder rig is super comfortable and fits under a sweater/sweatshirt to where you can't even tell you're wearing it), and 125 rounds, (100 FMJ 25 Hornady Critical Def). Three sets of grips as well. Has cocobolo wood grips on it now and comes with two sets of plastic black ones. Really want a glock in 45acp, preferably a compact. Would go for a Warthog 45 as well. Really only interested in a 45acp weapon. However, I would consider a Judge or Tracker series revolver. S&W makes a 45acp revolver I wouldn't mind either. To make it a good deal for the right 45/or whatever I am also including a .22 revolver I took as trade. I took it to the range and it shoots great, but it's just not something I need so I will include it a trade IF the weapon offered is more valuable than my Walther package on its own. I have other items listed too so have a look and I am pretty easy about putting together a good deal for both parties. I can add cash if need be, but I think I'm pretty even on what I'm looking to trade for. Make offers, but don't be out of line with your values. I've done a dozen trades in the last month and so far everyone has gone away happy and the transactions were headache free so I'd like to keep that standard..."

So, this one is heading out the door. It is a RIA 1911 Commander size (4"" barrel). It has Pachmayr grips and a Wilson combat 8 rd magazine. The gun was cerakoted a grayish color and is missing both the front and rear sights (I assume they were lost when the cerakote was done). My LGS said it'd be $35-$40 to purchase sights and have them installed. The cerakote job is ok, not great. I've seen better and worse. The cerakote itself is actually pretty well done, it is smooth and even throughout, however, it looks like the slide was sanded a little before cerakoting so the RIA logo is not as dominant as it probably should be. 

This would make a great gun for someone who, like me, is looking to try out the 1911 platform without investing a ton of cash. I'm asking $400 OBO and have about 20rds of FMJ and 7 rds of hollow point I'll include with the gun. No box or docs."
