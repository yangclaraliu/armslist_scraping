It comes with 500 plus rounds of premium ammo, all factory fresh, no reloads. The price is for everything you see in the pictures, gun, original box an paperwork, 2 factory magazines and ammo.
Will not separate ammo its a package deal at $700 for everything, these long slide glocks are very hard to find and retail in excess of $600. The ammo alone is worth close to $300

I've come to the decision to sell one of the ARs in order to try something new (never had any ""battle rifle"" but my 5 ARs). It's a 16"" LW BCM midlength upper built on a Seekins Precision lower receiver I built using the following quality parts: 

Complete Lightweight 16"" BCM Midlength Upper Receiver Assembly 
BCM Bolt Carrier Group 
PSA Mil Spec Carry Handle 
Seekins Precision Forged Lower Receiver 
Daniel Defense Mil Spec Buffer Tube 
""H"" Buffer 
Daniel Defense QD Receiver End Plate 
Magpul MOE Stock 
Daniel Defense Castle Nut 
PSA LPK 
Magpul MOE Pistol Grip 
ALG Defense (Geissele) QMS Trigger 
Surefire 6p light (the lense is cracked however this does not affect light output at all) 
VLTOR Scout Mount (mounted to MOE rail section bolted to top of handguard) 
Furniture painted with Krylon (Paint is in great shape) 

This is a lightweight, outstanding handling rifle with everything necessary for a basic home defense, range, or class use. I built it back in May and haven't even put an entire magazine through it! I'd guess I've fired about ~20rds or so - I built it as a backup to a backup to a backup and it only made it to the range once in its short life. Overall it is in excellent condition as you'd expect for such a new rifle with a low round count - this is essentially a brand new carbine. The only caveat is that the Seekins lower was too tight to drop mags free when I got it - I filed inside the magwell a bit and now all my USGI mags drop free. 

$850 Face to Face. Willing to ship. Thanks!"

 Selling to but a nice Christmas present for my fiancÃ©.
150rd count exactly.
 Like any and all Arms or products, the finish is not the quality...in fact you'll see I'm my last pic how easily it scratches. I occasionally carried IWB appendix and my belt buckle scratched the top of the slide. That's the only defect in the whole gun though. The company has to cheap out somewhere when they sell sub $600 1911's and that's where they do it. This gun is a shooter, not a safe Queen or mantle piece. I've carried it the past month and put my life on it. Not a single malfunction in the 150rds I put through it.

E-RPC, LLC, is proud to introduce the REMINGTON MODEL 1911 R1 CENTENNIAL. The opportunity to own a commemorative pistol of this quality is rare and this model will only be available for a limited time. Since its adoption by the US Army on March 29, 1911, the M1911 pistol design has proven timeless. Remington's experience with the pistol design started under the UMC moniker just before the end of World War I. In 2010, more than 90 years later, E-RPC, LLC re-introduced the Remington Model 1911 R1 pistol to a new generation of handgun enthusiasts and collectors.

Need to sell this week!

For sale is a Mossberg 4x4 300 Win Mag - Walnut stock.  I got the gun to bring out west this fall and also used it for this year's deer season two days.  So far I am two for two with it, it can't miss!!!  Has a total of 12 shots through it.  Awesome gun, looks beautiful, expert woodwork involved in it.  The fluted barrel takes some of the weight away fromt he barrel and allowes it to cool faster.  The muzzle break definitely takes some of that sting away from your shouldner.  I would say that it doesn't feel like you are shooting much more than a 270 or 30-06, but you are!  The detachable box magazine is nice too.

Rifle has permanent muzzle break(trust me you need it on this), 3-9 power scope, and over two boxes of ammo to go with it.  Still remaining with the ammo is the rest of the Hornady SST Superformance, great stuff, normally $40/box.  Then one box of Remington CoreLokt Ammo, and one box of Winchester Power Max.  48 rounds in all.  (ammo at purchase price from Walmart was $59 for two full boxes and $16 for remaining Hornady rounds.

No cosmetic problems or mechanical problems, gun is NEW minus 12 shots.  It is currently sighted in to 1 MOA at 100 yards.

Purchase price for A Mossberg maple rifle on the main buds website is $459 and does not have a scope or any ammo to go with it.  Buds is where I purchased originally from.

Selling for $425obo.  Please make offers if you have a .308 you think we could work into a trade.  I figured the ammo adds $75 in cost, plus the scope of roughly $50, and you not having to pay taxes or any transfer fee, makes it still a bargain for almost a brand new gun

I dont' want to ship this item but will at buyers expense.  Buyer must present WI DL before the sale transaction and must be willing to sign a bill of sale taking ownership."

FTF in the Denver metro area. Bolt carrier group and charging handle not included. Here are the specs from BCM's website.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for todayâs infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.
T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.
USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for itsâ superior ballistics.
Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets itsâ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.
Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960âs was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.
Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.
5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.
Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.
Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.
HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

This rifle has never been fired and includes factory box. 

This is the very desirable, nearly impossible to find new, very limited edition Remington Model 700 200 year anniversary of Eliphalet Remington in 30-06 with a 22"" barrel made in 1993 and carefully vault stored ever since. To celebrate the 200th Anniversary, Remington pulled out all the stops and fitted a collectors grade stock on this rifle in truly spectacular, ultra highly figured fiddleback maple finished in unstained natural maple high gloss finish with a Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, generous skip line cut checkering both on the pistol grip and for end, black caps on the for end, pistol grip and on the butt stock which wears the Remington logo. 

The pictures simply can't show the true beauty of the wood. The stock has a 3D, holographic effect to the exquisite fiddleback grain as you look at it from different angles. The rifle includes a Leupold Vari X II 3-9x40 scope. Being a Model 700 BDL it has the factory Remington open sights installed with the front having a removable hood and the rear being adjustable for windage and elevation. The magazine has a hinged floor plate that has a gold filled etching paying homage the 200th anniversary of the company's founder and the metal work has a rich, deep blue gloss finish which looks superb with the gorgeous maple stock. Also, note that this rifle does NOT have the silly locking bolt shroud as some later 700's do. As you would expect on a NIB rifle there is no wear on the bolt face."

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVRâ¢ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver.

This gun is super clean and has only had approximately 200 rounds thru it.  This is a fantastic shooting gun and retails for over $1400 without any extras.  This is a Custom Shop which means it has all the bells and whistles.  I put a set of Wilson Combat grips on the gun but it will also come with the original factory grips.  It came with one factory mag but I have three total that will go with the gun.  The gun is priced to sale fast so don't hesitate to call or text.  REDACTED
