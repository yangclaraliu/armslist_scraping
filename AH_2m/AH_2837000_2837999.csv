The knife is new having never been used but does have very slight wear from being taken in and out of the sheath. 

Featuring the most technically advanced handle ever engineered on a combat knife, the Gerber Silver Trident is the brainchild of William Harsey, Jr. and Chief Watson--a founding member of Navy Seal Team 2. Resistant to heat, UV light and chemicals, the handle is a co-mold of two versions of the material called Hytrel. Inside there's a rock-hard version for strength, while the exterior offers a soft, textured version for extreme grip control. Use the stainless steel butt cap as a hammer.

The double-edged clip point blade is constructed of 154C stainless steel, and heat-treated to achieve a hardness rating of HRC 59-61. That means you get excellent edge retention, strength and flexibility. The non-reflective black blade limits glare and corrosion. The Silver Trident's blade measure 6.18 inches, and it has an overall length of 11.22 inches and a 17.4-ounce weight. It comes with a sheath made of durable ballistic nylon. Backed by a limited lifetime warranty.

The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement. Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Available in a number of powerful calibers, the PX4 Storm is a handgun that will keep delivering premium Beretta performance even after years of hard use. 

Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.

I three brand new Ruger LCR 357 (model# 5450), just came in about an hour ago.

These are hard to get, most places (including distributors) are sold out.  I was lucky that my rep saw I had searched for one the other day (for a customer) and called, asking me if I wanted one.  He said they'd probably be sold out within the hour.  I just checked, he was right; out of stock again.

It's a .357 mag (can also shoot .38 special), made with Stainless Steel but Ionbond Diomondblack finish (black in color), hammerless, 1.875"" barrel, Hogue Tamer Monogrip.  MSRP is $599.  I'm selling them for $498 (and that's with a very low margin on my part).

It has a full 16"" barrel and is chambered in .223. This rifle will include (5) 30 round mags, (3) 40 round mags, and a factory STEYR soft case to put everything in.


A little history,
This Aug A3 was made by Sabre Defense Industries from late 2008 until October of 2010 from parts kits made by Steyr in Austria and imported into the United States. There were approximately 3000 AUG A3's made by Sabre starting with serial number 1USAXXX all the way up to a possible 1USA999, then started 2USA001 and so on. In 2010 Sabre got into legal trouble with the ATF which resulted in a raid and seizure of all the remaining parts kits, they were sent back to Steyr. Long story short in August of 2012 Sabre started making A3's again starting with 3USAXXX but this time with the famous Tulip flash hiders. 3USAXXX is where Sabre ends their time with the A3. Number set 4USAXXX is when Vltor got the contract from Steyr and started making the Aug A3's and I think they are still making them today. This Aug I am selling is a low serial number, was made by Sabre and it is number 1USA532. so the 532nd AUG A3 ever made. I thought that was pretty cool, anyways here it is for sale.

I will attach a picture below of the 1USAXXX A3 rifle since the 2 and 3 number sets are different. If you have any questions feel free to email me and thank you for looking."

The Lower has only ever been hand cycled and was built in pistol configuration before being converted to a rifle, so you can remove the stock and put an upper on it that is less than 16"" legally, as long as the stock is removed! It is in rifle configuration now but you DO NOT have to use a pistil buffer tube to convert it back to pistol config. It has never been fired, other than dry-fired to check function and mated to an upper to check fit... It is TIGHT. This deal also comes with 10 MOE Pmags, bran new, all but one of them are still sealed in their packaging... the one that is open was just used to check the lower's function. I will throw in a 50cal ammo can, which is also bran spankin new!

-Lower is multi-cal compatible, marked for safe/fire. Has PSA logo. NOT a blemished lower. 
-mags drop free as they should.
-Built as a pistol first, listed as ""other"" on FFL.
-LPK is NOT the PTAC model, it is their higher-end phosphate coated LPK.
-Has MOE trigger guard and Blackhawk pistol grip
-6-pos stock and mil-spec buffer tube and buffer.
-Trigger breaks at a clean and crisp 5lbs
-Safety selector is very positive and smooth, not gritty and sloppy like 90% of the cheepo brands.

Price is FIRM. I am only selling this because I bought several when the prices were low(ish) but I have decided I need to finish other projects. I see a whole lotta price jacking going on so I am going to be 100% upfront about this deal; I paid $250 (not including shipping and FFL fee) for just the parts and lower and $150 for the mags and ammo can! This is your chance to snag a good deal. As you can see, I am not making any money... I am loosing money in fact. Shipping, Tax, and FFL fee was about $40 iirc."

Not trying to get rich, just make a little money and not be a jerk while doing it.

I three brand new Ruger LCR 357 (model# 5450), just came in about an hour ago.

These are hard to get, most places (including distributors) are sold out.  I was lucky that my rep saw I had searched for one the other day (for a customer) and called, asking me if I wanted one.  He said they'd probably be sold out within the hour.  I just checked, he was right; out of stock again.

It's a .357 mag (can also shoot .38 special), made with Stainless Steel but Ionbond Diomondblack finish (black in color), hammerless, 1.875"" barrel, Hogue Tamer Monogrip.  MSRP is $599.  I'm selling them for $498 (and that's with a very low margin on my part).

I am fine with you profiting reasonably on you scarce commodity to save me the hassle of scrounging for a little bit at a time going from store to store.
All of that said, prices are trending downward so I'm not looking to pay $50+ per brick or $.10 per round for cheap bulk ammo.  I don't want to drive all over the Metro Detroit area for a brick at a time either.  I am located in north Oakland county.  How far I'm willing to drive depends on the quantity, price and quality of your ammo.  
I have cash ready to go.  I will show up when we agree, where we agree and conduct a simple easy transaction.  If you've sold much through armslist, you know that is much less common than it should be - there are a lot of wishy-washy people out there.  I won't waste your time if you don't waste mine.

It delivers multiple-shot capacity with match rifle accuracy at extended ranges. In addition to the M24's unsurpassed accuracy, it also offers reliability and durability under the harshest conditions of combat use and transportation.

Designed for and used by the United States Military, the M24's popularity also stretches from SWAT teams nationwide to International Military and Government agencies. Based on Remington's legendary Model 700™ and 40-X™ rifles, famous for their ""out of the box"" accuracy, the M24 has quickly gained a reputation for precision among the sniper system community. An essential element in the M-24's accuracy is its heavy, hammer-forged, stainless steel, Rem-Tough powder-coated barrel. The barrel's unique 5-R rifling delivers combined advantages of reduced bullet deformation and metallic fouling, even pressure curves, higher bullet velocities and longer barrel accuracy life. The M-24's H-S Precision® aramid fiber-reinforced, fiberglass stock with an aluminum bedding block, is utilized for exceptional strength and dimensional stability in all weather conditions. Combined with its sophisticated sighting options, the M-24's Sniper Weapon System remains the standard against which all sniper systems are compared.

They have chips and scratches to the saya or wooden scabard but the hand folding in the steel blade is beautiful. One is an naval officer's sword the other is a so called heirloom sword; made for a middle class family that didn't inherit a sword. It has hand painted flowers on the saya and decorative work on the blade. Swords of this type sell for thousands when in perfect condition and properly marked. I haven't and won't damage the rayskin on the handles to take the swords apart to see the markings on the full tang of the blade. I sold the other swords for over five hundred dollars a piece 6 years ago. These two went in storage. They have dings and dents to the saya and are aged if beautiful works.

MAG5-60

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

The original 30"" bird barrel has a noticeable amount of exterior rust (from Dumbass last owner who barely touched it for most of those years he owned it but at some point managed to not oil the exterior of the the barrel while it was in storage) but is fully functional with a good looking bore. Also included is a Remington 20"" blued w/rifle sights (matches perfectly but only chambered for 2 3/4), purchased along with the gun all those years ago by original owner, in the same shape as the rest of the firearm, beautiful. The high end wooden furniture is also in great shape besides a self installed sling stud and a small mark from the sling hardware just bellow it. Unfortunately we can thank the previous owner for this as well. Fit and finish is superb as you would expect from a hand fitted 870 built by Remington when craftsmanship made a difference (Before it was bought by Cerberus and became part of ""the freedom group"" and all QA went out the window). Built with a steel trigger guard and safety, I also have a set of Brownell's Anti-walk pins currently installed but will supply the original trigger pins as well. Being a 83' as mentioned it is pre ""flexi-tab system"" but can easily be converted with the parts kit from Brownells or Remington. All Wingmasters are hand fit and finished, you can tell the difference as soon as you pick it up (especially if you've handled your share of more recent express models). It really is a thing of beauty. Please don't contact me trying to convince me this is an old beater. Please only serious inquires. I would appreciate selling the gun to another 870 enthusiast who will appreciate it like i do. I can provides picks or info to any serious inquirer. Please feel free to contact me with any questions."

893,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2837893,For Sale:  Henry Rifle 45/70,"Hope Hull, Montgomery, Alabama",$ 695,"Listed On: Thursday, March 20, 2014",Rifles,Henry Repeating Arms                                                                                ,45-70 Government                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Introduced by the U.S. Army in 1873, this cartridge was first known as the .45 Government. As it made its way into commercially produced firearms the name .45-70 appeared, because it was loaded with a 70 grain blackpowder charge with 405 and 500 grain bullets. Virtually all rifle making companies of the late 19th century chambered their single shots and lever actions for the .45-70. As those companies and their rifles faded away, the .45-70's popularity did not. Factory .45-70 ammunition has been cataloged continuously since 1873 but never in the variety of loadings available now, in the 21st century. They range from 405 grain lead bullet, low-velocity loads for deer hunting and target shooting to high-velocity 300 to 400 grain jacketed bullet ones meant for large game.

Our new Model H010 .45-70 can handle them all. Its receiver is blued steel fitted with an 18.43"" round barrel underneath and a tubular magazine of four-round capacity. Its pistol-grip buttstock and steel-capped forend are crafted of beautiful American walnut and cut with checkering to provide a sure grip. The buttstock wears a soft rubber pad to help shooters handle .45-70 recoil from a 7.08 lb. rifle. The model H010 will be factory issued with XS Ghost Ring rear peep sight with blade front. Because the receiver is drilled and tapped, scope mounting is an easy option.

If you need a handy yet powerful lever gun capable of fast repeat shots in the bear country of Alaska, or just a short, light rifle for deer hunting in the mountains of Pennsylvania, our new Model H010 will provide the accuracy and reliability you can count on."

A favorite of law enforcement professionals for duty and even more popular for concealed carry, the KIMBER Pro Carry II has a variety of options and features that cover every need from concealed carry home defense to in-service patrol.

The Tacoma, WA P.D. extensively tested the Pro Carry models finding them to be the most dependable firearm put through the paces in over 20 years.

Why settle for second when you can OWN THE BEST!?! The Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. This device is an integral part of the firearm and therefore, cannot be lost. This same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems alike (two keys come with each gun). A long-standing tool for defense that has passed the test of quality.
