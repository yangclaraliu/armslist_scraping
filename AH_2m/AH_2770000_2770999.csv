CZ USA 455 American Bolt-Action .22lr Rifle, 20.5″ Threaded Barrel, Walnut Stock, Detachable Magazine, No Sights- CZ 02167

The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire. The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation. The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.

Product Description

The Magpul MAG471 STR (Storage/Type  Restricted) is a drop-in replacement buttstock for carbines using  commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A storage-capable version of the  CTR, the STR has improved cheek weld and two water resistant battery tubes on a  compact, reinforced polymer A-frame design. A shielded operation lever and  supplemental friction locking system prevent accidental operation and minimize  excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. The  STR incorporates two integral sling loops, a reversible push-button QD sling  mount, and a replaceable 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder  purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

Hard to find and if you do they will come with the cheap china made sheaths not the better blackhawk sheathe they used to come with. This one comes with the blackhawk . 


From Gerber webste :

The Silver Trident is more than a symbol of Americas top Special Ops personnel. Its living proof that guys who handle our nations nastier chores will go through whatever kind of hell is necessary, so long as they have the best gear.


The Silver Trident has the most technically advanced handle ever engineered on a combat knife. Its resistant to heat, UV light and chemicals. The brainchild of William Harsey, Jr. and Chief Watson—a founding member of Navy Seal Team 2—the handle is a co-mold of two versions of the material called Hytrel. Inside, there's a rock-hard version for strength. Outside, there's the soft, textured version for extreme grip control. Use the stainless steel butt cap as a hammer.


The double-edged clip point blade is 154C stainless steel, heat-treated to achieve a hardness rating of HRC 59-61. That means you get excellent edge retention, strength and flexibility. The non-reflective black blade limits glare and corrosion.


It's just a damn awesome knife! Great for survival or SHTF, although it was made for another purpose.

I'm asking $140, which is fair, OBO



Thanks for looking!"

High Standard Model 200

Interesting Facts about the J.C. Higgins model 20:

This is a very interesting shotgun. It was designed by Frederick L. Humeston who was an engineer at Winchester before moving to High Standard. (Humeston was the primary designer of the M1 Carbine.) The patent for his pump-action was assigned 1/2 to High Standard and 1/2 to Sears. The J. C. Higgins Model 20 sold by Sears predated all High Standard shotguns based on this design by several years, so it's really inaccurate to refer to the Model 20 as a ""High Standard Model 200,"" as is often seen on the Internet. It's also been reported that the Model 20 was based on a Remington patent. This is clearly not the case.

If you compare the detailed drawings in the Humeston pump-action patent (No. 2476196) with those of C. C. Loomis at Remington for what would become the Model 31 as well as those for the Winchester Model 12, it's easy to see that Humeston was trying to integrate the best features of both of these guns in his design. It's no wonder many who have Model 20s (or later High Standard pumps based on the same patent) claim they have the slickest actions of any pump they've ever handled. With the Model 20, you've got the love-child of the Model 12 and Model 31.

The Higgins model 20 is a well built gun. It's an all steel receiver; walnut wood and the barrel screws into the receiver. If you are looking for a good hunting gun it will last you a lifetime or more. Most only shoot 2-3/4"" shells though. It was made by High Standard and is good quality.

High Standard began making shotguns for Sears Roebuck in the late 1940s. In 1960, High Standard began marketing shotguns under their own name and the approximately 200 models in the following listing are derived from the High Standard catalogs and price lists of that time. A redesign of the shotgun line occurred with new models introduced in 1966. In 1973, High Standard introduced their new ""Trophy Line"" of shotguns and this marked a change in catalog numbers from the number beginning with the numeral 8 to the number beginning with the numeral 6. At this time the previous catalog numbers were referred to as the ""Regular Line"". Some regular line guns were cataloged in 1973, but this was the last year for them except the Police models. The 12 gauge pumps in the Trophy line were the guns which had interchangeable barrels. Serial numbers began appearing on the High Standard shotguns during middle to late 1967. Beginning about 1958, many of the shotguns had a two letter date code.

Additionally, there are over 150 catalog numbers for both semi-auto and slide action shotguns not listed here which represent models with High Standard markings but with special roll marking or other features which High Standard produced for several large distributors. Many of these distributor specials had their own model names which included Point Right, Pointer, Bird wing, NATO Pintail Field Classic Mallard Model 200 (J.C. Penney 20 ga. semi-auto), Model 220, and Sport Deluxe. These distributor label guns are not listed in the following data.

The choke markings used by High Standard are: * Full, ** Modified, *** Improved Cylinder, and **** Skeet Bore. Cylinder Bore has no mark."

This knife has never been carried nor used to cut anything.  I'm basically just looking to get back out what I paid for it as it's just been sitting in the safe since I got it a couple months ago.  

This particular knife is a perfect specimen of a Para 2: perfectly centered blade, no sticky lock, perfect lockup, and drop free blade when unlocked.  This knife still has the factory edge as it was basically taken out of the box for inspection, put back in the box, then locked in the safe.  These knives are hard to come by so I ordered a couple duplicates to the one I regularly carry when I was lucky to find one.  This knife comes with the original box.  Made in Golden, CO, USA.

From the manufacturer’s web site:

This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't

The zero resetting feature is very unique and useful.After you get this scope set up and dialed in(on target)you just loosen the allen screws on top of the turrents and reset them to zero then lock them back down.Now when you need to make any windage or elevation adjustments you start from zero and return to zero for your original settings.

The colt pocket has a 5"" barrel.  It has all matching serial #s including wedge. loading lever, and cylinder.  The pistol has most of the silver left on the brass frame and the gun shows little use.  However, the cylinder does not turn when cocked (may be a simply fix from an experienced gunsmith. The cocking of the hammer works perfectly.  It addition, the pistol has a rough place on the barrel as shown in the pic (I have not attempted to clean).  The bore looks very clean with rifling.  The flask also is in good condition but has a rough spot on it as well.  Otherwise, it is in good condition.  It has a very low serial # 29XXX.  The bullet mold has Colts Patent but it is very faint.  It also has 31 PK on the side of the bullet mold.  The cap tin appears to be a reproduction but looks good with the set.  The box looks very old but has a couple of issues.  There is a split in the wood on the back near the latch as seen in the pics.  Also, the latch does not close.  This is an extremely good looking set but has a few issues and therefore is priced considerably fair."

We had quite a few of these on backorder for sometime, but have been selling them quickly since they've started coming in . We are FFL licensed and this is factory new in box, unfired gun. I have included the factory listed features below. But to put it in perspective, these are 5.56/223, piston driven guns, making them cleaner running and more reliable than regular direct impingement ARs. But they do accept all AR mags, muzzle breaks, QD slings and any rail mountable accessories. They also give you the ability to switch calibers. And with an overall length of 26.1"", this is the smallest rifle you can own without a tax stamp, yet it still has an extremely accurate 16"" cold hammer-forged 1/7 twist chrome lined barrel. The price is $1850 cash, which is cheaper than most are asking on these used, when you can find them. We are located in Stanfield, NC and all local, state and federal laws apply. We can also ship these to a local FFL dealer if that is needed. Partial trades will also be considered. Please contact me with any interest as soon as possible, these won't last long.

This came off a 7x57 mm gun.  The finish is quite good - a few minor small dings from a wartime gun of this age, but nothing that affects the utility of the stock - could be restored very nicely or customized for a sporter.  Original finish with no sanding, hairline crack in the top handguard which has been glued, overall good condition. There are no other cracks or splits.  As best as I can tell thru 85 years of military finish, the stock is walnut, but I’m having to guess. No ramrod or cleaning rod, but the stock has all the other metal hardware that these stocks are issued with, and as far as I can tell, it’s original. The metal parts are not rusty, and many retain their original bluing.

Note that this is the ‘green’ label ammo (online forums report that there is also a yellow version). It is also collected by some.

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semi automatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
