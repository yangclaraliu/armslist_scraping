The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."

""Vyatskie Polyany Machine-Building Plant MOLOT""  VEPR 
The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F).
VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market
The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope.
All VEPR rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory""

This is not a ""square back"", this is a Version 1 slant back receiver 
will handle up to 200grn ammo, (it is EXTREMELY accurate with 174grn MATCH ammo)
Rifle has TWO factory 5rnd maga zines and ONE 10rnd magazine
the ""pinned"" barrel thread protector has been removed for easy installation of a muzzle brake. (standard 14x1 LH)
also have scope mount and rings.

The gun has worked flawlessly, i clean it after everytime I take it out shooting.  The only issue is it fell right when i got it and hit a few empty casings.  There are 2 scratches on the slide.  They are not into the metal, just through the coating.  My local gunsmith told me he could re-blue it with out having to strip it and it would cost $30.  so nothing major.

It is complete except I ran out of braces at the very back gate panel so you will need no more than 4 more braces ( if you decide to use the 3rd gate but if you just want the 6x6x28, it is all there and complete ) but are cheap at menards, etc...there is a slight bend in one of the frames but can be fixed or add a small piece of chain link or left as is, my dog never bothered it, I always see free chain link on craigslist.

I can help load into your pickup or trailer if needed as they are all 6x4 or 6x6 or 12x6 panels.

This is the parkerized model with original low profile sights and full checkered wood grips.  It was slightly used when I obtained it last year.  It looked like it had never been fired but the previous owner claimed he put 200-500 rounds through it.  I've put about 150-200 rounds through it since I purchased it.  I replaced the recoil and sear springs with new Wolff factory weight springs.  I don't like the short GI trigger so I replaced it with a long Harrison Design & Consulting solid black trigger to match the finish.  Trigger pull is now fantastic and rivals my old Kimber Custom.  I replaced the extractor with a tuned Ed Brown version and feeding and extraction are robust.  The feed ramp has been lightly polished as it did have some rough machining marks in it.  Feed angle and barrel/ramp gap were not altered.  Overall finish is excellent.  Comes with one original 7 round magazine and one blackened stainless Chip McCormick 8 round Power Mag and plastic case.  For $30 more I'll include the BladeTech IPSC competition pack consisting of a configurable holster and double mag pouch.  Feel free to ask questions.

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic
advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the
best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with
full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger
pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger
gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911
will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and
right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available
separately. The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938
will be available in five configurations.

Great gun, I just have too many. Comes with one magazine. 

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

The Model 845 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

PMAG 30 M3 w/ Dust Cover

Magpul is pleased to announce the latest additions to the PMAG family: the PMAG 30 M3. Like its predecessors, the PMAG 30 M3 is a lightweight 5.56 x 45 NATO / .223 Remington 30-round polymer magazine for the AR15/M16 platform, but with a number of new features which improve its durability, compatibility, and overall performance for the most demanding professional shooters. By combining the knowledge gained from years of PMAG production, extensive research and development of materials and manufacturing processes, and incorporating feedback from a broad range of end-users, the PMAG 30 M3 pushes the envelope of magazine performance one step further.

The PMAG 30 M3 features a corrosion-resistant stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower, pop-off Impact/Dust Cover, and easy tool-less disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Low-profile ribs and aggressive front and rear texture provide positive control of the magazine while helping ensure compatibility with common double and triple magazine pouches. The easy to disassemble standard flared floorplate provides drop protection and aids extraction from magazine pouches, but can be replaced by a PMAG Ranger Plate for improved handling, or the new M3 Slim-line floor plate to minimize bulk (not included). A paint pen dot matrix (click here for marking guide) has been added to the bottom panel of the magazine body for easy marking by the end user for magazine identification."

 This stuff is amazing! Not only did I get a 1 and 1/4"" grouping shooting 50 rounds rapid fire with a pair of BX-25 magazines at 50 yards, but more importantly, I DID NOT HAVE A SINGLE MALFUNCTION! Unlike other 22 ammo, this stuff is made for semi-autos and the powder is much cleaner. It does not cover the bolt and action in a very gritty carbon residue causing stoppages. 
 Sure, there were a couple fliers, and I pulled a couple, but raggedy holes was the rule of the day! And this was done with a stock 10/22 with a cheap simmons fixed 4X scope!

Only 4,000 were imported into the US.  This rifle was unfired until a few days ago.  I shot 20 rounds of brass case non-corrosive ammo in it to see how I liked it.  The trigger is better than the legendary G2 triggers and the gun is a smooth accurate shooter.  That being said I have a gotten the bug for a bullpup or maybe a nice AR.  I do not ship and only do face to face transactions.  Will meet in the DFW area.
