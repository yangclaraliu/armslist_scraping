 FROM REMINGTON:
 Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time â the Model 870â¢ â the new Model 887â¢ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLoktâ¢ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

 Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether thatâs barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when itâs time for action, our revolutionary SuperCellâ¢ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

 Key Features:
 Action design based on the venerable Model 870â¢ â ultra-smooth and reliable 
 Rugged ArmorLoktâ¢ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces 
 SuperCellâ¢ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54% 
 Our softest-shooting pump gun ever 
 Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics 
 Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably 
 Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 
 28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes 
 Sling swivel studs built-in

Condition: New

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color. 
Made in U.S.A.

These are incredibly rare and hard to find. As a pre-ban it is one of a very limited number of  H&KS in the country which are eligible to be converted to full auto assuming you're willing to jump through the legal hoops and pay the cost to complete the conversion. What makes this rifle even more rare is that it comes with a factory installed ambi safety (almost unheard of) and also a shell deflector. These were never included in standard production, so the fact that they are factory  OEM parts makes this rifle a real one of a kind. This rifle had been professionally assessed by a well respected Knoxville gunsmith and is certified as all original parts and also in 90-95% condition. The rifle also has a collapsible stock rather than the fixed stock as well as fully operational sights peeps for zeroing at 100, 200, 300 and 400 yards. Book value on this rifle easily exceeds $3,000 and I have turned down a cash offer in that amount. This .308 is a true battle rifle and kicks like a mule - this is not a plinker or a good choice as al first rifle. Experienced shooters will appreciate this rifle, inexperienced shooters will regret the purchase / trade. If you have a serious interest in working a sale / trade on this rifle I would be happy for you to have it assessed by your own gunsmith prior to the transaction."

What is Kydex?  Kydex is a thick plastic that when molded to something will retain that shape forever, unless it is heated to extreme temperatures again.  So basically, the holster/sheath you receive will always fit your gun, magazine, or knife, and with normal use and wear and tear, will last a lifetime.  It is flexible to an extent and can take a beating and keep on working for you.



IWB (Inside the Waistband) carry holsters starting at $45 and OWB (Outside the Waistband) starting at $55.  We can make it for the small of back, appendix carry, and anywhere in between.  We also can make any OWB holster with a light/laser attachment.  Does your gun have a threaded barrel, no problem, we can accomodate that as well.



Magazine holsters starting at $35 for single, and $45 for double.  These can be made for IWB or OWB.  We also have AK and AR magazine holsters for $45 each.



Need a new sheath for your knife, no problem, we can do that as well.  Knife sheaths start at $25 and go up from there depending on the size of the knife and options.



We can even make holsters for your tactical flashlights, handcuffs, medical shears, and so much more. 



Lots of color options available, including some camo patterns. 


Shipping is $5, or if you are local to the Austin area we can meet up.



Contact us for guns available and any custom options you would like to add or have done.  You will always speak with me and I'm the one making your holster from start to finish, so you are guaranteed to receive exactly what you asked for.  I will even send you pictures of the progress if you'd like. 



You will receive a true custom holster, guaranteed, as no two holsters are alike!



Turnaround time is approximately 2-3 weeks, but most orders are going out within 2 weeks if not sooner.



You can call or text me at REDACTED, or email me at REDACTED with any questions or orders.

What is Kydex?  Kydex is a thick plastic that when molded to something will retain that shape forever, unless it is heated to extreme temperatures again.  So basically, the holster/sheath you receive will always fit your gun, magazine, or knife, and with normal use and wear and tear, will last a lifetime.  It is flexible to an extent and can take a beating and keep on working for you.



IWB (Inside the Waistband) carry holsters starting at $45 and OWB (Outside the Waistband) starting at $55.  We can make it for the small of back, appendix carry, and anywhere in between.  We also can make any OWB holster with a light/laser attachment.  Does your gun have a threaded barrel, no problem, we can accomodate that as well.



Magazine holsters starting at $35 for single, and $45 for double.  These can be made for IWB or OWB.  We also have AK and AR magazine holsters for $45 each.



Need a new sheath for your knife, no problem, we can do that as well.  Knife sheaths start at $25 and go up from there depending on the size of the knife and options.



We can even make holsters for your tactical flashlights, handcuffs, medical shears, and so much more. 



Lots of color options available, including some camo patterns. 


Shipping is $5, or if you are local to the Austin area we can meet up.



Contact us for guns available and any custom options you would like to add or have done.  You will always speak with me and I'm the one making your holster from start to finish, so you are guaranteed to receive exactly what you asked for.  I will even send you pictures of the progress if you'd like. 



You will receive a true custom holster, guaranteed, as no two holsters are alike!



Turnaround time is approximately 2-3 weeks, but most orders are going out within 2 weeks if not sooner.



You can call or text me at 512-350-9181, or email me at millertacticalgroup@yahoo.com with any questions or orders.

Grilling and Jim Beam are synonymous with sharing good times with family and friends. The same folks who enjoy Jim Beam are the same folks who use their grills to entertain at a weekend barbeque or just cook a special meal for their family. The new Jim Beam 4-Burner Stainless Grill gives you all the power and versatility you need for backyard grilling, and to share with family and friends.
Big enough to cook for 4-6 people with 696 square inches of grill space (493 square inches primary, and 203 square inches secondary), and a total of 61,000 BTU.
4 individually controlled main burners, aligned front-to-back, give you the versatility you need to grill over direct heat, or set up with indirect heat.
Burners are stainless steel tube-style, and each provide 12,000 BTU to give you the power you need for high-heat grilling.
Includes a 13,000 BTU side burner for added versatility.
Cooking grates are cast-iron; designed to give beautiful grill marks.
Hood is a double-layer design to hold in heat, with stainless steel on the outside, and aluminum plating on the inside. All of the burners are stainless steel as well, providing longer life.
Electronic ignition for easy start-up, and a handy temperature gauge, centered in the hood to give you âoven temperatureâ as opposed to grill temperature; enabling better control over longer cooking applications."

http://gunsupplyoutlet.com/magazines/96-glock-magazine-gen-4-glock-17-34-9mm-luger-17-round-polymer-black.html

This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. *Note, these do not come in the hard plastic packaging, but are brand new from the factory.
Made in Austria.

Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity. 

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load."

If a hands-free Night Vision Goggle System is what you need, ATN has the unit for you. Viper Night Vision Goggles are designed primarily to be a goggles system for hands-free application, but this unit can also be used as a compact monocular or for nighttime photography when attached to a camera. This high-resolution 1st Generation.+ Night Vision unit comes with 1x magnification, but can be optional 4x or 8x. Surprisingly, even though they gave the Viper a heavy coated glass lens, they were still able to keep its weight down to only nine ounces. For any activity which requires night vision and hands-free operation, the ATN Viper delivers superior results.

For all other trades please consider my Sig lists for over $1200 and is selling BNIB for about $1000. I have mine for sale for a reasonable price. Please do the same if you offer me a trade.

Looking for a couple of 10/22's for my boys and girls. ARs are always nice, I would absolutely love to own an AK, preferably a 47. No deer rifles please, I am also interested in antiques, especially Garands. No M1 Carbines though. Finaly, I have had my eye on those CZ .45s for a while, in fact any CZ, and for shotguns I would consider a nice O/U. I have a pretty good feel for valuing firearms so please don't waste either of our time if you are interested, other than that, feel free to shoot me an offer, worst I could say is no."

I have had at least 20 weird calls on this $130 gun. Maybe this info will help. It was one of the last units in the series and was made in mid to late 1977. They were discontinued after 1977. I have owned it for 20+ years. I have fired 173 rounds thru it in 20 years. Before that how can I know how many times it was shot?! Lordy!  The bore looks great and the rifle functions well. I WILL NOT fire it in the city of Madison to show you that it can make a boom. I will not drive 50 miles to show you a $120 gun. Lordy! I will not take paint, tires, paint brushes, magazines, bow and arrows, a leather coat on trade. That is just some of what has been offered. Lordy again! What it is, is a good older Winchester tube fed auto for 130 bucks....no let's make that ""120"" bucks. Some guys have even called 4, yes 4 times on this. If you have called please don't call anymore to discuss it. We are both busy I am sure.  It is only 120 bucks. make a decision.

I am considering selling/trading my ATI 1911, it is a great full size handgun and has only had 97 rounds through it. i just decided to look for something bit different. it does come with 1 8 round mag (which came with the gun), 300 rounds of factory loaded ammo, and one holster. the gun does have a ported barrel as well as an adjustable trigger and also has the tactical rail under the barrel. keep in mind i do not NEED to sell/trade this but i will respond and let you know if i deny your offer. Thanks!"

It is Pre-taurus, pre bolt safety and I have been told it is highly desirable.  They are extremely hard to find this age, in this condition, especially in this caliber.  Since the original owner purchased it, it has had a total of 50 rds (thats right -fifty) put through it.  It is extremely accurate and feels as though there is little to no recoil.  It has beautiful Brazilian hardwood furniture and the only wear on the gun is where the saddle ring sat.  Yes it even has a saddle ring!! 

These are spectacular firearms and of superb quality.  This one is old enough that it does not have the Interarms or puma stamps on it.  These go (when you can even find them) on gun auction sites for anywhere from $500 - $600 with many more rounds put through them.  From what I understand, these are great for cowboy shooting competition and once people have them they keep them.  I only contemplate selling it, because I have an AR itch.  If it is not the right price, I will hold on to it for my boys.  

It shoots great with either .357 or .38 special.
