We all love SBR's, but it's such an expensive pain in the rear to get one. But, they're just so damn cool, and unbelievably effective in close quarters scenarios. You could settle for a ""pistol"", but they're useless, and it just just looks neutered without a stock. This is the alternative, a Sig Sauer 556 with a 10"" barrel, and is equipped with the ""Sig Brace"" butt stock. EOTech is not included. This is NOT an NFA item, and transfers as a pistol, complete with an ATF letter attesting to it's legality. She accepts standard AR mags, and the chrome lined barrel has a proper twist of 1:7, with a long stroke, four way adjustable, piston gas system. The entire bolt assembly is nickel boron coated (NibX), negating the need for lubrication (I still always kept her lubed though). The long stroke piston offers a lower recoil impulse, as the piston is pushing the bolt back....instead of hitting it like a short stroke does. Basically it's a bastard crossbreed between an AR and an AK.  Why settle for one or the other, when you can have their bastard child? You will find the AR 15 style controls and accuracy to be very familiar, and the AK reliability to be very comforting.  I have shot this thing out to 300 meters, and consistently hit my target. With 62gr ammo, she groups about 1 1/2"" at 100. I changed the grip to a Hogue overmolded, and included is the stock grip, one steel magazine, and a steel Krinkov (AK 47) style muzzle brake. The original grip is designed for tiny European hands (it causes the top of your hand to dig into the selector). When detaching the flash hider to use a suppressor, I caused a scratch (easily and cheaply replaced) on the crush washer. She also has some normal scuffing behind the ejection port. This is simply caused by the ejected shells, and it does not run to bare metal. I've run around 100+ rounds, and she will eat anything. I have NEVER had ANY failures for this gun...EVER. $1,400, or best reasonable offer. I live in Rowlett, and will drive a little, but I'm not looking for a road trip.

This is a 1934 Tula that was all original when captured by the Finnish during the Winter War or Continuation War. What is interesting about this rifle is the tang date is '34 and the barrel date is 1934, which means the receiver and barrel are original to eachother. Something not common at all about the Finnish Mosin Nagants. The other interesting thing is ALL of the small parts about this rifle are Tula parts and the finish wear matches the rest of the rifle, so unlike most rifles the Finnish captured, they decided this one should stay as it is! It is not counter bored and the bore is mirror sharp! The other interesting thing is that the numbers all match on the rifle (RARE for a Finnish, almost unheard of) however the bolt does not match the rifle. BUT the bolt is all matching to itself and is imperial Izhevsk and the numbers are within 2,000 of the rifle's numbers. So I believe there was something wrong with the original rifle and the Finnish replaced it with a self matching bolt of the time. The stock on this rifle is absolutely stunning and is the best looking stock I have in my collection. The only reason I'm selling it is because I am getting into Mausers. 

I will ship this rifle if you have a C&R license or a FFL. I have 100% positive feedback on multiple sites including Gunbroker and Ebay so feel free to message me and I can prove that.

Stock # CSP COMM. Serial # 42xx. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings), this is a Colt Model 1878 with a 7 ½:” barrel, and a nickel finish, made in 1880, and chambered for .45 Colt. The Model 1878 was Colt’s first double action revolver, and it used the same barrels and ejector rods as the Colt SAA. Besides the nickel finish, the pistol has the original black hard rubber “Gutta Percha” checkered grips with the Rampany Colt logo, and it also has a lanyard loop on the butt. The pistol has Colt’s Hartford address on top of the barrel, the left side of the trigger guard is marked “45 CAL”, and the pistol’s serial number is on the butt, these are the only markings on the gun, and they are still fairly crisp and visible. The nickel may or may not be factory, a Colt Letter is really needed on this gun. The nickel is flaking off, and the grips are well-worn. The bore has small spots of frosting, but good rifling is visible. The double-action works fine, trigger pull is smooth, and overall condition is about 70%. Obtaining a Colt Letter should instantly add value to this pistol, especially if it turns out to be a Factory Nickel gun! We do not have any accessories for this gun.

The ring has been in the box since. I've decided to join the army but before I go I need to pay off a hefty speeding ticket I received a month or so ago. So not only will you be getting a heck of a deal on a ring but you'll help me get to where I need to be!

The ring is a 14k white gold ""Halo"" engagement ring. It has a .84ct white sapphire center stone with .45ct tw in smaller diamonds surrounding it. I paid 1100 for the ring/setting and 500 for the white sapphire. If you'd rather have a diamond you can get a diamond set in it instead. I have all paperwork and receipts to prove the info stated above and that I am the owner of the ring. 

I'm only asking 500$ OBO for the ring which is less then 1/3 the price I paid at Shane co at taylorsville/hurstbourne in louisville! I am open to offers and I need this gone by this weekend so I can pay my ticket on Monday and head to MEPS on Tuesday!

I am selling this because I need the money.  I did zero this sight indoors on a mid-length Noveske Afghan (low recoil).  That is the only thing keeping the sight from being new.  It has never been dropped, or been exposed to outside elements.  I am listing the sight for what I see them listed for online, even though they are all back ordered, even though i paid $2145.00 + tax, and I am including the bikini lens covers and a kill flash (which amount to another +/- $100).  These sights are going for $2200 to $2300 on Ebay (check completed auctions), but I would rather save someone the money and me the fees by selling it here.  Price is relatively firm and if you know what you are looking at, you will not scoff at the price...  I really need to sell, so I will look at trade offers but don't really need anything other than money.  Here is a description that I found on the internet:

ELCAN DFOV14-T1 FDE SpecterDR 1X-4X Dual Role 5.56 Optical Sight


Description

The ELCAN DFOV14-T1 Flat Dark Earth SpecterDR 1X-4X Dual Role Optical Sight is a limited release ELCAN Scope with only 500 units produced worldwide.

The ELCAN SpecterDR FDE/Tan 1X-4X Dual Role Optical Sight represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight, the SpecterDR switches instantly from a 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight with the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes.

Selected by USSOCOM for elite SpecOps mission, the SpecterDR™ dual role rifle sigh by ELCAN is reliable, amazingly bright and deadly accurate. Whether the mission calls for clearing a building or open-terrain patrol, SpecterDR™ gives you both fast acquisition and long-range target identification.

The unique locking lever mechanism brings you accurately back on target every time. The remarkably bright, clear ELCAN optics extend your daylight operations. Why risk yourself and the mission with red dot or fixed telescopic sights that do only half the job? Carry the one and only combat sight that switches between CQB and precision ranged fire mode - in the blink of an eye.

Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. In CQB mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry.

The 4x and CQB Reticles are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP. The SpecterDR offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

The Walther P-38 was designed by Carl Walther and first manufactured by Germany during WWII.  It was only supplanted for the Austrian armed forces by the venerable Glock 17, Gaston Glock's 17th design, and first forray into firearms.  The Walther P-38 has much in common with the Beretta 92.  There's comparison videos and articles that show this.  This is a great shooting gun, is aesthetically unique and iconic, and a nice piece of history.  This is a ""post-war"" model, made in 1968 in West Germany (based on stamps on the frame).  I hope you enjoy the firearm safely and responsibly."

872,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2394872,For Sale/Trade:  Stainless HK USP 45 V1 SA/DA w/Original Box & Manual,"Lake County, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 700,"Listed On: Saturday, November 30, 2013",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I'll probably regret selling this HK, but for sale is a very lightly used HK USP 45 Variant 1 with a stainless steel slide (probably the best looking USP ever made), right hand slide release, right hand safety/decocker, night sights (I put a short charge on them and they glowed in the dark), extended magazine release (I'll include the original release if you happen to be one of the 10 people on Earth who doesn't prefer the extended release) and a 12 round magazine.  That's 12+1 of 45 ACP stopping power in the ""little brother"" of the famous HK Mark 23/SOCOM.  This pistol is amazingly accurate (very nearly as accurate as my HK Expert 40), is exceptionally clean with almost no slide wear and has very little wear on the frame.  It comes with the original case and manual ( and it is the case with the ""In a world of compromise, some don't"" logo molded in, which pretty much sums up why you run HK pistols.)  

I've put less than 100 rounds through it and I can't imagine based on the internal slide wear it has had more than 500-1000 rounds through it total.  The floor plate on the mag is etched with part of the serial number, but you can get a new floor plate if you want.  It is a Variant 1, so you have a saftey/decocker and can carry this cocked an locked, if you want.  I run the LEM (DAO, really not a double-action, but no safety, no decocker) on the HK's I carry, but I wouldn't hesitate to carry a V1.  

The trigger reset is really good on this and the single action trigger pull is short, smooth and light.  (When I say really good, I mean that a professional operator could run this without an issue, might not be as short as they like, but it is great for 99.99% of shooter.)  The double action pull is good for DA, but you could drop in a match hammer spring and switch to the light trigger block spring if really wanted to get it down a bit more.   I'm not sure if you would want to put the light trigger return spring in this, I think it would be too light, but you could always try it.  I don't generally like DA pulls, so if I think it is good for DA, you will probably be fine.  (Yes, I am really discriminating about triggers and almost every pistol and rifle I own has had its trigger replace/adjusted/modified/smoothed.)

If you don't fully understand the last paragraph, I'll summarize it for you:  It has a really nice trigger.

So why am I selling it?  First, this is the only centerfire pistol I have that isn't 40S&W or .380 ACP and I reload lots of those two calibers, having to reload another caliber and stock it is just kind of a pain for me.  Second, it's a bit big for me to carry concealed, but I think there are a lot of guys who could conceal it just fine.  I'm also selling this to fund a short reset modification to one of my HK carry guns and the purchase of a single stack compact in 40S&W.  

Is $700 expensive?  
Compared to a Glock, yes.  Not for an HK USP 45 with a stainless slide in this condition.  If you are ok with compromises, buy a Glock, they are cheap and ok.

Ohio drivers license required, CCW preferred ( it's nice to know you have at least some level of trianing and hopefully won't have an AD from stupidity.)

Will I ship it?  
Maybe. If you demonstrate on the first email that you have your ducks in a row for shipping, know your state laws and you have an FFL that knows you by name ( by first name is even better.)  If you don't have an FFL that knows you by name, don't bother emailing me, I am not going to ship it to you.  ( Yes, my FFL knows me by first name.  Hell, you could just call him and tell him you need to ship an HK to him for a customer and his first call afetrwards would be to ask me what I was buying.)"
