That was the thought process behind the CW series of guns from Kahr. With all of the high quality engineering you'd expect from Kahr, these CW9s come in at a very desirable price point. 

The CW9 is double action only with an internal striker and browning locked breech design. The stainless steel trigger is exceptionally smooth throughout its 3/8"" ride from engagement to let off, with a crisp ""snap"" at the end. Kahr CW9s marry refinement with power. The polymer frame is checkered providing an incredibly positive purchase for your hands. All of these features incorporated into such a slim concealable package makes this weapon perfect for concealed carry. Call Brian at 704.3nine3.seven1two4

149,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2806149,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 54,"Listed On: Thursday, March 13, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=222

Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail"

This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when LWRC designed the SIX8 family of weapons, they started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, LWRC designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, LWRC designed the SIX8 platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8 family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8 rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge."

The rifle is fully converted to AK format other than it still has the original gas tube and Tapco Saiga handguard.  It accepts standard high-cap AK mags and the trigger was moved forward and replaced with a Tapco G2. Hogue pistol grip.The Rifle is fully 922r compliant. The entire finish was redone with black semi-gloss Duracoat and looks great.  Has not been used all that much – I would estimate is has at most 500 rounds through it and I have never used corrosive ammo and am diligent about cleaning after shooting.  This rifle shoots great – very smooth and accurate, especially for an AK. In my opinion, Saigas are some of the nicest AKs around.

1.	Red-dot optic with side mount
2.	Buttstock recoil pad
3.	AK sling
4.	10 rd magazine (I would throw in a 30rd but cannot due to high-cap mag ban in Colorado)

This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when LWRC designed the SIX8 family of weapons, they started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, LWRC designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, LWRC designed the SIX8 platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8 family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8 rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

I built this rifle for the purposes of self-defense and mid-long range hunting (Coyotes, prairie dogs etc…). It’ll be obvious when you see it that NO expense was spared. This weapon is by far the most versatile, deadly accurate rifle I have ever shot and I’ve been shooting my whole life. The following is the full list of parts that the rifle is composed of. I was very meticulous when I was assembling the parts.

Tough to get at the time, and still sort of is.
Full size Stainless SR1911 with all factory box, papers, parts, mags etc… As you get it when you buy it new. Fired it about 100 times, cleaned EVERY time, and put back in the safe. Never carried so there's no holster wear. Literally like new, not a scratch or mark on it.

This is the last of my 1911 herd, and my favorite of several mid - upper end 1911 platforms. I've had springers, RIA, limber, etc…. Ruger is the best BANG for the buck, so I held on to her the longest. My problem is my medium sized hands just don't fit the platform very well. Although they 1911's are awesome and I love them, I have finally faced the fact that I'd be better off with something more suitable for my hand or my wires even smaller hands :)

The 4516-1 is one tank if a 45 and finding one as clean as this might be a little tricky. I'm looking for $650 or possible trades on other quality handguns. I like Glocks, Sigs, Walthers, HK's and Smith and Wesson revolvers. If you have a $500.00 Glock you better have a $150-$100 bill to go with it unless you have extra mags and ammo to sweeten the deal. So with that being said, please no low ball offers. I know what these bring. And I also know that somewhere out there is a S&W collector that would love to add this to his/her collection.

The Marble's Game Getter is one of those delightful little gun oddities which, like Ithaca's neat little ""Auto-Burglar Gun,"" was almost legislated out of existence by the National Firearms Act of 1934 unless it has the 18"" or longer barrel.  There are two basic versions of the gun, the 1908 model and the 1921 model, both apparently designed by Webster L. Marble and Manufactured by the Marble Safety Axe Company, which became Marble's Arms & Mfg. Co, in 1911. The company still exists as CRR Inc./Marble's Inc. in Gladstone, Michigan, USA, and produces rifle sights and other gun specialties including the Poly-Choke device for shotguns.  (additional pictures are available.)  Item G-35627-18.

(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on CMMG LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a few brand new, factory fresh Magnum Research 17/22 .22LR Rifles! If you haven’t seen these in person, it’s time to. These are built from the ground up using a CNC-machined receiver, Ultralite Graphite 17″ Free-Floating Barrel, and lightweight black synthetic thumbhole stock to provide incredible accuracy in an extremely lightweight package. These accept normal 10/22 magazines as well.



I only have THREE in stock, and they are ON SALE and priced to sell quickly for only $535.00 each (cash price).


The MLR22AT will give .22 LR rifle shooters something to get excited about. The ambidextrous lightweight thumbhole 10/22 stock is made of polypropylene with fiber additives for maximum strength. The stock comb height is designed high enough to comfortably and properly shoot with optics. The stock design also features a semi palm swell on both sides of the pistol grip, and a molded-to-fit hard rubber butt plate attached with screws.

This rifle is equipped with the Magnum Lite revolutionary patented graphite bull barrel, exclusive to Magnum Research. The patented uni-directional graphite fibers, parallel to the bore axis, results in a barrel with six-times the stiffness of conventional steel. The lighter barrel weights (from 13-16 oz, depending on barrel length) are easier to wield and dissipate heat up to 43% faster than steel. The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy.

Other features include a .22LR Benz target chamber designed specifically for semi-automatics; full floating barrel for maximum accuracy, CNC-machined receiver from 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging with an integral weaver-type rail for optics and a black anodized finish. The MLR22AT has an approximate weight of 4.25 lbs, barrel length of 17 inches, and over all length of 35.5 inches.
