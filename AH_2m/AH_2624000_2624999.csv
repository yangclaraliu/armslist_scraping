The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine."

Don't need to sell, but I've had it several months and haven't even had a chance to fire it myself. The only other one I have seen come up for sale went for $1,200. I am not willing to take less than $750 for this gun, or I will keep it for my own collection.

I also have not been able to find any local FFL dealers to ship for me, so please only contact me if you are local unless you can arrange the shipping details."

 The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

.380, 9mm, .40cal and .45cal versions available - With fixed sights or Night Sights - All in different variants. Please call for INSTORE ONLY pricing or if you are looking for a specific model!

Pistol is pre-owned in excellent condition.

This pistol is an absolute beauty. It is perfect for a day at the range or target practice. Great for shooting without all the expense of higher-priced, higher-caliber ammo. Hate to sell it. I'm sure you'll have as much joy with it as I have.

If you've ever wanted to perfect your long range shooting skills, this is the pistol to buy. Also included are 5000 rounds of .22LR CCI Blazer (a very, very hard find at the moment).

Let's do the math. A full case of 22LR is extremely hard to find. Some people on other sites are selling this ammunition for $625 right now! Here, you're getting a firearm and the ammunition included. Either you'll spend years shooting it or piece them out and recoup the cost of the firearm. The choice is yours!

This is a private sale. All sales must be completed locally. You will be required to present your permit to purchase or carry permit and sign a bill of sale. Cash only.

This is rated by Chris Costa to be the best carry gun available today for many reasons.You can look up his videos on youtube and see what he says about it. The only reason I am selling is because I have too many guns and need to get rid of one. I am not desperate but will entertain reasonable offers.

You can see more details in the pictures but I have painted the engraving to coyote tan. This can be undone very easily. I can even do it for you if you like. The gun will come with the two factory mags, three backstraps, as well as one 17 round magazine (very hard to find right now) and the xgrip extender. 

I have had the Apex Tactical FSS trigger kit installed. This job is $300 plus. The trigger is comparable to a nice 1911 with no pre or over travel. I have the 5.5 lb spring in the gun right now since I used it to carry but I will also include the 2.5 lb competition spring with the gun. I do not recommend carrying with this spring but it is up to you. The following have been installed into the gun: Apex Forward Set Trigger, Forward Set Sear, Ultimate Striker Block Kit, Striker Block, Striker Block Spring, Forward Set Spring Set, Sear Spring. All of these are authentic Apex Tactical products. I have receipts to prove authenticity.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
•Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life 
•Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes 
•Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
•Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves 
•One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
•Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories 
•Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•Extended slide release 
•Patented Lock-Out Safety device

(They are to large to post on this website)

This is my complete airsoft package. I had several airsoft guns that I bought and sold, but this was always my primary. I had also bought lots of equipment and finally figured out what works best with this gun. THE ONLY reason I am selling this is because I am short of money. It is hard to explain all of the good things about this gun, never jammed, always worked, exceeds the range of 99% of other players on the field, battery lasts a really long time...etc. Here are all of the accessories and upgrades to this gun and you can figure out yourself what is is capable of. (not forgetting that it is a kwa which is already one of the best airsoft models out there). 

Upgrades:
G&P m120 high speed motor
590 mm, 6.01 tight bore madbull barrel
190 mm scilencer
11.1 Lipo Battery
Firefly bucking
(A few other things for the looks, all the rest of the parts are stock)

Accessories:
Airsoft goggles and metal netting face mask, with a TF 141 skull bandanna to cover it
One num-chuck battery, and one stick batter (11.1 lipo), charger included
2 speed loaders
3 mid cap magazines
1 1200 rd high cap magazine (it was self winding electrically, but it stopped working, you can still wind it manually, I will still include the charger for it in case you can do something with it)
About 1500 rds of .25 king arms 6mm bbs, and about 2500 rds of .20 king arms 6mm bbs
Sling and foregrip incuded and attached to the gun
(there is a very big possibility that I am forgetting something, but if I remember anything, I will add it to the post)

Note:
There are 2 really minor details that are broken on the gun, but are hardly noticeable and don't affect the functionality at all
1. The little handle to retract the stock is missing, the stock still re-tracks, you just have to lower the bolt yourself
2. The top of one bolt was stripped, so i drilled the head out, you can not even notice this unless you are specifically looking for it

I am also including a soft carrying case that has plenty of pockets. 6 mags, 1 of which is a polished black metal. And to sweeten the deal, 500 rounds of 7.62x39 FMJ rounds still in the boxes, and an empty water tight ammo can.

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who pointed out that I had the wrong photos. They've been updated. The firearm has never been fired. You can still see the black paint lines (like grain) in the chamber on the metal surrounding the opening of the striker. This is normally the first thing that wears as rounds feed and push against the chamber when firing. No wear can be seen with this firearm.

This pistol includes everything as pictured. Gen 3. Fixed sights. It also includes 20 additional 15-round magazines (aftermarket). Yes, a few years ago when I purchased this I also bought a whole bunch of magazines during the last gun scare, and now I'm getting rid of them. My loss is your gain!

This is a private sale. All sales must be completed locally. You will be required to present your permit to purchase or carry permit and sign a bill of sale. Cash only. Item is located near Anoka, MN.

Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod.[1] The NHM-91 was equipped from the factory with two 30-round magazines and a 75-round Chinese drum magazine.
Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.
Stocks on the NHM-91 are of a one-piece thumbhole design with integral pistol grip, and are thicker and longer than the standard AKM/AK-47 buttstock. Made by E.C. Bishop or Boyd[2] and constructed from birch wood or hackberry, the NHM-91 buttstock lacks a separate pistol grip,[1] though the rifle may be retrofitted with a separate buttstock by simply cutting off the lower portion of the stock and grip with a band saw, then fitting a new pistol grip. Like its RPK counterpart, the NHM-91 does not come equipped from the factory with a bayonet lug. However, the front of the barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector welded onto the threads. By removing the thread protector, a muzzle brake can be fitted.[3]
Factory NHM-91 rifles were manufactured with a rivet in the magazine release button, preventing use of some Soviet or German-made AKM or AK-47 magazines. Instead, special magazines with a modified tang were manufactured by Norinco for the NHM-91. Since the sunset of the 1994 Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, removal of the rivet in the magazine release allows use of any and all AKM, RPK, or AK-47 magazines."

I have 2 mages for it, an ankle ""tactical"" magazine pouch and also some military surplus things to trade too like a camelback and military grade full firing range earmuffs and shooting glasses to sweeten the deal if anyone has a nice 1911 for sale/trade. I got it for $500 so i'd like no less than $350 for it, so far one guy has offered me $330 but honestly I'll just use that money to get a 1911 (prob my fav handgun and a must have for me) so a trade for me is preferable. 

Oh and i still have the box for it and the serial numbers are clearly marked, i bought it literally 6 months ago brand new. Oh and for anyone who doesnt like the chrome you can fix that up at a gunsmith for $30 or just do it yourself for $5-10 if  get the right type of paint as most gun paint coats are black. And also i have 100 round ammo for the gun already of 9x19mm rounds. Like I said i don't mind sweeting the pot if anyone has a nice 1911 or other type of .45 sidearm for my 9x19mm p95 ruger."
