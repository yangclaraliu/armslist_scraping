Just bought new carry gun, FNX 45, so buying a Bullpup out right would have to wait, My Sig hardly ever sees the light of day so I could live without it. More interested in trade than flat out sale. I have 3 30rd pmags (2 windowed, 1 regular) 3 40rd pmags and 2 metal 30rd mags. Rifle is unmolested with 100rds through it. Only mark on it is on the shell deflector from expent shells hitting it. Unavoidable when firing an AR15. All the stats for this rifle are on the internet if you want to know anything generic about it. It's in great shape. After tax and everything I paid just over $1700 in all for this rifle which came with one pmag ($1589 + tax). Then with all the mags and red dot I'm in it a bit deeper than that. If someone wants to flat out buy it with all 8 mags I'd want $1500 firm. I have the box, strap, manuals, all that. No shipping, No sales to non minnesota state residents and I know it's not required but I will want to see a permit to purchase/carry and MN state ID and fill out a bill of sale which I'll provide with both of us getting identical copies."

I have for sale (no trades at this time) a Savage MDL 24V series B chambered in 222 remington over 20ga. It will take 3"" shells. Overall condition is VG-Excellent. The case colors are good and bright. No dings or scratches on the wood and no rust on any of the metal. Both bores are great with zero pitting. It is set up for a scope and comes with the base attached. I have no idea on round counts but I would say it is low. I am located in Onalaska (Lewis County). I will NOT travel. The ONLY reason that I am selling this is Christmas is right around the corner and I am taking my wife out of town on vacation. Once the holiday is over if I still have it it can make its way back in to the safe."

Specifications:
In addition to the rigid quality controls of manufacturing, the feature that sets the Anderson AM15 Rifles apart from the masses is the proprietary RF85 treatment allowing Anderson weapon systems to operate efficiently without “Wet” lubricant. In a coefficient friction test performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the reduction of friction on all steel surfaces was reduced by 85% — without traditional “wet” lubricant, hence the name RF85. An RF-85 treated weapon cycles faster and more reliably, operates at cool er temperatures, experiences significantly less wear and, without traditional “WET” lubricant, doesn’t experience failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action.

The 6.8 mm Remington SPC (aka 6.8 SPC, 6.8 SPC II & 6.8×43mm) is a rifle cartridge that was developed by Remington Arms in collaboration with members of the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, United States Special Operations Command[4] to possibly replace the 5.56 NATO cartridge in a Short Barreled Rifle(SBR)/Carbine.

Based upon the .30 Remington cartridge,[5] it is midway between the 5.56×45mm NATO and 7.62×51mm NATO in bore diameter and muzzle energy. It uses a .277"" (7.0358 mm) diameter bullet, the same as that used in the venerable .270 Winchester hunting cartridge. It is particularly adaptable to current 5.56 mm NATO firearms, sharing the same cartridge overall length (2.260"").

----------------- Kahles words............
Multizer0 turret
Riflescope with multizeroTM micromechanics allows the shooter to zero the riflescope in at up to five different shooting distances.
With the innovative multizeroTM ad- justment, KAHLES is making professional long-shot mechanics available to the serious hunter for the first time. Fine, non-magnifying reticles and the revolutionary concept of multiple zero settings completely redefine the long range shooting reference class.

Today, these standards are exceeded with the new HELIA CS with the innovative multizeroTM elevation adjustments. With this new technology, the greatest precision is now possible at any desired distance. It is so precise that the reticle had to be set in the second focal plane to minimize target coverage."

509,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2453509,For Sale:  Trigger-Guard Mounted Universal Integrated Laser Sight,"Orange County, Los Angeles, California",$ 149,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 14, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"On-Duty integrated Laser sight, like new with instructions, original cost was $480 + tax and shipping. Preferred by law enforcement and SWAT operators for ease of operation, reliability and accuracy.

Constructed of high-strength aircraft aluminum with a weather-resistant, sealed BK-7 window glass projection port. This facilitates fast target acquisition and increased accuracy, particularly in low-light conditions. 

Simple DIY installation, Mounts to the trigger guard without changing out parts or alterations, installs in minutes.

Sits just under the bore for highest accuracy and prevents your finger from blocking the beam. It also ensures absolute alignment with the bore for consistent point-of-aim. 

No exposed wires, No drilling, tapping or gunsmithing.
Holds zero better than any other laser sight on the market today.
Beats any Crimson Trace or Viridian any time!

Ambidextrous operation for right or left-handed shooters. 
Adjustable Switch Sensitivity.
Distinct On/Off switch turns the laser on only when you need it.
Separate Windage and Elevation adjustments.
Uses one 6-Volt battery.
Battery lasts at least for 2 years under normal law-enforcement use.
Red laser with constant beam, 5 Milliwatt=the maximum allowed by law, 630 Nanometer.


What kind of targeting and accuracy problems do lasers actually solve? 
Poor eyesight is one. Using iron sights becomes more difficult with age. It becomes impossible if the defender’s eyeglasses are knocked off early. 
Firing on the move is another: careful lining up of iron sights is very difficult when trying to move away from a moving attacker or his line of fire. In all those cases, keeping the aiming point on the actual target can be very helpful.
Aiming from awkward or compromised positions, such as from behind a shield.
Accuracy is another. Your groups will shrink to half or third of the original size when fired using a laser rather than iron sights. The same effect is even more evident as the range increases.  With a properly zeroed laser, sighting errors are taken out of the equation and the accuracy depends more on trigger control.
Lasers are also extremely helpful for training.
Cheap lasers are dime a dozen: they never zero precisely, get knocked out of zero by the slightest recoil rendering them unusable for any situation when you would actually need it! The most surprising fact I have learned the hard way: The sight one uses should cost as much or more than the gun it will be used on.

The eye relief is about 3 inches. There are two auxiliary crosses, one for aiming at 900 and 1,000 meters, the other for high-trajectory ammunition.

The step closest to the baseline is marked '10' for 1,000 meters, while the farthest is marked '2' for 200 meters. The three steps in between correspond to 800, 600 and 400 meters in ascending order. Just align the target's groin with the baseline and match the top of his head with the appropriate step.

It all started with a Polish AK-47 chambered in 7.62x39, then adding a precision head spaced NEW chrome-lined 16” barrel manufactured in the USA, polished bolt, bolt carrier, and gas rod, and installed over-sized guiderails that were filed to a precision fit making the action smooth as glass and faster than any AK that you have fired before. The Tapco trigger was smoothed for quicker lock time and a decreased pull, and installed with RedStar anti-walk pins that were hand-fitted. Even the magazine well and lower rails were hand filed to create a secure magazine engagement while eliminating that sloppy feel and slow, fumbling mag change that AKs are known for. The entire assembly was then Cera-koted in Sniper Gray to include the GunTec glass-breaker flash hider for reliability and protection both inside the action and out. Black Tapco furniture was installed that includes a SAW-style grip, longer-pull fixed stock with sling mount, and a forward hand guard with accessory rails. No expense was spared and I can assure you this weapon will quickly grow to be your favorite and the envy of your peers. It comes with a 30 round Tapco magazine, cleaning rod, and lower accessory rail cover. I am not interested with trades at this time, but I will entertain reasonable cash offers."

It is an 7.62mm Israeli kit on ORF's side plate. It may have some US parts in it but I'm not certain. When i got it, it was very unreliable. I sent it back to Todd for warranty work. When I got it back it, it worked like it should have from the get go. The spade grips are nice(OOW I think). Not sure why the magic marker X's are there. I can remove them with a little Acetone if you want before shipping, never bothered me. I enjoy shooting it much better with the spade grips(and looks cooler too). The trigger pull is nearly perfect with the spade grips on it and you can really send the rounds down range in a hurry. The regular grip is included and approximately 50 links though not pictured. I have fired approximately 300 rounds through it and fired them w/ the trunnion protector installed. Shipping will be $65. It is heavy. I will send the tripod separately and it is a reproduction, not WWII vintage. No T&E included, never had one. This ships from my FFL to yours. I'll give you three days to inspect it and shoot it.

I picked up this rifle just before I found my son was coming and just never got around to shooting it. For sale is an unfired Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) MK114 MOD 0 with upgraded trigger and buffer tube. If you're looking at this rifle, you know exactly what you're getting. PWS uses a proprietary piston technology which in my opinion is much better than a direct impingement system. This an original MOD 0 rifle which means there are rails all around the upper as opposed to a MOD 1 version which uses the KeyMod rail system. Again, my opinion on the two styles is that the MOD 0 may be a little heavier but you can put just about any attachment on the rails without having to purchase additional rails. Currently, the MOD 1 versions of this rifle cost $1,949 retail (with no upgrades) and take up to 6 months to build/ship. I'm open to REASONABLE offers but new, this rifle would cost you $2,200+.

I have 2 cases of 10 boxes each; 20 rounds per box.
UPDATE 2/18/14 - ONLY 6 BOXES LEFT!!!(SOLD 14)  Remington Factory Production, NOT reloads.  350 grain Swift A-frame bullets (at ~2600fps).  If the job doesn't require a solid, this should easily do the trick!  Perfect for Moose, Elk, Big Bears or anything on this continent, and most others!  $75 per box of 20 (20 boxes of 20 cartridges/each box are available)(A real deal - These are A-frames like Nosler Partitions, and are bonded too!)  Will Jiggle your Giblets!  Buy one or all 20.  I am located in Janesville, Wisconsin, but I thought it would be reasonable to post this ad in Alaska, since this is where the 416's would probably be used.  Check out prices for ANY .416's loaded with Swift A-frames...you'll see these are considerably less!  Inquire if you have any questions.  I may be slow, as this originates from my desktop - I normally check daily.
Considering the price of ammo these days, I might consider trades - but I am getting fussy in my old age!  By the way, if you were to reload new brass, it would cost you over $55 per box, using Midway componants.  Thanks for looking!
update:  Shipping is expensive!  Ship a case to Fairbanks for $120 (23lbs)
             or, for example, 4 boxes would run $72 to Fairbanks
If you buy a case, I will pay for half of shipping.  Reasonable for you, reasonable for me.

Great. As Back Up Gun or for Carry around the house gun. I have carried in front pocket most days since purchasing early last year. It can be carried locked and cocked so ready to roll if time ever arises. It has factory magazine that holds 7 rounds and barrel tips up to add 8'th round.  
I have owned several in various calibers and this one  is in Great condition. Would be great addition to collection or wonderful  Christmas Gift. You Will be surprised how often you will carry this little jewel. Beretta is and always had top quality great pocket guns. These are not cheap junk Taurus or others are offering. It's flattering that Taurus tried to copy but this is the real deal. I carry Hornady Custom 35 Grain XTP #90012 hollow points they offer 900 FPS at Muzzle, 813 FPS at 50 yards. Most pocket guns are used in face to face confrontations  so 8 of these placed in correct  place will sure get someone off you and allow you time to get to safe area.

This is a great package for a new gun to CCW or IDPA/IPSC competition.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 magazines holding 12 rounds each for the handgun. Each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! 

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

I will include one box of Federal Ammunition Self Defense hollow point ammunition with this package. 

I am located in Peirce County, but I will travel a reasonable distance to meet a buyer."

Chambered in the classic .308 Winchester cartridge, the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!
