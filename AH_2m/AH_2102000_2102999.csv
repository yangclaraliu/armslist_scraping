The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt®-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

You rarely see this model for sale but you see the ultra light weights always for sale. My wife owned one and it was stainless lol and an aluminum frame and it had a 17 lb trigger on it even after I changed the springs the timming was always off. This is why you buy those for 350$ she returned it over and over and just ended up selling it..

218,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2102218,For Sale:  Taran Butler tactical sights for glock,"aiken, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 85,"Listed On: Sunday, October 6, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"TTI tactical sights for glock new in package.  Black rear, fiber optic front.
The TTI Ultimate Fiber Optic Sights for GLOCK were designed to the specifications of Taran Butler and Robert Vogel for the optimum sight picture and brightest fiber optic front sight possible.   The fiber optic dot has been moved up to the very top of the front sight so the shooter doesn't get confused with shooting off the top of the dot or a big, thick blade sitting above it, which can cause the shooter to shoot either too high or too low.  The fiber optic bar is NOT partially embedded into the floor of the sight, which means more light reaches a greater portion of the circumference of the rod.  Our shiny, stainless steel screw reflects even more light right to the middle of the rod.  As an added bonus, the front sight is designed to also be compatible with the GLOCK factory screw in case it is dropped or lost at the time of installation.  The front of the rear sight is angled to allow one-handed charging from your belt, pants, or any other object.  The front sight is .220"" tall and .115"" wide for perfect point-of-impact with the GLOCK 17, 17L, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 34, and 35.  The tighter .125"" rear notch helps dramatically when shooting small steel and tight shots at a distance. Rear serrations cut down on glare.   Both front and rear sights are billet stainless steel coated with Diamond Black Ion Bond (95 Rockwell hardness) for the highest level of rust resistance and the strongest finish.  No more pulling your gun out of your bag a week later and finding your sights rusted over, dinged, dented, or finding distracting, shiny corners or edges.   These sights have been used to win National Championships by World Champions Robert Vogel and Randi Rogers."

Extend the life of your weapon by installing a Sprinco Recoil Management Guide Rod System. A secondary, or sub-spring assembly is incorporated onto a heat treated, stainless steel guide rod to cushion the slide to frame impact! All components, including the chrome silicon wire secondary springs, are hand polished to a brilliant finish for reduced friction.Our products are used by many of the top competition shooters in the world, including both World and Multi-National Champions. Their reliability is validated by their use by Law Enforcement and Elite U.S. Military Forces around the world in combat deployment.Sprinco USA Recoil Reducers make a significant difference by the management of peak impact forces to the slide /frame interface. The graduated sub-spring is engineered and critically positioned in each model to ensure normal cycling and reliability. In most models, the spent case has already been ejected prior to slide deceleration. The reduced slide to frame impact results in reduced energy transfer to the grip, wrist, and other extremities (""less felt recoil""), as well as extending the duty cycle of your pistol. This is a proven effective no frills, no gimmick approach to recoil management.Installation is as easy as installing your stock guide rod system. No firearm modification is necessary to enjoy significant reductions in muzzle flip and perceived (felt) recoil. The system improves your shooting with faster follow up shots, faster sight recovery and improves control of your rapid fire shot strings. While you may not be bothered by the recoil of your gun, expert as well as novice shooters benefit from faster target acquisition and lowered split times.Some of the benefits of installing a Sprinco Recoil Management System in your firearm include:LIFETIME WARRANTY AGAINST BREAKAGEReduces Muzzle ClimbProtects Your FirearmFaster Sight RecoveryCMP & IPSC LegalReduce Felt (Perceived) RecoilHeat Treated 17-4 Stainless SteelChrome Silicon Wire Secondary Springs Never Have To Be Replaced No Modification to Firearm Required"

For sale is a H&K P30L, acquired unfired from a friend. I have put <100 rounds through the pistol, and have decided to get rid of it to acquire a 1911. Excellent pistol, basically brand new, and you'll save $200 or more off the new in store price. 

This model is the LEM, which means no decocker/safety, but still has an internal hammer and DA/SA firing. Here is a quote from Bob Rowe concerning the system:

""The H&K LEM pistols, like their regular DAO models, can be obtained with or without a control lever safety. I chose to not have the lever retained when my pistol was converted to LEM. I did this for a number of reasons: (a) The safety isn't necessary; (b) No liability issues of whether the pistol was on safe or not prior to firing; (c) To eliminate concerns that the pistol might be accidentally put on Safe; (d) The pistol is more comfortable in an IWB holster without the control lever; and (e) The absence of the control lever gives a cleaner access to the slide lock release lever. Other owners may have different priorities and may opt for having the control lever present. The LEM pistols have a two-part hammer -- an internal hammer and an external hammer. When the slide is cycled, either manually or by firing the pistol, the internal hammer is cocked but the eternal hammer follows the slide forward to its normal just-off-the-firing-pin position. The trigger is in its forward position. To fire the weapon, the trigger is pulled rearward through a long, light trigger pull of something less than 2 pounds. Near the end of that trigger stroke, resistance is encountered. If additional force is then applied to the trigger, the pistol will fire, cycle, and start all over again. 

The LEM fire control module can be obtained in either of two trigger pulls. The ""light trigger"" is 4.5 to 5.5 pounds. The ""heavy trigger"" is 7.5 to 8.5 pounds. I chose the light trigger for my USP conversion. When I received the pistol back from Sterling, VA, the trigger measured just under 5.5 pounds on my RCBS trigger pull gauge. I anticipate that it will lighten up a little with use.

H&K advertises that their LEM trigger has a ""very short trigger reset."" I found this interesting, because the very long trigger reset is one of the main disadvantages (for me) of my Para Ordnance LDA pistol. I also wondered how they could have a short trigger reset, when the trigger had to move forward into its DAO position after firing. Well, here is one of the main advantages of the H&K LEM trigger over the P-O LDA trigger. After firing an LEM-equipped H&K USP pistol, the slide cycles faster than the shooter can release the trigger. This occurs in all semiauto pistols. If one fires the LEM pistol, and keeps the trigger back after firing, the hammer remains back! At this point, the shooter can let the trigger go forward just a short distance; the trigger will reset, the hammer will stay to the rear, and the pistol will be ready to fire again. If this is done repeatedly, firing the pistol will be just like firing a pistol in SA mode. There will be short trigger pulls of about 5 lbs, short resets, and hammer staying cocked after each shot. However, if the shooter lets the trigger go all the way forward after firing it, the hammer will go forward to its normal just-off-the-firing-pin position. At this point, the pistol will be in the same condition that it was after initially loading, and it may be safely holstered. Although the internal hammer remains cocked, letting the trigger go forward is almost like ""decocking"" the external hammer, but without having to manipulate a decocking lever.""

Here's the story.  I ordered this rifle 8 months ago.  I then went away on military orders and came back.  My rifle just arrived and I picked it up yesterday (09/10/13).  While I was gone, I found another rifle that I like even better (means more expensive).  I love this rifle, it has every feature I could want in an AR 10 platform.  My price is $2200 which a full $200 under the total MSRP + taxes (if you could find one for sale to start with).  If you don't believe me, look online and you'll see.  For $200 more you can have my 5 brand new 308 pmags and 100 rounds.  I also have some .308 hunting loads I can sell  to the buyer if your interested.

What could steal my attention away from such an awesome Battle Rifle?  Spikes Tactical makes an SBR with an integrated suppressor in the 300 BLK.  It'll take me a year to get, but I'm pretty patient when it comes to buying guns.  I've been waiting on a Sub 2000 for over a year (I'll be damned if I pay over MSRP for a KelTec).

 I'd prefer to sell FTF with a CCP or LEO on this one, with all the crap going on.

Just reply to this ad or text me at 9zero1-two1six-5six1five.

Thanks

It is 5.56mm. Price is $650.00. This silencer was $1195.00 new so you are getting a heck of a deal. It is used but in 100% working condition. It was used on a LE rifle but was never abused. It shows signs of wear around the muzzle only and I took photos of that. It has no dents in it and it was taken care of. It has approx 1000 rds through it and has lots of life still to go. It is still covered by AAC's Limited Lifetime Warranty that I never used. I sold my 16"" AR and I know have only a 8"" SBR and it won't work on it since the M.I.T.E.R system overlaps the barrel about 1"". It will work on any 16"" AR with a threaded barrel or one that has a removable flash hider. I will include the one AAC BlackOut Flash Hider that goes with it. It is threaded for 1/2x28 which is what most AR's are threaded for from the factory. This Silencer is on a Form 4 in Oklahoma, which means it will only be a one stamp transfer to someone in Oklahoma or if you are out of state it will be a two stamp transfer. If you are out of state contact a local Class 3 dealer and they can explain this to you. I am a class 3 dealer in Oklahoma and can handle the transfer if the buyer is from Oklahoma. This is in my personal inventory that is why it is on a form 4. If you have any questions let me know and I can answer them for you. My email is jpowers8340ATscbglobal.net or my cell number is 580six9five8340. I can take calls or texts. Buyer will pay $50.00 shipping if being shipped to another dealer."

Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Its re-engineered muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make the 82A1 comfortable and, dare we say, exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it is transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

This rifle actually will fit in the case fully assembled, which is a nice advantage. No need to mess with assembly while out in the field. Also, the chrome-lined barrel will make it easier to clean."

We also have silencers for .22LR that start at $145.00, silencers for AR-15's/5.56 calibers that start at $425.00, and 7.62mm silencers that start at $499.00.  We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up. Our prices are typically below MSRP and we have silencers that can fit anyone's budget. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. If you chain of command allows it you can take these on deployments since we know that only the ""cool guys"" get them issued. You never know this could be the piece of equipment that helps save your life or someone else. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I sale all major brands of silencers so if you have a special request just ask. It is now legal to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $4500.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am an experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED.

Rifle has nice adjustable sights and the receiver is grooved for scope mounts. Comes with a 10 rd magazine, key lock, and owners manual; 15 and 25 rd magazines are readily available from Armscor of America and are inexpensive. It also has an easily removed shell deflector mounted on the receiver for you lefties out there so it will not throw hot brass in your face. The stock has a tiny mark under the pistol grip that came that way, hard to notice but I wanted to mention it. Will meet buyer half way between us for a FTF Cash and Carry deal in a public setting during daylight hours, buyer must be legal resident of Maryland and not prohibited from possessing firearms, sale to active duty military stationed in MD is legal and ok with me. I will include a set of new Millett Angle Lock rimfire scope rings with the rifle at no extra cost. This is a very nice and seldom seen rifle that is brand new and will make a great addition for any collector of .22 rifles or as your an everyday shooter. thanks, pls email with any questions."

It's a great weapon with a tough and manly feel (for lack of a better description). its .40 cal, that comes with two grip back straps, a few mags, and a paddle holster that is easy to get on and off when needed. I included these three pics so you can get a good look at it. As you can see there are no scratches or anything like that. It doesn't get used because frankly I prefer to carry my XD. I received this weapon on a trade from another Marine, but have never shot it because I'm disabled and mostly bed bound so I very rarely get out to shoot. But even though the Marines have taken my back out of commission, they could never (nor could anyone else) take the Marines out of my heart and spirit. Part of that spirit comes with a love of firearms. So I'm looking for another weapon to love.

I can't drive because of my injury incurred in the Marines makes it difficult to do so. So whoever I trade with or sell too has to be willing to come too me in Belfair. I'd make you coffee, shake your hand, smile and tell you war stories if you wish. Thank you for your understanding."
