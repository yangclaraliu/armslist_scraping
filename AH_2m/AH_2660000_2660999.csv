The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories."

It is great condition with a very clean stock and good patina on metal.
The bluing and crown on the barrel look great.  The bore is dark but is shootable. There is no crest on the gun as they were ground off during import. There is a bit of wear and patina on the buttplate and the magazine.  Bollt functions smoothly.  Take a look at the pictures below.

 I personally have not shot this gun as I don't have any 7.65 lying around.  I bought this gun with a couple others a little while back and after getting it home I just decided I didn't want to stock yet another caliber.  This gun is beautiful and really its stock and bluing condition puts the best of my Mosin's and Enfields to shame.

I would be willing to consider trades particularly of a Swiss K31 or makarov variant.

I understand that this gun falls out of transfer and interstate rules as it is considered an antique but I am not looking to ship this gun...sorry I don't care for money orders or rubber checks...I would rather shakes hands and walk away happy."

These Sunglasses work well for people whose style is: Classic.

These sunglasses feature a mirror coating. Mirror coatings are suitable for protection from intense light. A mirror coating reflects back light and reduces the amount of light passing through the lens. This makes it more comfortable for eyes in very sunny conditions.
The sunglasses feature gradient tinted lenses - Gradient tints are tints that start off at a darker color at the top of a lens and then gradually lighten towards the bottom of the lenses. These tints are great for fashion and for reading outside on sunny days. Gradient coatings work by allowing an appropriate amount of light to filter through in certain areas and less in places where protection is most necessary.

Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

The primary difference between the SSAR-15 SBS™ and the SSAR-15 OGR™ is the design intent. In an effort to cater to varying consumer preferences, the SSAR-15 SBS™ is designed to resemble current combat rifle stocks. In addition, the SSAR-15 SBS™ was designed with multiple accessories in mind which will be available in the near future."

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the BuckMark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip RX andUltragrip DX represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple brand new, factory fresh Henry H001M .22 Mag Lever-Action Rifles! Henry lever-actions are known around the globe for their incredibly smooth action and great accuracy, right out of the box. This model features a smooth American Walnut stock and blued finish.


I only have TWO stock, and have them priced to sell QUICKLY for just $399.00 each (cash price).


 Henry H001M .22 Mag Lever-Action Rifle with 19.25″ Barrel, 11+1 Capacity Tubular Magazine, Checkered American Walnut Stock

The tubular magazine holds 11 rounds. It weighs 5 1/2 pounds and overall length is 37 1/2″. With regard to ballistics, in general the .22 Magnum travels twice as fast the .22 LR cartridge and delivers twice the energy. Various types of .22 magnum cartridges are available from all the major ammo makers.

Clair Rees, who authored a Rimfire Column article in GUNS Magazine, had this to say about our rifle, “I’ve done enough shooting with Henry’s .22 Magnum to know it operates smoothly and reliably. Accuracy is good, too. At 50 yards, it produced 5-rounds averaging an even inch center-to-center with Winchester Supreme jacketed hollowpoints. This great looking .22WMR lever carbine delivers. This is a good buy.”

Never fired. PLR-16. Got this not too long ago and had it accessorized and some custom work done to the trigger and mag release areas for better improved performance. Trigger is nice and smooth with a clean break, mags drop freely and mag reloads slide and lock into place effortlessly. I have a few of these and all are reliable and accurate. Tons of fun factor. Without any compensator this IS SUPER LOUD, while throwing huge balls of flame. Definitely an eye catcher at the range. The decibel concussion level of it will certainly annoy any shooter(s) next to you. However it is tamed by a Primary Weapons CQB Comp that focuses all that annoyance forward and away from the shooter and those next to. Dramatically improves control as well. This CQB Comp is asily removable and disassembled for cleaning purposes. Accurate and solid stable sighting is via Bushnell TRS-25 on a high mount over looking a Nebo iProtec HP190 LED Light. Forearm Guard is a Midwest Industries Rail System. Super durable and rock solid stable. Remains nice and cool when your running this AR/AK hybrid hard. Won't melt off like the original manufacture plastic ones do. Grip assurance is from a Magpul AFGII. I have just over $1300 into this little beast and wanting to trade for a quality AR. Everything on this is new. You'll get all the boxes and packaging materials etc for these as well. Have 3 brand new 30 round PMags and Fieldline Tactical Carry Case, Factory ammo etc.

A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols.

    A tribute to attributes. Specialized features are the hallmark of the Compact and Ultra Carry families. All have shorter 3-inch barrels that make them easy to carry with the power of the .45ACP cartridge.

    Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols in .45 ACP and 9 mm have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic.

    To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber.

My ammo
I recently got a .44 superblackhawk and could not find ammo to go shoot it. As a patriotic American and former Infantryman I felt that was completely unacceptable, and I needed to do something about it. I learned how to make my own ammo a couple years ago and just started casting my own bullets. All the ammo I have made has worked as good, if not better than the cheap stuff I was buying. I only use quality ingredients also. I will be honest though, I just started casting the lead bullets and there are minor discrepancies. But actually it looks as good as what I got at wal-#art.
