Former Marine thinking about selling my NJ Compliant 16"" LWRC M6A2 SPR.  I'll start by saying I love this rifle, so much that whatever I make in this sale is going right toward another LWRC rifle, just haven't decided on a barrel length or caliber.  I purchased this rifle, new, in August 2013.  This rifle is gently-used and well taken care of.  I've cleaned it more times than I have taken it to the range; and ran a bore snake through it at least once per 4 or 5 rounds, of which only approximately only 250 have been fired.  The weapon charges and operates like the well oil machine it is. The nickel bolt carrier group runs ice-cold no matter how quickly you can feel it magazines and doesnt need an oil bath.  The short-stroke piston keeps your chamber and bolt clean and cool and makes diss/ass and cleaning, easy. If you are interested or have any questions, feel free to reach out.  NJFID Card, COE and ID.

From LWRC website:
The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots."

The tech details are as follows:
Palmetto State Armory upper receiver: 5.56 NATO chamber, chrome lined barrel, 1:7 twist, carbine length gas system, low profile gas block, Midwest Industries SS112G2 free floating hand guard (comes with the standard (3) 2.5” rail sections installed (see the link below for other available options),   chrome lined bolt carrier (full auto profile), Carpenter 158 bolt secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked to mil spec standards (gas key was staked by a gun smith at PSA). 
 Spikes Tactical lower receiver: multi caliber, 7075 forged aluminum, hard coat anodized finish, low shelf for use with RDIAS, PSA lower parts kit, PSA mil spec buffer tube and 6 position stock, Magpul MOE pistol grip wrapped with paracord, Troy Industries quick detach single point sling adapter (swivel included) – the lower rail section on the upper has a quick detach swivel adapter machined into it which makes going from a single point sling to a 2 point carry sling very quick and easy (see pictures)
The sights are UTG removable fixed iron sights (made form aircraft grade aluminum).  These sights are a cheaper brand but they work very well.  I hate so sell a rifle without any sights at all so that it is ready to go to the range right out of the box, but at the same time I hate to add money to the rifle for sights because every wants to do their own thing with the vast variety of optics available.  The sights cost $50 for both the front and back as a pair, if you don’t want them let me know and I will remove the sights and deduct the $50. 
Check out the Midwest industries hand guard on their website, there are different size and types of rails that can be added to customize the hand guard.  See the pictures; the bottom rail is set back from the side rails because there is a bipod adapter.  This can be removed and the rail moved forward with an allen wrench if you choose to do so.

I wrap the pistol grips just to make them a little bigger and more comfortable, if you have small hands and/or don’t like it you can simply unwrap it.

Recently I decided to thin the herd a bit, so I've got 5 firearms up for sale.

This is for a Ruger LCR .357 Magnum. This gun is completely stock, and has only had FIVE rounds through it (Blazer Brass 158gr JHP).

The firearm itself is in perfect condition, and will come with the stock case and all the stuff you get from Ruger (manual, spent casing, etc).

I also have:
Blackhawk! leather holster
45x Blazer Brass 158gr JHP
20x Speer Gold Dot 135gr JHP

These can be added for additional money, but I will cut you a deal if you want the firearm + ammo and/or holster.

The SIG516 Patrol by Sig Sauer is one of the most advanced and versatile AR-based rifles available.

The free-floating military-grade barrel is chrome-lined and phosphated, and the rifle features an adjustable four-position gas regulator. The SIG516 Patrol also features a free-floating M1913 quad rail and flip-up adjustable iron sights.

Recently I decided to thin the herd a bit, so I've got 5 firearms up for sale.

This is for a Glock 41 Gen 4 chambered in .45ACP. This gun has:
Dawson Precision competition rear sight
Dawson Precision black serrated front sight
Glock NY1 Trigger Spring (slightly heavier pull, but MUCH cleaner pull / reset)
Glock Extended Slide Stop Lever
THREE magazines (13 rounds each)

I am a certified Glock Armorer, so rest assured that these parts were installed correctly.

This firearm has exactly 200 rounds through it (Federal Champion 230gr FMJ).

The firearm itself is in perfect condition, and will come with the stock case and all the stuff you get from Glock (manual, spent casing, all the backstraps, etc.

I also have:
50x Federal American Eagle 230gr FMJ
30x Speer Gold Dot 200gr +P JHP
Various Glock Holsters

These can be added for additional money, but I will cut you a deal if you want the firearm + ammo and/or holster.

I'd prefer to meet somewhere in Geauga County.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
Thanks for looking!

The guitar started life as a standard run of the mill Mexican Strat, over the last 15+ years the body naturally aged and changed color from Snow White to a vintage creme color! The luthier removed the fret board, smoothed it out, oiled it, and polished it. Re-wired the whole guitar, added a DiMarzio super distortion humbucker and two fender vintage single coil pick ups. This guitar screams classic sound and it more than achieves sounds from Ritchie Blackmore and Iron Maiden all the way to other more classic fender sounds such as Clapton and Malmsteen.

Barrel: 16.25"" with a 1:9.5 twist, Overall: 27"" (stock folded), 35.5"" (stock extended), Weight: 7 lbs.

The Vz. 58 is a 7.62mm Rifle designed and manufactured in Czechoslovakia and accepted into service in the late 1950s as the 7,62 mm samopal vzor 58 (""7.62mm submachine gun model 1958""), replacing the vz. 52 self-loading rifle and the 7.62x25mm Tokarev vz. 24 and vz. 26 submachine guns. The vz. 58 externally resembles the Soviet AK-47 but is internally a completely different design based on a short-stroke gas piston.
Development of the weapon began in 1956; leading the project was chief engineer Jirí Cermák assigned to the Konstrukta Brno facility in the city of Brno. The prototype, known as the ""Košte"" (""broom""), was designed to chamber the intermediate Soviet 7.62x39mm M43 cartridge, rather than the Czech 7.62x45mm vz. 52 round, used in both the earlier vz. 52 rifle and the vz. 52 light machine gun. The assault rifle entered service in 1958 and over a period of 25 years (until 1984), over 920,000 weapons had been produced, fielded by the armed forces of the Czechoslovakia, Cuba and several other Asian and African nations.


The vz. 58 was produced in three main variants: the standard vz. 58 P (Pechotní or ""infantry"") model with a fixed buttstock made of a synthetic material (wood impregnated plastic, older versions used a wooden stock), the vz. 58 V (Výsadkový—""airborne""), featuring a side-folding metal shoulder stock, folded to the right side, and the vz. 58 Pi (Pechotní s infracerveným zamerovacem—""infantry with infrared sight""), which is similar to the vz. 58 P but includes a receiver-mounted dovetail bracket (installed on the left side of the receiver) used to attach an NSP2 night sight; it also has a detachable folding bipod and an enlarged conical flash suppressor.


The vz. 58 is a selective fire gas-operated weapon that bleeds expanding combustion gases generated in the barrel from the ignited cartridge through a port drilled in the barrel, 215 mm (8.5 in) from the chamber, opening into a hollow cylinder located above the barrel that contains a short-stroke piston. The vz. 58 does not have a gas regulator and the full force of the gas pressure is exerted on the piston head, propelling it backwards in a single impulsive blow. The piston is driven back only 19 mm (0.7 in) when a shoulder on the piston rod butts against the seating and no further movement is possible. There is a light return spring held between the piston shoulder and the seating which returns the piston to its forward position. The gas cylinder is vented after the piston has traveled back 16 mm (0.6 in) and the remaining gases are exhausted into the atmosphere on the underside of the cylinder via two ports. The entire piston rod is chromium-plated to prevent fouling.


The locking system features a falling breech lock hinged from the bolt and housed in the bolt carrier that contains two locking lugs which descend into and engage locking shoulders in the receiver's internal guide rails. The weapon is unlocked by the short tappet-like stroke of the piston rod as it strikes the bolt carrier and drives it rearwards. After 22 mm (0.9 in) of unrestricted travel, an wedge-like surface on the bolt carrier moves under the breech locking piece and lifts it up and out of engagement with the locking recesses in the steel body. The breech locking piece swings up and this movement provides the leverage required for primary extraction. The breech block is then carried rearwards extracting the empty cartridge casing from the chamber. A fixed ejector passes through a groove cut in the underside of the bolt and the case is flung upwards clear of the gun."

For the closest in concealment, the Inside-The-Waistband (IWB) leather holster gives you the deep concealment of inside the pants with a high inner body to protect your shirt or skin from the sharp edges and also to keep the finish of your pistol protected from moisture. Molded on the inside for extra retention, the top of the holster is also reinforced to allow one handed re-holstering. Inside the waistband (IWB) holsters provide the most comfortable and effective concealed carry method for most people. All parts of the holster and pistol that ride below the top of the pants (or skirt) are hidden, making it less likely that the covering garment will be pulled up and expose the holster. The shirt guard is to keep leather between the slide and your body, and to increase comfort and prevent your shirt from blocking the gun holster. The pants and belt hold the pistol close to the body for a flatter profile. This holster is made to fit belts up to 2"" wide and attaches by a metal spring clip."

The original box with factory paperwork and cardboard shipping sleeve is included.Doug Donnely president of USFA company provided me with two new box labels because the original box was shipped with a cardboard shipping sleeve that had information written on it. I received these labels in 2010 from Doug. The historical letter from United States Firearms Manufacturing Company Historic Armory in Hartford Connecticut hand signed by Doug Donnely is included. Also included is paperwork from Doug Turnbull Restoration. No pits, no turn line, no rust or scratches, bright shiny bore. The USFA company no longer manufactures revolvers. I have been told that all the tooling has been sold. Now is your chance to own a piece of firearms history. California bidders responsibility to make sure this firearm is on California DOJ approved list. Firearm will be shipped US postal priority mail from my FF L dealer. Shipping cost $30.

It has been gone through, and cleaned by a gunsmith. I'm not real good about taking apart semi-shotguns.

I have a nice little .410 Snake Charmer shotgun Don't really know what the value is but i can throw that in on the right deal. I also have a 2011 Sunny scooter, It needs some work to get running again ( i think the fuel pump is shot) I bought it to get it running and resale but i haven't had any time to mess with it, and it does have a title. I also have a really small Yamaha 50 (i think) 2 stroke 3 wheeler. It ran pretty good the last time it was ridden but it's been sitting about a year now. It needed tubes in the back tires, and the pull rope housing is loose (i think it just needs to be tightened). Also the shut off valve for the gas was broke so when its parked it kinda drains the gas out the carburetor. So if you have a nice 350cc or bigger quad you're looking to sell and anything here catches your eye I'm willing to throw in some cash too. Or even if you just have one for sale, let me know what you have and maybe i'll have enough cash. You can email me or text or call me at 530-310-2 9 four seven."

This was the gun that lead to the manufacture of the 1911 which is still so prolific today. This specimen remains in original condition. Like the majority of these models most of the blueing has long since faded away although there is still some original blueing mostly on the frame. The grips have honest 100+ year wear but are not broken or chipped. Mechanically in good condition, we have shot it. I took a picture of the bore although they are very difficulty to accurately picture. I would describe it as having good sharp rifling with some darkening located at the breech end of the bore. The chamber is good. The magazine included when I got the gun is not original but is rather a duo tone 1911 magazine that has had the groove added to the rear of the magazine for the heel released magazine catch. It works although the magazine isn't held in place as tightly as it should be if the magazine were original. Other than that the gun is as pictured. It would make a great addition to a Colt collection. This gun is C&R eligible."

Penney Co, New York” This rifle has a 24” barrel with strong rifling. The rifle has sling swivels, a monte carlo stock with attractive grain patterns, and a crisp trigger. It has been carried around on hunts much more than it has ever been shot. There is some light wear on the end of the round bolt handle. The stock shows numerous nicks and small scratches from use, and these are shown in the photos. The only other flaw is a broken rear iron sight, which can be replaced if desired. The gun is priced accordingly and would make a great hunter, as the flaws do not affect the function in any way, as this gun is quite accurate and has taken several big game animals. Seller no longer hunts big game and is switching to a smaller caliber. The gun has weaver style bases still attached, and is ready for scope mounting.  Detailed photos are available on request."
