TAC-XP LOW FLASH (1,150 FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX","Azusa, California, United States",$ 38,"Listed On: Monday, November 11, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=299

This load is a very high performance +P 45 acp load. The 185gr. hollow cavity Barnes all copper bullet mushrooms readily and still penetrates deeply for such a light bullet, while giving the low recoil and high velocity of a light bullet. This helps fast sight acquisition for quick/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 13 to 14 inches of penetration in flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a low flash powder which gives an important tactical advantage to the shooter as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Being blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As usual, Buffalo Bore tests and obtains our advertised velocities from real world over-the-counter firearms. We believe that the industry wide established practice of utilizing extra long test barrels to generate advertised velocities is dishonest and creates expectations that cannot be realized in real guns, in the real world, where it matters. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll actually obtain the velocities we advertise.

1193 fps -- Colt Series 90 Gold Cup, 5 inch
1183 fps -- H&K, USP Tactical, 5 inch
1158 fps -- Glock Model 21, 4.6 inch
1159 fps -- Colt series 80 Commander, 4.25 inch
1110 fps -- Glock model 30, 3.5 inch


In one of the above instances, you’ll note that a longer barrel gave velocities lower than one of the shorter barrels, showing that there is more to internal ballistics, than just barrel length.

This load reliably fed and exhibited very good accuracy in all test pistols."

80% Lower Receiver FAQ

What is an 80% Lower Receiver?

An 80% Lower is a partially completed piece of aluminum that requires simple machining/drilling of the firing pocket which holds the hammer, sear, and trigger assembly. Unlike a firearm receiver it is not required to be transferred through a Federal Firearms Licensed holder (FFL).

Is This Legal?

Yes, in every state in the U.S., it is legal to build your own firearm for personal use, as long as you can legally own a firearm. You must build the lower yourself. It is not legal for somebody else to do it for you. You are not required to engrave a serial number or any other information on the lower, unless you later decide to sell it. From the ATF:

Individuals manufacturing sporting-type firearms for their own use need not hold Federal Firearms Licenses (FFLs). However, we suggest that the manufacturer at least identify the firearm with a serial number as a safeguard in the event that the firearm is lost or stolen. Also, the firearm should be identified as required in 27 CFR 478.92 if it is sold or otherwise lawfully transferred in the future.

 No, in fact in Pennsylvania it is actually illegal for any government or police agency to keep a registry of firearms per 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111.4 (Registration of firearms). If you legally possess bring your firearms into the Pennsylvania or come into possession of the firearms legally, no further action is required. 

It should be noted however that all transfers of handguns in Pennsylvania are required to go through the Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS) and as such the Pennsylvania State Police keep a ""Sales Database"" of all handguns purchased within the Commonwealth. While almost any casual observer can see that this database clearly violates the spirit of 18 Pa.C.S. § 6111.4 (Registration of firearms), in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the Pennsylvania State Police that because the database is not a complete record of all handgun ownership (as people bringing handguns into the state do not have to register them), it does not."

The pistol was carried by the previous owner and was said to have been shot very little(around 100 or so). Judging by the wear marks on the hood of the barrel and the bore I would say that is a correct statement. It has True Dot night sights installed from the factory which are still bright and have plenty of life left. It does show wear on the raised edges of the slide release and selectors along with the muzzle of the pistol as shown in the photos below which is constant with it being carried in a kydex style holster. Rail underneath shows no wear at all. Mags show very little wear(mainly on the leading edges of the mag)with no fouling on the floorplates or mag bodies.

Differences between an Express 870 and a Police Magnum 870:

The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market. It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality. All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences. It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models. Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.

Synopses of the variances are provided below.
870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Get it now, or miss out on the opportunity to own this pristine condition 'classic' Pre-Ban American manufactured AK.

If you know Ak's - you know that Arsenal makes the most expensive, and best, with the tightest tolerances - aside from ordering a custom AK from Rifle Dynamics... which can't be touched in this price range! This rifle is stamped Arsenal Las Vegas Nevada USA, is in pristine condition and currently owned by a gunsmith.


This Arsenal Pre-Ban SAM7A1R 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.


From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.


The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.


Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.


Summary: SAM7A1R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, 2 30 round magazines, sling, and cleaning kit.


FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. AK scope rail. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.


SPECIFICATIONS Caliber: 7.62 x 39 mm Total Length: 927mm (36.5”) Barrel Length: 415 mm Weight without Magazine: 3.67kg (8 lbs.) Muzzle Velocity: 710 m/s Rate of Fire (practical): 40 rds/min Twist Rate: 1 in 240 mm Effective Range: 400 m Max Effective Range: 1350 meters/4430feet

Made in Germany.

USP Compact 45 Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame.
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life.
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes.
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish.
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves.
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel.
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories.
Ambidextrous magazine release lever.
Extended slide release.
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

This pistol has a great finish as well.    The numbers all match except the barrel has a different number.   This gun has been imported which is probably why the barrel has been swapped.   They do not allow faulty guns to be released onto the market.  

No swaps please just a certified bank check.    You pay transfer and I will pay shipping.

The L.W. Seecamp pocket pistols are known for their great workmanship, functionality, and of course, concealability. Their stainless finish work is that of fine jewelry or a fine watch! Also has the best DA trigger pull of any carry gun.

""The LWS 380 is a retarded blowback action that uses a roughed out chamber as the retarding mechanism. When round is fired, the case expands into this recessed camber area. The case expansion into the recess retards the expulsion of the empty case from the camber until chamber pressures are reduced. This retarding means slows slide travel and correspondingly increases bullet speed. It allows for a gun of diminutive size of the LWS 380 to equal the performance of a much larger pistol.""

Springfield Armory XDM 3.8 in 9MM. Combat ready and tested, with all necessary equipment for both everyday concealed carry, and duty or open carry. Equipped with only the highest quality parts constantly used and recommended by the pros like Travis Haley and James Yeager. No cheap china crap, no mass produced off the shelf equipment, all gear and modifications have been hand made, hand fitted, and put through various handgun courses without a hitch.

Firearm has roughly 750 rounds through it, always PROPERLY cleaned, lubed and maintained by professionals with high quality cleaners like Froglube. It has broken in nicely and runs like a sewing machine, easily firing both the weakest reloads and the most powerful duty ammo.

Its equipped with XS big dot 24/7 night sights. One of the fastest and mostly highly recommended combat sights. They are less than a year old and still glow as bright as the day they were installed.

The grip has been properly hand stippled, eliminating the slippery smooth polymer and giving it a comfortable yet secure grip with oily, wet or bloody hands. Not too rough like grip tape, and not too slick.

The gun comes with two 19 round magazines, and 4 13 round magazines. two of the 13 round magazines have pearce grip extensions, giving you that extra shelf space for your pinky, allowing a full firing grip, without adding length to the pistol's butt that will print under clothing.

Equipment provided includes all standard XDM gear: holster, 2 double magazine pouches (they have stipple test patterns on them) cable lock, interchangeable backstraps and grip extensions for the 19 round magazines. 
PLUS
G-Code OSH paddle holster, G-Code dual magazine paddle pouch, G-Code INCOG IWB system w/ mag caddy
PLUS
KaBar TDI Knife (used by police to aid in weapon retention scenarios) in custom kydex concealment sheath.

The G-Code equipment is expensive and top tier equipment, do your research on this, this isn't your average blackhawk run of the mill stuff.

The equipment has been expertly used, not just sitting in a safe, so it shows minimal signs of use such as slight holster wear on the slide. all equipment is at its peak of use, just broken in, and is designed to be used. Not just sit on a shelf and look pretty. That being said EVERYTHING functions at 100% No repairs or replacement of parts will be necessary in the foreseeable future.

The ONLY reason this equipment is being sold, is because the duty weapon I will be required to use is a Block *cough* Glock. And I believe in minimizing the amount of weapons I train with to maximize familiarization. Even though I believe I am taking a serious step down.

Do your own research on this weapon and its accessories, and you will see that this set up is top notch.

900 bucks for the kit. AZ DL required, AZ CCW preferred. 

I may entertain Glock 19's ONLY as partial trade, depending on if its been properly cared for. I can tell.

I would to trade for something in the area of 4-500. Ideally would be for a Gen 4 Glock. But open to a 7.62 rifle as well if its the right one"
