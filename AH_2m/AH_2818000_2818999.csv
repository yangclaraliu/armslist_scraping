Planned on rebluing & making it a full time shooter but have moved on to anothet project.  It still has most blueing but there are spots around. This pistol is original & un altered. No safety upgrades. I believe it is from the late 1950's.

This piece started as a Stock Saiga that looked like poop to me. 

I am a combat VET from Afghanistan and was actually able to bring back a few butt-stocks and for ward grips. I lightly sanded and varnished them up and bam!! She looks amazing. I had to relate the breather and add an exhaust tube for blow back, and she also has the traditional AK-47 front slant break. 

This really is ONE OF A KIND!! She has 100-200 round through her all for test firing. Ungraded trigger, and mag well has been changed to accept tradition 30 round banana clip mags. Barrel is CHROME LINED for Much easier cleaning. 

If you would like some more pictures or have any questions feel free to call or text zack anytime. If you would like to shoot it, you are more then welcome to test fire it at the Orange County Brea indoor shooting range. The rifle comes with (1) 10 round tapco mag so we can do papers on it. As you can see from the pictures it also comes with the AK-47 authentic cleaning rod. I have 2 mags that will also come with the deal, they are parts kits 30 rounders ( WINK WINK PEOPLE! ) 

HMMMM soooo lets see. Yeah, I think that about sums it up. Trigger pull and reset are just UNBELIEVABLY SMOOTH!! Come on by and check her out. I do not expect this to last long being as she has wooden stock and forward grip from Afghanistan. OH!! She also has the CA - AK bullet button -which you can take off after you buy it, lol. But to do papers you have to have it. 

No cash and carry at all. Buyer is responsible for ALL DROS FEES. I am firm on my price but your welcome to try and haggle me, as I understand WE ALL HAVE TO TRY RIGHT! HAHA! 

Alright folks talk to ya laters. I also have an AR that I will be posting up stay tuned for that one!!

Great condition. No issues, near new. Comes with 1 magazine, springfield grips. VZ frag grips can be included for an additional fee ($50). The gun is a match pistol with bull barrel, night sights and all the bells and whistles. Comes with a Wilson mag well installed. Comes with box and papers. This is an absolutely awesome gun that was produced in 2012. These are not easily to come by. It is also railed, and extremely lightweight.

Rear sight is a Magpul MBUS folding rear sight.  Also rugged and accurate.

Lower is a CMMG with CMMG lower parts kit.  Stock single stage trigger.
