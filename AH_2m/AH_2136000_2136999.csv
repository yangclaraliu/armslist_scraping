This rifle originally came from the factory with the black synthetic stock and accu trigger. I customized this rifle for myself, but never fired it. It is mounted on a walnut stained birch stock with the savage ""chief"" medallion set in the stock grip, rubber recoil pad. The stock synthetic trigger guard has been replaced with a low luster metal trigger guard (and also comes with another low luster metal trigger guard that will fit the synthetic stock if preferred) and a 3-9x40 Bushnell scope with medium height rings has been mounted and the scope has been bore sighted. The barrel is completely free floated up to the receiver. It also comes with a new Savage leather sling with logo and sling rings, and a black (extra) padded case with shoulder strap. The original box and paperwork and accu trigger adjustment tool also comes with it. The trigger is set at about 3.5 pounds. There is also 120 rounds of .243 ammo. One box of Remington 80 grain power soft point, two boxes of Federal 100 grain soft point and three boxes of Winchester100 grain power point. 

I originally customized this rifle for myself, but the economy being what it is I need to sell it (before I even try it). It is new, never has been fired and you are getting all my work on it for free.

With my work included this would cost you well over $1550.00

The cost of the rifle and all that comes with it is worth well over $1180.00

I am asking $599.00 for everything, that includes the ammo too!

Please only serious enquiries. I am losing allot of money on this (to say the least) already, so please do not ask for trades, or anything unreasonable.

Anyone who knows about these type of bolt action rifles, or the work that goes into customizing one, knows that this is a wonderful deal and that they are getting a very rare deal. This is priced to sell!

If interested I sell to only those with a CCW, or who are willing to do a background check.

The barrel is a heavy barrel with full length guide rod. No bushing type cone barrel which makes lock up much better and increases reliability. This gun started as a stainless steel frame and was built from the ground up to be an everyday carry fighting 45 auto. It features Wilson Combat hammer and sear ,Wolff extra power recoil spring, Smith & Alexander arched officers mainspring housing to provide first shot quick on target and the original 1911 feel of a fighting 45. The frame has what I call spur ""Buzz Saw"" checkering on front strap. This was done entirely by hand the ""old school"" way and looks and feels great. This actually really helps manage the recoil to prevent shifting in the hand during firing. It has a Cast Iron Duracoat finish and Spalted Cherry Wood smooth grips from Brazil which contrast beautifully with the dark grey finish.
 It comes with three Wilson Combat Officers model magazines and two colt logo 6 round mags with improved colt followers for a total of 5 magazines.. This combat carry system is in a word... ""badass"". Not just because of how it looks but because of how quick it is into action and how reliable it is. The heavy barrel provides better accuracy and I defy you to find a five inch 1911 that will out shoot this gun. It is superb. The sights are special too. It features the high profile Colt Commander rear u notch and .225 front sight with white dot. This system is called ""operator sights"" due to the single focal point of the front white dot. I prefer this system to other because it does not confuse or require two aiming focuses. I just look for front dot and go to work. I am offering this gun with three mags and FREE SHIPPING TO GEORGIA for $450 flat. Try to find another Officers frame with Commander slide for even twice that price. It cannot be done. For those of you in the know...this system is the best of all worlds for 1911's. Arguably the the most reliable carry version ever put together. This gun is barely broken in and has approx 150 rounds thru it. It is reliable and functions great.  Text me (only) for more photos or info REDACTED"

The finger grooves have been removed, the hump in the Backstrap has been reduced, trigger guard undercut, support hand index added under the trigger guard, thumb and trigger finger index point added on the side of frame. All stock internals with polished mating surfaces and the sear/striker interface has been stoned to take the sponginess out of the break. This gives the standard trigger a VERY crisp break at about 5lbs. A stainless guide rod and a factory extended slide release round out the package. The gun has about 200 rnds through it. Comes with three mags and factory box. I am asking $600 for this gun. Glock, sig sauer, kimber, smith, Wesson, Springfield, M&P, 1911, .45."

This is a Smith and Wesson M&P 15 Sport rifle. The rifle is brand new, and only has like 40 rounds through it (it functions flawlessly).

It is equipped with a BCM Gunfighter ambidextrous charging handle, and Battle Arms ambidextrous safety an A2 stock (this was purchased used, and is older and has been spraypainted over the years, but it's better quality than the cheaper stuff you find after-market these days and it has a stow hole with a nice, strong cover), a GSG A2 style carry handle which works great and is accurate (the handle has been weight-relieved with holes).

Not all muzzle devices are created the same.  There aren't many muzzle brakes and compensators that 'understand' proper high-pressure gas dynamics.  The VG6 GAMMA 556 was designed using state of the art engineering techniques, utilizing CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and CAE (Computer Aided Engineering).  100% CNC machined for optimal performance.  Stainless steel construction for longevity. 
The VG6 GAMMA 556 is a muzzle brake and compensator hybrid.  It virtually eliminates recoil and minimizes muzzle movement.  The unique combination of both braking and compensating features inspire shooter confidence and allows the shooter to make very fast follow up shots. 
The VG6 GAMMA 556 has been tuned for versatility as well.  The brake has been optimized for 10.5"" to 18.5"" barrel lengths, but ultra-shorty SBRs and AR-Pistols with shorter barrels and full sized 20"" rifles will benefit greatly from the muzzle brake as well.

Let me make this clear, I am 19. It is 100% legal for me to purchase a handgun from you, so long as you do not hold a Federal Firearms License (you know who you are). If you are unsure of the law or have any questions, I am more than happy to cite both federal and Washington State law.

I have been looking for one of these for a longggg time so I will pay top dollar.

This rifle was issued to the Heer (German Army) back in 1936-37 and comes with all appropriate and matching Nazi proofs, markings, and Waffenampts. From the stock, to the bolt, to the barrel, this rifle is COMPLETELY matching and authentic (as all pictures and inspections can verify). 

As recorded, this rifle is one of 270,000 that were issued from the Mauser-Oberndorf factory during 1936. These 270,000 rifles were then distributed to the varying branches of the German Military, the Heer (Army), the Kriegsmarine (Navy), and the Luftwaffe (Air Force). Mathematically speaking, that means that this is 1 of around 90,000 identical rifles. Even better, there is no marking, no ""X"" mark, no coating of cosmoline that would indicate that this rifle was a Soviet capture. That being said, that makes this rifle even more Collectable! No one wants a dirty, mismatched, reblued Soviet capture. They want the real deal. This, friends, is that ""real deal"".

The downside of this rifle is only minor. Firstly, it may just be too collectable to shoot (sorry). Secondly, since it was not Russian reblued, it is now noticeable that the original bluing done by Mauser Obendorf is wearing off. Due note, that does not mean that the entirety of the bluing has worn off, just that it doesn't look brand new.

Finally, pitting. Though the pitting isn't bad and can be ""stoned"" out, it would require removing the original bluing applied by Mauser, something my heart won't allow me to do yet. Although I do agree that any sort of pitting is a problem, I must attest that this IS a 77 year-old rifle that has seen its share of the Second World War. 

On the topic of usage, I must say that this is one of the nicest barrels I have ever seen (like brand new nice!). I have checked and verified that this barrel is indeed an original one and not rebarreled from Mauser mid-war nor from Bubba after obtaining the rifle post-War. The Grooves, lands, and overall rifling of this rifle are deep and crisp leading me to believe that this may have been used in some guard post or similar position. 

The last thing that I will speak of with this rifle is possibly the most important. As stated per Mauser-Oberndorf, around 100,000 of these rifles were issued specifically for the Waffen SS for guarding Concentration camps. The tell-tale signs of this issuing are runes engraved into the stock near the pistol grip or near the barrel. Other signs will be listed in a following link for verification of information listen here. So far, I have not been able to find any signs showing that this was indeed a rifle transferred to the Waffen SS for Concentration Camp duty, however, the serial number, date of manufacture, and lack of barrel usage leads me to believe that it is not out of the realm of possibility!

Please, reply to this post for pictures and pricing. I am willing to be flexible on pricing as I know that this will both intrigue collectors and the average buyer alike. Shoot me an offer and I will respond in kind.

For anymore information or verification on what I just said above, please view this website. It is both informative and useful for verifying my information. Please view paragraphs 4-8 for my rifle.

776,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2136776,For Sale:  GECO German 26.5mm Flare Gun Package,"South OP, Kansas City, Kansas",$ 325,"Listed On: Friday, September 20, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a functioning GECO LP42 26.5mm signal pistol. The pistol is used and in good condition. This is NOT one of the cheap plastic and steel HK flare pistols - The only plastic part on this pistol is the grip. The frame, barrel, levers, are all steel. 

There is one minor flaw with this pistol and that is that the plastic grips seem to be cracked. That being said, the grips feel sturdy and I do not think that they will break anytime soon unless you mistreat the signal pistol. 

There is also some tape residue on the end of the barrel that should come right off with some goo gone or similar solvent. I have not touched the pistol because I do not want to alter it. This is how it was given to me, this is how it will be delivered to you. The pistol shows signs of use and holster wear. 

Pistol is marked with the following:

27985   05/64  << serial, month, and year

Sign. Pist. 26,5mm 

These flare pistols are high quality and will last a lifetime. They are getting harder and harder to come by. 

Pistol comes with a cleaning brush, Holster (rubber/vinyl/canvas material - issued, used in good condition), and if you are local, I will include 5 red 26.5mm flares.  I CAN NOT AND WILL NOT SHIP FLARES BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH MY TIME TO GO THROUGH THE HAZMAT SHIPPING PROCESS

These signal devices are great for hunters, woodsmen, boaters, or collectors. This flare pistol is 100% functional. 

You can purchase an adapter to allow the pistol to shoot cheaper 12 gauge flares as well. 

Interested buyers only. I have not seen any of these for sale lately, grab it now before its gone...or I decide to keep it."

Each barrel has approximately 150 rounds through it. It also comes with a blackhawk holster. 

This gun has been fired very little--it is in pristine condition and looks absolutely new. It comes with original box, papers and accessories. You won't find a more complete Sig package out there--it is ready to be the ultimate suppressor host, duty weapon or home defense gun. It was purchased less than 6 months ago and I have over 1200 invested in it. 

I will also throw in a Sig Sauer cleaning mat, since this is my only sig. I am selling this because I am transitioning solely to Glock for training purposes.

This is a Sig P290 ultra compact 9mm concealed carry pistol with removable frame mounted laser sight, molded holster that fits with the laser attached.  There is an extended capacity mag that makes it much more friendly to large hands, then there is one with a pinky extension and one that is flush.  It was new in December 2012 and has had less than 300 rounds fired.    I've decided that I'm a much better shot with my Glock 26 and it's worth the sacrifice of the concealable benefit this pistol offers.  No sense in letting it gather dust in the safe, so here it is for sale.  This pistol is also equipped with the Siglite Night Sights and the nitron finish.  It is all packaged up in the original tupperware and includes the original documentation as well."

Back when Bill Clinton was passing anti-gun legislation I bought some new Beretta 92FS pistols, a couple of them in stainless (Inox in Italian).  Going through my safe I came across this Beretta that was never used.  I tried looking for another NIB Stainless Beretta 92FS made in Italy to see what they are selling for, and I haven't seen a single one in a month or so of looking.  So, based on that, I'm going to assume they are reasonably rare.  If you've never compared one of the Italian made Stainless 94FS pistols made back then to the US made, you won't believe the difference in build quality.  They feel completely different with the Italian model making the US model feel like it was cast in a sand mold and never polished.

Included is the pistol, original warranty and manual, original 'oiled paper' in the original box along with the original 2 stainless 15 round magazines.  The date of manufacture for this pistol is mid 1994.  I wore some white cloth gloves and wiped pretty well all of the dried original oil off that had turned sort of orange yellow.

I actually found another of these that I bought at the time that has the beautiful original hardwood grips and I honestly don't think the slide on it has even been racked except when I bought it.  I'm not sure I want to sell it.  I fell in love with it's beauty all over again.  If some collector needs an original '90's era Stainless 92FS made in Italy with original wood grips, email me and we might be able to make a deal.

Sale to an individual will require the individual to have a carry permit and proper ID.  Any shipping MUST go through FFL dealer at buyer's expense.  I'll stay on top of removing the ad if I sell it or change my mind on selling.  So, basically, if you're seeing this ad, it's probably still for sale.  Sorry, but I'm not interested in any trades at this time."
