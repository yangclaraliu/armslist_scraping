The Laser pointer is an additional $50.00 + 7% tax. The sneaky pete leather holster was $65.00 including shipping. I am including this in the package because the holster was specially made for this model handgun.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frameâ¢,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500â¢, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

Good for a lefty (cylinder release is on top of the bodyguard not in the traditional left side) which is pretty unique to this model.  It also has a factory integrated laser that can be turned on Solid, Pulse (which is kind of nice) or off.  Impulse buy used from GAT for $350 + tax about 2 months ago (can show buyer receipt).  I have cleaned it once and it's been in the safe ever since.  Basic nylon IWB holster and (3) boxes of Magtech 38 SPL included in sale along with a simple plastic case.  Timing is accurate and no play on the cylinder (locks up tight like it should).  I don't have a round count since it was used, but I was told when purchasing by one of the guys I trust there that it was traded in because the guy's wife was too recoil sensitive with this particular model (likely low - no visible signs of wear).  Originally intended to be a potential CCW alternate, but I have decided on something altogether different that will work better with what I wear on a daily basis.  I will not separate ammo as I rarely fire .38 over .357 in other revolvers.  Valuing ammo at $65 + firearm at $350.  $415.00 obo takes it, all laws will be observed by both parties including the new FOID card check on the ISP.

Have shot a couple of times, but I am weapons instructor on base and work with a certified Glock armorer, I have any and all tools needed to keep this gun in tip top shape.
With that being said, this glock has an adjustable trigger (pre-travel/ over-travel reduction pins) and can either be modded to super sensitive (or hairpin as the movies say) or just right for you. Here is the link that descibes it in detail ( http://www.glockstore.com/pyramid-trigger-ultimate-system-1 ) if that doesnt work, its called a Ultimate Pyramid Trigger by Kenny Mcgill at Glockstore.com. Everything is polished and coated in Gold Titanium Nitrade so it is very crisp on the trigger pull every shot. The parts I had installed were done by a Certified Glock armorer and the package of things installed were a titanium safety plunger, skeleton striker, black trigger, silver safety, connector, and competition springs. All in all it boils down to a 250$, best drop in trigger available. Turn it into a Race gun without worrying about the insides.
 Retail on a Glock 19 Gen 4 Brand new are in the $550 range, im selling this one for $650 and you will get:
* A Glock 19 Gen 4 (no scratches)
*Three factory Magazines
*One Happy Stick aka 33 Round magazine

This is a Forbes Rifle in 30-06.  New Ultra Light Arms (NULA) owner Melvin Forbes licensed a military arms maker to make these rifles as FORBES RIFLES using his plans and with a match-grade barrel.  Forbes himself makes the graphite stock.  This rifle is EXACTLY the same as NULA rifles but with a different finish on the metal - just as light and just as strong and accurate.

It only weighs 5 pounds 12 ounces with the scope mounts attached.

This particular rifle shoots .6 inch groups at 100 yards with Remington Factory 150 grain ammunition.   Also pictured are other hand loads and factory loads under 1 MOA, and I didn't work particularly hard finding/developing loads.  I bought it earlier this month but now I just need the money.

The Leupold VX-I 4x-12x scope is NOT included and the rifle also comes with a hard case.

There are several large companies that sell remanufactured (reloaded) ammo across the country. Retailers like midway even carry it.  There is also no license required to sell ammunition. There is no such FFL for selling ammo. The only FFL one would need is a type 06 or type 07 if they wanted to reload ammunition AND sell it as a business FOR PROFIT. Also should mention it is extremely difficult to prove you loaded what you sold AND you made a profit. Selling a few here and there and trading does NOT require an FFL and you can only get an FFL (other than a C&R) if you are engaged in the business TO MAKE MONEY.   An individual would definitely assume risk/liability for the reloads. Your ""friend"" that supposedly went to jail must have been 1- reloading the ammo himself, 2- selling the ammo himself, and 3- doing so much business that he attracted the attention of the ATF (maybe by mailing it through the post office or selling it to people that can't legally buy it). BTW, I am a licensed manufacturer so I kind of know what the rules are since I have to follow them."

At only 1â wide, the XD-Sâ¢ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-Sâ¢ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

This is The Original CZ-75, all metal construction that's been copied all around the world but never truly matched in quality -âAccept no substitutes...â

The hammer-decock model allows you to carry a chambered round without having to engage the safety on like 1911's. The hammer down/double action first pull trigger means quick reaction times and positive target acquisition without fumbling with safeties or unintentional discharges in a stressful situation.

I am the original owner and took this pistol to the range less than a handful of times. Under 50 rounds down the barrel since new. Purchased as my full-sized carry but never got around to buying a holster and so never used as intended. On their recommendation, I had CZ Customs install their lighter mainspring for lighter trigger pull. The original factory mainspring included along with 2 hi-cap magazines, original carry case, and all original paperwork.

Absolutely no wear on the poly-finish or internal mechanics. Field-stripped cleaned & oiled after every range session before returning to the safe. This is truly a beautiful auto-pistol with a proven history for reliability and ease of use. You know when you pick it up this is quality in your hand.

I paid full retail with tax out the door during the panic but you can have it for less.  Make me your best offer and I'll respond if I am interested -so we don't waste time haggling. Please include your phone number if you expect a reply. This is a face to face bill-of-sale transaction with a legal AZ resident only -no tax & no shipping. 

If you are reading this, the CZ is still available. Ad will be pulled immediately upon sale so no need to ask. Thank you for your interest.  I am in Bisbee but go to Tucson on business.  Feel free to contact me with your offer."

 The advanced SureFire SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake, which fits M4 / M16 weapons and variants with 1/2-28 muzzle threads, greatly reduces both recoil impulse and muzzle rise so that the weapon tracks straight back to keep you on target for faster shot-to-shot recovery. Its patented Impulse Diffusion design minimizes side blast and rear-directed concussion effects. The SFMB-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-AttachÂ® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command.

The class is the NRA Basic Pistol / FL Concealed Weapons Permit class.  It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm I recommend you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / back round check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.  I hold the public classes in the conference rooms at Homewood Suites by Pensacola Airport (or your location for a private class of 4 or more students).  The class is $75 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.

Call John at REDACTED

Leupold model 53436 Competition 40X45 Fixed Power rifle scope with the Leupold 1/8 MOA TargetDot Reticle and a Black Matte finish. This scope has tactical dials that have easy to read 1/8"" click adjustments at 100 yards (1/8 MOA) and the parallax is adjustable from 50 feet to infinity. 

Leupold is probably the most recognized name in rifle scopes at shooting competitions. When going up against tough competitors where the margin of win or loose can be measured in hundredths or thousandths of an inch you need a top quality scope that was designed especially for the competition arena. The Leupold Competition Scopes have features like side focus, 1/8 MOA Target Adjustments, 30mm tubes, and threaded lens covers for added protection of the objective and ocular lenses. Of course, they also have the superior optics that Leupold has based their reputation on. 

Every Leupold scope made has a full Lifetime Warranty but they are so finely crafted and ruggedly built the warranty will probably never be needed. 

All Leupold scopes are made in the U.S.A."

The class is the NRA Basic Pistol / FL Concealed Weapons Permit class.  It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm I recommend you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / back round check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.  I hold the public classes in the conference rooms at Homewood Suites by Pensacola Airport (or your location for a private class of 4 or more students).  The class is $75 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.
