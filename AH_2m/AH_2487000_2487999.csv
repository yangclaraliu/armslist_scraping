I'm getting away from 45acp as I have switched my primary carry caliber to 357sig, and this is the last of my 45s. Factory parkerized finish, factory night sights. I have 4 magazines for it, 2 factory 7 rounders, a Kimber 8 round and a Novak 8 rounc. I do not have the factory holster or mag carrier that came with it, took them out of the case and they disappeared at some point from my gear cabinet.

My gun has an extremely low round count (in the neighborhood of 250, has never seen the inside of a holster. It is completely factory, the trigger was adjusted for minimal reset travel. It also includes a set of VZ Recon grips to sweeten the deal. 

I also have over 150 rounds of Factory FMJ 230gr ammo and 12 rounds of premium JHP ammo, that I can include for another $75. 

Gun runs extremely well and is super accurate, I just really don't want to deal with setting up to reload 45acp, but if I can't get my asking price or a decent trade before the end of the year I will just move ahead with reloading 45acp and keep the gun. 

Price is firm at $825 without the ammo or $900 with the ammo. Trade value $1000, and will come with the ammo. 

(I'm not willing to sell the ammo before the gun is gone, no PM's about the ammo until I list it separately)

Please keep trade offers reasonable, my asking price is about $200 less than than I have into this, and my trade value is still $100 less than I have into this. I am not going to consider low offers, as I have no ""need"" to sell or trade this gun, other than convenience."

The transmission has about 3k miles on it and I installed a Rankin Racing Rail Shifter. It has a 4.11 LSD differential. This car came factory with AC but it isn't hooked up. It has factory 4 piston front disk brakes with no power brake assist. The rally 2 wheels on it are freshly sand blasted and painted the factory color. This car is meant to be driven and that is what I do with it. I have had this car for 4 years.

MOE® Carbine Stock – Mil-Spec Model

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

 The Magpul MOE Stock – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

MOE® Grip – AR15/M16

The MOE Grip provides Magpul quality, feel, and durability in an economical, drop-in upgrade for the standard AR15/M16/M4 pistol grip. The ergonomic, hand filling design combines aggressive texturing with storage core capability. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, the one-piece reinforced polymer construction provides simplicity and a reduced cost while still maintaining the durability needed to withstand operational environments. The MOE Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. All mounting hardware included."

If you're reading this ad then you know all about the history of the EBR. I carried a Mk14 Mod 0 in Iraq and had to build one when I came home. The scope is absolutely perfect for this setup. The rifle prints consistent 1"" groups at 100 yards and with the 0-4 power scope it's great for reflexive fire as well. I'm selling because I'm going thru a divorce and really need the money."

Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 9x19mm pistol also retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments"".
I have this G17 Gen 4 for sale. it has exactly 150 rounds through it. I bought it for IDPA, used in one match and after that is back in the box. I rather use my G19, even being less accurate, it's what I carry. I installed a Ghost Kit (Evo Elite + spring kit). That makes the trigger much better (my opinion) , shorter reset and up take , less over travel and way lighter ( about 3 1/2 lbs). If you want stock I can switch back for you. It comes with everything from the case manufacture , 3 mags, reloader, lock, extra Back Straps, paper work, and obviously the stock connector and springs.

That's 17.50 per box. Heck of a lot cheaper than Walmart. Yes, you can buy PMC for 15 from some people on here, but c'mon - have you ever shot pmc? If you have you know it's corrosive, it's pmc and it's cheap.

**1 Stock w/ Tang Block 

 (Tang Block is not included when you buy these stocks originally... it has to be bought separately if your AK is not a paratrooper model) 

Will replace your under-folder on your paratrooper model AK if needed replacing or with the tang block, can be installed on a standard AK just like changing the original wood stocks to a 6 position or side folder- NO DRILLING NECESSARY. 2 SCREWS and 2 minutes and you're done. This stock is solid, super-tight, with no sway AT ALL and is about an 1/8th of an inch thick steel throughout it's entire construction. It also has the strap loop right there where the ""folding"" button is, like on an AR where the castle nut is located... (It's Not in the way or anything, just letting you know where it's located)

It's already attached to the tang block so no installment needed there... It's ready to go.

** 3- 5 round mags included. All steel, Russian made."

I like ammo and tools as well. You can also order wood and we can make a deal when I get the type of wood you want.
