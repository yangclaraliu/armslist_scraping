What makes this rifle extremely desirable is: 1. This is the first year these rifles were produced and 2. This particular specimen carries a very low serial number (4xx). These rifles were made by the world famous Belgium Company FN, using their Supreme action. FN is so highly regarded that oodles of firearms makers have used their actions to produce their own firearms, such as Weatherby, Husqvarna, Sako, Colt, H&R, and Sears just to name a few.  The Safari rifles are considered by many as one of the best production rifles ever made. They are a control round fed action rifle with a pre 64 Winchester 70 type trigger system (the best and most reliable trigger system every invented). Scope not included.  It no longer is carried in its original wood stock, but rather a bedded Bell and Carlson synthetic stock that is impervious to humidity, rain and temperature changes. There is no rust or pitting on the metal and the bluing is phenomenal for a rifle of this age. The only blemish to the stock is a small bit of the soft recoil pad is missing at the toe.  All in all, this is a sweet rig selling at a sweet price.  I’m currently not interested in trades. As always, I highly encourage that you do your research and price check to ensure that you’re not getting “bent over” if this rifle interests you."

I purchased this gun new in Dec. 2012.  As you can see by the photos, it's in like new condition.  It's only had about 100 rounds fired at a local indoor range.  I've switched to competitive target shooting; so now this great gun just sits in the gun safe.

More photos available on request.  Buyer's responsibility to ensure compliance with all local firearm laws.

Price:  $350 for rifle, scope, and listed accessories

I built this entire platform myself piece by piece (all purchased at Rainer Arms) with the goal of creating one of the lightest and well-built systems for a true rifle of self-defense and accuracy. You will not see this rifle anywhere else because it is not a Noveske or Rainier Arms complete. This is its own system dedicated to being tight fit between upper and lower and no play in any part what so ever.

Everything from the trigger group to the BCM battle comp has been assembled professionally. I’ve only shot 250 premium brass rounds through the barrel for break-in period and sighting the irons. This is a brand new rifle.

Too many dealers?  Don't look at their posts.
Price is too high?  Don't buy it.
Don't like what people are charging for 22 ammo?  Don't pay it.  keep camping out at Wal Mart.  And adding to the 60,000 rounds in your closet.

I have bought, sold, and traded here on AL for the last 6 months, and I like it.
Yeah, you have to do your homework about pricing.  yeah, you have to deal with low ballers.  I think that is why so many listing prices are so high.  But that is what you get in a FREE market.  if you don't like it, don't buy.  Or sell.

Illegal activity?  Only if the buyer and or seller make it illegal.  Follow the laws.  Look them up if you don't know them.

We are all grown folks (or, should be, by law).

SO QUIT YER BITCHIN' or move on."

 The only reason for selling is that it was ""totalled"" by the insurance company after last springs hail and tornado.

 The body is rough up close, but pretty good looking at 20 paces. 

 Hail Damage, dent in left side rear door. Surface rust on bottom edges of body.

 Tree limb drag marks on both sides. This truck has been working for a living. ""Hunting and Fishing""

 The inside is pretty good. 

 Two places in the cloth seat where the stitching has broken and the foam rubber shows. 

 It is a cloth bench seat, front and back. Rubber floorboards are in great condition.

 The miles are aproximatly 145000.

 It is an automatic V8 gas engine. (runs out very smooth and reliable)

 4x4 is a shifter on the floor with manual hubs on the front axle. 

 I had new ball joints put in on both sides about 9 months ago.

 Has a recent alignment. (Drives straight down the road with no hands""

 I would call this on of the nicest running beat up work trucks on the market. 

 Camper shell is painted to match and in similar condition as the truck.

 The little shock sticks are worn out, so you have to hold the windows open on the sides.

 Rear window works as it shoold. 

 Truck has no leaks or drips.

 If it weren't for the hail and tornado storms, I would keep this truck for ever because it has proven itself to me. 

 As far as the title is concerned, it is green and in my hand with no lean, however the insurance did total the truck from storm damage. I am not sure if this makes it salvage title or what, but I can find out if your interested. 

 I promise that my description is more critical than yours would be. This is a great truck with some dings and bangs.

 P.S. This truck seems to attract 10 to 12 point bucks. The deer hanger does not come with the truck.
