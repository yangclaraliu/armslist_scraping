Product Information, Features, Specifications:

This item is a Kel-Tec Sub 2000 G17 9mm Rifle. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

It is used and has been kept in very good condition. It has always been promptly cleaned and Bore buttered. It is capable of shooting the max loads of powder(150gr). It shoots the 209 primers and I have a breech plug wrench that will come with it. I bought a new Bone collector this year so I could shoot the max loads and not feel them quite so much, I'm a little older now. I don't need 2 long range muzzle loaders. I am in NE Indiana, I can ship this as its a muzzle loader. You may add 3% for paypal to ship this and You will pay shipping. Paypal will be used as transferring someone money for goods or services. I would prefer a face to face meeting to do the transaction, somewhere in public in Indiana if possible."

Factory Description:

Designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. To install remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided Interface Block. SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install are provided. Shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward. As a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer. Compatible with Mil-Spec and commercial buffer tubes. Some sling plates may not be compatible. Includes SSAR-15 OGR, interface block, hex key and instructions.

I've debated long and hard on selling This piece,Finally decided it would be better suited with someone who is actually going to shoot it,and use it as it was intended. I have mainly just had it as a ""show and tell piece"". I may entertain some trades on this gun but they would have to be good ones or partial Trades Asking 1050 which is well below what I paid for this gun,Msrp and The gun blue book value this gun is in 100 percent shape."

Nighthawk includes a crazy amount of extras on the Dominator, but here are the extras I paid for...

Naked Slide (no huge DOMINATOR engraved on the slide), no front cocking serrations (hate 'em), flush cut slide stop, fiber optic front sight, rear is standard night sight, and the stainless frame is hard chromed (Nighthawk charges for this now). 

This gun is well over $3500 new with the options, and then you have the 6-12 month wait to get it built. There is no damage, no scratches, no rust. I have never carried it in a holster, so no holster wear. I have all paperwork, factory test target, and Night Hawk gun rug. I bought this new in 2011, and nobody else has ever fired it. 

If you think your Kimber or Springfield is nice(and they are, I have both), you won't believe this thing. Check out all details at Nighthawks website. Trigger pull is 3.5 lbs, and defines the ""breaking glass"" description."

It's a shooter & not a safe queen.  It's accurate, reliable, and a good quality rifle, but it isn't the prettiest one in the world.  It's used but not a beater.  Round count is appx 3500.

I built this rifle about 10 yrs ago.  It was during the AWB so the bayonet lug is neutered and the muzzle device is a Cav Comp & not a regular flash hider.  Rifle was built on a stripped Century Arms lower, a JT lower parts kit, a bushmaster upper, & a Les Baer bolt carrier group with chrome carrier.  1:9 twist heavy barrel.

Included is one USGI 30 rd magazine, an inexpensive but functional 4x20 scope made to mount on the carry handle, a carry handle gooseneck mount for a red dot, and a carry handle scope mount - everything you see in the picture.

This rifle will shoot 1"" groups all day long with decent ammo.  It really likes 55 gr Hornady Vmax bullets & I've gotten groups a little under an inch from sandbags with it. It feeds & functions flawlessly on any ammo I've ever tried including Wolf steel cased.  It has a 5.56 chamber.

A few little cosmetic dings & scratches.  Not beat up & overall I'd call it very good condition for a ~10 y/o rifle with 3k+ rounds.  I'd trust it fight off a zombie horde or alien invasion.

Only selling to fund a purchase of something I don't have the cash for right now.  I'm up to 8 ARs now so time to thin the herd.

Price is pretty firm & I won't ship.  Not interested in any trades.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need more detailed pics."

This gun sat in it's original S&W box from the 1970's to 2002 when it was willed to me. It had never been fired, and was still wrapped in the brown paper Smith used to use. 

I added a Crimson Trace grip and it has about 500 rounds through it. Most was .38 special, as it was my wife's favorite to shoot. It has never been modified, side plate never removed. Has original adjustable sights. 

Includes original wood grip, a rubber Pachmayer grip, and the original S&W box. Even have the ad from the Rocky Mountain News listing the sale prices for pistols that weekend. I think it was 1972. 

Lost my job, so it has to go. However, price is firm and well worth it. Also have a lot of .38 ammo I will sell for a great deal to buyer. 

Thanks for looking, and I can send pics to anyone that would like  me to."

Title in hand, Tabs are up to date.
Engine doesn't have exact milage because the odometer is broken. I bought it from a friend who's uncle gifted it to him. My friend got it with 65k on it. The engine was rebuilt. Still runs strong and is really reliable. 

I just recently changed the windshield wiper motor, PCV Valve, Thermostat, o2 Sensor, flushed the radiator, and rotated the tires. Clutch was changed last year. There is absolutely nothing mechanically wrong on this vehicle. Only damage is cosmetics and its to front left part of the hood, left part of the fender, and light. Nothing major. No leaks of any kind. Doesnt burn oil. Lights works, Signal works, has working aftermarket deck and speakers, and 5% window tint.

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time other than what is listed below. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only and insured shipping is additional.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL FTF firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Cheers,
