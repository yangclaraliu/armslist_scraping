Bell & Carlson Tactical Medalist Style 3 w/ ""Hook"" Model 2956 Long Range Lightweight Remington 700 Short Action Stock

* Fits factory hinged floorplate magazine System;
* Cut for the standard Rem #3 Varmint / Tactical barrel;
* Includes the 700 SPS, XCR, VTR Varmint and Tactical type rifles.

The Hook"" is designed as a “drop-in” for the heavy barrel Remington Model 700 BDL or DBM (short action). It has an extended grip and a fairly wide forend with dual front sling studs to allow for both bipod and sling attachment. The hooked cutout underside is designed as a steady-holding feature - simply jam your off-hand into the recess for an isometrically-solidified rest, ideal for varmint, target or tactical field applications!
The stock has no checkering and like all in the “Medalist” line, it has the integral aluminum bedding system that is computer designed and CNC machined out of aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum. The aluminum block extends through the forearm to add strength and stiffness and incorporates the attachment of the front sling swivel for additional security. An aluminum “tail piece” also extends from the bedding block through the grip area to add rigidity and to strengthen the stock. The stock is designed to be “free-floated” and it comes with a standard length of pull of 13 3/4” with a Pachmayr Decellerator pad. Textured BLACK.

Was installed on my Rem 700 SPS tactical for range use only. Decided to go a different way with a TAC-21 chassis system. This stock is LIKE NEW in original box with no dings or sratches. Stock retails for over $300 MidwayUSA sells it for $290 plus shipping."

The SureFire High-Capacity Magazine is compatible with all Mil Spec AR-15 variants and other firearms that function with standard AR-15 pattern magazines. Constructed entirely from Mil-Spec aluminum and then Type III hard coat anodized for durability. Surefire magazines feed smoothly and reliably were designed to be left loaded indefinitely. Additionally, Surefire Magazines can be disassembled for cleaning via the removable floorplate. Also, unlike other high capacity magazines, the Surefire High-Capacity Magazines DO NOT require dry lubricants for reliability. 

Due to their unique 4x2 quad stack configuration, the magazines add firepower without excessive bulk. The 100 -round magazine is five inches longer than a standard 30-round magazine and narrower than two 30-round magazines clipped together. 

Surefire High-Capacity Magazines can be seated in a rifle with a closed bolt, even when fully loaded-no downloading required. Surefire ensured this by allowing for differing tolerances between SAAMI and NATO specifications.

Other than running for president, mister Landon achieved numerous goals, like beeing governor of Kansas for 2 terms (only one to be reelected )and becoming a milionair on oil industrys.

This rifle has all the features associated with a national match rifle. It has the target sights both front and rear, glass bedded stock, and Greek cross marked national match barrel. The barrel also has the ""NM"" marking between front sight and hand guard. Additionally the barrel is a LMR barrel 3-53 that are known for their accuracy. This rifle was further conditioned for accuracy by the Air Force armorers at Lockland Air Force base with the following features: The outside area of the barrel and the inside of the op rod are polished to reduce friction between the op rod and barrel. The trigger mechanism is stoned to allow for a crisp trigger release and proper trigger pull weight. It is also marked with 4 lines that signify that it goes with this rifle. The inside of the stock is marked with 4 counter sunk holes that signify the Air Force armorer that conditioned the rifle. The front and underside of the bolt are polished to reduce friction. The barrel is marked ""AF"" ""PG"" between the front sight and front handguard. The stock has the front ferial screwed onto the stock. The rear handguard is relieved and free floating. The front handguard is screwed onto the rear stock ferial in front of the rear handguard. The op-rod is also marked with four lines that signify it is original to the rifle. Last but not least the rear sight is modified by having the windage knob milled with 8 notches to give finer windage adjustment and the receiver is drilled and a ball bearing and spring are inserted to give a positive position stop for the sight windage adjustment. The bore is clean and bright and the muzzle measures 2 and the throat measures 5. The rifle also comes with a canvas sling. This is a very rare rifle as most of the AFPG rifles started out as NM 30-06 rifles and were converted to 308 NATO in later rebuilds and in the 1970s. To find one in original 30-06 caliber is quit rare.  no face to face transaction and no local transaction"

They came in neutered however. This one has all the work done for you to make it look like it should. The de-banning was done professionally by Ken at Global Military Gunsmithing. The de-banning included the following. The stock is an IWD stock made for the single tang rifle. The trigger group is a G2. The donor parts are from a milled Bulgarian ak 47 kit. This includes the upper and lower handguard, handguard retainer, the pistol grip, the cleaning rod, gas block, front sight post, and muzzle break. Muzzle was threaded to standard 14x1. I test fired about 15rds through the rifle only but no idea on the total round count on the gun but I suspect very low. Barrel is flawless and mirror shiny.  r. The donor parts were not refinished so the gun has a BFPU look about it which I really like. I will also include a sling and correct type bayonet and one 30round eastern European magazine.

Patented August 21, 1894.  Nickel Steel barrel. Especially for Smokeless powder. This gun has nicks and scratches in the stock typical of a 109 year old gun and someone has re-lacquered the stock and fore grip but it was not sanded down so wood fits as original by the color and condition of lacquer would estimate it was done 70 to 80 years ago. Barrel retains 90% plus of it's original bluing!!! Barrel bore is 90% plus and shiny. Tube has nice brown patina but only has 60% or so of the original bluing. Receiver has 50 to 60% or original bluing and then rest is nice brown patina. Action is very solid this gun was shot very little internals function like new and springs are still good and tight. 20"" barrel with full length tube. Original butt plate with some cracking in the wood towards the bottom of the butt plate. Claimed to be owned by famous Texas Ranger John R. Hughes 1855-1946 then later by his Son Franklin R. Hughes who's initials are inscribed in the stock and who was responsible for the re-lacquering. I have no paperwork to substantiate this claim. This rifle was purchased from a gentle man By the name of Franklin R Hughes Jr. who said he was John Hughes grandson. From the age of the gentleman and the stories his grandpa use to tell him I believed him. Historical or not nice old functioning and shooting 1904 Model 1894"

I have a Sig Sauer Mosquito chambered in .22 LR and it is olive drab in color.  BEAUTIFUL pistol!  It's been used a little bit, but in great shape! I have 1 magazine for it.  I don't shoot it very much anymore, and am a 1911 guy, so I'm looking to trade for a 1911-22 (with a rail would be great).  Don't really care about the brand, but I prefer GSG, UMAREX, COLT, ATI, or SIG SAUER.

All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

882,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2646882,For Sale:  New Confederate Items at www.bmhistorical.com,"Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina",FREE,"Listed On: Monday, February 3, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Confederate ID'ed Austrian Lorenz Rifle! Confederate Altered Model 1826!

1.) Austrian Lorenz - “Excellent” identified Confederate Austrian M-1854 Lorenz with great provenance. The lorenz was imported in large numbers by both sides, Union and Confederate. The Union imported around 250,000 Lorenz Rifles, while the Confederacy imported 100,000. Caleb Huse, a purchasing agent for the Confederacy, obtained these Austrian rifles thorough S. Issac, Campbell & Co. in London initially. He then visited Vienna as the Confederate Ordnance Departments purchasing agent in 1863 and obtained more for importation.

This particular Austrian M-1854 Lorenz is in .58 caliber, has the original rear block sight and is without the cheek-rest seen on earlier models. The breech is marked SEILINGER, the name of the arms manufacturer who contracted to make this rifle. The lock is marked 861, which is the last three digits of the year of manufacturer: 1861. The rifle is in “Excellent” condition, retaining most of its original finish. It has some of the sharpest and clearest markings I’ve seen on a rifle that was used. There is some peppering around the barrel, some patina on the lock, and few dings in the stock from legitimate usage. The underside of the barrel, and the stock in the barrel channel are so well preserved they look as they did when it came from the factory, truly remarkable.

The most interesting part about this firearm is that it can be identified to the Confederate soldier who carried it. “J. Muselman” carved his name in the stock, and also his company, “Co. D”. A quick search of the Civil War Soldier database returned an exact match, which identifies him as Muselman, J, of Company D, 60th Regiment, Virginia Infantry (3rd Regiment, Wise Legion). He enlisted as a private, and ended the war as a private.

2.) Model 1828 - Great example of a Confederate altered M-1828 Wickam Musket. Some refer to the updated patterns of this contract as “Model 1816 Type II” or “Model 1816 Type III” when in actuality they are either Model 1822′s or Model 1828′s. This musket was produced by the firm Marine T. Wickham of Philadelphia and is a Model 1828. Wickham worked for the Philadelphia Schuylkill Arsenal as an arms inspector before he started his own firm.

This musket has a very peculiar alteration to percussion from flintlock. For starters the choice of hammers, a “dog’s head” shaped striker, is very similar to Confederate altered muskets pictured in “Confederate Rifles & Muskets: Infantry Small Arms Manufactured in the Southern Confederacy 1861-1865″ by John M. Murphy M.D., and Howard Michael Madaus. The other similarity is the drum bolster method of alteration, which was utilized often by southern armorers. Page 455 shows pictures of two muskets altered in Virginia for the Civil War, both utilizing the same type of hammer, and the drum bolster method of alteration. In conclusion this Wickham has the same “dog’s head” striker hammer, and drum alteration as the Confederate altered muskets in John Murphy’s book; strongly suggesting a connection.

The lock is dated 1831, marked PHILA for Philadelphia, and still clearly reads US over M T WICKAM. The barrel is also dated 1831, and has U.S. over the inspectors initials of JM, under both of which are a “P”. There is a light patina on the rifle, and some heavy peppering by the breech and bolster area. These issues are consistent with actual use, and the condition of the nipple supports that even further. The original nipple is still present and intact, but has seen considerable use. The stock still has sharp edges and is free of any major cosmetic or structural damage.

Considering the evidence provided by John Murphy’s “Confederate Rifles and Muskets” of the exact same alterations being done by the Confederacy to refurbish muskets during the Civil War, it would fit perfectly in a firearms collection representative of either side and is priced well below what others would charge for a Confederate arm.
