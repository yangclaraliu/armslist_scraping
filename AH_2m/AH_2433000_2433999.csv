Details:
The EN plated Bolt Carrier Group enhances reliability, lessens cleaning time,
improves corrosion resistance and minimizes required bolt lubrication.

- EN plated bolt carrier, heat treated & hardened.
- Hardened gas key, grade 8 hardened fasteners, type III sealing
compound, black phosphate outer finish and inner chrome lined.
- Black phosphate HPT/MPI bolt and extractor with Mil-Spec gas rings.

Cleaning is minimal, usually requiring only a soft cloth. Permits firing for 
longer periods of time between cleaning, as dirt and powder residue has 
no wet or oily surface to cling to.
EN provides a high lubricity and low friction co-efficient,
greatly increasing the life expectancy of a firearm due to reduced friction wear. 

Electroless nickel plating is an auto-catalytic reaction used to deposit a coating of nickel on a
substrate.  Unlike electroplating, it is not necessary to pass an electric
current through the solution to form a deposit.  This plating technique
is to prevent corrosion and wear.
EN electroless nickel plating has several advantages versus
electroplating, it provides an even deposit regardless of workpiece
geometry, and with the proper per-plate catalyst, can deposit on non-
conductive surfaces.

Wood Is good with a few scratches.  First $100 takes it (no lower).  Im taking a big loss but i want some Xmas $$$...Text me at REDACTED.  Will meet in Arlington area

The compensator allows for less felt recoil and the ability to easily change choke tubes. The shotgun is in great condition and shoots beautifully. This would make a great hunting/skeet gun.

1895-1911 W. Richards 12 Gauge SxS Underlever Shotgun. You don't see many of these underlevers around. It has a 28.25"" Cast Steel Barrel (un-cut), Functioning side hammers and working double triggers. Walnut stock is in good shape.  No scroll work on wood or metal. Has incorrect bolt for breech pivot pin. Left firing Pin needs replaced to make mechanically functional. Not recommended for shooting, and not to be confused with Wesley or William Richards shotguns.

1966 Rohm RG10 .22short revolver, blued w/white plastic grips, 2.5"" barrel – Excellent+ condition w/original box and 13 rounds of ammo. Box of ammo are likely as old as the gun. Great trainer or novelty piece.

1972 Remington Speedmaster 552 .22 (S,L,LR) tube fed semi-auto, 23.5"" barrel - Excellent working and physical condition. Bluing is strong with some scratches mainly on the receiver. Stock has a few minor dings as might be expected, but looks very good. I've taken this one down and did a thorough cleaning. It is in great shape with a bright shiny bore.

1975 Winchester Model 94 30-30, blued w/wood stock, 20"" barrel – Excellent working and Physical condition. Has some minor pitting, especially on one side of receiver, due to setting for many years. The rust and finish have been removed from the left side of the receiver where most of the pitting is located. Because of the difficulty in bluing this model, it will either need to be sent out for special processing, or one could go the paint route. Brownell's has a product called Paint & Bake that is said to look very nice and is very durable. It was owned by a very elderly man who has passed away. Considering he was up in his years when he bought it new, I would guess it did not get much use. The action and condition also indicate very little use.

1976 Glenfield Model 60 .22LR, tube fed semi-auto – Very good condition with the stock having some minor scratches and thinning of the finish in a couple places. Checkering is in great shape. Also has a Bushnell 4x Sportview 22 scope. Overall a good looking rifle. If the stock were just a little better, I'd grade it excellent.

2012 Bersa Thunder .380 Duo-Tone, DA/SA, 3.5” barrel – LNIB w/extra 9rnd mag, soft case, & holster. Only 3 shots ever fired. Can include some ammo for a good deal. Great CC package. Cash sale of this handgun requires a carry permit or proof of handgun ownership.

Up for sale or trade is my Ruger Security Six. This weapon's serial is 160-10xxx indicating it was made in 1984. For a 29 year old weapon, it functions superbly. I've put about 50 rounds of Winchester white box through it since I've owned it and there was not one hiccup, and it's more accurate than I am. There is some holster wear on the barrel and slight pitting on the frame. Keep it this way and wait for the value to go up, or reblue and have a beautiful example of a great classic Ruger!

This is a Stainless Steel .25ACP single-shot 'Pen Pistol'. The serial is #PP9xx. This is a legal pistol because it cannot be fired in the ""Pen"" position… and as such, it requires NO Special Stamps or fees.  You must first fold the gun 90 degrees, which will cock the gun and provide access the trigger.  VERY RARE and hard to come by.  This one is BRAND NEW, UNFIRED, and IN THE BOX.  Original Leatherette case with cardboard sleeve and instructions included.

Prefer an Illinois FTF transaction, but will ship FFL to FFL to contiguous 48 states (if not prohibited by law) and AT BUYER'S EXPENSE.  Be aware of the laws in your State, as this collectible firearm may not be legal to own in your State… including California and New Jersey.

I currently reload 9mm, .380, .223, 30-06, .38, .357. and 300 AAC Blackout with my Hornady LNL AP Progressive press. I check all my reloads with a high quality caliper and digital scale.

-Clean brass, Walnut Vibration method with brass polish
-Clean primer pockets
-Swag primer pockets/Remove primer crimps
-Precisely Trim Rifle/Pistol brass
-Resize/Deprime Standard brass
-Cut/Trim/Reform .223 brass into 300 AAC Blackout/Whisper (I can provide some mixed once fired brass or you provide brass and I cut/trim/deburr/reform)
-Remove stuck brass from a die with my Hornady or RCBS stuck case remover
-Factory crimp dies for .223 and 30-06

-And last but not least, if you want full reloading of custom ammo we will have to work out something were you can use my equipment and materials for a fee. I can not fully reload ammo and sell it without the possibility of jail time or bureaucratic crap (with large fees and paperwork). We can build custom cartridges with your choice of bullets, powder charges, factory crimped cases for high precision ammo with high quality components for great accuracy and lower cost than store bought. With my progressive press I can produce rounds very quickly with a high degree of accuracy.

It's a solid mount - nothing moves once it's tightened. One can also remove it and return the rifle to stock condition (which is what I'm going to do).

The mount allows for mounting of Scout Scope or other long eye relief optics to Mosin Nagant model 91/30′s without the need to drill & tap receiver or make any permanent modifications to the firearm.

It is designed to fit over the rear sight block in order to allow for continued use of the original fixed/iron sights up to 100 meters.

The Mount is rigid steel construction with Black Oxide finish.  The masking tape is so I don't lose the bolts.

It's in great shape and easily moved to nearly any Mosin Nagant 91/30.

Included is all mounting hardware, instructions and the punch/drill bit that came with the kit. Interested parties can go to Brass Stacker's website to find out if it will fit your specific rifle (and to see more/better pictures). Scope and rings are NOT included.

This price is firm - new ones are $60. I also checked to see if the lifetime warranty is transferable - an email from Brass Stacker says yes.

If you're interested in a scope that will fit this mount, please check out my other ad on Arms List.  

I'm willing to ship to your location for prepayment including actual shipping cost.  Payment must be US Postal Money Order only.  I do not accept PayPal.

I have up for sale a like new Charter arms Lavender Lady 38 spl Hammerless model. This is the model that has ""The Lavender Lady"" engraved into the barrel rather than anodized on like some of them do. This is also the Hammerless model which isnt as easy to come by compared to the hammer models that run 399.99+ in stores. This little 5 shot is perfect for conceal carry for a man or woman. The color actually grows on you and has a great sheen to it. Haha. It has had less than 75 rounds through it and has zero issues. The grip is fantastic and pockets very nice for being this kind of gun. The kick is very light considering its weight and the punch it is delivering. I would keep this but I already have a conceal and my gal just isnt in to revolvers. So, I will pass this great gun on to someone who will use it for more than just a safe queen! Included for the asking price are the original case, paperwork, lock, and the pistol itself. I can also possibly include ammo on my end for the right trade. I need to meet in or very close to norman if possible due to my current time constraints, but Im not unreasonable.

----
I would like to offer for sale a Glock 19, with a factory-installed NY1 trigger and Trijicon night sights (http://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3c.php?pid=GL01). These are 2006 dated, so are at about 70% brightness.

This pistol has been carried for a number of years, so there is the expected amount of holster wear on the slide (see photos), but shot very little, so everything is in good overall condition. This G19 is also a generation 2, which means it has the out-of-production, but desirable frame with no finger grooves. In other words, if you don't like the gen3/4 finger grooves, give the gen2 a try.

Includes one 15-round factory magazine, with the restricted LE markings.

Also, comes with a Southwest Shooting Authority dry fire kit, with the trigger pull weight matched to this gun. An excellent dry fire trigger, uses slightly modified Glock factory trigger parts to duplicate the Glock trigger take-up, break, and reset. Easy to install and remove, as it replaces the entire trigger assembly and drops in as a unit. Especially nice to have if you are having trouble locating 9mm ammo.

Perfect for dry practice at home, or fun at the range, and the right size for concealed carry with the usual Glock ruggedness, reliability, and accuracy.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine.

Thanks for looking!"

It comes with Browning Quick Release Scope Rings & mounts.  Has a hooded front sight and flip-up rear leaf.  The see-through rings allow the the sights to be used with rings installed.

I believe this is a first-year production of the Browning BAR High Power Rifle.  The serial number is 36XXX   M8, which I think translates to a 5-digit serial number, M= High Power BAR and 8 signifies 1968, the first year of production.  I could be wrong about all of this, but this is what it looks like on the Browning websites.

It's really a pleasure to  shoot.  The action of the BAR absorbs most of the recoil, making it kick more like a .243.

The rifle is very accurate.  It retains probably 95% of bluing or better, and only a few light nicks in the stock.  It looks very nice in person.  The receiver has engraving as seen in the pictures.  

I'm told that some of the Belgium Brownings had salt-cured wood stocks, which caused rust/corrosion to the metal parts.  This rifle does NOT have a salt-cured stock, and there is NO rust or corrosion of any kind, even under the stocks.  I can e-mail pictures of various parts if you are interested.  Under the fore stock, the gas mechanism looks to be in perfect condition.  Let me make this clear, there is NO rust, nor has there ever been any rust anywhere on this rifle.  It has been on some hunts, and there is some slight wear of the bluing (hence the 95% and not 100%) but it was NEVER put away dirty and never allowed to corrode.  The bore looks great as well.

 I would like to see a CWP or such, and a FTF transaction only; I am not willing to ship.

Please include a contact phone number to rull out the scammers.  E-mails without a working phone number will be deleted.  So will e-mails asking simply if I still have it.  If this listing is still active, then I still have it.

I'm not really interested in any trades, although I might be talked into a Wilson Combat or Kimber 1911.  Not really interested in anything else.  The price is firm.  Thanks for looking!"

Up for sale is my 5"" Gov Sized 1911 built by SPW custom shop, (A branch of Safari/Olympia Arms). The gun is hand built, VERY nice quality just about every bell and whistle you can think of, lowered and widened ejection port, beveled mag well, hand-stoned-to-match hammer and sear, lightweight long-shoe over-travel adjusted custom trigger, extended thumb safety, wide beavertail grip safety, champion rear site, full length guide rod, shoot like a dream and is extraordinarily accurate, skeletonized hammer, etc you will not be disappointed,hell even the serial number is custom, you get to pick it. the only non quality part are the grips they are cheap ones pulled from another 1911 as the custom wood grips i had on it i am keeping, the skull ones work fine just not up to par with the rest of the gun. Comes with 4 mags, A standard capacity kimber mag, hi capacity extended kimber mag, and 2 hi cap extended Chip McCormick mags. Also included is a range bag for pistol and aformentioned mags.

Are you looking for a gun that can shoot the wings off a fly at 800 yards? Yeah?!?! Well this is not it, but if your looking for a badass thunder stick  that can knock down an elk at a reasonable range then your in the right place.  This well crafted weapon packs a kick that would make Chuck Norris cringe and the angels cry.  Sure its not the Bone Collector with all its bells and whistles but last time I checked I was a man, a man who needed nothing more then a gun that could send a projectile 2,300 fps towards an unsuspecting critter that I nicknamed supper.  ""But it doesn't come in camo"" you say in a whining disappointed voice.  Well if you need camo covering every square inch of gun to keep from getting spotted then this gun is not for you.  Matter of fact here are some other signs this gun may NOT be for you.
1. You brake for squirrels
2. Put the twist tie back on the bread when your done
3. Have ever heard a One Direction song and exclaimed ""not bad""
4. You skipped out on poker night to watch Glee
5. You eat hot wings with a fork.
IF none of those apply to you then your a decent American and I don't mind handing this septar of a rifle over to you.  Gun shoots like a dream and at the mere age of 1 harvested her first 6x6 elk.  I'm no good with math but a friend tells me that 1 for 1 is 100% or something like that.  Gun is in near perfect condition so instead of showing you pictures of it ill show you pictures of what it can do jack.  I mean really would you rather see a Ferrari parked next to the track or see what it could do in a quarter mile.  That's what I thought.  Can't imagine you'd have any more questions but if you do or are just lookin for someone to have a beer with feel free to email me."
