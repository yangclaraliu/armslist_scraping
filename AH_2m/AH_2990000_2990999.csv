Product Information

 The Eton Raptor Solar Charge Emergency Radio is a radio, cell phone charger, weather alert and more, all wrapped up into one product. Not only does the Eton Raptor tell you the basics of your journey, but it can also take pressure readings so you can be aware of changing weather, tell you how high you've climbed, and it can wake you up in the morning so you can continue your trek. When it gets too dark to continue, enjoy local AM and FM radio stations or use its flashlight to find your supper. It even has a bottle opener so you can crack open a cold one and relax. It charges in the sunlight, so you don't need to worry about charging it while away from electricity. When you get back home, use its rechargeable battery to enjoy inside as well. 


Product Features
•All-terrain, all-in-one - In addition to the solar smartphone charger, weather alert and radio functions, it’s got guidance features galore. With an altimeter, thermometer, barometer, compass, chronograph, LED flashlight, and even a bottle opener, the Raptor is an indispensable tool for trailblazers and travelers.
•Stay alert - When the “Alert” function is on, the radio will automatically broadcast emergency weather alerts for your area such as hurricanes, tornadoes and severe storms.
•Listen up - Stay in tune and up to date with this AM/FM/NOAA weather band digital radio with display and alarm clock. If you want more than just the radio, there’s an AUX-input to play your own tunes, and when you want to listen alone, just plug in your favorite headphones.
•More power to you - Take the Raptor in the sun or use the DC jack with mini USB cable to charge the Raptor’s built-in  rechargeable lithium battery.
•Say hello - To charge your smartphone, simply plug it into the USB port. Power will automatically “dump charge” to your phone, just like plugging into the wall. Great for emergency calls or texts on the trail.
•On the go - Clip the Raptor on to your pack with the built-in carabiner and don’t worry about it getting wet—it’s splashproof (IPX-4).

It has some nicks on the grip and scratches trigger guard from improper shipping and handling, but I soothed the pain by including a nice glass bedded walnut stock that I never got around to installing. The barreled action is a long action Model 70 XTR sporter magnum in 7mm Rem Mag. I inherited these after a relative had past away afew years ago and never got around to even setting them up properly, heck, I didn't get a stock for the action! I'm selling these to ease the burden of moving. I'm hoping to sell both at $700 for convenience but will consider selling separately at $530 for the rifle and $250 for the action.

496,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2990496,"For Sale:  AR500 targets with ""stands"", just the C zone of USPSA target","near Belleville, IL actually, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 145,"Listed On: Saturday, April 26, 2014",Targets,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These are 3/8ths thick AR500 steel targets.  If you are familiar with either a USPSA target or an IDPA target, cut off the D zone of the USPSA target or the down 3 zone of an IDPA target and this is what you get.  See pic below.

This is about my 4th generation of targets built.  To keep prices low, I make all my stuff so it fits in a USPS flat rate box meant for board games.  So these plates are about 11.75"" wide and about 23.75"" long.

These are meant for guys to mainly practice with their handguns, especially for the IDPA classifier stage where the targets are height adjustable to 6 foot tall, then 4 foot, and then 5 foot.

There is one catch though.  The legs....You supply them.  1/2"" diameter rebar works just fine, and you can buy it in 4 foot lengths at any Home Depot or Lowe's or Menards.  Each 4 foot length of rebar is about $3.00 at those stores.  So you spend an extra $10 dollars or so out the door for a complete target plate and stand set up.

Confused yet?

Sorry.  If you have any questions, you can just email me, too.

These are not made by century, but are contracted by century, so the quality is much higher than most of their products. It uses the roller-locking system like the MP5 and G3 rifles. This is the most accurate 5.56 autoloader I've ever handled and probable the lightest recoiling too.

$25 takes it.  That's around .43 cents a round.  CMP sells this for .67 cent a round.
Plus you get 4 enbloc clips.  

Local cash sale.  I live in Hastings and would meet within 20 miles of my home. 

I really don't know why my posting for this ammo keeps getting flagged as spam.  I assume it's a troll or someone just being a jack wagon.  Maybe instead of flagging it, you could email me and tell me what your problem is?     The posting is legit and a very good price for CMP ball ammo for the M1 Garand.  I originally asked $30 for the lot which was still very reasonable.  I have lowered my asking price to $25.

Here's what Sig has to say about it:
Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

Been Given False Promises and Unrealistic Goals for Your Lover to Return? Am here to STOP all that misery.
This spell intends to drive at your ex partner positive energies related to you and your couple. Thanks to my psychic powers, I can concentrate and communicate to your ex-lover the energies created by the ritual. It is important to say right now that this spell respects free will. That means black magic is never involved in any of my love spells. If you and this person were once a couple, it was for a reason. It means that there are natural energies that once created a strong and wonderful bond between you two. And so, there is absolutely no need to summon energies that will be entitled to take control of your ex-partner's soul and mind. If you love him or her, you certainly don't want to cast such a spell. Risk free, this spell is also very powerful and truly work. You can expect a 85-95% success rate with this spell. I will cast a ritual following an ancient formula of an old Egyptian spell, which was cast during the time of Pharos. This spell summons very strong energies that I will transfer to your partner thanks to concentration and meditation.
This love spell will then re-create this energy and make it surround your ex-lover. As I use only positive energies, there is no risk that my spell backfires at you. It is safe to have this spell cast.
In just a few days, maximum of 6-7 days, your lover will be back, and your relationship will be restored, with the same intensity and passion that it was at its prime.
