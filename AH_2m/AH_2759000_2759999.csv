Note:  this is the police model, not the express model.  
What's the difference?

 Summary of the differences between the police model and the express model

• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer
 magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.
• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.
• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models.

Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,
.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo. 

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

Spike’s Tactical LW BAR 2 13.2” Quad Rail				
Yankee Hill Upper Reciever						

The price listed below is exactly what it cost me in high grade mil-spec parts.  There is no profit in this price at all or any charge for my labor to build.  I enjoy doing builds so if you don’t want to build well than this is a good deal for a SWAT grade upper.
Complete Upper $870.00 /OBO
Or Complete Upper w/ Yankee Hill Flip Up Sights   $1,070.00 /OBO
Or Complete Upper w/ Yankee Hill Flip Ups and Bushnell Bone Collector Scope $1,200/OBO
Or Complete Rifle with Tactical Machining Lower & Rguns lower kit $1,400/OBO

This complete build has between 300-500rds through it so it's practically new and barely broken in.  I love this gun but have an exact duplicate so I'm looking to add variety."

Hammerless double action only, 1.875"" barrel, 5 shot revolver.

I bought this revolver 2 or 3 years ago in like new condition and I've shot less than 200 rounds through it since then. It's a great shooter and it only weighs 17.1oz. It makes a fantastic snake gun with rat shot because it's so small, light and easy to carry.  I'll throw in a Fobus paddle holster to go with the LCR.

I'll be honest: full power 357 Mag rounds aren't very fun to shoot in this gun. 38's are a blast and you can shoot them all day, but you won't want to shoot many 357 rounds in a row.

I've also got a set of two 5 Star Firearms speedloaders and bedside block, filled with ten Hornady 357 Magnum 125gr FTX's. I'll sell the set for an additional $50 with the purchase of the LCR.

Face to face only at this time.

H&R 1900 model.  12 gauge
     1900 model was made from 1900 to 1915.  This one was made probably pre-1910from what I can find online.  It has a removable pin which allows the upper to be easily removed for storage.

H&R 1908 model.  12 gauge.  Made from 1909 to 1930.  Model 1908 (two models, one Standard Frame and the other Heavy Breech Frame) This gun takes down by removing the forend and then removing the barrel. The forend is a snap type and not a screw type.


Both are in working condition and I would not hesitate to shoot bird loads out of them today.
Both have a nice plum color to the metal.  Both have dinks and dings to the stocks and metal.  They could both use more bore cleaning and the 1900 model has had the buttstock repaired around the wrist.
This is reflected in the price of $125.00 for both or $65.00 per.

He specialized in converting Rolling Blocks to works of art, and more. His company, Lone Star Rifle was located near Houston, Tx. He built two of these for me; identical, except for caliber. The other one, already sold was a 38-55. It was one of the most accurate rifles I personally had ever shot. I'm also selling another one of his earlier works in 45-120. It too is outstanding in both workmanship, and accuracy. RIP David.

The checkering is amazing and flawless. The blank on this gun was 800 alone and the checkering was 700. Comes with a one of only 200 made NRA limited edition slings that were only avaible at the 2013 Dallas Safari Club Show and a Weatherby 3by9 Supreme Scope. Ive only shot it 28 times and it shoots rings around the 338 Lapua and punches hole thru 1/4 inch steel plates at 600 yards. 3800 invested. 2500 cash.

It has a plain 27 1/2 inch matte barrel with a full choke.  It is in fair to good used condition.  The barrel has some bluing loss from use but the bore is in good shape.  The forearm is in good shape with no cracks, but has a few dings and light scratches.  I found out the stock was cut by 1 inch when I bought it, so I installed a Pachmayr recoil pad and a spacer to bring the LOP to about 14 inches.  The stock is in good shape with some light scratches and dings.  I bought the gun to pheasant hunt with and killed 15 in South Dakota last November.  It is a little too tightly choked to bird hunt with, but would be a great light weight gun for turkey, coon or squirrel hunting.  The gun came with a regular mag spring with one friction ring and bronze piece.  It will shoot 7/8 ounce 2 3/4 inch shells reliably with this setup.  I ordered a magnum mag spring from Browning with 2 bronze pieces and 3 friction rings to shoot 3 inch shells and it works fine this way.  The gun was taken a part and 47 years of crude and junk was cleaned from the gun. It is not a closet queen but a good functional shooter.  I would prefer a FTF transaction in the Memphis area.

Not a safe queen.  Has MagPul front and rear grips in OD green.  Has Tapco G2 trigger group. Tapco pin retaining plate that takes the place of Shepheards Crook spring.  Works better that way if you take your rifle apart to clean, if not leave it alone.  I will give you 2 Tapco 30rd mags and a no name brand, metal 30rd mag with the rifle. (total of 3 mags) I have listed a 75rd drum on another listing if interested check my other listings.  If you want more 30rd mags I will sell them cheap with the rifle.

PSA:
""Once upon a time, a ""dissipator"" AR was created by taking a 20"" rifle-length gas system upper and cutting the barrel down to 16"". This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability. The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition. Advances in AR technology have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks. This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation. We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version. 

Our Hammer-Forged Mid-length dissipator uses a ""Machine Gun Steel"" barrel that is thick chrome-lined for durability and high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected. 

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.

Super Grade wood w/o the high luster bluing or Super Grade stamped on the right side of the barrel or on the floor-plate.  This gun is UNFIRED.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER."

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER."

While sporterized, the rifle is largely intact. Marked ""U.S. Model of 1917, Remington""  The original ladder sight has been removed in lieu of a two-aperture flip peep sight. The front sight is also aftermarket. The military parkerized finish is in good condition, and the rifle shows no rust or abnormal wear. The finish is strong except as typical on high spots and edges, and on the working areas of the action. The buttstock shows nice figure that matches the solid, burly character of the rifle. 

The action, with controlled-round feed, claw extractor, and fixed ejector, has similar features to the Mauser pattern rifles and all it's successful variants and offspring. The action is rugged and has been test fired and functions well. The springs appear strong, the safety functions, and the bolt and internal magazine operate smoothly. The rifle feeds, fires, and ejects flawlessly. 

This rugged, functional rifle could be restored to U.S. military trim with a vintage stock and ladder sight, or used as-is as a durable, effective big game rifle making major style points at hunting camp or in the fall woods. How many hunters can claim their rifles fought ""the Hun"" in the ""War to End All Wars"" or possibly the Nazi menace in ""The Big One""?

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

I picked it up used and was told that it is a colt upper. It has a free float 11"" quad rail, mid length gas system, and the pics pretty much tell the rest of the story. I can make a deal with or without the BCG and charging handle. I mounted it to my S&W lower and fired 10 rounds for function test and everything ran smooth and held a nice tight group. 
 I'm not looking for anything specific as far as trades go, but I'm not into poly frame pistols, and will only trade to other firearms, or ammo and cash, or straight cash sale. I am not desperate to let this go, I'll buy a lower when my taxes come back if this hasn't sold by then. So all you barter kings and wanna be pawn stars might as well just low ball the next guy because your wasting your time here.
 ** Update** I've done my homework and this does appear to be colt. I've had a couple more offers for lowers but if you want to offer one up please check the manufacturers web page for MSRP. That's what I'm going to do before I make an offer. Many lowers have dropped in price, so if you bought yours 6 months ago it's probably not worth that price today. Because of panic buying the market floods and drives prices down."
