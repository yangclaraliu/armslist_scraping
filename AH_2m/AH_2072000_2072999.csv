GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this 15-round .40 caliber pistol.

Laser Genetics ND3 Laser Designator / Flashlight with Scope Mount Product Info
Laser Genetics ND3 Laser Designator is powerful laser flashlight that makes an excellent source of illumination for hunting, fishing, marine, rescue, and EMS uses. Thisimage Laser Genetics laser sight uses patented technology to create true night vision and turns your scoped rifle into a night hunter. More than just a laser scope, the LG-ND3 Laser Illuminator combines a powerful, green laser light diode and a precision optical collimator. Pair the ND3 Laser Genetics Light with your rifle scope and you can cast a bright beam of green laser light to fully illuminate targets up to 250 yards. The patented optical collimator allows for quick, one hand, full range adjustment of beam diameter and light strength with just 180 degrees of rotation. With this powerful, easy to use green laser flashlight, you never have to take your eyes off the target, or your hand off the trigger.
The Laser Genetics ND3 Laser Designator features a system of 9 fully multi-coated lenses, and a patented Rotary Optical Collimator that allows full adjustment and control of beam diameter and intensity to focus light where you need it most. Rotating the collimator ring to minimum creates a bright micro beam of green laser light visible up to 3 miles. Rotating collimator to a more open setting provides plenty of illumination to light a trail at night or paint a target at 250 yards. Battery life allows you to handle a variety of emergencies with over 7 hours of available power. The ND3 Laser Designator from Laser Genetics works well for both night hunting and game spotting. For optimum night vision for hunting, pair the Laser Genetics ND-3 Green Laser Sight with a high quality variable power riflescope having a 40mm or larger objective lens providing maximum light transmission. The included ND3 mounting system for 1"" tubes provides full adjustment for windage and elevation for scope alignment. Additional mounts for binocular, spotting scopes and weaver rails are included.
The Laser Genetics ND Series of Laser Designators features low energy use and high illumination yield, enabling you to focus full illumination where you need it, with the least loss of light due to ""flooding"". The ND Series puts you in full control of directed laser light for maximum illumination of the intended object. The high power laser beam may be collimated down and concentrated to cast an intense, highly visible beam of light that can be seen miles away, useful for signaling or search and rescue operations. Or adjust the beam to 10ft to light a path for full night vision. Green light is the most visible to the human eye and requires the least amount of eye adjustment at night. High power green laser light reflects intensely off the eyes of animals allowing quick detection up to 250 yards.
Laser Genetics specializes in green laser sights, lights and scopes specific for outdoors, hunting, marine, emergency, and home defense use. Laser Genetics utilizes exclusive patented optical laser technology to develop the lighting instruments of the future for civilian and professional use. Founded in 2006, Laser Genetics is one of the nation's fastest growing manufacturers of personal-use laser lighting products. We bring you the full selection of Laser Genetics Laser Sights, backed by the best customer service and our 100% satisfaction guarantee.

This is a fun gun to shoot, very lightweight, .357 loads give a nice little snap, .38 specials are more comfortable to shoot for practice.   Never had any issues with this nice revolver, grip is a little worn from carrying everyday, and gun shows some signs of use/wear.   This is not a ""new"" gun, I have fired 300 or so rounds through it, and have changed the hammer and trigger springs to a lighter weight, not the lightest that came in the kit.    Still have stock springs.    I will sell the gun with the IWB holster from Theis Holsters, very comfortable, and no one ever saw me carrying.

Looking for a new or near new Glock 19 OEM 10 round magazine at a reasonable price. Even though we can't be trusted with Hi-cap magazines, the 10 rounders are still legal here. 

The reason I'm looking for a magazine is that when I picked up my new Glock 19 the gun store only had Law Enforecemt models (15 round mags) and no 10 rounders. So they took the 15 round mags out of the box and gave me a credit for the mags. They said they had no idea when and if they would get any 10 round magazines from Glock. So, new Glock with no mags and an owner who can't wait to test fire it. TIA

In October 1860, B.T. Henry was granted a patent for the design of a new gun, a repeating rifle that used metallic cartridges. It was the first repeating rifle in history. With it, one man could load 15 cartridges in eight to ten seconds. That was the equivalent of 15 men armed with traditional firearms. It was such an important innovation that the gun was named after its inventor, Henry, and its cartridges bore his initial, H. All models feature a walnut stock with 13-round capacity. The barrel has an integrated magazine tube; total firearm length is 43-3/4”.

I've put a new radiator in it, and new shocks all around. The interior is very clean no rips/tears non smoker. The clear coat on the outside is peeling but doesnt look that bad. The tires are all good. 4X4 works great and the heat and a/c work great too. The drivers side window has problems rolling up but it still works. This would make a perfect vehicle for work or school.  I would rather trade than sell, $2700 on trade or $2000 cash FIRM!. Im interested in things that go bang, little cars, or ANYTHING of value that isnt junk. I will not trade down only up. Thank you!"

It retails for 550 so I am looking to get 400 for it since I don't have the box. I will consider trades for firearms as well just shoot me offers at REDACTED or email. Here is the info on it. 

The EOTech 552 model is one of the night-vision compatible red dot sights offered by EOTech. (The night vision compatible model numbers begin with 55. For example, 552, 553, etc).

The 552 gives you the same night vision capability and features that are found on the 553 sights, but at a lower cost. The 552 is submersible in water to 33 feet, while the 553 is submersible to 66 feet. The 552 uses readily-available AA batteries, while the 553 uses the smaller lithium batteries. So, if you don't think you'll be taking your sight any deeper than 33 feet of water, and you don't mind the slightly longer battery compartment, the 552 gives you all of the other performance of a 553 at a reduced price.

Like all EOTech sights, the 552 mounts quickly to your Picatinny or Weaver rail, and can be removed just as quickly. Battery replacement is easy, too. Just lift the long lever on the top of the forward battery compartment and pull the battery compartment forward until it comes off the unit, then replace the batteries and reinstall.

Two buttons on the rear control the brightness levels, and turn the sight on and off. A third button puts the sight into night vision mode.

If you want an EOTech sight to work with your night vision equipment, but don't want to spend over $600, the 552 is the best choice for you.

•Optics: The view through the window is 100% parallax free
•Magnification: 1x 
•Eye Relief is unlimited
•The operating temperature range is from -40 degrees to 150 Fahrenheit

I will also trade straight up mag for mag for like-new condition Kimber 8-round Tac Mags. I am not doing photos unless you are out of town. I am too busy right now. I can assure you they are in VERY good condition and you can always back out of a deal once you see them. Thanks for looking. 2 of them are 47Ds and 6 are ETMs. They are the same exact mag except for the baseplate design and the numbers on the witness holes.

This pistol is a police trade-in, but is in great shape, and shows little use outside of holster wear from daily carry.

Finish is 95 percent blue with honest holster wear and small white patches around the muzzle, front of the slide and safety/decocker. Rifling is bright, sharp and shiny and shows some wear, but is in great shape. The frame has stock ""combat"" style sights, which are quick to get on target, but not great for precision shots. Even so, you can expect 2-3"" groups 7-10 yds using good quality target ammunition. I personally have a preference for S&B and PPU, but the pistol seems to function flawlessly with all types of ball ammunition. I've not used is as a carry gun, so I have no experience with defense loads.

I've had some work done to the trigger; it has a very crisp single action pull, and a tolerable double action, which is a vast improvement over the stock 15lb+ DA pull."

It has a single line ""Fabrique National"" on the slide, Browining on the grips, NO proof marks - inside or out.  Note the unusual serial number 00C0000XXX.  Mine is identical to the picture (thanks to J. Zachary for the use of his blog pic).

I am confident that it is NOT one of the original Belgian produced, or French (MAB) produced pieces, there are NO proof marks.  The serial number does not fit any to the easy to find sequences. The piece and packing are not age appropriate for this either. 

I am also certain its NOT a LATER PSA production as it does not bear the the ""Virginia"" stamp on the slide and the serial number does not begin with ""VA"".

I thinking its a really early PSP/PSA piece produced in Colorado. 

I have exhausted all the books and web pages I can find. Any information on this little mystery would be much appreciated.
