Ward and Sons was a Birmingham gunworks from 1859 till 1935. Their premises was known as the Central Gun Works located at 24/27 Bath Street, Snow Hill, Birmingham, Alabama.

This gun is as tight as Dick's hat band, no play whatsoever in the breech section. The right barrel has a nick that I've shown in one of the pictures, other wise the bores look good.

Every piece of metal on the gun has engraving, even the game rib between the barrels. See pictures below. The gun's finish has great patina. The wood stock and forend are in very good condition, no cracks.

This gun is over 47 inches long and the barrels are 30 inches long. They could be cut off (to remove the bad place on the right barrel if you thought it was necessary) and still leave enough to be legal. Basically, make it a western coach shotgun. It would then be a shooter for sure. (I probably just made all the collectors out there cringe when I said cut it off.)

I have other pics that show the foundary/forge markings, serial number, etc if anyone needs that information."

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. Model 99 in action The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.

Starting with their extra large frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR includes a Hi-Viz front sight for accurate target acquisition. Plus, its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot. Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver."

Comes with a frontline leather OWB holster, 2 magazines, brand new inner and outer op rod springs (in OEM packaging) and the sad sad knowledge that I'm going to regret selling this gun pretty much immediately. 

I'm only selling it because my wife can't get her dainty little fingers wrapped around it properly and she insists I sell it before I can go out and buy another. (Not that a million pairs of shoes and purses mean anything, amiright?)

The Jericho 941 is based off of the CZ-75 pistol. If you have ever carried/shot one of those and liked it, this will feel right at home. 

Original case is included if I can find it, but the locking tabs are weak on it. As a result, I re-purposed an old Clark electric screwdriver zippered case. Doesn't look half bad if I do say so myself. I use it as a car case to keep in the trunk. I mean, we all have trunk guns right?

Asking $450 or trade for street-legal motorcycle. 

Bring your CHL or State issued ID please. I will be writing that info down on your receipt (for my legal peace of mind). Thanks for looking.

Has 4 factory magazines (no aftermarket), 2 extra recoil springs, a Foxx IWB holster. 2 backstraps, Sig Lite Night Sights, and about 300 rounds through it. 

The gun has been kept very well. Militec-1 lubrication, and detail strip cleanings between shooting sessions. My weapons are maintained to a high standard. 

I don't have the original box because it's a shoebox so don't ask. The box has no barrier on value to me, and I don't entertain that string of thought. 

The gun new was $500, only came with 1 magazine. I bought the extra 3 at $40 a piece. Foxx holster was $40, springs were $10 a piece. Overall value is where I put it. Only an extra $50 for 3 extra mags, 2 recoil springs, and a holster. Please don't tell me that's too much. I'm not asking premium price (what I paid for each part). 

Thanks for your time!"

This is the last year they called these just the pickup before switching to the Tacoma model name. This one has 166,000 miles on the original 4 cylinder 22RE motor and 5 speed transmission. The motor is in great shape and just had the belts replaced and fluids topped off and oil changed. The transmission shifts smoothly with no grinding. The timing chain was replaced at 130,000 miles. The clutch has plenty of life left. The interior is in good shape. The seats have been replaced with some bucket seats out of a Toyota Celica. There is an aftermarket CD player with an aux. input. The doors had the vinyl covering removed so the speakers could be installed and the vinyl was never put back on. The A/C blows ice cold. There is an aftermarket bed cover/cap installed. The tires are BRAND NEW 70,000 mile Hankooks. They were installed 3 weeks ago and cost 450$. The brakes work great. The truck was originally black and was painted white by the previous owner. Both side mirrors are missing and the blinker on the front passenger side is missing. The low and high beams work great. The driver's door has to be opened using the outside handle as the inside one is disconnected. Car has aftermarket floor mats, steering wheel cover, and center console/cupholder. This truck runs great. It's been my daily driver for a while now but I bought a new car and now need to sell the truck. This truck has tons of life left in it and would make a perfect work truck, hunting truck, or first vehicle. Comes with two used spare tires, one is already on a rim. Also included is a Haynes manual for these trucks. Looking to trade for pistols, with or without cash, over/under shotgun with or without cash, maybe nice guitars. Call Quinn at 864-354-0566."

This handgun has been used, but probably looks better than it did from the factory.  It has been Duracoated HK Black with a coat of clear over that.  The gun will be able to hold up to holster wear and use for a very long time. If you are not familiar with the CZ99, this is what Wikipedia says about the gun:

The CZ 99 is a full-sized, semi-automatic service pistol produced by Zastava Arms. It was developed in 1989 to replace the Zastava M57 in the Yugoslavian Military and Police. Design of the CZ 99 was based on SIG Sauer P226 while the frame design was influenced by Walther P88. The CZ 99 is chambered in 9√ó19mm Parabellum and .40 S&W
Design of the CZ 99 was based on SIG Sauer P226, while frame design was influenced by the Walther P88. However, the CZ 99 is not a copy of either, but rather borrows from both designs. frame is made out of PD 33 aluminum alloy while the slide is machined out of hammer forged steel.
The CZ 99 is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The firearm's locking mechanism utilizes a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide approximately 3 mm (0.12 in) until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system.
The CZ 99 incorporates fully ambidextrous slide release/decocker (Both slide release and decocker use same lever) as well as ambidextrous magazine release button. It also features loaded chamber indicator and DA/SA trigger.
The CZ 99 has no manual safety instead pistol can be decocked and holstered safely and can be fired in double action mode by simply pulling the trigger. The hammer may also be manually cocked at any time by the user to fire in single action mode.
The hammer-forged hard-chromed barrel is made from the same material used in the Zastava M84 General-purpose machine gun. In the tests done in the USA in 1991/1992 it was found that it dissipated heat rather well. While this is not a concern with handguns nearly as much as it is with the machine guns, the ability to dissipate heat rapidly makes barrel capable of lasting longer due to a shorther expansion/contraction cycle. The barrel is hard-chromed (inside and out) to protect from corrosion.

This is a very  well made and very durable gun inside and out.  It would serve anyone looking for a P226 but would like to get by spending less."

I have for sale or trade a Daewoo K2 (DR-200). She is a 223/556, South Korean modern day battle rifle. She uses M16/AR15 Magazines, has a FAL adjustable gas system, cycles using AKM gas piston technology. The K2 basically took the best parts of the M16/FAL/AKM to make an outstanding battle rifle. I added a $250 ACE stock to her that gives her the ability to side fold and deploy. These are pretty rare now and I haven't seen any at any gun shows. She has only had about 400 rounds through her total. She was cleaned after each shooting and never abused. I took her shooting last month (100) rounds and she fired flawlessly. 

I am only open to cash or trades in equal of posted amount (firearms only and no black powder or shotguns). Make me some offers.

This is a 10-22 T stainless in a green Ruger/Houge over molded stock. Factory .920 bull barrel.
The factory laminate stock developed a small crack and was repaired and custom painted years ago. I still have it, but the base colors are starting to check under the clear.
I bought this rifle new. It has not been shot much. It has a Simmons stainless 22 Mag 3x9 scope with A.O.(Also bought new) Custom sear (Power or Volquartzen, I forget) oversized bolt handle.
This rifle shoot sub 1/2"" groups at 50 yards with Federal auto match and Aquila SV.

    Combined Technology Ballistic Silvertip Bullets CT Ballistic Silvertip¬Æ bullets combine all the features of Nosler Ballistic Tip¬Æ hunting or varmint bullets, but with the addition of an advanced Lubalox¬Æ external treatment that reduces fouling and creates less barrel wear to promote longer barrel life.

    Streamlined polymer tip resists deformation in the magazine, provides a streamlined meplat for flat trajectory, and initiates positive expansion on impact with small and medium game.

    What is Lubalox? Lubalox¬Æ is the trade name Winchester uses to describe a black oxide process. It is a very thin oxide bullet coating, often compared to the bluing on a steel firearm.

    What are the benefits of Lubalox? The primary benefit of Lubalox is reduced barrel fouling. The process creates a surface on the bullet jacket, which increases the amount of shots possible between cleanings. Unlike moly-coated bullets, Lubalox-coated bullets leave the barrel residue-free and do not require barrel ‚Äúseasoning‚Äù. Additionally, unlike uncoated bullets that tarnish over time, Lubalox protects the surface of the bullet jacket, keeping it looking like new.

    Will Lubalox harm the gun barrel? Lubalox does not harm the barrel. In fact, testing shows that the coating often reduces barrel fouling. Lubalox coating is not a Moly coating.

    CT, Combined Technology and Ballistic Silvertip¬Æ are joint-registered trademarks of Nosler, Inc. and Olin- Winchester¬Æ. Winchester¬Æ, Supreme‚Ñ¢, and Lubalox¬Æ are registered trademarks of Olin-Winchester¬Æ.

This Real Sword SVD has seen very little use. Other than shooting it in the backyard, it has been taken to two games. There are a few scratch marks on the plate that holds the hand guard together and the scope. The reason for this is because the hand guard plate needs to be hammered off to get to the battery compartment and the scope is off spec from the mounting rail so it too needs to be hammered on. The scope‚Äôs battery cap is missing but the illumination reticle didn‚Äôt work anyways.  There is also a chipped piece of wood on the hand guard but it is hardly noticeable.

I'm definitely missing things, this is what I can remember off the top of my head. I am the original owner and only shooter of this bow. It is in excellent condition and has been extremely well taken care of. This is basically a kit with everything you need to maintain the bow and arrows, including re-fletching the arrows properly. I am not interested in trades because I need the cash for rent, or I wouldn't even be selling this. It has taken me around two years to gather everything I'm selling, and it's more than worth the price listed. If your going to try and low ball me, don't even bother reading any further.

These are molded, not forged. Unsure of the ""brand"". I highly doubt they are ""American-made"".

They are not airsoft sights - they have been tested on a real AR. Likely Chinese - I have a UTG (Chinese) clamp-on rail with mounted sights - holds zero fine after 700 shots, and after countless rail re-mounts. Without fail, I have tried to make ""Chinese"" sights/rails lose zero and I have experienced no bad luck.
