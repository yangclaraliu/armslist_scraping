The 'Hi-Point .45 ACP' is a polymer-framed, semi-automatic, blowback-operated pistol manufactured by Hi-Point Firearms. The pistol has an integral accessory rail, and a thumb safety. It is also capable of firing +P ammunition. The weapon uses the large .45 ACP cartridge, and is the largest pistol that Hi-Point manufactures. The weapon comes with a lifetime warranty like other Hi-Point firearms.

Hi-point's handguns use a simple yet reliable ""Blowback Design"" similar to that used in the Walther PPK and Russian Makarov PM. In blowback weapons the return spring and mass of the slide absorbs the rearward force generated by the propulsion of the bullet. As the slide moves back, an extractor hooks the empty casing and pulls it out of the chamber after which the case is ejected from the weapon. When the slide has completed its rearward travel, the recoil spring moves the slide forward, chambering another round. Many modern handguns use a locked-breech design and therefore do not require the amount of mass that the blowback design requires in order to remain safe to fire, comfortable to shoot, and easy to control during the firing process. For this reason the felt recoil for the shooter is decreased.

When the last round is fired and ejected, the slide will lock in the open position. There is no slide release on the Hi-Point .45 JHP, so releasing the slide is performed by pulling the locked slide further back. When another magazine is loaded into the weapon all that is necessary is a short pull back, unlike the full length pull to chamber the first round."

Bushmaster has reworked their magazines to offer significant improvements in function, durability and value. The aluminum box is stamped with a full ""progressive"" die to produce tightest tolerances. The welding process along the box seams has been automated to insure optimum weld ingot, strength and compliance with MIL-STD. The surface finish has been improved to meet or exceed MIL-PRF-46010 (required for U.S.G.I. magazines). Magazine boxes are treated with Molybdenum Disulphide (""Moly"") for its exceptional adherence properties which ensure long lasting protection and lubricity - far superior to the PTFE (Teflon) used on other magazines. Finally, these magazines now have a new ""anti-tilt"" follower that ensures the round is fed into the chamber properly - preventing failure to feed problems. Drop tests have proven the advantages of the anti-tilt follower over the traditional green follower. As an additional aid, the followers are caliber marked - 5.56 in this case. Highest quality tempered steel springs, and Bushmaster logo stamped baseplates (removable for cleaning) round out the improvements on these superior magazines - which have been endorsed by the National Tactical Officers Association. 

Price there $22 and out of stock. Price here $15 each. 9 available.

And the 40 rounders from their site:

These are new .223/5.56mm Cal. 40 Round Magazines with a matte gray finished box and mil. spec. green follower.

I don't know much about this pistol as I purchased it a few months ago in its current condition.  I do know that it was made before Kahr acquired the AO brand, and because of that, they were unable to tell me when it was manufactured.  I had a licensed gunsmith check it out and he couldn't find anything mechanically wrong with it, and said it possibly has had a trigger job in the past.  I put 100 rounds through it with no problems.  It has a pretty crisp trigger break and is surprisingly accurate.  

The 1911 does look a little rough.  It has surface scratches and finish wear, however, it has no rust that I can find.  I feel it would be a good candidate for a build.  Included are two GI style magazines, each holds 7 rounds.  One has a slam pad.  If you have any questions please TEXT me at REDACTED.  I can send picture messages if there is anything else you would like to see.

It is in great shape and aside from some slight wearing on the control surfaces it appears to have been handled and fired very little.  Has a set of Hogue grips on it that make it fit the hand very nicely, also has night sights on it and while they aren't crazy bright they still have enough life left in them to be usable.  Only comes with one mag but it is an extended 8 round mag and P239 mags are readily available online.

I'm primarily interested in trading for a XDM 40 3.8in compact (needs to be the compact with the shorter grip, not interested in one with a fullsize grip.) I would trade straight across for one assuming its in great shape and comes with all the xd gear.  

I would also be interested in either a glock 27 or an XD40 subcompact with cash, ammo, or extra mags to even out a trade.

Will sell for $600 firm if not interested in trading.

Got this in trade but more into milsurp rifles. It has engravings on both sides of receiver with geese, a dog and some pheasants. Trigger pull is light. Also, these can be slam fired meaning you can just hold the trigger and keep pumping the action to fire faster. Would be a great skeet gun, match gun, or first gun for a kid.

I've been a pawnbroker and have ran a business for over 10 years now,
The business just isn't what it used to be!
I used to be a carpenter, an electrician and now basically a jeweler/haggler
For 10 years now.
I enjoy firearms (very much), and love to tinker with stuff and do my own gun smithing work
I have startup cash as should you if you're interested.
I would really like to discuss it over a range visit, and maybe a cup of coffee and talk about what we can do and how and where to get started.
With the way the firearm market is I think now is a great time and it can be very lucrative!


I need to get out of my business because of it being so slow, and what other booming business is there in this economy.....guns!

If interested please email me and we can further discuss our options.

Thanks for your time,

It simply says ""Germany"" on the top of the barrel. It's in great condition, with 75-80% of the original blued finish, and original grips. It functions flawlessly, and still has good rifling. It comes with one mag and the original holster. Do not miss out on this rare opportunity to own one of John Moses Browning's seldom seen masterpieces. Trades and negotiation considered."

I have up for sale or trade a Ruger LCP 380 acp in fantastic condition. It has less than 5 rounds down the pipe and functions perfectly. I happened to be at the shop the other day and this exact setup without the extra case was 469.99 plus taxes and fees. So this is a steal for the right person! It also has a Lasermaxx laser installed on the trigger guard. It comes with the factory box, paperwork, zip cover, and also a extra conceal carry holster. This is a great little gun that I would love to keep, but I really would prefer to get a 9mm. I would like to trade it for a LC9 or possibly a CM9, PT 709 slim, or possibly even certain other pistols. Just shoot me an offer on her, the worst I can say is no. I know what this is worth, and I know what they sell for. I would possibly be willing to add cash for the right trade. I would also consider partial trade for certain guns as well. my cell is REDACTED if you have any questions or would like pictures. Please text only because I recently damaged the mic on my phone, so I cant actually ""talk"" on the phone. PLus text message is a quicker means anyway. 
Thanks for looking

The Ruger Single Six is a single action rimfire revolver produced by Sturm, Ruger. The Single Six was first released in June 1953.[5]

The Single Six is currently produced as the New Model Single Six. The term ""New Model"" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single Six, though this will lower the value for those in pristine, collectable condition.[6]"

Other info: Up for sale is my Kimber Eclipse Target II (5""/full size 1911). I am the second owner of this pistol and can tell you its a gem.  I personally have shot a total of 15 rounds total through it. The previous owner who is a friend of mine told me he had shot 1500 or so... very little use! That is an honest 1500... the only reason I am selling this one is because I own 3 of this exact same pistol and the wife is in my ear about getting rid of some of the stuff that I do not shoot very often.

This Specific Kimber is an early series II Kimber (the older style Kimber box)!  For you Kimber guys, you know that the series I and early series II Kimbers are far better quality than the mid/late generation pistols.  This pistol is a treat to shoot and the trigger pull breaks like glass... it is extremely crisp and snaps right at 3-3.5 lbs. This thing shoots like a dream. The pictures of the gun do not even come close to doing it justice.  As you will see from the pictures, this pistol looks close to NIB and in my estimation would rate this overall as 96% with no visible wear! 

**As a side note, the pistol is being sold with the original grips as it came from Kimber, comes with Original box, Paper work, blue Kimber bag, and 1 mag.**

I am asking $1000.00 firm on this (plus the actual shipping if I need to send it off). 

As always, if you want more detailed pics, feel free to ask and I can email them to you!"

I bought this off Armslist back in March from a guy who was forced to downsize his collection by his wife, lol. It's a great gun, but I just don't have time to go to the range anymore and frankly lost a lot of my interest in guns. I guess it was a passing hobby for me. When I bought it, the guy told me it had about 200-300 round through it. I put maybe another 100-150 so it's gently used.

It comes with the original case (not pictured), 4 total magazines, and I am throwing in a box of 100 Federal target rounds. I'm asking $475 *firm* as that is less than I have in to it. I'm not looking to do any trades, just a cash sale in the Madison area. Any offers below $475 or offers to trade will be ignored.

I'll only meet somewhere on the west side of Madison at a public place of my choosing. You have to either have a CCW or certify that you are legal to own a handgun and ammo in the state of Wisconsin. Preference will be given to CCW holders. Cash only...no checks, IOU's or any of that stuff.

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands.

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

The CZ 452 Ultra Lux is a beechwood version of the CZ 452 Lux. The Ultra Lux has a 28” barrel for more precise shooting with the factory equipped CZ tangent sights. The beechwood stock is offered on this model to bring our customers the same quality you expect from CZ-USA at a lower price. 

The military style tangent sights combined with the hooded ramped front sight is calibrated out to 300 meters.  While the effectiveness of the .22LR is significantly diminished at 200 meters (about 219 yards), when a suitable range is available for testing, it’s fun to see just how accurately the sights are calibrated."

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

Hi-Point .40 caliber pistol with ""dead-on"" accurate, rail mounted laser (red).... and olive HOGUE Grip. Gun has been taken good care of and hasn't had 200 rounds through it, yet. Functions perfect and has never had a hiccup. The Hogue grip feels like it is a part of your hand and the laser is bright and tight and accurate. I carry a 600.00 Springfield XD40 and would reach for this Hi-point as quickly as I would the Springfield. The original heavy slide blowback design of the Hi-Point makes them very reliable. And it is very accurate. This is not a Jennings or Raven or FIE or Titan or any of that other zinc/pot-metal junk. Hi-points hardly ever fail. They carry a lifetime warranty with the Hi-Point company ..that is located in-I believe, Ohio. They will honor the warranty regardless of whether you are the original owner or not, forever. No receipt required, send it to them, they fix it and send it back with any new applicable upgrades and a free magazine. The gun looks perfect and functions perfect"

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

From DW-Our Classic Bobtail has proven so popular due to its concealable profile that we decided to bring you something even more concealable -- the Concealed Carry Officer. This model is built as a classic CCO, with a Commander slide on top of an Officer frame. This combination provides the control and reliability of the Commander with the easy concealment of the Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP in the two provided 7 round flush base magazines, you won’t feel under-gunned.
To make it more comfortable and make it disappear even easier while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce the overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. To help control recoil, we included an undercut trigger guard and our new “Chain Link” pattern on the front strap and mainspring housing. The slide and small parts are coated in the same “Duty” finish that we use on the Valor. Like all of our night-sight models, you will find dual colored Tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO wears a medium length trigger shoe to facilitate faster draws and a better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled Shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional. MSRP $1479. Best FTF cash offer. Thanks"

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

The P250 Compact Threaded Barrel features a 13.5X1 LH threaded barrel with protective knurled cap for the attachment of suppressors or other threaded accessories.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from SIG SAUER.

Mine is new in box, unfired.  No issues with it.  Comes with all normal stuff and 2 mags.


I prefer the Glock OD or FDE color.......the one I really want is like the desert sand color GEN 4, but I am open to any Gen 4.  Might possibly consider a Gen 3 if the right deal.


Mine is stock so does not need to have Night Sights but if it has a trigger job done by gunsmith, that would be great.  If yours has extras like trigger job, extra mags, extended slide release, pinky extensions, we should be able to work something out to make up difference if price is realistic.





Must be FL Resident and legal age, no felons......prefer cwp and FTF only near Clermont............please look it up b4 emailing me.  I will only drive 10-15 minutes to do this which would be the edge of Clermont.





I prefer New with box gun, but possibly open to a very lightly used one.  





I would also consider trading toward an inexpensive AR. By inexpensive I mean under $1200 based on walmart pricing. I have a few other guns I could trade and a bunch of ammo I can trade to even up the deal.  Upper and lower must be same manufacturer please.

This is a 6T serial # John Inglis Browning Hi-power, manufactured in June 1945.
When the Belgium factory of FN fell to the Nazis, the blue prints for the Browning Hi-Power were smuggled out to Canada and the John Inglis company began manufacturing them for the Commenwealth forces as well as the Chinese. The pistols were only produced between February 1944 and October 1945 before operations were moved back to the recently recovered Belgium factory. This is the Mk1* Commenwealth version

As far as I can tell the original finish is intact, All serial numbers are matching on the frame, slide and barrel. Proof marks for Canadian Army behind the trigger guard. The Barrel grooves are bright and shiney, the overall finish of the gun is scuffed. Comes with 2 magazines however they are not the originals."

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

Springfield Armory’s® Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details.
They have, once again, raised the expectations of what a polymer pistol can be.
Fiber Optic Front Sight -Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots
Adjustable Rear Sight-Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination
Lightening Cut -The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used"

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

The Classic Custom features the following:

-5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.

-Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.

-25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing.

-Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI.

-Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only.

-Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight.

-Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly.

-Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button."

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

The Classic Custom features the following:

-5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.

-Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.

-25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing.

-Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI.

-Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only.

-Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight.

-Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly.

-Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button."

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

The Classic Custom features the following:

-5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.

-Weight: approximately 40 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted.

-25 LPI checkering on forestrap and mainspring housing.

-Special mirror finished slide, with 50 LPI serrations on back of slide to match serrated adjustable sight, top of slide is flattened and finely grooved at 40 LPI.

-Traditional ""square cut"" cocking serrations on rear of slide only.

-Adjustable rear sight buried deep into slide, cross dovetail front sight.

-Two-piece guide rod for smoother cycling and easier disassembly.

-Mag catch with Oversize 40 LPI checkered button."

-The Classic Custom includes all the classic modifications. Known as our flagship firearm, this is our finest work, and many of our repeat customers say it's the finest pistol available anywhere, at any price. It has all the bells and whistles, and includes those extra enhancements that you don't really need, but really want! Many customers think of it as the proverbial safe queen, but don't let that fool you - it can take just as much hard service as any pistol out there. The unique slide treatment sets it apart from any other pistol. The sides of the slide are painstaking kept absolutely flat and true with crisp edges, and are then brought to a gorgeous mirror finish by hand, to contrast and enhance the glass bead finished frame. This gorgeous mirror finish really makes the Classic Custom stand out! The top of the slide is flattened and finely grooved to provide a no glare runway effect that naturally guides your eye to the front sight. The rear of the slide is finely serrated 50 lines per inch to match the deep buried adjustable sight and eliminate distracting light reflection. The frame of Classic Custom is elegantly finished in fine 25 LPI checkering. Also included as standard with the Classic Custom is the two-piece guide rod, and oversize magazine release button. We think you'll agree the Classic Custom represents the ultimate in quality firearm craftsmanship at it's finest!

The Classic Custom features the following:

-5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy.
