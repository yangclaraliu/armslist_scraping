Hey everyone, 
I have an old Blackpowder for sale or trade. It is a American Eagle Arms Corp 45 caliber. It is almost an exact clone of a thompson center hawken rifle. It is made in Italy and is in pretty good shape for its age. I have been told by 4 different people that it was probably imported in the 70's or so from the italian company who also makes the guns for hawken or lymon. This was proofed in 1977 due to the stamping it has on it. It isstamped made in italy and has the proof marks as well. It looks to be an originally ""browned"" gun instead of the regular blued. If not, then the patina is really good and gives the steel that ""browned"" look. The only thing this may need is the brass jag on one end of the ram rod is missing. I looked and you can get a replacement for pretty cheap (literally like 5 dollars on some sites), but overall this is a really good gun that mainly just needs a really good cleaning and oiling down. This is actually a pretty decent gun and would be a great setup for someone wanting to be more traditional that all these inline muzzleloaders out there. I would keep this for myself but I already have a Lymon 50 and a Thompson 54 and really dont want to have to make a bunch of rounds for this gun as well. So I am passing it on to yall to play with!"

This rifle  is in near perfect condition.  The only blemish on the rifle is a small indentation on the handguard/monolithic rail just above the GA Precision Roll mark on the left side of the upper receiver which is visible in one of the photos below.  The scope is in perfect conditions with no nicks/marks or dents with the exception of a dent on the scope cover and as always is covered by Vortex's Unlimited Warranty if you do find any issues with it.

The rifle is configured with these options and I have not modified anything after receiving it.  I have all of the original material that shipped with the rifle including invoice (pictured), bumper sticker, guidelines and product advertisements.

Right now the estimated lead time if you were to order today would be 10 months so here's your chance to buy one of the best precision Semi-Auto rifles available (According to Klin on Snipershide, February 2013 orders are just starting to ship so this lead time could be longer, could be shorter)

Will only sell scope if rifle sells first and buyer doesn't want the scope.  I accept paypal discrete +3%, USPS Money Orders (Must Clear before I ship) or Cash for a FTF in SE Wisconsin (Milwaukee, Waukesha area)
Feel free to PM or email me with questions, first to post ""I'll take it"" in the thread gets it.

Only trade I'm interested in would be a black SCAR 17 in excellent condition + Cash on buyer's end.

I'm not an experienced precision shooter and I don't roll my own so the groups you see below are my best, and a much better shooter can probably have much more impressive results.  The rifle seemed to shoot best with Copper Creek .308 win Gas Gun 175 SMK Match Ammo.  I've posted my best 5-shot groups below shooting from a bench with bipod and rear bag.  Anything not labeled specifically in the pic was shot with the Copper Creek 175gr ammo.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, Novak® night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

It was manufactured by DWM in 1916. Most of the numbers match, however the grips, side plate, and one one other small piece (not sure what it would be called) are of a different SN. It does however have a matching magazine which is a relatively rare occurrence. The matching mag has a small piece of wood missing from the baseplate however it still holds ammunition. For this reason I have never fired any rounds out of the original magazine. The spare magazine is fine. I've put two mags down range and it would not cycle 115gr FMJ, but had no problem with 125gr lead round nose. (I've read numerous times that the P08 doesn't like anything less than 124gr) I have no papers or history on the gun. The finish appears all original, no rust, and action locks up tight.

The rifle will ship in it's original box with the M16 operators manual, cable lock, and original invoice.

This rifle has about 500 rounds through it of all brass cased non-corrosive ammo (90% federal, 8% PMC give or take with a few different brands of Match ammo for accuracy testing thrown in) and is in excellent condition. The only noticeable blemish is a small scuff on the right side at the end of the barrel. This rifle has been extremely accurate for a non-match rifle and I've gotten under 1 MoA with match ammo on a good day.

Price for this rifle without the Geissele trigger (will reinstall original mil-spec trigger) is $1200 + shipping obo

(Milwaukee/Waukesha area). (I do require buyer to sign a bill of sale for FTF transactions and preference given to CCW permit holders)

First to IM/email me and post ""I'll take it"" gets it.

The only reason I'm selling this is because I got a great deal on a Daniel Defense M4 and my family's company does direct business with them and I like to support the companies we do business with, so even though BCM has a great reputation and manufactures an excellent rifle I just don't have a need for it to sit in my safe next to 2 other ARs.

THE ARE DISCONTINUING THE GEN II LINE OF LOWERS



everything they make from now on will be the gen 1 and the brand new gen 3s



info about these lowers:

The new Gen2 receiver features a Flared Magwell, Integrated Trigger Guard and Reinforced Buffer Tube attachment area. Sounds like a nice Billet lower but these are actually Forged lower receivers.

Features:

    Flared magwell for speed reloads.
    Flared forged lower uses standard take-down and fire control pins.
    Receiver is mil-spec hard coat anodized aircraft grade 7075 T6 aluminum.

Note: The Surefire 60rd and 100rd mag will not work with this lower.



all of the gen 3 lowers will be billet, for those of you that dont know, billet lowers are heavier and thicker than your standard lowers since billet lowers are not as strong as forged they have to make them thicker and which then makes the require to retain more aluminum, which means more weight.



once again, these are no longer being made and these are the most sought after lowers because of the design which is normally taken up by billets.



if you really want to make a great noveske rifle or a great rifle in general your gonna want one of these lowers.

I have owned this handgun for almost 25 years.  It has never failed to fire.  Granted, I have NOT shot thousands of rounds through it.  The pistol has had maybe at most a few boxes of shells through it over the years.  It wound up being an under the seat or bedside gun for many years but does not show a lot of wear as it was kept in a small gun case most of the time.  It fits well into a pocket. For the last several years it has been sitting lonely in my gun cabinet. 
First and foremost, this is an American made gun.  It was designed by Douglas McClenahan who had previously worked for Colt, High Standard, and Ruger before he founded Charter Arms in 1964. When Charter introduced the Undercover, at 16 ounces, this was the smallest, lightest, steel framed revolver in the world with the fewest moving parts and included a then unique hammer block safety.  The innovative design of the revolver included a one piece frame (with no side plate) which gave the gun additional strength and allows it to safely shoot high pressure loads.  Several of the Charter innovations have been copied over the years by much larger manufacturers.  Due to its continuing popularity, the undercover is still in production.  As such,  there are a wide array of new grips, lasers, holsters, etc. that will fit this revolver.  The suggested retail for new Charter Arms Undercover .38 special revolvers is between $330 to over $425 depending on the exact model.

This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.

As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge.

I am sure everyone has heard of the company EO Tech, which produces weapon sights commonly referred to as a ""Red Dot"". 

For those of you who are not familiar with Aimpoint, they are the less known company that produces optic for Military/LE. 

In my first hand experience with using many different weapon optics as a Police Officer, I prefer many Aimpoint optics to EO Tech products due to a much longer battery life and lightweight design. 

The Aimpoint Pro is a Patrol Rifle Optic with a ""Red Dot"" LED projection used for quick target acquisition. The Aimpoint Pro can be mounted on M1913 standard Picatinny rail.

The optic provides 4 NVD *(Night Vision) settings and 6 day time brightness settings.

The sight is housed in high strength aluminum that protects the optic against damage it may face Military/LE conditions.

This is more stress than any civilian weapon will never be put under. Simply put this Optic is extremely durable!

It is water resistant and is submersible to 150ft. 

The Optic has a continuous use (Always in the on position) of over 30,000 hours, or 3 years with one battery. One 3V Lithium battery, type 2L76 or DL1/3N is used to power this Optic. 

This optic was mounted on my Daniel Defense, (DDM4LE). After sighting in the optic and around 5,000 rounds put down range, it has kept its zero and never needed to be re-sighted. Even at 100 yards this sights is extremely accurate and makes an unexperienced shooter look like a pro. It is best suited for closer range an allows for quick target acquisition. 

I have experience with many optics and I will say it is an excellent sight for the price and I have zero complaints about how it has preformed. 

I have had it for less than one year, and it has approximately 20 hours of battery use. When not in use, the sight along with my weapon is stored in an air/dust/ moisture tight Pelican Case. It has never been dropped, has no damage and works perfectly. 

I am selling my Aimpoint Pro to fund another gun purchase. 

This sight sells new for around $415 without tax and shipping. For $300 this is a very good deal for someone looking for a very high quality optic.

I have the original factory manual and comes with the Aimpoint Pro mount and lens covers. 

I have posted a link to Aimpoint's website with more specific information. You can also look at reviews on youtube and online and you will find it has excellent reviews. 

I have also posted several pictures of mine mounted on my weapon and the sight by its self. 

Serious buyers only.

Ideally I would like to trade for the same gun with comparable ""stuff"" in 9mm. After that I would like to look at lightweight 1911's in a compact carry format... Sig, Kimber, Colt...ot really brand particular.

If the trade is for something other than a 229, I also have a Raven concealment and a CompTac minotaur holster for the 229 that can be added. Ammo can include up to 80 rounds 40 S&W SD rounds and 250 - 357 sig SD rounds for the right deal.

Dont want to write a novel, but know that we can ""make a deal""


Sale price for the gun, 4 mags and 50 rounds each caliber = $800 FTF


I will not sell the additional ammo till a deal has been made for the pistol.

The only parts that are stock is the action and barrel.
Had about 100 rounds put through it.

New parts:
Timney 3lb trigger (drop in) very clean break
Axiom Knoxx stock (w/ cheek piece) Reciol **recoil reduction by 25%** Custom Paint
^^ Free Floating Barrel Stock
Solid Rail (no rise)
TRS Competition 35mm rings (low profile)
Millet LRS-1 6-25x56mm (illuminated 0-10) Mil-Dot Scope With sun shade BEAUTIFUL OPTIC. Smooth parallax from 50m-infinity. Locking turrets and 140MOA to move for elevation and windage. Crystal clear picture!!!
Harris Bipod (S-BRM) notched*
Precision Armament- M11 Severe Duty Muzzle break **recoil reduction by 50%** Increased ability for follow on shots, reduction of dust signature.

Believe me when I tell you that this is nothing but custom and beautiful. Holds excellent groups with Weatherby's name on the line. Research the ballistics for more info.
Coming with the weapon:
-about 63 rounds custom Hornady 185gr Nosler Accubond rounds.($227.50) Value
-20 rounds weatherby ammo (poly-tip) 185gr rounds. ($62.50) Value
-Tac sling
-25 EXTRA batteries for the ILUM scope
-.300 bore snake

Again, not a lot of detail, but I am testing the waters.
Asking $2,000 OBO.
Throw some offers at me- worst I can say is no right?

Honestly I bought it in the hopes that I would shoot it and never did. The gun is very cool and in great working condition, I just don't have the bullets, powder, etc. needed to try it. It's a great conversation piece and would definitely be a head-turner at the range or with your friends. It is a 44 caliber and all the numbers on it match. Although Kassnar didn't make many of these I am not claiming that it is extremely value, I know there are a lot of similar pistols out there. I would just like to get something else to play with or my money back at this point. If you have any questions or offers feel free to email me. Thanks!"

For sale is my Ruger Mini-30 7.62x39 cal. rifle with scope and accessories. I am the original owner of this rifle, which has been well cared for by a serious adult owner. It has roughly 1500 rounds through it, and has been well maintained. It has NEVER fired corrosive-primed ammo, and has always been cleaned before storage.

It shows some minor cosmetic wear - a bit of bluing wear inside the bolt handle track and some minor scuffing of the folding stock near the magwell - which I have documented in the photos. Otherwise, the bluing is intact and good condition throughout. The factory stock is in good condition, with a couple small nicks on the right side, one above and behind the trigger group and another on the forend near the shroud. The chamber and bore are clean and unmarred and the crown is likewise undamaged. The action is in excellent working order and chambers, fires, and ejects properly. The firing pin makes centered and deep primer strikes, which is especially important if you plan to shoot Eastern-bloc surplus ammo with hard primers. No modifications of any kind have been made beyond the addition of the scope and the folding stock.

You'll be getting the Mini-30, with factory Ruger scope mounts / 1"" rings, along with the original factory wood stock and a Butler Creek side-folding pistol-grip composite stock. This is the earlier metal-folder version of the BC stock, not the later all-composite version. It locks in the folded and open positions very positively with no slop or play and includes a nice interchangeable 1"" rubber buttpad that extends the length of pull over the factory stock a little over 1"". It has a neat storage compartment built in to the pistol grip that has a removable sliding door to store batteries, cleaning accessories, etc.

Also included is a nice Tasco 3-9 x 32mm variable-power, wide view scope with yellow-coated lenses and rangefinding reticle. This is a great scope, especially well-suited to this rifle and use in an enviroment where you might engage multiple targets or targets at varying distances. The rifle wears a Ruger folding BUIS (back-up iron sight) in the rear of the original 'medium' height.
Also included are the original Ruger factory 5rd flush-fit magazine and two(2) ProMag steel 30rd extended mags.

Items included:
1x Ruger Mini-30 rifle in excellent operating condition
1x Factory Ruger 5rd flush-fit magazine
2x ProMag Steel 30rd magazines
1x Ruger Factory Wooden Stock
1x Butler Creek Side-Folding Pistol-Grip Stock w/ storage compartment
2x Ruger Factory Scope Mounts and 1"" rings
1x Tasco 3-9x32mm Variable Scope with rangefinding reticle, coated optics, and wide field of view

$1000 Or Best Offer - Will consider trade + (my)cash for NEW SR-556 (5902) or SR-762
Offers less than $800 are unnecessary, as I have a standing offer for $775. Thank you.

I am confident the new owner will be very happy with this rifle! It has always served me well, with flawless function and impressive accuracy.
Here is a Google Drive folder with several more pics:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7GOwZKrqtG2em9rQkx1Y2hIZFU&usp=sharing
Please note that these pics were taken under CFL lighting, and so the bluing looks weird in some pics at some angles. The bluing is dark and original and in very good condition! Also, the first 6 or 8 pics show the rifle without the rear sight mounted and with only one scope ring mounting bolt. This was to save time - these items ARE included and are shown in the later series of pics.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single brand new, factory fresh, and VERY hard to find Ruger Redhawk .44 Mag Revolver, with a long 7.5″ Barrel! The Ruger Redhawk is no longer in production, and so far Ruger has not announced a date for when, if ever, they are going to start production again. As one of our favorite lines of revolvers this is sad news, but it makes these guns even more important to get now before people start selling them as collector items!
