I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.
The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.
Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

This thing is awesome to shoot, Has 260 rounds and shoots solid groups. I used only quality parts on this build take note at some of the parts. I shoot left handed even tho i'm really right handed and the added ambi charging handle , bad lever, and ambi safety's really help. I haven't had any issue with this rifle and it shoots everything loaded into it with ZERO issues. 

Im sure im forgetting a few things. I would take a trade on a safe street bike. Price is not 100% firm but giving the amount of money invested i would like to be pretty close as im already taking a loss.

Would also consider a sweet schwinn but it must be a stingray with banana seat.

I purchased the Model 60 from General Coin & Gun a couple months ago and have taken it to the range a total of one time. It has some wear on the metal from before I purchased it, but the bore is clean and it is a great shooter! The stock has also been beautifully refinished and feels & looks great. It has a 14rd. tube magazine that feeds flawlessly. This is the newer version of the Model 60, meaning it has an improved and streamlined trigger assembly as well as a reinforcement screw in the stock to prevent it from cracking (which was a notorious problem in the older Model 60s). This .22 makes for a stellar small-game rifle, a great first gun or rifle to introduce new shooters to, or a fun plinker. If you are in the market for a great semi-auto .22 rifle, people will always recommend you to either a Ruger 10/22 or a Marlin Model 60. The only reason I want to let go of mine is because I find myself hunting squirrel less and less each year and I already own a sizable collection of Mosin Nagants that I would love to add a new one to!

The Glock 26, often referred to as the ""baby Glock,"" has created a true and practical auto pistol alternative to the standard five shot snub nose revolver. The ""safe action"" system consists of three (3) automatic independently operating mechanical safeties which are sequentially disengaged when pulling the trigger and which are automatically re-engaged when releasing the trigger. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

This gun has original blue and finish.  There are no hair-line stock cracks.  The Winchester butt plate is intact.  The action spring is strong and it cycles cleanly.  This is a fun gun to use on Mourning Doves.  (Face to Face transaction only).  I can send you more images upon request."

Bought used from a Sporting Goods store. Serial # 16-04###, 1979

http://www.ruger.com/service/productHistory.html#

Set up for concealed carry and for use on the cowboy pit at gun range with a friction holster which I cut down to fit the short barrel length and adjusted for pull.  The magazine pouches are hard cased and barely fit the .22lr magazines (for another caliber), they work though protecting them from bending or lip magazine damage.

I have a box of .22lr (either a 500 or 525 round) to go with it for an additional .08 a round (noone has it IN stock for cheaper then that on-line).

Firm on the price. You could not replace the belt, holster, and magazine pouches for less then $60.00.   Holster is nice since it allows you to add the grip laser if you want and is fast on the draw.

=================================

Sold to first person that shows up. I will not hold or wait for your wife to okay your purchase on your next pay day sometime in the future. 

Terms: You have to have a GFL (Georgia concealed carry permit) that is current. We do a bill of sale, GFL to GFL. No exceptions, period.

DHS is buying up 1.6+ billion rounds (750 million .40 S&W) using our tax dollars borrowed from China, enough for a 100 year war in Afghanistan. Which is causing this shortage, along with insane gun restrictions. So ... before we even talk or shake hands you have to say:

""I didn't vote for Obama because he sucks."". No exceptions. PERIOD.

Otherwise you can go back home. I don't want your money.

If you are a criminal and thinking about something stupid, don't bother. I live between two police stations and you have to pass one to get here.

The piston system is a Stag arms proprietary design modeled after the Daniel defense. I have sent exactly 30 rounds through her. Like all standard stag AR rifles it is chambered in true 5.56.
