      Up for sale is a nice piece from my collection. It is a Rock River Arms PDS Pistol. Its Brand New, Never Fired, just been sitting in the safe. Comes with everything original in the case, and you can add on the EO-Tech 512 (Brand New as well, just taken out to mount on pistol) for only $400, and I'll throw in the Magpul Sights for $80 (brand in as well). I bought this from Grabagun.com and spent 1450 with Tax, Shipping, and FFL transfer charge. I will let it go for No Less than $1300. The only trades i'm looking at would be a Vepr 7.62x54r, and cash, or just straight cash. This isn't a cheap AR-15 pistol. Read the reviews! Its awesome! My buddy has one as a SBR and its a fun little rifle to shoot!

EO-Tech 512 - $400 (will not just sell the EO-Tech sight. if you buy the pistol and want the sight, its 400 extra, if not, I'll Keep it.)

engineered with the young hunter in mind.  Chambered for the low recoil 30-30 Winchester cartridge, The Model 336Y is modeled after a Marlin classic, the 336C.  To accommodate a small framed hunter, this carbine tips the scale at a light weight 6.5 lbs. and is only 33.25 inches in length.  The hardwood stock is shortened to a 12 inches length of pull and the 12 groove, Micro-Groove barrel is 16.25 inches long.  The rifle comes standard with an adjustable, semi-buckhorn folding rear sight, a ramp front sight with a brass bead and a Wide-Scan hood.  The solid top receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts and an off-set hammer spur is included with every rifle.  The Marlin Model 336Y is the perfect rifle for young hunters to take their first deer.  They will be proud to join generations of Marlin owners who have engaged in the deer
hunting tradition by carrying a classic Marlin lever action, The Great American Rifle.

Marlin's Model X7S
Madison, NC – Since its introduction in 2008, the Marlin X7 series of bolt action rifles has taken the hunting world by storm! Described as the ""best rifle in its class"", the Marlin X7 series is built for those who demand premium features at an opening price point. New for 2011, Marlin is excited to announce the X7S Stainless series of bolt action rifles. Marlin Firearms has added six, all-stainless, centerfire bolt action rifles to its product lineup. The first model in the new stainless steel series is the X7S Short Action, a standard short-action rifle available with a black synthetic stock. It is offered in 7mm-08 Remington. Made with the latest in rifle design and technology, the X7S has modern yet practical features that matter to practical hunters. Features like Marlin's Pro–Fire® accuracy
enhancing trigger, the Marlin Soft–Tech™ recoil pad, a lightweight pillar bedded synthetic stock and more. Marlin's new user-adjustable trigger system allows the shooter to customize the trigger pull weight between three and six pounds, while providing the ultimate crispness with zero creep. An in–house Marlin design, the Pro–Fire® Trigger Safety prevents movement of the trigger until the safety is fully depressed. The Soft–Tech™ recoil pad significantly reduces felt recoil, making the X7S much easier and more pleasant to shoot than other rifles in its class. Other notable features on the X7S include: a fluted bolt for an exceptionally smooth action, steel sling swivel studs that will not break or degrade over time, pillar bedding for consistent accuracy, a checkered bolt handle, recessed target style muzzle crown, and a classic American style checkering pattern molded into the lightweight synthetic stock.

It comes with the box, two 12rd mags, a barrel cleaner, lock key, and 112rds of 9mm ammo. There are 19rds of Winchester +P hollow points, and the rest are regular ball rounds. The gun has very minor holster wear. The gun also has few, very small divots in the back of the gun on the polymer part. A spec of the white paint has come off of the left rear sight. If it's much of a deal, I can fix the white paint prior to trade. That was all due to a friend dropping the gun, but none of the major gun parts were damaged in any way. Since then I've put over 100 rounds through it, and the gun still functions flawlessly. No jams or anything. I have included a picture of the damage. It's a great gun for someone looking to conceal carry, or just regular carry. I'm open to all offers, and depending on trade, can add some cash on top. I WILL NOT SHIP. I am ONLY willing to do face to face deals. Must have ccw or pistol purchase permit, a valid drivers license, and also, a bill of sale will be filled out.

The EB1 Backup is an extremely compact dual-output flashlight with a 200-lumen maximum output that can be used as a backup light for patrol officers or a duty light for plainclothes officers. It's also ideal for everyday-carry, self-defense, or outdoor applications. The EB1 features a virtually indestructible LED emitter and a precision Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens, creating a beam with the optimum configuration for both reach and situational awareness. 

There are three EB1 Backup models to choose from, differing in the tailcap type/switch type combination: 

Click-type switch with tailcap shroud — Partially press tailcap pushbutton for momentary-on high output; press further to click constant-on high. Return to off and press or click again within two seconds for low output. Raised shroud around switch provides extra protection against accidental activation. 

Click-type switch without tailcap shroud — Like the original E1B Backup. Partially press tailcap pushbutton for momentary-on high output; press further to click constant-on high. Return to off and press or click again within two seconds for low output. No shroud around switch. 

Tactical switch without shroud — Partially press tailcap pushbutton for momentary-on low output; press further for momentary-on high output. Release to turn light off. Twist tailcap clockwise for constant-on low then high output. No shroud around switch. 

The brilliant 200-lumen high output beam is ideal for identifying threats and overwhelming the sight of adversaries. The 5-lumen low output is perfect for reading a map, checking an ID, or navigating in low light with minimal degradation to your dark-adapted vision. The Backup can run at this level for 40 hours, a valuable feature for outdoor or emergency situations. A tough, lightweight Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum body protects the EB1 Backup’s sophisticated electronics, and its smooth contours minimize clothing snag and pressure points. A two-way clip allows head-up or head-down carry. All EB1 models are available in Black, Silver, and Desert Tan.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.

The 883 features the pure fluorite crystal “PROMINAR” 88-mm objective lens, the Kowa TSN-883 offers simply unsurpassed light throughput for the brightest, aberration free images. Despite the huge lens, the durable magnesium frame helps limit the weight of the Kowa TSN-883 to less than 54 oz. Kowa’s inner focus system shortens the prism box on the TSN-883 scope, giving it a compact 13.5 inch length. The Kowa TSN-883 spotting scope features a dual focus system with separate knobs for coarse and fine focusing, an eyepiece locking mechanism, and a tripod mount that adapts to accommodate either a 1/4- or a 3/8-inch mounting screw. With its superb optics and Kowa’s special adapters, the TSN-884 makes a great digiscoping rig. The Kowa TSN-884 scope is completely waterproof and nitrogen-purged to be internally fog-proof. 

The Gitzo tripod features a 6X carbon fiber tube, made of a unique structure of 6 crossed layers that maximises rigidity, vibration absorption and lightweight performance. 6X tube has a high density structure made of top quality ultra-thin carbon fibers (7mm or 0.007 mm). Built-in Anti Leg Rotation is now a feature of the whole carbon fiber range.  Tripod also has a Gitzo G1177M series 1 Center Ball Head.

This combination is valued over $3,500.  Asking $3,000

From a review in Accurateshooter.com by Danny Reever: 
One of my tests included a Snellen Eye Chart, just like the one at your optometrist office. Instead of it hanging on a wall, I placed the Snellen Chart at 500 meters along with some previously-shot paper Ground Hog targets. Conditions were hazy and humid with moderate mirage. My Nightforce 12-42x56mm Benchrest riflescope set at 42X could read line 6 on the chart and I could distinguish only a few of the 6mm bullet holes. My Pentax PF100-ED set at 60X (to match the Kowa’s maximum power) was better. With the Pentax I could read line 7 on the chart and see more of the bullet holes. With the Kowa set at 60X, I could read line 8 on the chart and see all of the bullet holes on the white parts of the targets.. FYI, line 8 on the Snellen Chart defines 20-20 vision at 20 feet. Reading that at 500 meters (1641 feet) is pretty impressive!"

  It's a great weapon with a tough and manly feel (for lack of a better description). The weapon can also be adapted to a .357 by just switching out the barrels with another made by Sig (as you may see on the Mags). Im including these three pics so you can get a good look at it. Just ask if you need any more pics. As you can see there are no scratches or anything like that. It doesn't get used because  I prefer to carry my XD. I received this weapon on a trade from another Marine, but have never shot it because I'm disabled and mostly bed bound so I very rarely get out to shoot. But even though the Marines have taken my back out of commission, they could never (nor could anyone else) take the Marines out of my heart and spirit. Part of that spirit comes with a love of firearms. So I'm looking for another weapon to love (Preferably not a Sig. They are fantastic weapons but for some reason I'm just not a Sig guy. Everyone has that one brand that they prefer not to have for no good reason what-so-ever. Sig is mine :)

unfortunately I can't drive because of my injury incurred in the Marines makes it difficult to do so. So whoever I trade with or sell too has to be willing to come to me in Belfair. I'd make you coffee, shake your hand, smile and tell you war stories if you wish. Thank you for your understanding."

I don't want to part with it, but I am moving soon and have to part with some of my collection. The Wolf ammo is hit and miss, the rifle will shoot accurately at times with it, and it will also short stroke and jam up. I've used other brands of ammo with it including surplus and it ran fine. Just doesn't like the Wolf ammo. The bore is sharp and has no pitting at all. It's best to run the Wolf ammo with the gas valve off and use the rifle as a straight pull bolt rifle.

From what I can tell all the parts match. It's heavy for an SKS, but has very mild recoil."

Price is $540 a piece FTF in the Murfreesboro area. They make a great combo, $1000 buys both. Must be 21 years old, a Tennessee resident, and not a convicted felon. Drivers license required, HCP preferred. I bought these new so must be willing to sign a bill of sale.

Prefer cash but as far as trades go, I'm specifically looking for an all metal, no accessory rail, 9mm Jericho 941 (baby eagle). Also interested in: S&W 5906, M&P 9mm, CZ-75 w/manual safety, and maybe some others. If it's not on the list, chances are I probably won't be interested but it won't hurt to ask.

This is the Shooting USA model - serial number 50. Lightly used and no scratches or blemishes. Never carried (not that we can even do that in IL).

Pistol comes in original box with accessories and all paperwork. Includes two magazines.

Here's the story from the Les Baer website on how this model came about:

When popular television host Jim Scoutten came to Les Baer Custom with his television crew in November of 2010 to shoot an episode for his popular Shooting USA series, he became an immediate fan of Les Baer's 1911 pistols. At the end of two and one-half days of shooting, Jim and Les Baer agreed to offer a Shooting USA 1911 pistol, built by Les Baer Custom. The special pistol includes most of the features of Les Baer's flagship Premier II© pistol (see page 8) and also comes with:

• Tactical extended safety • A special serial number prefix with ""S USA"" and the number • The famous Shooting USA logo engraved on the right side of the slide • Blued finish • (2) 8-round stainless steel magazines 

Calibers: .45 ACP

""I've seen how Les Baer guns are built. We've told the story on TV. You'll never find a better built 1911, with every part hand fitted for extraordinary accuracy and performance. When we finished taping in the factory, I told Les he isn't charging enough because his guns are worth way more than his price.""

 Here's a correct Sig barreled M28 with the ""Ski Patrol"" stock and it's built on an ""antique"" ""96r"" Tula receiver.

 It has a ""Finn"" Civil Guard numbered matching bolt and the butt-plate is also matching the the original serial number.

 This is definately a war veteran, with four small notches cut into the stock across the cleaning rod channel and near the bayonet lug. 

 It's still packed in the storage grease/cosmolene it was imported with  and has not been fired since imported.

 I ran a few patches down the bore and it is very good.

 This would make an great addition to any ""Finn"" Mosin collection especially for someone looking to add an M28 Civil Guard rifle at a reasonable price and without having to deal with those auction hassles.

Serial number is in the correct range and under 3000.

Sling is not for sale with the rifle.
