Up for sale or trade is a Palmetto State Armory AR15 chambered in the powerful 6.8 SPC round (6.8 X 43MM).  This is a nice rifle, featuring the softer shooting, mid-length D.I gas system.  

The rifle is the shortest possible length (a true 16.1""), while still being NFA compliant.  It has a 14.7"" hammer forged barrel that is manufactured by FN which is commonly referred to as ""machine gun"" steel due to its use in the M249 and M240 machine guns.  The barrel is also double chrome lined, 1:10 twist, with a pinned/welded A2 flash hider which brings it to the legal length of 16.1"". 

The rifle has a chrome BCG, fixed front sight,  6 position telescoping stock, and Blackhawk pistol grip.  Comes with a 25 round magazine AND flip up rear sight.  Will also come with PSA box.  

This is a very nice rifle.  I have yet to fire this one, I'm moving it to clear a little space in the safe.  I figured I didn't really need 5 AR 15's.  I could use some of the trades listed below or will sell for cash price listed .

This is a very VERY concealable handgun (possibly more so than my Walther PPS that I love) chambered in 9mm.  It shoots very well (though it's more sensitive to limp wrist-ers) and is pretty darn accurate for how small it is.

I bought this gun from a local gun store, and I shot it very seldomly since I have a gazillion other 9mm that I like for range duty better. And since I use my PPS exclusively for CC, this one just sits in the safe.

Price is $275 firm, ftf only, no trades.

 ""The Hawken rifle was a muzzle loading rifle built by the Hawken brothers, and used on the prairies and in the Rocky Mountains of the United States during the early frontier days. It has become synonymous with the ""plains rifle"", the buffalo gun, and the fur trapper's gun. Developed in the 1820s, it was eventually displaced by breechloaders (such as the Sharps rifle) and lever-action rifles which flourished after the Civil War.

The Hawken ""plains rifle"" was made by Jacob and Samuel Hawken, in their St. Louis, Missouri shop, which they ran from 1815 to 1858. Their shop continued to operate and sell rifles bearing the ""Hawken"" name under later owners William S. Hawken, William L. Watt, and J. P. Gemmer, until Gemmer closed down the business and retired in 1915.

Samuel and Jacob were trained by their father as rifle smiths on the east coast. They moved west and opened a business in St. Louis at the beginning of the Rocky Mountain fur trade. The brothers' claim to fame is the ""plains rifles"" produced by their shop. They produced what their customers needed in the west, a quality gun, light enough to carry all the time, capable of knocking down big targets at long range. They called their guns ""Rocky Mountain Rifles,"" reflecting their customers: fur trappers, traders and explorers""  Ref. Wikipedia"

ABOUT DURACOAT:

DuraCoat is a permanent 2 part chemical coating created specifically for firearms and will last several lifetimes of tough elements and wear.

DuraCoat's combination of elasticity and hardness creates a finish impervious to impact, scratching and the elements.

One of DuraCoat's attributes is its extreme ability to resist salt corrosion UNLIKE STAINLESS STEEL WHICH DOES RUST. A firearm coated with DuraCoat simply will not rust...EVER!"

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Purchased in 2007, this rifle has held it's own in the woods of central Wisconsin and Minnesota for several years. The gun is like new (I really like to take care of my guns) and is in perfect working condition. Cleaned and oiled after each use, this gun appears to look as it did when I took it out of the box. In total, this gun has been fired less than 100 times. I really did enjoy using this rifle with its slick lever action and simple controls, it handles like a dream. The only reason I am selling it is because I tend to use my other rifles more often and would like to see it do more than collect dust. The powerful 308 caliber is enough for any minnesota/wisconsin game and has been proven to work on larger animals such as elk. Traditionally a woods gun, a lever actions typical range is approximately 150 yards. However, Marlin produced this rifle with the 308 caliber (a very flat shooting round) and extended the range of this lever gun to match the 308 winchester round. What you will get is the rifle, mounted scope, and 40 rounds of ammo. The rifle retails for around $630.00 and the scope was purchased for $200 (cabelas). I would really like to get $550 for the whole package but am willing to negotiate. I would consider a trade for a like new rifle in .270 caliber."

transport and storage option for the popular Ruger 10/22. As reliable and accurate
as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep
Americaâs favorite rimfire rifle by your side.

The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the
action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling
them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy.
The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need
re-adjustment after the first assembly.

Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable,
ensuring an accurate return to zero â even when receiver mounted optics are used.
The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that
features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets
with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other
accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer
different carrying options.

The 4.67 pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37â long when assembled; each half
is less than 20-1/4â when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and
provided with one ten-round rotary magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers
legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package.

The grips appear to have been refinished with Tru Oil or some other type of glossy oil finish. Gun is in good cosmetic condition with the normal fine scratches that matte stainless guns get. Bore and lockup are great and it doesn't look like it has been fired all that much. Smooth trigger, regular hammer, white outline/red ramp adjustable sights. Pre-lock S&W revolvers are getting harder to find, and this is a good one at a good price. Check Gunbroker for prices on 686's  and you will see what I mean. I'm selling it to finance a 625JM that has caught my eye.

Would be willing to trade for other quality revolvers, especially a S&W 625 or one of the 7 or 8 shot S&W 357 revolvers.

Sale to a KY resident only, and you must be willing to show me a valid KY ID such as a CCDW or driver's license. This gun was purchased from a dealer and has a 4473 form in my name."

The M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRC to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nationâs armed forces well for the past 40 years. This rifle boasts a practical Patriot Brown Cerakote finish, similar in tone to the popular Flat Dark Earth but darker. Cerakote is a type of thermal cured firearms coating applied over the standard Type 3 hard coat anodizing and offers unparalleled abrasion and corrosion resistance. It also incorporates the benefits of Teflon without compromising its durability. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.A comfortable Magpul MOE+ rubberized pistol grip and LWRC adjustable butt stock are outfitted. This rifle features LWRC BUIS and one 30 round PMAG are included.

No BS. If you've been looking you know this is a good price. You won't find a nicer used Saiga Sporter for cheaper anywhere because everyone is converting them then selling a genuine Izhmash Russian AK-47 for $1000.

Don't have the tools or confidence for the conversion? $899 total and I can do it for you without muzzle-brake in a week's time (will need $150 as deposit from you to purchase the trigger group and other necessary parts from CSS).

This was built to be a top quality rifle and I hate selling it before even getting it to the range, but I just had more unexpected expenses come up and all my other rifles are registered. Every part of the rifle is new parts with only factory testing (on tested parts like BCG and Barrel). I have added a spreadsheet with a detailed list of all items on the gun and prices to buy the items to build it yourself.

Time to reduce my collection. This one doesn't get shot enough.

Make me an offer, and we'll go from there. I would trade for a .45acp with possible cash on my side, but that is about the only trade I am interested in. For what it's worth, I paid $400 for the gun when I got it, and it is in about the same condition now. You guys all know what is fair and what's dumb. Make me a fair offer, and I'll probably accept."
