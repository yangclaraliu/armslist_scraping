More info on the gun below.

The Taurus 24/7 OSS 40 cal. features Taurus' revolutionary single action/double action trigger system that fires normally from a smooth single action mode, yet, if a primer fails to ignite, it provides a life saving second try at firing a faulty cartridge, a feature no other pistol on the market offers. 

Also the ambidextrous decock lever provide ergonomic functionality for right or left hand. The aggressive checkered grip that allows a glue like purchase on the gun, even with sweaty or bloody hands. Add the combat necessary ambidextrous decock/safety levers that allow for cocked and locked and/or double action carry, SA/DA indicator on the rear of the slide shows whether the pistol is in cocked or decocked mode, a reversible magazine release and the 24/7 OSS versatility becomes immediately apparent. Field strip the 24/7 OSS and you'll discover a remarkable 18.5 lb. recoil spring that cycles the slide faster, a heavy match grade 5 1/4"" barrel and a stainless steel guide rod that adds just the right amount of front end weight for improved recoil control and rapid fire accuracy. The 24/7 OSS gives you a lifetime of hard charging performance, bullseye accuracy and unrelenting dependability."

The cosmetics need a little work. I know little history of this rifle other than it sat in a closet for the last 8 years. I've put a few of the many references I used to research this fire arm.

H&K 701445A5 USC Carbine Semi-Auto 45 ACP 16.13"" 10+1 Syn Stk Blk

The USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard hitting
.45 ACP cartridge. Extensive use of the same polymers used on HK's line of
military and police arms ensures light weight and durability. And the
highest grade of weapons steel is used in the cold hammer forged target
barrel, and  bolt mechanism. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a
comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. Hard points located on the
top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails
easy.

I have a combo deal offered for this gun and the tree stand I have listed also.

CANNOT ship powders........Taking offers for combinations of what you prefer.

I have a local FFL dealer for reference. Gun can ship from there as well.  No problem with buyers being afraid of a scam. I can offer any verification requested.

Please READ description THAT IS NOT RUST ON THE BARREL (bow dull that comes off)

Thompson Center Renegade, double set triggers, 54 caliber. Cap lock, not flint.

Original barrel was tapped for scope mount and has a Redfield Widefield LO PRO 2-7x scope on it.
Second barrel is also 54 caliber but the 2 inch longer version and is NOT tapped for a scope mount.

Camo tape was put on this the year I bought it new, and has stayed on it. The ""brown"" spots on the forearm is ""bow dull"" that used to be made and comes off.  THIS barrel has a ""rough spot"" in the barrel near the bottom by the powder charge  (I loaned it out. argh) BUT.....attention BUT....while I bought a newer barrel I LEFT THIS ONE ON because it still shoots groups as well as I can hold them. Even GREAT groups with sabot type bullets (and they go DOWN a tad easier) :-).  Running a patch down the barrel its obvious the rifling is still 90 percent intact as it will turn following such.  This barrel is NOT ""shot out"".

I simply never found the ""need"" to use the other barrel which is in fine shape but a few rusty dots on the bottom where it would sit on the forearm.

INCLUDED is all in the photo. Both barrels, scope, rings, mount. More than 2 lbs of Goex powder, and 80 (ish......I didn't count) cast bullets 435-440 grain.

The extra barrel and scope run over 200 alone anywhere you look. 

Original ramrod was replaced with a metal one and a bullet start is on it as well.

If you price out the extra barrel and the scope then what a renegade sells for.......this is a deal and meant to sell FAST.

I CAN SHIP......but on your nickel if you cannot pick it up.  I can offer my gunbroker and ebay feedback ID so you can see I have 100 percent feedback and this WILL go to auction but rather sell local and FAST.  Shipped in the shown Gun Guard case.

I cannot drive to meet but maybe Plymouth, Rochester or Knox but DO NOT LIKE selling firearms IN PUBLIC........PLEASE DRIVE HERE!

Selling cause retired, broke, and too frickin old to carry this anymore.

GOD BLESS.....take a child to church!.........and then to the woods!

It will come with two speed loaders and about 50 rounds of ammo plus a case and a holster. 

Second is a Sig Mosquito Two Tone .22LR  Comes with Two 10 Round Mags, case, Paperwork, Low Power spring and a Nylon Holster with extra mag Holder.  The Mosquito DOES have a bit of a chip on the rear sight but it doesn't actually affect the aiming. I priced a replacement and it could actually be upgraded to a Browning HP Sport rear sight for around 40 dollars so I'll factor that into the price. 

Both are great shooters but Im looking to save up enough for an AR and I figure this will get me started.  I am roughly asking 300 for the Rossi and 250 for the Sig.  If you buy em both together I'd consider taking 500 even for both.

MOSS. 500 TAC, FRANCHI 500 SEMI AUTO, ARMSPORT SINGLE SHOT BREAK BARREL","NW or Washington Heights, Houston, Texas",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 8, 2013",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,Shotgun,"I have three shotguns and I would like to sell any or all of them or trade them individually or together.  A brief description of each is as follows:

The Mossberg is well suited for home defense as it has an 18.5"" barrel with heat shield, a 6-position tactical stock with side saddle shell holder to carry an additional 5 rounds on the stock.  The gun also has a nylon hand-guard so you don't lose grip on the slide. 5+1 capacity and gun can handle 3"" shells.

The Franchi is a great bird gun, it has a 28"" barrel and has a 4+1 capacity. It shoots 2 3/4"" shells and works great although there are minor scuffs on it and the previous owner looks to have re-glued the forward wooden grip back on at some point or done some type of repair.  The bore is clean and the gun functions great.

The Armsport was a park ranger's ""bear gun"" and has been fired less than 5 times its whole life. It has a 26"" barrel and I put a neoprene side saddle to hold 5 shells on the stock.  Additionally, this gun breaks down into 3 pieces easily which makes it great for a backpack or bugout shotgun.  Minor wear in a couple places but overall great shape.

For cash I would like 400 on the Mossberg 300 on the Franchi and 200 on the Armsport. 

Buy more get a better deal, I am using this money to fund an AR or AK build so cash is great but trades for the right things work too."

It is in excellent condition. I purchased new about a year ago and have only put 250rds through it. The gun has no idiot mark on the frame. The only flaws of the gun are on the barrel bushing and the slide catch. They are not scratches or rust but seem to be spots with light finish. These spots were there when I received the pistol; I'm sure it wouldn't be too hard to touch them up, they just never really bothered me personally.

The gun has hogue extreme grips on it, which are black/grey, I still have and will be including the original wood grips. It still has the original sig night sights. I am including 2 8rd cobra mags as well as the 2 sig mags that came with the gun. Other than the mags/grips nothing has been done to the gun. The trigger breaks right about 4.5lbs and is very clean but not perfect like a high end wilson, nighthawk, etc. The slide to frame fit isn't super tight like high end 1911s but isn't sloppy either. Haven't had any issues with malfunctions with the gun. It is the most accurate 1911 I've owned. The original box/papers will also be included.

I also have ammo for sale (with the sale of the gun only). $20 per 50 rds. I have winchester white box and federal champion - all of which are 230gr FMJ. I have 325 rds available - as seen in pics (the PMC is a partial box - 25 rds).

My price is $850 FIRM FTF for the pistol/grips/mags only in Columbus Area. I am in Westerville. I will ship but I am not a dealer so I would have to ship next day air through UPS and it is not cheap - buyer to cover shipping. Expect $75-80 shipped/insured. I will do $950 for the gun/grips/mags and 325 rds of ammo FTF. Again shipping possible, but buyer will cover shipping.

Please read this twice if you have a trade offer - The only trade I am considering would be an excellent condition/new Sig P226 Combat model ONLY (either threaded/non-threaded okay)- no other versions of the P226. No other trades will be considered so please don't ask.

Please contact me via text if you can for more pics, questions, interest, etc., REDACTED. It is the fastest way to get ahold of me. Otherwise email is fine. Serious Buyers ONLY!

Thanks for looking!"

At least $2444 in this rifle, I'm taking a big loss at $1400 FIRM, I will consider separating without the scope and rings for $1000 firm (20MOA base included), scope is not available except with the rifle.   Don't expect shipping @ this price, and I don't sell to out of state buyers without going through an FFL.  Local sale preferred.   I'm willing to consider part or full trades, as long as you're willing to take a loss on your rifle too.  You may have paid $1400 for your AR, but they are a dime a dozen right now.  I don't need to sell, I love this rifle, but I'm heading a different direction if it sells.

This is an amazing gun, I purchased it in order to get some range and hunting time with it.  I was given a second gun as a gift 2 days later, same caliber and figured I don't need two .308's so I am selling this. I also bought a 20 MOA 1 piece weaver scope mount for it, never even had a chance to attach it but I will throw it in for free which is a $40 value. Serious buyers only. 

This gun is a tac driver from what I've heard, easily can reach up to a 1000 yards with it if you have the skills. If you want to pay me an extra $400 I will throw in a brand new in box  Nikon Monarch 3, 4-16x42 SF Bullet Drop Compensator scope.  The whole package would be $995, that is a serious rifle for under a grand.
