The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots.

Rifle comes with 11 mags.  Three 42 round mags and eight 30 round mags.  Not willing to separate the gun from the magazines, so make sure you include their value in any trade.  I can include the optic as well but if you don't want it no big deal.  It is a PA fixed 3x CQB style scope for $150 on top of the mags and rifle.

Looking to trade not sell outright, I can do trades plus cash.  Guns I am interested in.  20 ga over/unders or side by sides, brands like Beretta, Browning, Caesar Guerini, and Fox.  Winchester Feather weight in 300 Win mag or 338.  Will consider other hunting bolt action rifles in 300 Win mag or 338.  C93's, 20"" A2 or A4 AR 15 rifles.  AK's in 7.62x39, Arsenal or kit builds with original import barrels.  No Yugo Ak's please.  Sig 226's or 229's (no DAK please).  FAL's.  Nor C&R rifles please.

This gun has been a safe queen.  I am in no rush to get rid of this gun, if the right trade doesn't come along I have no issue keeping it forever.  If you make a trade offer make sure and include what you think your gun(s) are worth plus any cash you plan on adding to the deal or what cash you expect in the deal (if applicable).  If you expect full retail for your gun, I will expect retail for mine.

Unfired in original box with papers. The rifle is in excellent condition, the box not so good. This rifle was kept for many years in an enclosed display case. I have not opened the action or so much as run a patch down the barrel. The rifle itself does show some very light handling which was present when I bought it almost 20 years ago. The box unfortunately got bounced around from closets to garage to basement, so it didn't get the respect it deserved. The onion skin paper is ripped and shredded. All paper work is present. I removed the ""Genuine Walnut"" sticker from the stock and attached it to the hang tag."

Original owner.

I purchased this gun locally last fall at sportsman's warehouse in bend for $229 + background check

It's nick-named the ""Noisy Cricket"" and packs a punch!

This offer includes the revolver with 5 round magnum cylinder, owners manual, lock, etc. (it did not come with a box)

I will also include 1 box of premium hollow-point ammo with the sale (50 round box minus the 15 rounds fired)

This .22 Magnum can be used with all popular .22 Magnum ammunition, including .22 Magnum shot shells (called Snake Shot by some manufacturers).

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

Can be hidden anywhere, so there is no excuse not to have a gun on you!

Its a little small for me, and i really prefer semi-auto pistols. But its a very nice little single-action wheel gun in like-new condition.

If you want to shoot 22LR, a second cylinder may be purchased from the mfg. to do so. (as shown in picture but not included) for about $50 plus shipping.

Last picture shows an ad-on holster that folds over trigger and clips to pocket like a knife. (not included)

this is a private sale - i am NOT a gun dealer - i will not ship

i require a private face to face cash-only sale to a non-felon 21+ oregon resident with valid oregon id - ccw preferred
plz respond with a valid email, phone number and your name so i can call you directly or you will be put in spam and your email blocked permanently.

 These are very hard to find, and they will retain their value very well. If this posting is up, that means it's still available.

If you add the cost of the gun, the crimson trace grip, 3 boxes of ammo, and the holster - it's well above $500. Selling all for $450, not a bad deal for a once used gun."

Shooting old bottles filled with water is the oldest form of reactive target because its fun and incredibly cheap and often free to do! But shooting them setting on the ground has disadvantages. They disappear in the grass or the wind blows them over. This holder eliminates all that! It puts your bottle roughly 2' above the ground. Shoot them with any caliber from .22 lr, 9mm, .45 acp to .223 and .308! Set out several at random distances and hone your long range shooting skills! Just $5 each. Shipping is available.

DETAILS:

The new PT 24/7 OSS version was originally designed and built as a .45 ACP to exceed all requirements originally set forth in 2005 by the U.S. Special Operations Command for an intended procurement of a new military .45 ACP service pistol. It was subsequently adapted for .40 S&W and 9mm as well.

On the vast majority of double-action-only pistols there are no manual safety mechanisms. The 24/7 has one, which you can choose to use or not use. Ditto with the Taurus Safety System on the right side of the slide that can key-lock the slide and action and make the gun unable to fire.

Other features common to the 24/7 pistols also found on the OSS are a loaded-chamber indicator, internal trigger safety, Heinie combat sights, molded-in equipment rail, reversible magazine release and ergonomic grip design."

The rifle is in excellent condition, no canting in the barrel/sights etc, everything has a nice tight fit to it. I am the original owner, I have had it for a little over a year now, I have only had about 200 rounds through the pipe with zero issues, it functions just as an AK 47 should, the wood furniture has been refinished and The hammer has been polished giving this rifle a super smooth action. It comes with 2 magazines, a single point sling, the sight tool,  and I can throw in 100rds of ammo. If interested please email me or text me @ REDACTED regarding your offer, and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

In less than a decade, Turkish firearms manufacturers have earned the respect, some of it grudging, of the United States Firearms markets. Fit and finish are second to nobody, only the lettering has been weak at times. That third, most crucial F word, Function, is not a problem. Photos show the first specimen we’ve had of Tisas’s new Practical Two-Tone finish tribute to John Moses Browning’s Colt Government Model of 1911. Manufacturer is Tisas, shorthand abbreviation for Trabzon, Turkey, Gun Industry Corporation. Importer is R.A.R. Express of New Jersey, stamped inconspicuously on the forward under side of the frame; this is the same pistol imported in 2011 by American Tactical. Service Center, should any be necessary, is Guns Inc. in Lexington, KY. Type is Government blowback semi-automatic. Construction is entirely steel, with Turkish hardwood smooth surface grips. Model is Zig M1911, stamped on the left side of the frame. Each pistol comes with standard fixed GI dovetail hard chrome rear sight, and stake-on low profile serrated front sight. Slide and Sight finish is satin chrome; and frame finish is non-glare, weather resistant black parkerized. Action is standard 1911A1 style single action, Series 70 type with main safety and grip safety, but no firing pin safety. Magazine is Mec-Gar blue steel 8+1 capacity. Trigger is .240 serrated face blue steel, and the specimens we’ve received so far gauge in the 6 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. Hammer is traditional short spur checkered surface .430. Barrel is 5 inch stainless, right hand 6 groove 1:16 rifling. Weight empty is 38 ounces. Specs, then, are basically the same as a Series 70 Government Model. Here, then, is a well made, attractive pistol at a very attractive price. We’re offering the Tisas 1911A1 Pistols identical to the one in the photos		each	for only	$ 369.00.

This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Type S Dies use interchangeable sizing bushings that are available in .001"" increments. This set includes Type S Bushing Neck Sizing Die, Body Die and Competition Seater Die.

These work excellent and I have even shot a 1.5"" group at 500 yds with bullets from these dies, I just do mostly full-length sizing so I have to size twice with this die set.  Once with the neck die and once with the body die.  I am also including the  Redding neck sizer .308"" titanium nitride bushing.  I have loaded a few hundred flawless rounds with these dies and they are in excellent condition.  I will put the original Redding lock rings that are in the box back on, I just have my Hornady ones on right now in case I load more before these sell.  With the bushing, these cost me $205 new.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

AR15 type rifles are restricted in many jurisdictions of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for One rifle; dealers, law enforcement agencies, and collectors, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-gun price, and with no additional shipping charges. Here is Panther Arms / DPMS’s response to the economical class of AR15 rifles like Smith & Wesson’s MP15 Sport. Manufacturer is D.P.M.S., Defense Procurement Manufacturing Services, simply known as Panther Arms, parent company to Remington Arms. This is Panther Arms’s A-15 Sportical, a modified descendant of the highly popular Colt C-AR, Collapsible AR-15, that evolved into the U.S. Military M-4 carbine. Like the Smith & Wesson Competitor, it does not have a forward bolt assist, but the FBA is usually not necessary for shooters who practice adequate gun hygiene and keep their rifle bores and chambers clean. Furthermore, according to many of our old head veterans, when it gets so bad that one has to use the FBA, one is already down to a single shot. Barrel is 16 inches of full length medium light contour barrel, 18 inches counting the muzzle brake. The Panther 5.56 NATO Sportical, writes the factory correspondents, has a 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel with 6 grooves, right hand 1X9 twist, button rifled Lite Contour with A2 flash hider (birdcage) 16 inch barrel, gas operated rotating bolt, and a 8620 steel bolt carrier. The upper receiver features flattop Lo-Pro Extruded. The Upper Receiver made of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum. The Lower Receiver is made of 7075 T6 aircraft aluminum and feature semi-auto trigger group, aluminum trigger guard, and a aluminum magazine release button. The stock is DPMS Pardus Carbine Stock. The handguards are GlacierGuards oval carbine length with aluminum Delta Ring. Neither the receiver top, as the photos show, nor the gas block front sight area have sights; instead, there is a a 12 slot Picatinny or Weaver type base on the receiver and a 3 slotter on the gas block front sight area, either capable of securely anchoring any appropriate optical accessory. Buttstock is solid high impact polymer 6-position collapsible, and it allows overall length from 32 1/2 inches to 36.375 inches, a fully extended 14 5/8 inch length of pull all the way to 10 5/8 fully contracted. Weight empty is 6.3 pounds with center of gravity at the magazine well. Each Panther A-15 Sportical is brand new in its original factory box with instruction manual and chamber protector. It comes with its original black finish 30 shot factory magazine. We’re offering the DPMS Sportical rifle in the photos, or one of its identical mates, each for only $ 589.00. 2% Discount if Payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card. Not transferable to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any other jurisdiction where AR-15 type rifles are restricted to law enforcement. For civilian buyers in Colorado, we will sub a 10 or 15 round magazine, usually Thermold or NHMTG.

Unfired Colt Double Diamond set:

I have two of these sets (just picked this one up) and am looking for a trade. I didn't get anything approximating a ""deal"" on it and only bought to trade out for something else. I find that a rare Colt is better currency in the market than cash. If I do not find a trade I will happily keep the set. As you already know these were made in a limited production by Colt for their 150 year anniversary. This set consists of a BSTS officer's model 1911 and a 6"" BSTS Python. The package comes with the guns, presentation case and booklets, no individual boxes. This is a must have for the serious Colt collector. These sets are near impossible to find and I won't let them go unless replaced by other valuable Colt items. What I am looking for is (priority to trades of the more scarce items on the list):
Lew Horton ported or Combat Pythons in nickel or stainless
Factory 3"" Pythons 
Snake Eyes set
2 or 3 digit 1950's Pythons in 97% with ORIGINAL finish with box

With a 2-1/2"" barrel and a weight of about a pound, the P380 is perfect for use as a concealed carry firearm. The stainless steel barrel and slide on the P380 weighs just a bit more than the aluminum alloy or polymer frames of the competition, but it helps ensure that the P380 will be durable and fire reliably after years of use. The wrap-around polymer grip is comfortable and extremely compact. This pistol features fixed low-profile sights and includes two 6-round magazines and the original factory hard case.

On average I have tried to price everything so you would be saving 5-10 bucks per every 50-100 rounds depending on the ammo. All ammo is full and unused and has been stored in a waterproof tool box the last few months. I will try and delete ammo as it is sold. If you are interest in the whole thing feel free to shot me an offer and we can discuss it. I'm in no hurry to sell so no low-ballers please. This is good quality ammo that is well worth the discount price I am asking. So, here is a list of everything I have. If you want everything then I will chop the price down dramatically for a total of $850 which is almost a $200 drop from the retail worth of everything. Depending on where you're located I may even be able to bring it to you for a very low addition. Enjoy and feel free to ask questions!

INCOG is a joint development project between Haley Strategic Partners and G-Code Holsters. 

The INCOG is a minimum bulk, multi-positional, deep concealment holster. Its distinctive features enable the concealed carry of a handgun from a variety of carry positions while facilitating the acquisition of a full firing grip on the weapon prior to the draw. Inherent are adjustments in the depth of carry, angle of carry, the position of carry and security of carry. Adjustments are supported via the unique modular mounting points on the holster and the use of variable mounting components. Combined they maximize function respective to the users: body type, deployment tactics and personal preferences. The holster is adaptive to varying operational environments and mission requirements. 

The mounting clip Incorporates a negative angle designed to force the holster closer to the body. This improves the conceal-ability of the holster without increasing the bulk and supports a higher positional carry without compromise to the positional security of the holster during use. This higher position facilitates faster weapon presentations from deep cover. The mounting clips also have multiple mounting points further increasing the range of carry options and adjustments. The mounting clips open and slide down over the belt and lock in place. The clip is actuated via a finger tab, and is flexed to open allowing quick installation or removal from the belt."
