I turned down $2250.00 cash when it was put in front of me, and would again, so don't waste your time or mine offering $2000.00.   $2450.00 is the bottom line, or I will add your choice of either a Glock 17L or Glock 24 for $3000.00 total If you can buy it cheaper elsewhere you should. I don't have to sell, the rifle and scope just doesn't meet my needs any more, and I have both a 17L and 24. Get the best of the best in three categories bundled in one package deal. Deer hunt here, elk hunt out west. No cheap second rate gear here These two items at retail new price will total $4200.00+ including taxes, so save on this one, and the 17L and 24 are the Glock competition models, and are pretty rare. This is easily researched to verify, so no offers please. I think my price is a bargain, more than fair. The Steyr is Safe Bolt System Pro-Hunter, stainless barrel and action, camo synthetic adjustable stock, in 300 Win Mag. The Swarovski is 2.5-10 X 56, heavy duplex reticle, 30 mm tube, in steel dual-dovetail Leupold rings, no risk of loosening under magnum recoil. Don't be fooled by the imitators. If it doesn't say Steyr or Swarovski it is not the best. In low light at long range you will need these. Also included is a box of Federal Premium 180 Grain Nosler Partition Ammo. Last reduction on price. I will sell it for my price or keep it another year and sell it for more.

Rifle is approximately $1400.00 new retail

Any new 56mm Swarovski scope is at least $2400.00 new retail. I have all of the original box and paperwork for this scope, including the original lifetime warranty registration, never filled out. You can send it in as the original owner. If you hunt early morning or late afternoon, the pretenders don't compare to the 56 mm Austrian built optic.

I will add your choice of a Gen 3 Glock 17L or a Glock 24 to the package for a total of $3000.00

LOCAL AREA FACE TO FACE CASH TRANSACTION ONLY, NO SHIPPING PERIOD.

I have had a number of trade offers, but everyone forgets that my combo is priced about 40% less than new retail with tax, and they want to trade based on new retail or more for theirs, so therefore, please don't send me trade offers.

It is a Beretta SO2, manufactured in 1961. It is in a configuration I particularly like and not normally found on O/Us in the US, i.e. straight grip and double triggers.  As many know, the SO series of Beretta shotguns is the best that Beretta makes and they are all true side locks; not side plated guns. They have classic very shallow receivers and are one of the strongest actions ever devised.  It is also factory equipped with sling swivels that have proven most useful when carrying things into the field. To add to its versatility it has Briley choke tubes. There are 7 chokes tubes and their constrictions equate to: SK, IC, LM, Mod, Imp Mod, LtFull, Full. No gaps in choke constriction regardless of what hunting or clay target game you are shooting. My measurement of the stock says, 1 3/8 DAC, 2 1/8 DAH, 14 1/4 inch LOP with maybe just 1/8 inch Cast Off. It weighs 7 lbs 3 oz which is quite svelte for a 12 O/U. 27 5/8 inch barrels. It has never been refinished but yet the wood I would rate at 90% with no cracks, chips, or gouges.  Very minor handling marks only.  The blue on the barrels I would rate at 80-85%."

Very rare 3"" 45 acp Revolver. This comes with S&W Combat grips, no box or papers. For the know it all people out there who like to sling insults, yes the front sight was modified with a yellow insert, if you want a factory unit to replace it buy one for 5 bucks pull the pin, insert it and reinsert the pin. No, the back sight is factory and not a replacement. Yes, it has a turn line like all bead finished S&W revolvers that have been fired. If you do not want the turn line blast it with some baking soda. Timing and lockup on this revolver is perfect. It has been fired and clearly shows that it has. I am not trying to hide anything

Those guns known to be very cheap in price and for poor quality and poor reliability were generally made by one of 6 California based companies (often known as the ring of fire) here in the US, or were cheap imports from before the FFA of 1968 was enforced.  These guns were made of what is commonly referred to as ""pot metal"", such as zinc castings, alloys with melting points below 800 degrees Fahrenheit, powder metallurgy, or other low-cost manufacturing techniques. The only steel parts were often linings or inserts in the barrel and chamber.  These guns were known to crack, break, bend, and even explode after firing so many rounds. The US companies are Bryco Arms, Jimenez Arms, Jennings Firearms, Raven Arms, Lorcin Engineering, and Davis Industries (now Cobra Arms).

Sterling is a New York based company that started in 1968. They began manufacturing the E&R designed compact handguns in 1972 and produced them up until about 1986. The company moved from Buffalo, to Gasport, to Lockport, but stayed in NY throughout its life.  These handguns were machined from steel and steel only.  There are no cheap metals in these designs at all. These designs were manufactured through traditional machining. Their weight is a testament to that, and the fact that there are still so many of them in existence, and reliable use, is also a sign of their quality.

This particular gun was purchased by my great uncle in the mid 70's for use as a pocket gun while working on his farm in South Dakota, it was then handed down to my grandmother for a purse gun, and then to my mother who has used it as her purse gun. I have now been carrying it as a pocket gun for the last few months.  I have personally put approximately 200 rounds through it.  It is rock solid reliable. 

It comes with 2 magazines that hold 6 rounds each.  One magazine is the original that came with it, and with this magazine there has NEVER been a single FTE or FTF.  The second magazine we bought at a gun show and it does have some issues.  The rear of the cartridges tend to hang up when feeding out of this magazine sometimes, and will stovepipe the live round. It is easy to clear it when this happens, but its a definite concern.  It will either need to have some work done to the top edges, or just be replaced.  I have it marked so that I only ever use it as a ""back up"" magazine. 

Its a great little gun. I am selling it simply because I've decided I want to switch to a .22 caliber pocket gun, because all my others are .22, and I'd like to only buy one kind of ammo for everything.  I will consider trades for .22 semiauto pistols.

I also have .25 ACP ammo. 100 rounds of FMJ target ammo, and 25 rounds of Hornady XTP (JHP), that I will sell for another $40.

It's a great gun.  I've only put about 300 rounds through it.  I'm selling it because the recoil is too much for my thumb that was injured in a motorcycle accident a few years ago.  I still have titanium in my thumb and the recoil hurts with every round.  The pain isn't unbearable but I'm not able to be as accurate because of it, so I'm letting it go.  

The list price for this gun is $529.  The retail value of the ammo is $175.

I'm including 330 various rounds of .38 ammo.  Also an Uncle Mikes in pant holster.  
Also includes the original box, owners manual, soft case and gun lock.

I would take another $75 off if you take just the rifle.
Browning's Ballistic Optimizing Shooting System (BOSS) is a patented breakthrough in rifle accuracy. When any rifle is fired, the barrel goes through a series of vibrations as the bullet leaves the muzzle. The variations of these vibrations greatly affect the accuracy of the rifle. Controlling these vibrations will greatly control the accuracy of the rifle. Browning's BOSS allows you to control the vibrations of your barrel so you can shoot groups you didn't think possible.

How the BOSS works.
 The BOSS simply tunes the vibrations of your barrel. This allows the bullet to leave the barrel the split second it is stationary. The BOSS manual has a list of settings for each caliber and bullet weight. Adjusting your BOSS to these ""Sweet Spot"" settings allows you to find the instant your barrel is stationary. The result is accuracy never achieved before by an out-of-the-box rifle.

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel. With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

Includes: (1) NIB, never fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.

Accessories Included: 400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case. All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition.

The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards. The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches. The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this. Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now. I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.

The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power. I included a picture of that. If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools. It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty.

Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire.... The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR. I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages."

This scope kit is designed to specifically fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

The MIL-DOT reticle on this scope can be used to estimate the range to your target. The smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is an excellent fixed 4X power lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

In this case the use of a hammer extension is recommended. They are manufactured by Grovtec and Uncle Mike’s and are usually available on Ebay or from  larger gun shops like Cabellas.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models."

This model is notorious for short brass shells needing to cool down before ejecting. After 4 or 5 quick consecutive shots with short brass, one occasionally needs to cool down before ejecting. Remington will fix it for free if it bothers you too much. Most all turkey shells are high brass so it never bothered me.  These guns run $425ish new."

PLEASE do your own research on internet - there are a ton of very positive reviews and vids - 

I personally have had the more pricey HK USP and I much prefer this CZ --- trigger pull for one.  Also, if you have average sized hands, you will NEVER feel a more ergonomically comfortable and pleasing grip -- CZ is tops in the area!  This grip is even better then the venerable CZ75.   Quality is right up there with HK too -- my humble opinion - CZs are the deal of the century right now!  

PS - I do think you will find the .40 recoil with this gun (barrel lower in the frame) similar to the 9 mm you are used to.

From CZ site and I quote ""Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions of the P-07 that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package.""   

Also from site:  ""Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty.  The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.""

 Omega trigger system - this is absolutely wonderful -- 

The  P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both CZ 9mm and .40 S&W."

Well the need for money has come up so I must sell my M1919 w/tripod. I hate to see it go, but sometimes life has other plans. This is a Saginaw M1919 built between 1943-1948.  It's was converted from 30-06 to 7.62X51 by the Israeli's before being decommissioned and turned into a semi auto. It comes with a 1942 M2 Tripod (infantry version). Along with a original WWII 250 round belt and a 100 round belt. The timing and head space have been adjusted and it functions great. This is NOT FOR TRADE. I could use the money or I would never be selling this weapon.

These rifles were made for the Indian Military back in the 1960's.  They are very rare, especially one this nice. Ive seen these in worse condition go for $500 at gun shows and on gun auction sites.
This rifle is in pretty good condition for a 60 year old milsurp rifle. The stock has some bangs and notches in it, but its still very sturdy. the original stock was broken when i got it, so i did put a new stock on it that is very nice condition. 

**When i got it, it was quite dirty, so i dissembled it, cleaned it all out, and have kept it that way ever since. The internals are all very clean and sturdy. It is not a piece of junk, dirty/rusty milsurp rifle. Would make a very nice deer or elk rifle.

**This gun is an amazing shooter for such an old rifle. I dont think it was shot more than 50 times, the bore looks very new. At 100 yards with irons, my bad eyes, on a elbow rest i got a 4 inch group from standard 308 fmj. I sure this gun could pull at least 2 inch groups if not better at 100 yards with a scope or handloads.

There are scope mounts made for it, as seen here. Its a non permanent modification too! I just havent gotten into it yet, but i was planing on scoping it with this mount here.

   I just bought a Glock 30 Gen 4 last week been carry it since purchase. I am wanting to sell or possible trade. I love the gun I put 4 rounds through it just to see it. the recoil is less then my Glock 27 and not even close to my Glock 20. the pistol is same size as a glock 19 but the grip is just a little shorter. the gen 4 comes with the extended thing on the mag so it fits nice and tight. fits in my hand really nice. Anyways. I don't think anyone on here has a deal like this so im loosing money on selling.

Gen4 Glock 30  10+1
( everything comes in box  backstraps,clean brush,lock,exc. )
496 rounds of 45 acp ammo for shooting range all brass 230 Grn ( all in hard cases )
40 rounds of the Hornady critical duty ammo this is a 220 gr flexlock JHP I have heard many good things about this ammo from well exp people. they run $24.99 a bock.
also I have a brand new 45 clean brushs, that will come with it aswell as the factory one in the box never used it.
Also have a Holster for it not a galco or black hawk but the really nice plastic ones that suck up to the gun when holstered. it fits really nice and flush against the hip. think they run around $75+ at norpoint shooting range.

Asking $750 for everything that's listed."

Pulsar digisight n550 IR nightvision scope,"Paonia, Western Slope, Colorado",$ 800,"Listed On: Sunday, January 26, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This scope works incredibly well. It works in the daytime, too, which is a huge plus. You can plug it into a DVR or LCD screen and it becomes around-the-corner capable. The circuitry isthe same as the n750 model. The difference is in the ir flashlight that it comes with. The upgrade is under $200 on eBay. A secondary battery pack is available too. Runs on AAs without it for a surprising long time. I was thinking this on an MVP scout would be a nice setup, or maybe an AR, but I need to raise some cash, so I think I'll let it go. It has been used very little, looks brand new, works flawlessly. Comes with a case, manual, and remote control. 
Partial trades will be considered. I'm interest in anything chambered in .45-70 government, AK rifles, pistols, or parts sets, AR parts, CZ pistols, steel framed Walthers, anything Colt, MPA pistol in 9mm, or ammo in 7.62×39, .303 British, or .45 acp. 
I'm asking considerably less than I've ever seen one go for on eBay, armslist or gunbroker. I got a good deal on it, and I don't mind passing that on, but no lowball offers please. Retail is $1499.

They Charge the $1995.00 for just the work, you have to buy the gun and send it to them. Its had around 1000 rounds through it, which could barely considered breaking it in. It has a short reset trigger (when I say short I mean short!!) with the smoothest 3-3.5 Lb pull you've ever felt. It will eat a less than 2 inch hole with all 13 rounds off hand, and I'm no expert shot.


I'm not to awfully picky, so if you have a trade send it my way, multi-gun trades are welcome, but please don't offer me something like ten old shotguns.

I'm not in a hurry to sell so please don't lowball me. I value the entire package at around $2200.00 but it is negotiable, especially if you have a favorable trade offer. I'll let you know, worst I'll say is a nice no thanks. I'll answer any questions you have and will included confirmation that its a true Novak piece.

Thanks for looking, pics, I can send lots more than I can post on here.

I'm selling my FNH FNS-9. This is a 9mm polymer striker-fired handgun with a 4"" barrel. The body is black and the slide is stainless steel. Comes with 3 17-round magazines, a smaller back-strap, a chamber lock, a hard case, a SigTac Level 2 Retention holster with a paddle attachment, and a SigTac double mag holster for the extra mags. 

The long story:

This gun is a well thought out design, and has many cool features:

- 3-dot combat night sights with a deep rear sight notch for great accuracy.
- Low bore axis. Recoil centers better on the hand, making for less perceived recoil and much faster and more accurate follow-up shots.
- 5 safeties: Manual, Trigger, Firing Pin, Drop, and Out-Of-Battery safeties
- Accessory rail
- Changeable back-straps for a perfect fit in your hand
- Ambidextrous safety, slide lock, and magazine release
- Beveled slide and frame for easy holstering
- Loaded chamber indicator

Comes with 3 17-round magazines, a smaller back-strap, a chamber lock, a hard case, a SigTac Level 2 Retention holster with a paddle attachment, and a SigTac double mag holster for the extra mags. Level 2 retention means that it has 2 levels of retention: Friction and a button lock. The holster allows for a full master grip, and the button is pressed naturally by your index finger on the draw.

This has about 600 rounds through it. I've never had a failure to fire or any other problem. Makes for a great reliable all-around gun for personal defense, a duty weapon, or just fun at the range. The low bore axis makes the recoil very manageable. Great for the wife if she doesn't like snappy recoil! I trust my life to this weapon, and you will too.
