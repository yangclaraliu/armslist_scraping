The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

I have only put about 80 rounds through it but I'm the second owner to my knowledge.  380 Hand gun, holster, two magazines, and 80 rounds of 380 ACP included in sale price.  20 rounds of the 80 are steel cased tulammo, and this pistol does not like it very much, but I tried to get through it.  It shoots the brass ammo just fine (60 rounds).  Probably best to use plastic tipped hollow point ammo for self-defense because this pistol only shoots rounded tip ammo or target ammo to the best of my knowledge.  I have not shot anything through it but plinking/target ammo.  I like it better than ruger LCP 380 auto, and defnitely better than diamondback 380 auto.  This is heavier for very steady shot, shoots tight groups exactly where you point it, and small enough to fit in your pocket.  Great starter pistol.  Other Jamenez I have seen have loose slide, but this is tight and very solid.  Be ready to show in state driver's license, and prefer CCW.  Will not sell to kids or felons, and will not ship.

The perfect trainer, it allows for low-cost practice and provides shooters with the familiar and preferred grip shape and feel of the famous 1911 45 caliber pistol.
In addition to the identical grip angles, the 22/45 features the same fire control locations (manual safeties, magazine releases and bolt hold-opens) as the 1911, making them perfect for 45 caliber shooters looking for an affordable way to train. Also perfect for plinking, target shooting, and small game hunting

This is a fairly uncommon model to come across. It is whats being called a sterile rifle. Meaning that the only stamp/information on the rifle is the serial number. This was made on newly delivered Russian equipment made by Chinese labor under Russian supervision. I have read that some were even made from left over Russian parts stockpiles after they had been scrubbed of arsenal stamps. True or not, I do not know, but the people talking about them were well regarded as knowing their shit in their forums. So i'm leaning towards that 'thats what it is' side of things. Also note the Russian style blade bayonet. 

It has about 70% bluing remaining. An early/small import stamp. It comes with 3 stocks. The original, heavily carved up with 'trench art' and a date. 1983? I cant make it out. This one is cracked in a few places and not really safe for shooting, but is included as it was the original, included original hand guard as well. 

The second wood stock is a basic Chinese Norinco that it drops right down in to with zero problems at all for general shooting/use.

The 3rd is a new synthetic Choat Druganov with matching hand guard. 

It comes with the original 10 round magazine, a 30 round steel magazine, a box of stripper clips. cleaning rod. 

I have personally had this one (as I do with every weapon I take in) 
taken down cleaned and function tested. I have sent several hundred rounds downrange with this one & it runs perfectly on a diet of basic steel Tula ammo.

I have about 40 more pics to share upon request."

Say what you will about Taurus but Ive had 3 of this exact model and have never had a problem with them. Good timing and lockup, surprisingly smooth sa/da action, and with the polymer frame and rubber grips it is surprisingly tame for a 2 inch snub while firing .357 magnum loads. Very easy to carry, I carry it daily in my pocket. Has the boot grips on it now but will also come with the full length grip. Its almost new and has only had 140 rounds through it. 

I'm starting to reload .40 S&W so I'm looking to trade it for a subcompact or pocket sized .40 caliber handgun. My top choice is a Ruger SR40c, but I'm open to offers, so let me know what you have. I'm ONLY looking for .40 caliber handguns though, not interested in any other trades.
Don't really want to sell but I will sell the revolver for $350 by itself or with 100 rounds of .357 magnum for $400.  Cash prices are firm.

This ain't that tapco plastic bullshit, this rail is rock solid and makes mounting an optic on the AK a dream. Kit replaces the gas tube and the optic rail mounts to the side of the gas tube insuring that you are not going to lose your zero. With the optic rail in place your red dot is mounted behind the rear sight giving you better eye relief.

It has never been used (fired) so I would say that makes it 99% new. I had it mounted to my AK but removed it when sold the rifle in a stock configuration with plans to put this on a better rifle, instead my girlfriend bought me an AR so I just have this lying around. The forearm itself is $150 new and the optic rail is another $40. I will sell it together for $140.

Up for sale is my upgraded Kimber Pro Carry II. She has a bunch of upgrades done to her (full list of parts below). There is some slight scarring on the inside of the rail (stupid roll pin) but I buffed it out with a dremel and polish. This was a DIY upgraded gun, and yes i've worked on 1911s before and had the work checked out. I'm not 100% sure i'm going to sell it but wanted to see what offers come my way. I'm interested to see what kind of partial trades (with money on your side) are out there. Feel free to shoot me an offer! If I were to sell it for straight cash, I guess i'd probably want around 1200.

List of Parts:

VZ G10 Black Frag Grips (Slimline)
Slimline Bushings for grips
Wilson Combat Disconnector
Wilson Combat Mainspring Housing
Wilson Combat Ejector
Wilson Combat Extractor
Wilson Combat Firing Pin Stop
Kimber Memory-Bump grip safety
Kimber Premium 2-hole trigger

This was a carry gun for a long time, it definitely has wear and tear! She shoots straight, only 400~ rounds down the tube. She does need a new ejector which isn't expensive. More pictures on request (1913 Colt .45 ACP, Colt Mustang Pocketlite pictured not included)"

This ain't that tapco plastic bullshit, this folding stock for your rifle or shotgun is machined from 6061 t6  aluminum and will fit all standard AK/Saiga stamped receiver. This stock is solid yet light weight with a tight lock up however deploying takes very little effort once installed.

It has never been used (fired) so I would say that makes it 99% new. I had it mounted to my AK but removed it when sold the rifle in a stock configuration with plans to put this on a better rifle, instead my girlfriend bought me an AR so I just have this lying around. I did paracord wrap it to improve the cheek weld but it is nothing that can't be removed with a blow torch and a bench grinder. The stock in a left side folder with the quick detach swivel sells for $160 new. I will sell it for $120 firm.

Cash only. Meet in South Kitsap. Will ship, buyer pays shipping.

It has some scratches from the bad finish but all saigas do and it's nothing noticeable until you really look at it.  It has a tapco G2 3-pound trigger in it for precision shooting.  The gun averages about 3 MOA, which, for those of you who don't know is 3 inches at 100 yards, meaning it's almost as accurate as a standard AR.  Extremely impressive for a Kalashnkov.  I'm not selling it because there are any problems with it, but I need money for a new project I'll be working on.  Feel free to contact me at REDACTED and ask whatever you please.  I'm looking for cold, hard cash or a trade for is a mini draco or zastava m92, but only if they're brand new, or have very little roundage on them.  If you're looking to do the latter and trade, then I'll definately make sure we work out a fair price depending on the offer.  Comes without a sling and the furniture is black polymer from arsenal.

The stock is a Black Horse Arsenal Dragunov Composite/Polymer expandable stock.  These are real russian dragunov stocks imported and then modified to fit onto an AK platform and also be length adjustable.  It also comes with its own paperwork.  I replaced the orignal trigger system with a Dinzag Arms Two-Stage trigger.  The bipod is a Versa-Pod Model 51 with a Mini-14 mount.  It is drilled into the receiver between the forearm and the magazine well.  It doesn't hinder the magwell, but there's not much room for fingers.

It pains me to sell this, but I am going to be moving to a newer apartment and the more cushion money the better. I'm asking $1400 + ~$40 with shipping for this rifle package.  Will accept USPS Money order, or a FTF transaction if you are from ND before i move.  No trades.  Will ship to your FFL, but if your FFL will not accept from a private seller I can't work with that.  I don't want to split this up either.  I do have the original box,I do have all the paperwork that went with the firearm and all the accessories.  I put probably around 300 rounds through this total, pretty good groups overall.If there's any questions or requests for more pictures, please don't hesitate to ask.  Good luck.
First ""I'll take it"" gets it."

PredatAR® 5.56 Overview:

The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.

The barrels are Stainless Steel, lightweight-profiled, Wylde chambered and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section.

Both models come with a 6-position Magpul MOE Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies. The lower assembly has the proven Geissele Two-Stage trigger.
