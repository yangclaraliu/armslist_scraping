Shot about 15 rounds and then I let my Girlfriend shoot it. She loved it. She is definitely not a shooter.

It is the heavy barrel version and honestly probably hasn't even had enough rounds through it to be properly broken in (maybe one brick of 22 has been put through it at most).  I bought the gun new a few years ago and just have not been able to play with it as much as I would like.  It has always been cleaned and well taken care of.

•Large Dobsonian reflector telescope with 8"" aperture allows you to see faint deep-sky objects such as nebulas and galaxies, in addition to fantastic views of the Moon and planets
•Locating those faint deep-sky objects is simple with the IntelliScope Computerized Object Locator - it includes more than 14,000 objects in its database, and points you right to each one
•Select the object you wish to view from the IntelliScope database, then simply follow the directional arrows displayed on the hand controller by moving the telescope until the object is right in the eyepiece field of view - it's easy!
•The ultra-stable Dobsonian telescope base keeps the reflector optical tube perfectly balanced for easy point-and-view use
•A precise Crayford focuser allows use of larger format 2"" telescope eyepieces - the bright, wide-field view of the Andromeda galaxy in a low power 2"" eyepiece is jaw-dropping!

guard withstands rugged use. Hardcoat black-anodized finish is corrosion-resistant. M4 double-heat shield handguard protects your hands from excessive heat generated while shooting. 

Comes with one 30-round magazine, hard plastic case and TruGlo Red Dot Sight. I can also toss in two 20 round boxes of 5.56 ammo I have. I am firm on the price since the rifle has only been used once at the range. No damage or scratches to the rifle. Lifetime Warranty!!!

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

Get everything you need for concealed carry at once from Velocity Works!  This Concealed Carry Combo includes:

Pre-owned in good condition CZ 83 w/ (1) 12-round magazine

A KYHIDE leather and kydex inside-the-waistband holster made specifically for that gun

1 box (25 rounds) of Copper Only Projectiles .380 ACP 80 grain solid copper hollow point self defense ammunition

KYHIDE holsters are all hand-made and custom formed to fit the particular pistol model.  Set screws allow adjustment to the retention, while the 2 belt clips can be moved to 3 separate holes for height adjustment.  The 2 belt clips help distribute the weight of the holster over a larger area, and the leather portion of the holster conforms to your body over time.

DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
The micro-sized .380s that have arrived on the scene in recent years have reduced dimensions to the point that they are difficult to control even for the most accomplished shooters. The CZ 83's combination of small size and moderate weight easily handles the new generation of high-performance defensive ammo that has become available for 'pocket' pistol calibers from leading ammo manufacturers. The DA/SA trigger mechanism operates in the same manner as the CZ 75. The 83 can be carried 'cocked and locked' with the hammer back and the safety on for single action operation, or it may be manually decocked for hammer-down carry. When carried in the decocked position, the safety lever does not need to be de-activated, but instead the first shot is double action and subsequent shots are single action. The CZ 83 features an ambidextrous manual safety and magazine catch.

Along with its superior shootability, the 83 boasts twice the magazine capacity (12+1 in .380) of its tiny competitors.

It comes with the long barrel (5 inch) installed and the short one for carry (3 inch). It also has the ten round extended magazine and one 8 round mag without the extension. In the carry configuration it is a small but powerful package with slide, magazine, and hammer safety. It also has windage ADJUSTABLE rear sights. Check youtube. There are no negative comments. These guns shoot all ammo. This example has been fired 50 rounds from new and comes with the new box and papers. I have two. I am keeping the black one and selling the stainless finish. If you want the equivalent of two guns for the price of one call me. This gun is like new and still needs to be broken in. The barrel release is tight (as new) Swapping the barrels is kind of tricky, but it's worth it. With the five inch barrel you can keep up with much more expensive competition at the range and then switch it to fit in your pants pocket.  $160.00. They are selling these all over for that price just for the short barrel version. Don REDACTED."

Description:
The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 

The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. (NOTE: Sub-Compact models feature tilt-barrel locking system and stainless steel construction). 

Other Features: Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block, 3-Dot Sight System, Ambidextrous Safety, External Hammer Design, Individual Size Grips, Reversible Magazine Release, Simple Field Stripping, Light Technopolymer Frame

This is the factory ported model with two round ports. Gun is in excellent condition, I purchased this new and have fired approximately 500 trouble free rounds through it since then. It has been completely reliable with a variety of ammunition and bullet styles including SWC’s and it is incredibly accurate.  Comes with two original Colt magazines w/the orange polymer follower, case, manual, etc.  
All of the information I have been able to find indicates that Colt made no more than 20 of the 07000DZ Custom Colt Defenders all in 1999. This is not to be confused with the run of 100 Lew Horton Defenders with four slot shaped ports that were Magna-Ported 07000D’s .  
Some info on the Colt Defenders I found on the 1911 forum:
There are 5 Defender Models.

07000D Colt Defender .45ACP
07000DZ Custom Colt Defender .45 ACP
07860D Colt Defender Plus 45ACP
07040D Colt Defender 40 S&W
07040DZ Custom Colt Defender 40 S&W

The 07000D is still in production. Early models had a high grip safety, late production models use the lower XSE style grip safety. A matte black finish was an option in 1999.

The 07000DZ is a Colt Custom shop ported Defender. Colt says less than 20 were made, all during 1999.
07860D is the Defender Plus, which has a full length grip and holds an additional round. This gun was intoduced in 2003 and discontinued in 2004.
07040D was cataloged from 1999 to 2002. It also had a matte black finish option in 1999. Total production of 40 cal Defenders is supposed to be less than 2000.
07040DZ is a Colt Custom Shop ported Defender in .40 S&W, made in 1999 in very small numbers, less than 20.
Lou Horton commissioned a run of 100 ported Defenders in 45 acp. These can be identified by their four ports.

Locking Bolts: 8/5 Active
Gun Capacity: 8/16+7 DPX

BODY THICKNESS: 12 GAUGE STEEL
The thickness of the steel that comprises the safe body. A smaller gauge number means thicker steel, which provides more security than thinner steel.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever. This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables. Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on many Browning safes.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

I built this AR as a precision rifle.  We are looking at buying a house, so I need cash.  I will have to build another, probably very close to this, once things settle down.

The best I have gotten out of it so far is about 1.1 MOA, shooting Federal GMM 69gr.  I am confident the problem was me, not the rifle, but I cannot promise anything.  I have shot about 200 rounds through it, starting with the shoot one, clean for 10 rounds, then shoot 10 clean for the first hundred.  The rifle has been through a couple different configurations, which is one reason I never got to fully wring it out.

The rifle is wearing a black Stark grip.  I also have a Stark SE-2 with the sling attachment point in Flat Dark Earth, and a black Hogue grip with finger grooves.  Should the buyer wish, either of those could be swapped for the existing grip.

If the buyer can legally own 20 or 30 round magazines, I will include a magazine of their choice, either 30 round aluminum, or 20 or 30 round translucent smoke Lancer L5, with the rifle.  Additional magazines are negotiable for the buyer of the rifle, but the magazines are not for sale separately.

I have over $1500 in the rifle, plus all the associated shipping charges over the several years it took to build it.  I am asking $1300, to include shipping in the hard case seen in the pictures to any legal area in the CONUS.  If you are local to the Huntsville, AL area you can pick it up in person for $1250.  USPS money orders only, or cash in person.

Note that this will be posted in multiple places, so do NOT IM!  Email only please!  Inquiries will be responded to in the order they are received.  At this time I prefer to keep the rifle intact.  Should a buyer wish to purchase the rifle without some parts or accessories, and I agree to do so, at that time I may make the other parts available.  Only if there is no interest in the complete rifle will I consider parting it out, so please refrain from claiming parts until and unless I post that they are available.

The well designed layout of the interior of the safes allows users to easily organize firearms and other items that need safe keeping. The top half of the safe door features the DPX storage system that boasts a variety of pockets and pouches for more storage. The DPX Storage System features a gun rack on the safe door for more storage and easier access to your most used firearms.

Sporter safes are packed with the type of real security and fire protection features you demand to ensure your valuables stay yours.

58x30x20
Cubic Feet: 20
Weight: 490 lbs.
Locking Bolts: 8/5 Active
Gun Capacity: 8/16+7 DPX

BODY THICKNESS: 12 GAUGE STEEL
The thickness of the steel that comprises the safe body. A smaller gauge number means thicker steel, which provides more security than thinner steel.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever. This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables. Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on many Browning safes.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

Proven gun safe security and added convenience are yours with a Sporter safe. These value packed models offer high-security features at a price that will leave you giddy. A heavy 12-gauge steel body, a rigid 1-inch thick formed door with a rugged Force Deflector Lock System and an honest 1200 F/45 Minute Fire Rating to put your mind and wallet at ease. Our Duo-Plus interior package, combined with the DPX door panel provides a wide range of storage options.
The well designed layout of the interior of the safes allows users to easily organize firearms and other items that need safe keeping. The top half of the safe door features the DPX storage system that boasts a variety of pockets and pouches for more storage. The DPX Storage System features a gun rack on the safe door for more storage and easier access to your most used firearms. Don’t settle for a mere gun cabinet or locker to protect your valuables when you can get a level of protection the Browning Sporter Series offers. Sporter safes are packed with the type of real security and fire protection features you demand to ensure your valuables stay yours.

KEY FEATURES:
1200F/45 Min. Fire Protection
Thick 1-inch formed door with three-sided locking bolts
DPX Storage System on top half of door back

ANTI-PRY FEATURES:
12 Gauge Steel Body

Tight Tolerance Door Fit
1-Inch Formed Door

FIRE PROTECTION:
1200F/45 Min. Fire Protection
Two Layers of .5-inch Fire Resistant Insulation in the Body and Door
Palusol Expanding Fire Seal

SPORTER 20 DIMENSIONS:
58x30x20
Cubic Feet: 20
Weight: 490 lbs.
Locking Bolts: 8/5 Active
Gun Capacity: 8/16+7 DPX

BODY THICKNESS: 12 GAUGE STEEL
The thickness of the steel that comprises the safe body. A smaller gauge number means thicker steel, which provides more security than thinner steel.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX STORAGE SYSTEM:
The patented Duo-Plus Extra Storage System is the most versatile Browning ProSteel safe interior ever. This system maximizes gun storage space by including a modular system of door mounted racks for long guns as well as pouches and pockets for pistols and other valuables. Whereas many competitors offer these features as upgrades, the DPX storage system is a standard option on many Browning safes.

http://youtu.be/iyX67e22WW4

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL DIAL LOCK STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.
