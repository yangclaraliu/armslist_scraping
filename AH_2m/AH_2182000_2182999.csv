The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

    Bull pup configuration.
    Optimized ergonomic design.
    30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
    Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
    Detachable barrel.
    Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
    Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
    100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
    Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
    Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
    Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
    Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
    100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
    Equipped with a  last round stopper.
    All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
    Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

Overall in good shape with some nicks in the stock and a little blueing wear in a few places on the barrel but nothing serious. Scope has a few scratches also. Recently noticed that the rear site has been glued.

May entertain trades that do not require cash on my end. I'm not looking for anything in particular but I lean towards semi autos. 9mm stock Glocks, ARs, maybe an 870,  just ask. Might consider higher end metal detectors or 2xx amp mig welder. Thanks."

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).

    Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
    Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
    Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
    Very easy field striping into 2 parts.

I had them on my little Kimber Ultra before I sold it.  The buyer didn't understand the utility of laser grips on those little guns!  

I can't overstate the value of being able to put the red dot where you want it without raising your arm or taking eyes off the target.  At 5 to 20 yards, you know the problem is not with the little gun; They're consistent and put the bullet where they are aimed. Having the red dot (except on a bright sunny day, of course) helps the user tremendously.

I've kept these grips, thinking I'll get another ultra, compact or officer's model .45, but now it looks like that is not in the cards.  

These grips are about 18 months old;  I had them on my gun for about 6 months.  Everything that came with the grips when new is still in the box.  I will include the original batteries  --  which still seem to be great to me  --  and a brand new set for your future use.  The batteries last for years in the grips, and the new set have a suggested 'use by' date of 2017.

I've had other laser grips that look like Crimson Trace, and they may even say ""laser grips"" on the bottom like some models of Crimson Trace.  In a side by side comparison, it's clear that the knock offs are not as bright or focused.  You will never be sorry you paid for the quality of the best name brand. 

If you see this listing, the grips are available; I'll deactivate this when they're gone."

I shot it last week and had forgotten how light the recoil is!
This is not in perfect shape, so it's not priced like it. There's no choke, as the original PolyChoke came off several years ago. There's a couple small rust spots on the barrel but they're not spreading and you could re-blue the barrelif they bother you. The bluing on the receiver is still very good. The forearm has a hairline crack on it which is not spreading/changing, which is apparently very common on the old A5s.

This gun also has a unique safety which is located in front of the gold trigger. Browning switched to a different safety a few years later, adding to the uniqueness of this firearm. There's a switch on the side of the receiver that allows you to block the magazine from feeding so you can quickly load a different type of round.
This gun would be great for self-defense or you could add a choke for hunting/clays.

Cash only, face-to-face. Can meet in Appleton or Green Bay. I'm looking at getting a Mosin Nagant or 22 handgun and would consider trade + cash."

 Condition: like New in box

 Model: PF9 Black/Blued 

 Caliber/Gauge: 9mm

 Approx. Barrel Length: 3.1""

 Description: like The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

 The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

This PF9 has 3 mags 1 with the finger extension.  Many of the surfaces have been stoned and polished so it is much smoother than a factory PF9.  Got this gun for my wife and she decided she liked her Glock better.  My loss is your gain.  $280 Firm

Puppies will be ready to go home around Thanksgiving. A $200 deposit is required to hold your pick, with the balance due upon pick up/ delivery.

RH-Right Handed configuration

Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.

Trijicon 1x38 Sealed Reflex Sight (SRS) is a potent red dot sight by Trijicon that will redefine the way you think about reflex sights. Featuring image open field geometry and a distinctive body design, these Trijicon red dot sights provide an extremely wide field of view with no ""tube effect"", thanks to their shorter case length and 28mm aperture. Built for close-quarters tactical maneuvers, the Reflex Sight has only a 1x magnification and a 1.75 MOA LED red dot for precise shooting without any target cover, and its rounded, low profile body won't snag or limit the mounting space on your rifle. The Trijicon SRS Red Dot Sight has ten different brightness settings for its LED illuminated reticle which can operate for at least three years (even on the highest setting) using the reflex sight's dual power sources. A powerful solar cell acts as a primary power source for the Trijicon SRS Red Dot Reflex Gun Sight, but as the day gets darker, the AA battery picks up the slack for nighttime operations. For supreme optical clarity, Trijicon has equipped the SRS with a multi-layer broadband anti-reflective coating, and the 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum housing is incredibly durable and waterproof to 165 feet. A distinctive, dependable, and durable red dot sight for any tactical operation, choose the Trijicon SRS 1.75 MOA Tactical Reflex Sight.

Ours features a deluxe checkered American walnut stock, a grooved receiver for easy scope mounting and a 19¼"" barrel that will deliver the accuracy you need.
Shooting the Lever Action Magnum

The tubular magazine holds 11 rounds. It weighs 5½ pounds and overall length is 37½"". With regards to ballistics, in general the .22 Magnum projectile travels nearly twice as fast as the .22 LR, and produces more than triple the muzzle energy. Various types of .22 magnum cartridges are available from all the major ammo makers.

Clair Rees, who authored a Rimfire Column article in GUNS Magazine, had this to say about our rifle, “I've done enough shooting with Henry's .22 Magnum to know it operates smoothly and reliably. Accuracy is good, too. At 50 yards, it produced 5-rounds averaging an even inch center-to-center with Winchester Supreme jacketed hollowpoints. This great looking .22WMR lever carbine delivers. This is a good buy.”

HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models. Variant 1 is a double action/single action with \""\""SAFE\""\"" position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.\"

 In both the AL1 & the AL2 the 20 gauge was produced in far lower numbers than the 12 gauge.  The AL1 has machine engraving, the AL2 is hand engraved,with the gold plated trigger.

I got this beauty in a trade.  I am more of a handgun guy, so this Beretta is looking for a new home.  The weapon can be picked up in Dublin, Ohio or mailed to your FFL at your expense.

 (To estimate out the door pricing multiply the cost of the item by 10% and add $10. This will allow you to estimate the cost including tax and tics. For example an item which costs $100 in Tennessee will cost about $110 when tax is added. The State of Tennessee charges each time the TBI is used to run a background check. The background check is mandatory in Tennessee to purchase a firearm from a dealer. So a firearm which costs $100 will cost approximately $120 with tax and tics.)

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

Choate tactical stock, adjustable bipod  stud, kydex comb adjustments
18"" AAC 1:8 twist .308 Winchester barrel, 5/8-24 threaded barrel
Larue Tactical 0 MOA picatinny optical rail

This gun is awesome, it was built on a long action with faster barrel twist to accommodate larger and longer subsonic ammunition and suppressor capability while still shooting all standard loads as well. 

I have at least $1400 in this build but as a lefty I'm never going to be happy until I start over with a left handed rifle. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Price is $1000 obo. 
Sale FTF, not really interested in trades but I'll consider them, worst I can say is no.

Savage 19233 Axis XP Bolt 270 Winchester 22"" 3+1 Syn Stk Black w/3-9x40 Scope

Axis rifles save money without sacrificing performance. Savage didn't
design a cheaper rifle; they designed a better way to make a Savage,
including pillar-bedded barrels with more uniform cooling and greater
consistency. These Axis rifles feature a modern design with silky-smooth
bolt operation and a detachable box magazine. Drilled and tapped for scope
mounts, these XP models come with a 3-9x40 matte blued scope, already
mounted and bore-sighted, so it is ready to go on the hunt when you are.
They also have a black synthetic stock coupled with a 22"" matte black
carbon steel barrel to allow for multi-purpose shooting in multiple locales.

Great Gun For Amateur Collectors 

On butt of gun has inscription of H.P.D.  no 901  

This is a used condition revolver....it still shoots great.  Still fully functional self defense weapon for male or female. 

I've shot it and cleaned it after wards, then it just got put up for 10 years, so I figured I'd see if anyone else would have more use for it.  I do not have a box for it or any papers as I inherited it.  Just a leather holster that came with it.

It has wear on the grips, the left is better than the right one and holster wear.  The bluing is discolored.  Best to look at pics and see gun first hand.  Overall its in good shape for a gun from 1944. That's based on the serial number I looked up on Colts website and an independent website.

I've been watching them on gunbroker the past few months and they are listed anywhere from $425 for much worse condition up to $800 in better condition.  So I figured I'd split it down the middle and ask $650 obo cash or open to trade offers for something I can use for home defense or fun with the kids.  Make me reasonable offer, worst I can say is no thank you.  I'm open, but don't need the cash.

Email me your number and I can text you more pics

Must be legal and show ID. I'm a private seller. CWP preferred.

FTF in Clermont area only. Must pick up near me, I can't drive to meet outside of Clermont due to family health issues, sorry.

Trade options at bottom of ad.


Thanx for looking......... 

I prefer to sell but if you have something that is a deal, I might consider it. 

Great condition guns only.  If your offering trade, you need to send me offer price and model and condition of your gun.  GUNS only!!  

I am not into inflated trade value prices.  I would use gunbroker or walmart pricing to value your trade.  I can just sell it and go there to buy cash but I like trading with reasonable people.

Main trade I'm looking for is an AR, nothing high end.  $500-1100 range.  Prefer factory built upper and lower from same company.  I have lots of different ammo I can add to trade and a little cash or can accept your trade plus cash.

others
Prefer Gen 3 or Gen 4 Glocks $400-$550 range plus cash
Maybe a Judge or a Govenor. 
Possibly an M&P AR 22 or HK 416.
Sig P238 or P938
1911's
Higher end Tactical Shotgun plus cash
Possibly other tactical weapons plus or minus cash. No old beat up guns please.
Home defense Gun's .38, .380, 9mm, 40 or 45 cal 

For all trades other than AR 15 or AR 10, I will only add ammo to trades.......

But throw anything my way, I'm interested in anything that is in great to new condition that functions perfectly.  

Thank you for reading this ............"

I will post pictures soon. I have a 1939 Carcano rifle, and it is chambered for the semi-rare 7.35 round. I have never fired the rifle, but know some of its history. It was returned to my grandfather after WWII by his brother, who was an MP. The rifle has some very unique stamping on it.

It was manufactured in Terni, Italy.
It has the roman numeral count to mark its production during that year of Mussolini's reign.
It has ""SA"" marked on it, which means that it was given to the Royal Finnish army to defend from invading Russians.
It also has the original sling.

I do not have a stripper clip for it, and cosmetically it looks great aside from a small wooden chip in the top of the rifle."

*Stopping Power for Close Combat.
The FN P90® submachine gun and the SS190 ball ammunition team up to defeat the enemy in all close combat situations.
*High Accuracy
The high velocity of the 5.7x28mm ammunition guarantees a virtually flat trajectory up to 200m for outstanding accuracy. *Fully Reliable
The simple design of the mechanism, the unique feed mechanism and the materials used to manufacture the FN P90® make it highly reliable, whatever the conditions.
*Rapid Deployment
The FN P90® is carried ready to fire. There is no need to extend any folding buttstock. Despite its shortness, the FN P90® is designed to be fired from the shoulder, giving maximum stability.
*Quick Aiming
The FN P90® Standard is fitted with an integrated optical sight without magnification. The user can therefore shoot with both eyes open. Performance is fully retained in low light conditions thanks to a tritium capsule.
*Easy to Carry
The compactness of the FN P90® allows easy movement in confined areas. The magazine is fully integrated in the upper part of the FN P90® for optimized ergonomics.
*Fully Ambidextrous
The cocking handle and magazine catch can be operated from both sides of the FN P90®. The fire selector is under the trigger and can be operated in either hand. Empty cartridge cases are ejected downwards. The FN P90® can therefore be handled by right- and left-handed operators without any modification.
*High Magazine Capacity
Since the 5.7x28mm rounds are light and small, the magazine fitted above the barrel can accept up to 50 cartridges.

I know exactly what I'm looking for, I just need a FAIR price.
Acceptable Brands: 

- Older model Bushmasters with either a flat top or detachable carry handle (XM-15 A-3 or A-4), M-4 profile barrel. , NO NEWER BUSHMASTERS PLEASE. unless it's a Carbon-15 flat top

- Bushmaster Carbon-15's

- Colt LE or SP models with either flat top or detach carry handle, M-4 profile barrel

- WHINDHAM M-4 flat top 

- STAG ARMS MODEL 1 or 2

- Sig M400 or M400 Enhanced,

- CMMG carbines, Daniel Defense carbines, Mossberg, S&W or other reputable brands that I don't know of or can't think of at the moment.

I DO NOT want DPMS, ATI OMNI, or any other lower end models. I want to get this right the first time as I don't have the money or patience for major repairs.
Would like 5.56/.223 or 7.62x39
I'm also open to newer, more modern AK-47's but must have quad-rail fore grip and weaver/piccatinny flat top rail for mounting optics. No wood stocks.

I am open to NEW OR USED offers, but rifle must be Mil-Spec from muzzle to butt stock, be in excellent running condition,( I'm not overly concerned with minor exterior scratches or damage ), have either a 1:7 or 1:9 twist, chrome lined barrel and preferably M-4 feed ramps. Gas piston or direct impingement; either is fine.
No polymer lowers.
I cannot afford any type of free floating barrel system.
I'm sorry but I warned you I am picky, This will be my first AR-15 but I've done some homework and I know what I want.
Thanks for looking

This is the same type of riot shield used by many police departments as part of their anti-riot gear. Made by a GSA Compliant manufacturer, the only difference between this shield and the shield our manufacturer sells to police departments is the lack of a blue/silver ""POLICE"" banner on the front.

This riot shield is constructed from tough polycarbonate and is designed to deflect many common melee and projectile based attacks, including batons, rocks, fists, kicks, clubs, bottles, acid and more.

At 40 in. tall and 20 in. wide, this shield offers full torso protection. The back features a solid cast aluminum handle and arm strap. Designed to be held for extended periods, this shield weighs 6 lbs.

I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.
