Very nice gun.  If you know about these A5 Brownings, you know they are amazing.  The forearm is cracked and was nicely epoxied by previous owner. Pic shows the hairline crack. Instead of replacing with aftermarket, I wanted to keep everything original.  I picked this up at an estate sale and put it away. I'm just trying to get out of it what I paid.   $1100 cash serious buyer only inquire or possible trade for another firearm. Tell me what you have.  

I never cleaned this up so you know I'm not withholding anything.  Cleaned up I've seen these go for $1600.  If I can't get it sold for $1200, then ill take down to gun shop and get cleaned up, order an original forearm and reprice it.   So you get the discount!

I've put roughly 1000 rounds through my rifle with extensive cleaning after every range trip. The package will include the following:

Stag Arms Model 3 Flattop 1/7 twist
11 30rnd Black windowless P-mags
1 60rnd Surefire mag
1 30rnd Metal mag
1 42rnd Metal mag
Vortex Strikefire Optic w/1x magnifier(http://www.vortexoptics.com/category/red_dots)
890 rounds of 5.56 (Most of the p-mags are loaded with green tip XM855 with the last few rounds being tracers, the surefire is loaded with green tip xm855 with tracers as well)
Magpul flip-up sights
Magpul pistol grip w/storage
Front foregrip with battery storage and the side panels come off for a pressure switch for a light
Extended charging handle

Now what I'm looking for in trade:

I want an AK-47. Mag for Mag, round for round. I'm looking for a Bulgarian imported by Arsenal but I might entertain others. Wood furniture is preferred but I'm flexible.

Trade Value for my package $1600 (Cost me almost $2000(pre-panic prices) for everything)
I also have the original grip, the different backs for the magpul grip, the original charging handle. Original case.

I might entertain other trades. But an AK is what I'm really looking for, what you can't make up in ammo or mags I will take cash instead. Keep in mind the value of the AR is $890 brand new. I may entertain multiple firearm trades as well. If you've got a H&K USPc in 9mm and an AK-47 we can definitely make a deal. Below is the price breakdown.



-Stag Arms Model 3 - MSRP $890, Lowest price online I could find was $781 before shipping and transfer costs. So I’ll put the value at $750, which is definitely less than what I paid for it.
-11 P-mags - I’ve seen the price on these drop back down to as low as $12 without a dust cover. Most of my mags have the dust cover so I’ll put the value at $13 a piece for $143 total
-The two metal mags I’ll put them at $5 a piece so $10 total.
-The Vortex sight retails for just below $200 online I paid $180 for it not even two weeks ago.
-The ammo is around 350 rounds of steel core Federal 5.56 the rest is mostly on the higher end of FMJ with a small amount of cheaper surplus. Even though some ammo is almost a dollar a round that price is way too high in my opinion so mine with the higher end ammo in it. I think .59 a round is more appropriate. So for 890 rounds the price rounds out to $529. So I’ll just put that at $400.
-The Surefire 60 round magazine(which has functioned flawlessly) originally ran for around $50 or so before the panic so I’ll just keep it at that.
-The magpul sights cost me around $60 for the pair, so we’ll just say $50 for those.
-The magpul pistol grip I believe cost me around $35, it stores three rounds and has three different back straps. So I’ll just say $20 for it.
-Front foregrip is worth around $20.
-Extended charging handle is $10.

So after all the used prices are put together it comes too $1633. Some of the mags, ammo, and parts I bought while prices were inflated so I spent closer to $2000 for all of it. But in the price breakdown I didn't list the prices I actually paid for some of the stuff(Like a dollar a round ammo or $30 P-mags) So the trade value is less than what you would of spent to buy everything brand new without inflated prices."

To replicate this would take $1500 (new glock - $550-575, RMR - $530, night sights -$145, work by ATEi - $300ish) and thats not even including taxes, shipping etc. Custom kydex holster from multi-holster.com included so its ready for carry.

Will keep RMR if you happen to already have one and would like to put your own on the 22 for $500 off price."

Here is Arsenals description of this rifle.


Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit. 

FEATURES 
•100% new-production parts and components. 
•Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger
•Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology

•Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.
•Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.)

It can easily fit into places that are not normally concealment locations. Due to the slim lines, there are no revealing bumps, which makes concealed carry easier than ever before regardless of your needs.
This gun is striker-fired DA/SA trigger with the shortest reset I’ve ever felt on a factory built pistol. With a 7+1 shot capacity (9+1 with an extended magazine), this slick little “slim-line nine” will handle just about any situation a lone individual might face.
This pistol weighs just 19 ounces, and measures a mere 6.24″ long and less than 1″ thick. The trigger guard is big enough to engage the trigger even when wearing gloves. A lever in the face of the trigger prevents rearward travel unless it’s squarely engaged, so inadvertent compression of the trigger is reduced, a nice touch when carrying the gun in deep concealment. Also included on the 709 is a visual loaded chamber indicator as well as the Taurus Security System, which allows users to securely lock the gun using an inconspicuous keylock.
It has low-profile three-dot sights that are a nice compromise between having enough of a sight picture to see quickly and keeping them small enough that they don’t snag when worn concealed or hang up on the draw. This is a great shooting gun and very accurate.
If you are interested in the handgun  and want more information please call;

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models.

About the RTF2:
The last of the 3rd generation GLOCKS, that could be considered a 3.5 generation pistol, were the RTF2s, the first of which, the model 22 was released in November of 2009. The RTF2s have a modified grip texture that uses lots of little raised dots set in a grid pattern. It is called the Ruff Texture Frame 2, being that it is the second version of GLOCKS ruff textured grips. The only other change made were the slide serrations being changed from the normal straight design to a curved gill serration. The gill serrations were produced on the slides of .40S&W (22 announced January of 2009 & 23 announced November of 2009) and 9mm (17 announced May of 2009 & 19 announced November of 2009), although, later productions of GLOCK 17, 19, 22 & 23 are produced with normal straight slide serrations."

Rare,  AR 15 by  Lewis Machine Tool 

Eagle Arms ""Action Master"" .223/5.56 rifle produced in 1993, Retail then 1993 was $1075.

Factory original , Unaltered rifle...20” Douglas stainless steel 1:9” twist match bbl float tube, flat top upper receiver and Natl match trigger.

Eagle Arms, back then was basically the retail outlet for Lewis Machine & Tool's AR's, which are widely regarded as some of the best.
Here is a short article about Eagle Arms:
Karl Lewis and Jim Glazier formed a company named Eagle Arms in Coal Valley Illinois
in 1986. Lewis had manufactured a wide variety of both commercial and military parts for M16 rifles, and Eagle
Arms assumed the increasingly distracting retail business from Lewis’ company, Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT).
Eagle Arms initially marketed M16 and AR15 type rifle parts. The early Stoner patents had expired, and Eagle was able to build both parts and complete rifles. In 1989 Eagle commenced production of complete rifles, with LMT serving as the major supplier.
In January 1994 Mr. Mark Westrom purchased the company.
After the purchase, he continued producing Eagle Arms EA15 rifles with a focus on high grade target rifles. The bulk of the engineering work was contracted out to Lewis Macine Tool.
In early 1995 Westrom purchased those rights, and production of ArmaLite rifles resumed in Illinois. The corporation was reorganized as ArmaLite, with Eagle Arms
converted to a division of ArmaLite. First shipments of new ArmaLite rifles began in 1995.

I contacted Armalite and furnished serial number and photos of this rifle....
**** Here is the reply from them...""Your rifle is an Action Master rifle produced in 1993, 20” Douglas stainless steel 1:9” twist match bbl float tube, flat top upper receiver and Natl match trigger.

So this is basically a 'Pre-ban' rifle that was made by LMT (Lewis Machine Tool)....If you do not know who they are....search online and you will find the quality and prices of their guns.

I got this from the original owner ...he bought it new and it has ~500 rounds thru it.

See the reviews on this same ""Action Master"" series of rifles in the 1992 American Rifleman Magazine Photos..... I have the magazine and can send pics..

I am retired and my hobby is collecting and trading guns; as such, I would prefer to trade this rather than sell it.

This is not some mix and match AR that someone tossed together!! Do searches and see what others say online about the quality of LMT and specifically this Action Master from Eagle Arms!!
Best CASH OFFER 
These are nearly IMPOSSIBLE  to find and in my opinion will only increase in value in the coming years.

THE ONE RIFLE TO HAVE IF YOU COULD ONLY HAVE ONE...
""Beware the man with one gun, for he probably knows how to use it.""
Never has this been more true than with the Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle, the ONE rifle to have- if you could only have one. It is the perfect lightweight, hard-hitting, great handling do-it-all bolt-action rifle. High capacity and optic ready! 
The Ruger Gunsite Scout Rifle has a 16.5"" medium contour, cold hammer-forged, alloy steel barrel with a Mini-14® protected non-glare post front sight and receiver mounted, adjustable ghost ring rear sight for out-of-the-box usability. A forward mounted Picatinny rail offers options in mounting an assortment of optics - including Scout Scopes available from Burris® and Leupold®, for ""both eyes open"" sighting and super-fast target acquisition.

A Mini-14/SR-556® flash suppressor is effective on reducing the muzzle flash that may be present on some .308 Winchester loads when fired out of the short (16.5"") barrel. The 5/8-24 muzzle threads allow most standard .30 caliber muzzle accessories - flash suppressors, muzzle brakes, and sound suppressors - to be installed."

It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

Do not miss out on this beauty, As for the AK's im not going to listen to 700 century guns, I can get a brand new PAP m70 yugo from JG sales right now for $520 shipped and they far surpass the quality of a century gun. so be realistic with trade value's.

SO, marriage....sometimes it's awesome and beautiful, sometimes it kinda sucks. This is one of those times when it sucks.

So i get this thing, this glorious article of badassness, take it home, show it off to the wife...and that's all she wrote. Apparently, it's ""too dangerous to keep"". You know, dangerous, like a Browning Hi- Power or a Saiga 12. But I digress.

Now, I'm pretty much being forced to sell the thing. I am open to trades and trades + cash as well. I've been interested in rifles chambered in 5.45x39 and 7.62x54 lately, and I'd definitely consider any offers made. Email me for more details. One important detail I want to point out is that while these are available in states other than California, there are only FOUR of these bad boys in this hilariously restrictive state. ONLY FOUR were ever imported into California, so if you're a collector, be advised. The weapon is very lightly used, 200-300 rounds have been fired through it. It has a custom bullet button made specifically for it and a muzzle break to push it into CA legality. It comes with its original case and 3 ten round mags. Lets PPT at Turners in Kearny Mesa, and never speak of this again - it just hurts too much."

The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever your tactical needs may be. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own."
