No way it was done here in the states based on the hand-guard having Copper + Large Aluminum Rivets when it was cut down to fit the shortened stock.

It was chopped down by the soldier or armor, the hand-guard has been shortened and has copper + Brass riveting and the stock length is roughly 1.25"" shorter than it should be.  Looks like some was shaved off the butt end too, the metal plate hangs over the end and appears roughly 0.5"" shorter than my m91's.

Dual Serial Civil Guard Designation m24, this is a MUST HAVE for any Finnish Mosin collector, and as you can see they do not go on sale very often.  Open to real offers.

Spike's Tactical Fake Can/Suppressor

The Spike’s Tactical CAR-1 Fake Can gives you the looks of having a 10.5” suppressed rifle but doesn’t come with all of the expense and paperwork that’s required for the real thing. This is how it works; The CAR-1 shrouds back over the barrel of your rifle concealing part of it inside of the CAR-1. This is what gives the illusion of a suppressed SBR and of course, no stamp is required. Keep in mind, this fake can is just for cosmetic looks and does not provide any sound suppression whatsoever. The CAR-1 should only be used with barrels with Carbine length gas systems. 

Spike's Tactical fake cans are made out of solid 6061 Aluminum bar stock for strength and topped off with a durable Anodized finish. The length of the can is 5.5” and has a diameter of 1.25”"

HK P30 V2 9mm Pistol . The P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation-one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. •Caliber: 9mm •Weight: 1.63 lbs. •Safety: Ambidextrous safety lever •Sights: Fixed 3 point •Magazines Included: 2 •Magazine Capacity: 15+1 •Grips: Black polymer, interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates •Slide Finish: nitro-carburized steel •Frame Finish: Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer

Here's a fun pistol to own: The Springfield Armory XD45 Tactical, striker-fired semi-auto with a 5"" barrel, comes with two 13rd magazines, factory box and all paperwork including the fired case with a ""born-on"" date of 01-06-2011.  I haven't owned it long, but I determined that I've got other firearm itches that need to be scratched, so I'm putting it up now before I get too attached and do something crazy like order a 460 Rowland conversion for it!

I've personally put 50 rounds through it, but I'm not the original owner.  The pistol shows some typical wear on barrel hood that's consistent with an XD that's had a number of rounds through it, but it's in solid mechanical shape.  It does have some bright spots showing at the upper right corner of the slide, but the metal is still protected by the factory melonite finish.

Check out the photo I posted of the first 13 rounds I fired from this pistol!  Yes, the first *13* I fired from this pistol all went into that ~1"" hole.  It measures 1.1"", center to center, actually.  That was fired from 7 yards, standing offhand using PMC Bronze 230gr ammo.  I know, I know - the group isn't that impressive, but for me it shows this pistol can shoot, even with a hack such as myself behind the trigger!  Speaking of the trigger; it breaks right at 6lbs as measured by my Lyman digital trigger gauge.  It's a smooth break with no stacking or other unpleasantness.  If I didn't tell you I'm sure you'd think it was a lighter trigger.  However, it is a factory trigger so don't think any miracles are happening here. ;)

I'm asking $450.  I'm in absolutely no rush to sell, so please don't bother with lowball offers.  I may be interested in a trade, but no shotguns, please!  Let me know what you have; the worst I can say is no thank you.  Please be ready to send non-blurry, reasonably sized photos of your trade.  I need to be able to see what you're offering.  A non-inclusive list of firearms I'm interested in are:

- AK74's
- Beretta M9A1
- EAA Witness Match .45ACP
- CZ pistols
- IWI Jericho 941 9mm (my Unicorn gun!)

Of course, money can transfer either way to even up the trade.

*Local* FTF sale only (if you're in another city, you're traveling to me - I just had my time wasted by a tirekicking lowballer in Austin; thank him for my new policy).  Buyer must provide evidence of Texas residence via current driver's license or CHL (preferred).  Must be willing to sign bill of sale if no CHL is presented.  Must be legal to own and possess a firearm - if you can't buy from an FFL, don't bother to try to buy from me.  I prefer to do my transactions during daylight hours at the Academy parking lot located at either 1604/Potranco or 410/Military on the SW side of town.  Cash only - no checks or credit cards."

This is a BRAND NEW AR-15 package built on a Windham Weaponry rifle (the people who made the original Bushmaster rifle, before Bushmaster sold out, sacrificing quality for dollars).  This is more accurate out of the box than most AR's without any need of an accu-wedge or other device to tighten the tolerances.  It has a laser-etched American flag on the mag well, and a rail on the gas block and along the full length of the upper reciever.  It is aluminum, NOT one of the polymer models.

I've added a quad rail with laser markings on all rails (T, B, R, L), rail covers on the sides, flip-up back up iron sights (BUIS) front and rear, a brand new camo Sight Mark red dot reflex sight with lens cover, and a Sig Sauer vertical fore grip (VFG) with light and trigger on the foregrip to toggle in on/off (plus a “safety” so it won't turn on accidentally) and battery container in the handle.  

It comes with a sling and one factory 30-round magazine, M-16 bayonet with leather sheath (not pictured), original paperwork, transferable lifetime warranty, hard case, and a “Support Our Troops” ribbon magnet.  I'm also including 100 rounds of WPA .223 ammo to get you started, a used digital Camo single mag pouch with velcro flap (MOLLE compatible, or you can wear on your belt), a 15-40 spotting scope with tripod, and a .223 bore snake (brand new, just opened the package to check it out).  All told, this package has approximately $1300 in it.

If you prefer, I can substitute a UTG Leepers red/green dot scope with flip up covers for the Sight Mark reflex sight, or a new-in-package CT combination laser/light combo with pressure switches for the Sig VFG and light.  If you want these in addition to what's already on the rifle, I can include them for extra.

No offers, this is already several hundred dollars below what you'd pay for this package individually.  Plus you don't have to pay taxes, FFL fees, or file any paperwork.  I will not split this up - it all goes together.  Or if you don't want something, the price is still $975 and I'll take off or keep whatever you don't want.  I prefer you have a CCW, but if you don't have one you must be legal to own this rifle.  E-mails asking if this is still available or what my lowest price is will be summarily deleted without response.  Feel free to ask any other questions."

I did, and they refinished the slide...it's beautiful now and not a single speck of rust. Apparently they had some issues with how they'd treated metal on a bunch of guns. It's perfect now.

When they re-did the slide, they did not put the Trijicon night sights back in place. I have not gotten around to installing them, but I have them in a little baggy. Still very bright, with the bright orange circle on the front sight. $60 if interested.

I am going to include 2 mags in my price. These are the 12 round mags, better than the 10 rounders. And, I have the pinky grip piece on them, which I had to buy separately. S&W originals, they work flawlessly.

If you know guns, you know how much of a pain it can be to acquire mags. Sometimes they're damn near unobtainable,or just stupid expensive. So...the 3 extra mags I have will be $40 each if you want them.

Also, I'm a lefty, and I did the whole 2-3 month wait for a Crossbreed Supertuck holster. It was $80 or so, and it's amazing, worth every penny. Obviously, if you're reading this and you're a righty, it does you no good. Just offering it for $60 if interested.

So that's $700 for everything, or just $460 if you want the M&P 9c with 2 12 round mags. Your call, really not willing to wiggle on price.

Open to trades, NO JUNK, and nothing other than guns/ammo. Quality AKs, 1911s, compact Sigs or HKs, quality over/under shotguns, SxS shotguns, quality combo guns (something chambered in shotty shell + rifle), lever action in 357, etc. Open to anything except junk...for handguns, I prefer 9mm, 45ACP, 380Auto, no .40S&W since I've just never gotten into that caliber.

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim. The only change from factory is that i replaced the gray plastic mainspring housing with a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have the factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included.

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured.

Depending on the deal offered i have a Galco black OWB holster I can include.
