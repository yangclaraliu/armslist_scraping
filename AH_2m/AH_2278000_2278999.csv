Bullet Proof® Slide Stops are fully machined from solid bar stock with extra metal left in critical areas for added durability. But the real key to a Bullet Proof® Slide Stop is the material. After considerable research and field testing, we have found what we believe to be the finest slide stop steel possible which when properly heat treated produces a truly Bullet Proof® Slide Stop. As if this wasn't enough, Bullet Proof® Slide Stops have a built in detent, serrated top and maximum tolerance shaft.

Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. COMES WITH PELICAN CASE, 2 10RD MAGS, THE NON-ILLUMNAITED LEUPOLD MARK 4.5-14X50MM SCOPE WITH BARRETT BORS ON TOP AND ZERO GAP ULTRA HIGH RINGS.

It comes in it's original case with 2 15 rd Glock magazines, cleaning tool, paperwork, and (not pictured,) the red lock that comes with Glocks.

If you don't know anything about the Fail Zero finish, it was sent to Fail Zero from Glock, before it ever hit the sporting goods store. The finish creates a permanently lubricious surface, which they say eliminates the need for grease, oil, or any wet lubrication for the life of the firearm. I, however, still cleaned and lubed it after every use, like I would any other of my firearms simply out of habit.

This new 30-30 load was designed as the single 30-30 load for all big game hunting. The Barnes TSX opens fast enough to be brutal on deer sized critters, yet penetrates like TSX bullets normally do, so it gives ample penetration for larger species such as elk. While we feel the 30-30 is marginal for big bull elk, this is the load to use if you choose to pursue elk with a 30-30 and then use the same load to hunt deer, so you don’t have to readjust your sights for differing loads. This is the perfect load to hunt black bear of all sizes with as the bullet will expand fast enough to deliver terminal devastation on smallish bear, but will penetrate deeply enough for 500+ lb bear."

Adding to its superior functionality, the Night Raider boasts a stabilized power supply that resists recoil and ensures an uninterrupted power supply while shooting. Also included is a durable protective flip-up objective lens cover. The Night Raider 3x60 is a necessity for any hunting or shooting enthusiast’s arsenal."

The patented SPIRALCELL Technology in Optima RedTop batteries is truly worthy of praise. Optima RedTop batteries are built to withstand the abuse from Trucks, SUVs and 4WD experience on and off-road. SPIRALCELL Technology immobilizes the internal components of the battery, enabling Optima batteries to withstand incredible amounts of vibration. Vehicles modified for better engine performance demand more from a battery. Optima batteries withstand the high underhood temperatures associated with these Performance vehicles. This prevents external gassing and leaking which can damage engine components and limit battery performance. An Optima RedTop battery is the only battery specifically designed to take abuse. Its patented SPIRALCELL Technology offers 15 times the vibration resistance and up to twice the life of ordinary batteries. Plus it's spill-proof, highly resistant to heat and cold, and can be stored for long periods without maintenance. Optima batteries deliver a higher level of power to the starter in the critical first 10 seconds of the vehicle starting cycle. This decreased internal resistance, along with the completely sealed case, is the key to Optima's unparalleled high power delivery, increased cycle life and fast recharge capability for fast recovery in short driving cycles. Optima's unique SPIRALCELL design offers the greatest technology in providing a strong and clean power source that far surpasses any of today's filled lead/acid batteries."

Comes with box, couple pieces of factory paper, two factory hi-cap mags. Has factory Trijicon night sights that are still bright. This year, Hickory, NC PD changed issue guns and officers got to purchase them. This came from one of those officers through a shop in Hickory with whom I do a lot of business and am friends with the owner. He traded it in on something and I bought it right after that. It has sat in my safe ever since and I need to free up the cash I have in it. Has carry wear you would expect from a PD gun (took pics of the worst of it), but still looks good and likely was shot very little, as most PD guns are carried a lot and not shot much. Mechanically excellent with a great trigger. $450 firm face to face in Hickory, NC. Just looking to get back out of it what I have in it. Not terribly interested in trades unless heavily weighted in my favor."

I found this on a old Beretta pdf about this model.
Designed to satisfy the most demanding needs of the professional hunter, the new Beretta 686 Onyx Pro over-and-under boasts a long list of exclusive features, which give the shotgun its captivating look and makes it withstand the most adverse hunting conditions and the test of time. The receiver is machined with the Beretta distinctive Dura-Jewel pattern, which contrasts with the glossy side panels and other matte parts. The X-Tra Wood stock ensures, in addition to a stunning look, a high resistance to weather conditions and the super resistant finish of all metal parts guarantees a long life and protection against scratches. The newly designed checkering, executed by laser technology on the stock and wide beavertail forend, permits an excellent grip even during humid conditions. The Hunting Extended Mobilchoke tubes guarantee a perfect shot pattern. This shotgun features a 28"" vent rib barrel. LOP 14 3/4. Weight 7.28 lbs."

Daniel Defense M4 Free Float tubes were even chosen by the US Army Marksmanship Unit's Designated Marksman Rifle Program. 

These Daniel Defense mounts feature an innovative design that removes a portion of the front of the top rail, which allows you to aim with the front sight post, gives you more space along the side and bottom rails, and allows room for the gas block of your carbine length gas system. 

Manufactured from high-quality 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum, the Daniel Defense 9.5 FSP Free Float Rail System allows you to mount almost any weapon accessory using military standard 1913 Picatinny rails. Every M4 Rail also includes a set of three 6"" low-profile ladder rail covers. Aircraft Grade 6061-T6 Aluminum is used exclusively so that strength is not sacrificed for weight. The Daniel Defense M4 Free Float tube is among the lightest rail systems available today. 

Each tube is precision CNC machined and then Military Specification Type III Hard Coat Anodized. The free floating design of these mounts dissipates heat quickly and doesn't weigh down on the barrel, preserving your carbine's accuracy. And since Daniel Defense has designed the rail system to mount to the barrel nut or upper receiver, the system won't spin when it's weighted down with accessories. 

With a light weight, solid construction, and a natural feel in your hands, the Daniel Defense M4 9.5 FSP Picatinny Rail System can make the perfect fit for your AR-15 or M-4 carbine. 

• Length: 9.89""

• Inner Diameter: 1.45"" 
• Weight: 10.2 oz

• Locks to barrel nut to prevent unwanted rotation

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. Proudly made in the USA, all Heritage revolvers combine quality with affordability...an American tradition!

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

All that's left to do is to get the trigger moved forward.   This Saiga has been great- 200 rounds shot through it and it loves the buckshot and slugs.    However, for your low brass shooting, it has the original gunfixer hand adjustable gas plug.   In addition, it has an ACE folder with Tromix stock w/ limbsaver pad.   It has a quad rail front end, and as I'm getting rid of it all, I'm also including the foregrip/flashlight, red dot, two green lasers (originally offset to indicate the outside edges of a buckshot pattern at 50 yards), new much stiffer recoil spring, tromix muzzle device, a buffer in case you shoot 3"" bear slugs, and a SAW grip.   I am also including the original 5 round Saiga mag, two 10 round mags and two rare clear 12 round mags.

Thanks to my OCD, I also have every last original part, including the original gas plug recoil spring and thread protector.   I even have all the manuals and some of the receipts for the aftermarket parts.   

With all the parts and extras you get with this, $1500 (obo) is a steal-   However, I could sell just the gun and the specific parts for it for $1200 (obo) and not include the dual green lasers, the red dot and the foregrip/light combo.   



It's been a good gun, but I need the money more than I need another unfinished project in my safe.

I turned down $2250.00 cash when it was put in front of me, and would again, so don't waste your time or mine offering $2000.00. If you can buy it cheaper elsewhere you should. I don't have to sell, it just doesn't meet my needs any more. Get the best of the best in two categories bundled in one package deal. Deer hunt here, elk hunt out west. No cheap second rate gear here These two items at retail new price will total $4200.00+ including taxes, so save on this one. This is easily researched to verify, so no offers please. I think my price is a bargain, more than fair. The Steyr is Safe Bolt System Pro-Hunter, stainless barrel and action, camo synthetic adjustable stock, in 300 Win Mag. The Swarovski is 2.5-10 X 56, heavy duplex reticle, 30 mm tube, in steel dual-dovetail Leupold rings, no risk of loosening under magnum recoil. Don't be fooled by the imitators. If it doesn't say Steyr or Swarovski it is not the best. In low light at long range you will need these. Also included is a box of Federal Premium 180 Grain Nosler Partition Ammo. Last reduction on price. I will sell it for my price or keep it another year and sell it for more.

Rfle is approximately $1400.00 new retail

Any new 56mm Swarovski scope is at least $2400.00 new retail. I have all of the original box and paperwork for this scope, including the original lifetime warranty registration, never filled out. You can send it in as the original owner. If you hunt early morning or late afternoon, the pretenders don't compare to the 56 mm Austrian built optic.

LOCAL AREA FACE TO FACE CASH TRANSACTION ONLY, NO SHIPPING PERIOD.

I have had a number of trade offers, but everyone forgets that my combo is priced about 40% less than new retail with tax, and they want to trade based on new retail or more for theirs, so therefore, please don't send me trade offers.

    Easy-to-use 10/22®-style extended magazine release provides smooth, no-fuss magazine removal.
    Patent-pending Power Bedding® integral bedding block system positively locates the receiver and free-floats the barrel for outstanding accuracy.
    Ruger Marksman Adjustable™ trigger offers a crisp release with a pull weight that is user adjustable between 3 and 5 pounds.
    Ergonomic, lightweight black composite stock (designed for quick, easy handling) blends a classic look with modern forend contouring and grip serrations.
    Features a visible, accessible and easy-to-actuate tang safety.
    Satin blued, target-crowned, hammer-forged barrel results in ultra-precise rifling that provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning.
    A 3/8"" rimfire scope base is machined into the receiver, which is also drilled and tapped for Weaver® #12 bases (not included).
    A 60˚ bolt provides ample scope clearance, while an easy-to-use, receiver-mounted bolt release allows the bolt to be readily removed without requiring a pull of the trigger, a unique safety feature among rimfire, bolt-action rifles.
