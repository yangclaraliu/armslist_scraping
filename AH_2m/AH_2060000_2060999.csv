I picked up this AK new a few months ago. I really enjoy it, and its a very nice, Russian manufactured, fine shooting rifle. I have put less than 500 rounds though it. Standard fair for a converted Saiga. Tapco trigger, synthetic furniture, 2 metal magazines. I have 4 additional tapco 30 round mags I will include. Nothing too flashy, I like stock rifles, so I kept it how it came. Rivets are seated perfectly, Chrome lined barrel, no WASR mag wiggle, or used barrel from a parts kit. It's essentially the Ford Taurus of the AK world.    

The only reason I am putting it up here is that I would prefer a smaller caliber. 
I was hoping somebody with a 5.56 Saiga, or a 5.45 Saiga was in the same boat, and wanted a larger cartage. 

I will sell, but primarily interested in trading. Feel free to make an offer. The worst I can say is ""no"". 

Of course. I need to see your Florida ID to make any transfer."

3.3 XD-S™ SAFETY RECALL 
Issued August 28, 2013 

Technical Background          Get Started         Contact Us         Springfield-Armory.com 

Springfield Armory® is initiating this voluntary safety recall to upgrade 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols with new components, which eliminate the possibility of a potentially dangerous condition. We want to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date. 

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur.

What should you do?

STOP USING YOUR 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP PISTOL AND CAREFULLY UNLOAD IT!   

To begin the upgrade process and for fastest response, click on the Get Started link at the top of the page. On that page enter your serial number and click Next.  If your pistol is subject to this recall, you will need to provide your name, address, phone number, and email address.  The serial number is located on the frame beneath the dust cover (accessory rail).  If you prefer, you may initiate the upgrade process by calling REDACTED.  If you no longer own the 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol, please advise Springfield of the current owner.

XD-S Serial Number

What pistols are involved?

This Safety Recall applies only to:

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator's forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features
- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- ATF compliant*
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA
- Quick and easy to install

* ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control."

They are all steel.  The pockets will fit furring strips just right.  The finish is a baked on powder coat, so they will be virtually rust free.  When set up or deployed, the dimensions are just right to fit an IDPA or USPSA cardboard target.  When not in use, they fold down making a bunch of them easy to carry in a 5 gallon bucket, or in your range bag.  Once you're back home, they store easy enough.  I drilled holes in them, so you can stake them down.  The stakes are available at any Home Depot/Lowe's/Menards.

If I have to ship these, I'd really prefer to sell a set of 5 for $145 shipped , averages out to $29 each.  I can sell them individually like this:

1........$41 shipped. (yep, $41 for just one)
2........$76 shipped. (averages out to $38 ea)
3........$105 shipped (averages out to $35 ea)

I have used this bag for the past 3 years but it is still in great condition. I highly recommend it as a range bag for your rifle or a rifle ready bag. I have used it as a grab and go back, stuffing the mag pouches on the outside and adding some extra gun parts to it as well. If SHTF all I had to do was grab and go. 

The ONLY reason that I am getting rid of this excellent product is to get a bag that will carry two rifles.

The used parts are the barrel and the rail, everything else is new. 
The barrel is a Rainier Arms Select 16"" 5.56mm, this is a really good barrel and shoots, 5 groove polygonal rifling and 1 in 8 twist. This is not one of the new Medium Contour ones they sell now but the older heavier style. (I prefer it actually). 
Have shot out to 720m with this barrel and hit a man sized plate with 5 shots in a row. Runs Awesome! I have put less than 500 rounds through the barrel and it can't have had more than 1500 in it's whole life, so plenty of life left in her. 
The rail is a Troy TRX extreme 13 inch, love this rail super light and really tough, the moly-resin i did myself and is rock solid, the pattern itself works really great (I had the whole rifle done in it) I can turn it back to black if the purchaser likes. 
The Charging handle is one of the Brownells Para-Trooper Charging handles, works really good and is great to carry as it sits flat and does not poke you.

Runs really great have tested it and works with any ammo I through at it."

It has the inside front portion of the barrel (approximately 1 1/2"") threaded for a blank attachment (not included) which doesn't affect the firing of actual rounds.  It comes with a Thompson case custom cut for the rifle and two stick magazines, a WWII sling, a WWII 5-stick magazine pouch (marked 1942, but both the sling and mag pouch look too good to be actual World War 2 era so I suspect they're reproductions), 7 30-round stick magazines and a bolt-removal tool.  The case foam has a cut-out for a drum magazine which I don't have.  I can also include ammo for extra.

This gun was used in WWII reenactments so has some usage wear, but it's excellent condition without any gouges or finish marring.  There is about $1400 worth of stuff in this package and I've always wanted a gun like this, I'm only looking to sell or trade so I can upgrade my carry gun so don't bother low-balling me.

Comes with two 30-round magazines and a 5-round factory mag, and over 500 rounds of ammo in a new weatherproof ammo box (mix of brass and steel). Has a Weaver Marksman 4x scope on it with black rings (the scope has seen extensive use on several of my rifles so it's in the roughest shape, but the sights are clear and crisp). I'll throw in a second set of silver scope rings if you want to keep a second scope ready for a quick change-over. (I can mount a Simmons Blazer 3-9x40 instead of the Weaver, or include it with the package for an extra fee). Finally, I'm including a leather rifle bag that's quilted on the inside and fits the rifle perfectly without the scope mounted. 

I'm also including a Tapco Intrafuse tactical stock with both angled and straight 6-position extendable butt, and rails top and bottom to mount your favorite accessories. Pistol grip has a compartment for batteries, small tools, whatever. The SigSauer Mako light foregrip pictured is NOT included.

The rifle's been to the range a few times for breaking in, but it's in great condition and ready to visit the range with you, protect your home, farm, or business, or take down a deer for you.

The classic look of an M-14 with the firepower of an AK-47 and the reliability and accuracy of a new Ruger Ranch rifle, plus the ability to accessorize with AR goodies."

Detailed Product Overview: 

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Love the gun, but it is made for a smaller hand than mine.
Typical recoil for a super compact gun shooting a 380. No surprises there. Nevertheless this is an excellent choice for a carry gun.
I will throw in the leather pocket holster for the full price.
It also comes with a zippered De Santis case that holds the gun and two magazines. (not pictured). that case has a belt clip.
This gun will outlast you by several lifetimes. Well built. when you compare the heft of this gun with the pocket 380s that are out there it is a no brainer.

Only reason it is this price is that there is no .22LR cylinder, which normally comes with the gun.
I called Ruger. This is the straight story, which I did not get from the person who sold me the gun.  In order to get a .22LR cylinder, you have to send the gun to Ruger. They hand fit the new cylinder, charge you for the cylinder, labor and shipping. Cost? Approximately $150. Now you know what I didn't know.
If no one is interested in this gun I will hang onto it until I have the spare change to get the extra cylinder. So please no low ball offers.
In good shape, with both cylinders, this gun is easily worth the ~$470 cost of buying the gun and getting the other cylinder.
Thanks for looking. Cash and face to face. Must have PTP or PTC."

Up for sale is an excellent XD45 4"" model with 4 13rd mags all the accessories, case and an extra mag holder. No scratches at all just normal wear on the barrel and guide rod. Low round count but I don't know the exact #. Previous owners says he put 200rds through it. I have put less than 200 through it.

It shoots great and is way more accurate than I am. It has no issues and eats any ammo. A pleasure to shoot, I was surprised how light the recoil was for a polymer framed 45. It would make an excellent CCW even though its a full size gun. I would have no problem having my wife or daughters shoot it.

I am only selling because I want either a larger grip or a model with swappable back straps."

It is fire rated and waterproof though I don't believe any of them will last more than 30-45 minutes in a fire.  There are spaces for 22 long guns in the safe.  There are additional shelves (not pictured) that can be positioned in the right side for ammo, handguns, etc.  This of course would reduce your long gun storage capability.  It has rotary dial lock.  This is an EXTREMELY HEAVY safe.  Plan on bringing 2 or 3 strong guys with u to help load it.  I brought it home several years ago in a Ford Ranger that was extremely over the load capacity with the safe in the back. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN MOVED TO MY GARAGE...so no worries about moving it up or down stairs on this end.  Dimensions are 59 H X 27 W X 23 deep.   Not really looking to trade anything...this one cant make the trip when we move but might consider a nice Glock, Springfield XD or Sig.  Will consider cash offers....but this is not your bargain basement safe."

This is a rare serial number to have because it is one of the last M1s ever made at the end of WWII.  This is a fabulous rifle that gauges about a 2 on muzzle wear. The barrel has strong rifling and grooves and is shiny! That is just about a brand new wear rating on this rifle barrel. The stock on this rifle is a walnut stock with no dings and dents.  This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept an Arkansas concealed weapons license number which would eliminate DLN and date of birth.
