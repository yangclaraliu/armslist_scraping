The first link is to the website itself and the second link is to the only AX556 lower that I have seen on gunbroker so far. I am wanting to deal locally so that is why I am listing it on armslist but if I dont get the deal that I want I will list it on gunbroker. This is an almost complete lower for sale, minus the trigger because I was planning on getting a Geissele but ran out of money. If you look at my images of the lower you will see I have the custom full auto markings on the lower which will cost you an extra $50 from the factory. Go to the AXTS website and you will see how nice the lower really is and how much work they put into this. The reason the lower is fully ambidextrous is they incorporated a pin the when you press the magazine realease button it also pushes up on the bolt catch so you can lock the bolt to the rear. I have also put on the foliage green magpul UBR stock, a spikes tactical ST-T2 buffer with a red springco buffer spring. It also comes with a magpul MIAD in Foliage green and the Battle Arms Development ambidextrous safety selector. I got the 90 degree selector because it is just more comfortable to me. So the price I am looking at selling the lower for complete is $1000.00. Yes that is the price and I am will to negotiate a little but not much. Also if you want the lower stripped and have nothing but a basic lower parts kit installed, which means I will take off the UBR stock and the buffer and spring on keep the safety selector and miad grip and include a basic A2 grip then I will sell the lower for $600. Yes I know what the price is on their website but I also know that there is a wait and it doesnt come with some of the parts that will be included or the custom markings. Let me know what you guys think.

Comes with the range kit and some extras. I will say that the mag loader was stolen out of my range bag by my dog (see photo) but rest assured it still functions perfectly should you choose to use it. I am the only owner and have shot approximately 500 rounds through this weapon. It is awesome. I have all of the original paperwork and the test fire round as well as the form for the lifetime warranty. The range kit includes a mag loader, 2 mag holster, paddle holster, 3  16 rd mags, three back straps for varying grip sizes, and a gun lock, along with paperwork and associated literature.

The weapon is well maintained and has very little scuffing from holster draw. I have coated the slide, trigger group and barrel with a dry lubricant. As a result cleaning is a breeze. All that is needed is to blow through the barrel for light use, or run a bore swab through a few times if you feel you have soiled the barrel. Same goes for the surrounding areas of the gun. Then it is all shiny and new again.

I am also including two more holsters. One is a very comfortable Cross Breed IWB holster that wears like a dream. The other is a MIC holster (minimal inside carry) which is also damn cool.

Have seen other XDms on here for 525 and up. Figured I'd stick with the lower end of the range in hopes of selling quicker. Make me a reasonable offer and we can go from there. Wish I could upload more than three photos but if you need more feel free to ask in the email and I will send more.

The gun has the Todd Green trigger set up right now and will include the original heavy firing pin block spring and hammer spring. The gun comes with (4) 12 round magazines and one has the flush base plate attached (original pinky base plate will also come with it). The gun was custom stippled by Cold Bore Customs in Texas (Lane Owens) and has the carry texture on the front and rear back straps blended to the executive texture on the sides. The pics do not give the stippling justice, but it is by far one of the best jobs I have seen. The gun was stippled with the medium back strap, but also comes with another standard medium and large, both unstippled.

When I got her she had a pimped out slide/barrel with a high polish which wasn't my thing so I rattled canned and baked on a duracoat finish that turned out very nicely if I do say so myself. I did leave the barrel polished for just a little bling. 

She was at Glock a yr or so ago and they gave her a check, added Night Sights, extended slide release and mag release.

This is the harder to find 20"" barrel model. This is an early import from Kalashnikov-USA.  Not sure how many of these were imported but it is very nice. It has a tapco G2 double hook trigger with a very crisp break.  Unlike most Saigas this one has the entire front end converted the correct way.  Besdies putting the correct front handguards on it, it also has an original gas block and the retainer for the front handguard.  It also has a threaded front sight block installed with an original half moon 74 break. An original russian optic has also been installed.  It is a PKS-01.  This is battle grade red dot that also has a black etched reticle so even if the batteries die you still have a black circle and dot. It sits to the left of center on the rifle so iron sights are also usable. I don't think theres a better red dot on the market, it has an incredibly wide field of view.  What makes Saiga rifles so good is they are the only AK's that still have the original barrels on them. Very low round count at 200-300. Included is sling, five 30 rnd mags and a 75 rnd drum. This is not a cheap AK, alot of work and money was put into it to turn it back into the weapon it was designed to be.

Price is $1500 for everything, I would sell just the rifle and 2 mags for $1000.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine come with this one.

It's got finish wear from being carried - not a safe queen.  Excellent mechanical shape, recoil springs recently replaced (no reason other than I got a great deal on one from a friend who'd sold his sig before installing it).  I am not the original owner, I've put 500 or so rounds through it, but no idea of total round count.  Wanting to sell and move on to another project.  Don't want to drive to Seattle, local ccw holders only.

Cash price is firm and more than fair for what this gun runs new.  If the coating wear bothers you, cera/durakote it.  If it doesn't, enjoy shooting it as I've done.  The slide underneath is stainless, so it's not likely to rust.  Despite the coating wear the gun is in excellent mechanical condition, and has never failed to feed, eject, or fire while I've had it."

It currently sports a 7mm-08 bergara barrel that was cut to 16.25"" by David White (a very talented gunsmith). The gun also has fiber optic front sight, rear ghost sight, and pro hunter thumbhole stock and forend. It has a very smooth and short trigger pull. I will ship the frame in pistol form to an ffl and I will ship the rifle stock and forend to your door step. I can also email you the ATF letter that states that if the gun was purchased as a pistol, it can be configured as a pistol or a rifle and then back to a pistol as long as the barrel is not shorter than 16"" in rifle form. If you live near the center of Texas, a face to face sell with no ffl is fine. PM me for more info. Thanks.

From Beretta's Website:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A."
