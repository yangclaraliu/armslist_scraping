It is often designated the CZ 27 after the naming scheme used by the Česká zbrojovka factory for post-World War II commercial products. However, it is correctly known as vz. 27, an abbreviation of the Czech ""vzor 27"", or ""Model 27"".
After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 the pistol was folded into the German armed and police forces as the P27. Construction of the pistol continued in
Czechoslovakia until the 1950s. Allegedly, the Czech military sold five and a half thousand surplus vz. 27s to the Swiss in 1973 for half a million marks. Between 620,000 and 650,000 were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. In December of 1948, a gift of five ""ČZ 247"" automatic variants of the pistol (based on both the vz. 24 and vz. 27) was sent to Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie. In 1949, the vz. pistol was exported to 28 countries, including Turkey (3,286 pistols), England, South Africa, Egypt, Kenya, and Pakistan.

It has the ability to produce either 125 lumens for 60 minutes or 225 lumens for 20 minutes if you want to use the included high output bulb. It also has two white LED navigation lights which have their own pressure switch. The light can be turned on either by squeezing the pressure pads on the vertical grip or if you want it to be turned on permanently you can bypass the pressure pads and keep it on indefinitely. It runs on three SF123 lithium batteries which can hold their charge for as long as ten years. The light is in perfect condition and has never been used, it was only mounted on a weapon once and then placed in the safe. I will include 3 batteries with it so you can use it right away. These lights are sold for anywhere from $450 to over $500 retail, but I am offering it for $325. However its condition will be just as good as the one you get off the store shelf.

I prefer a cash transaction in the Phoenix area but will ship it to anywhere in the US if you pay the shipping. I will accept PayPal, money order or cashiers check. Please no trade offers.

We are now Offering custom frame work to the following
*polymer handguns
*magazines 
*knifes
*grips 
*rail covers
If its polymer we can add a custom texture to it!!!! 

The process is called STIPPLING. 
This process is done my melting small devotes, holes , lines etc.. In the polymer this caused the edges of the holes,lines devotes to be raised giving texture.

This is a permanent alternative to grip tape or the grips that slide over the handle. Grip tape eventually wears down and can be an hassle to remove and install new grip tape. It also isn't very eye appealing on some guns especially on FDE or OD green guns at least in our opinion.
Doing this stippling to your weapon will give you flawless manipulation with it. If you think you can manipulate your weapon just fine under any situation try putting a small amount of soap and water on you handgun then try racking the slide or doing speed reloads. Even holding the handgun can become difficult. 
***(EXAMPLES)****

GLOCK 17 $50.00 
S&W M&P 40 (FULL SIZE) $50.00

*WE ARE OPEN TO ALL POLYMER BASED FIREARMS AND MAGS AS WELL AS KNIFE GRIPS AND SHEATHS...BASICALLY ANYTHING POLYMER THAT YOU WANT STIPPLED IT CAN BE DONE 
**************************************************************
 WE ARE ALSO NOW OFFERING FRAME MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS TRIGGER GUARD SHAPING,GRIP MODIFICATIONS,GRAPHIC DESIGNS EXC EXC 
PRICES FOR MODIFICATIONS ARE USUALLY CUSTOM BASED HOWEVER TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF IDEA 

(EXAMPLE)
GLOCK 19 GEN 3&4 TRIGGER GUARD MODIFICATION $60.00 AND UP 
CUSTOM STIPPLE DESIGN SUCH AS FLAMES,WORDS,OR BASIC DESIGNS ARE $75.00 AND UP 
 USUALLY MOST DESIGNS ARE CUSTOMS AS WELL AS TRIGGER GUARDS SO USUALLY WE WILL GIVE YOU A BASE PRICE ON THE MODIFICATION AND THEN GO UP FOR THERE SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THE MORE WORK THE BETTER A PRICE HERE IS AN EXAMPLE 
GLOCK 19 STIPPLE ($50.00)
STIPPLE+TRIGGER GUARD SHAVE ($95.00)
STIPPLE+TRIGGER GUARD SHAVE+CUSTOM DESIGN ($165.00)
SO BASICALLY THE MORE YOU WANT DONE THE CHEAPER IT GETS IN WHICH IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE YOU SAVED $20.00 
ALSO THE MORE WEAPONS YOU WANT WORKED THE BETTER THE PRICES YOU GET
******************************************************************* 
We also offer color fill option. This is where I will fill in the engravings on the slide of a handgun with our custom Powder coating gear.
We can also do AR15 etc etc.. If its an engraving we can fill it with color!!!

In some instances the engraving depth isnt enough and won't come out as clean as the others..leaving a thin color rather than a nice bright clear color..
so please send us pictures and we will let you how it will more than likely will turn out. Glock's and M&P's come out great. As do most AR lower receivers

Prices are to be determined by the type of weapon. So please call text or email with any questions...

It can be easily mounted to any Glock pistol using the rail mount system. The flashlight is 60 lumens and it can be used by itself, the red laser can be used by itself or they can both be used together. The switch is placed so it is easily manipulated while in the firing position. This is a very solid piece of equipment and it fits perfectly to any Glock. The mount is rock solid with zero wiggle or play, yet it is easily removed with two buttons on either side of the light. It has never been used, it was only mounted on a Glock one time to see how it fit but never used while firing. It is in perfect condition and comes in the original packaging with the manual, small screwdriver and a spare bulb. It also comes with two lithium batteries so you can start using it right away. These are sold new for $250 and up, but I am offering it for only $125. However it is in perfect condition exactly like it came off the store shelf.

It is in perfect condition and has only been used once, it has zero cosmetic blemishes and it works perfectly. These magazines can be pretty hard to come by because people are buying them everywhere with the expectation that in the near future these ultra-high capacity magazines will no longer be made due to possible legislation. If a ban on new high-capacity magazines is eventually passed, these particular magazines will instantly quadruple in value, as they are by far the best and most reliable 100-round magazines available. These magazines very rarely have any feeding issues unlike the Beta Mags which are not only twice the cost, but are harder to maintain and easier to break. These usually go for $150 or more online or in gun shops... if you can find them, so I am offering this one for $125. However it is in the same condition as one you would get off the shelf at any store.

I prefer a cash transaction in the Phoenix area, however I am willing to ship it to you as long as there are no current laws restricting high capacity magazines in your area and you pay the shipping. I will accept PayPal, money orders and cashiers checks. Please no trade offers.

The barrel is in great condition with less than 50 rounds fired total, and it is in essentially perfect condition. It is a drop in barrel which will fit any G20 model including SF and Gen. 4 versions. The barrel is 6"" long so it does extend past the end of the slide about an inch, however this will create a slight increase in the bullet velocity. The .40 S&W rounds will fit in the G20 10mm Auto magazines without a problem. This will allow you to practice with your G20 without having to go through tons of expensive and often hard to find 10mm Auto ammunition. It will also give you added peace of mind knowing that if 10mm Auto ammunition ever becomes EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to find you will still be able to use your G20 with the much more common .40 S&W round. The barrel also has standard rifling so you can use lead ammunition without the issues that the Glock hexagonal rifling can cause. These barrels are sold by Lone Wolf online for $125 new, so I am offering mine for $75. However it is almost in exactly the same condition as the new ones you would get from Lone Wolf.

I prefer a cash transaction in the phoenix area but I will gladly ship it to you anywhere in the US as long as you pay the shipping costs. I will accept PayPal, money order or cashiers check. Please no trade offers.

It includes a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40 riflescope and a leather sling.  I also have some .300Whisper ammo (208gr subsonic) for sale.  The rifle has less than 40rds through it and is in excellent condition.  I'm not much of a rifleman, but this thing shoots an easy 3/4"" at 100yds.

The barrel is lightly fluted and threaded 1/2x28 with a flush thread protector.  The suppressor (shown) is not included.  The action breaks open very easily with the trigger-guard mounted lever and closes with authority.  The action is overbuilt and sturdy, as most single-shots are.  

Sale price for the Scout was $325 new; Nikon was $180 new; sling was $10; ammo is about $25/20rds (plux tax).  I'll sell the rifle, scope, and sling for $450, and ammo at cost.

The manufacturer's webpage on this rifle is here:
http://www.cva.com/Scout-Rifle-from-CVA.php

The website incorrectly lists the barrel length as 16.5"".  It is really 18"".

This rifle is extremely quiet with suppressed, subsonic loads.  Perfect for hog hunting or urban pest control.  The single-shot action means the rifle is very short and handy to carry around."

I have a Savage Mark II ""B"" model bolt-action .22lr for sale or trade. It has a blued steel barrel and wood stock, open sights. Rifle is in mint condition, only a year old. This gun is an absolute tack driver at 100 yards and will last you a lifetime if you need it to.

I bought this sweet rifle to get started shooting, and as much as I want to keep it, I'm trying to upgrade to a muzzleloader or rifle/shotgun combo for whitetail and bear hunting and that means saying goodbye to the Savage. I've kept the gun in a padded case since I got it, and the only visible marks on it are a few tiny scratches on the barrel from when I was attempting to mount a scope. I keep the metal parts oiled and run a boresnake (included with the gun) through it after every shooting.
Gun comes with:
-2 10-round clips
-Padded case
-.22lr boresnake cleaner
-4x rifle scope (no mounts, sorry)
-Some assorted ammo

This would make a perfect starter gun, Christmas or Hanukkah gift for a young shooter. It is easy to handle, quick to sight in, and has less kick than most air rifles. I learned to shoot on this gun and I hope someone else gets to do the same. Like I said, this gun is in pristine condition, so that's why I'm asking the going retail price for it. But including the accessories and excluding tax, this is a great bargain for anyone looking for a rimfire that can shoot accurately to 150 yards.

I have fired this pistol and I do carry it daily as a B.U.G. to my Glock 19EXO.  It shoots phenomenally clear out to 25 yards.  And yes, I've shot it out at that distance with a dollar bill diameter shot group at 25 yards.  The little thing is just that impressive.

I am on the hunt for a Savage Hog Hunter in 308, Savage 10 in 308, Remington 700 in 308, or a nice 30-30....with the Savage Hog Hunter being the preference.

However, if you manage to have about 700 pounds of scrap lead (not from batteries either) then I just might take that in trade.

Bill of sale required for valid CCW holders, all others will require transfer through a local FFL holder at the buyer's expense.  This is to protect both the buyer and the seller in the event that the firearm ever winds up stolen so that the SN is documented somewhere.  It's happened to someone I know and fortunately I had the BOS to give to the Sheriff."

The bore appears somewhat dark, but the rifling is sharp and I think a thorough cleaning would brighten it up nicely. Action is smooth and mechanically sound. It has the standard 10-round detachable magazine.

The metal is in excellent condition with no pitting and comparatively minor finish loss. Finish is the dark black almost paintlike appearance typical of the Ishapore Arsenal. Numerous proofing marks and UK property stamps are visible and picked out in white. A

Remember if something seems too good to be true . . . IT PROBABLY IS.  Don't take chances, don't send items or money in good faith, meet in person when ever possible and if you decide to do transactions through the mail only send or accept money via paypal.

It still cycles fine, so I carry that one in the gun, and the other (which slides in smooth) as the spare mag.

 I've got a couple guns available for trades or possibly for sale. I really prefer trades but as they say everything's for sale for the right price. Just please either way make an offer. Any further emails asking ""what trades are you looking for?"" Or ""how much?"" will be ignored.
 That said here's what I have to offer.
 First up is my Para Ordnance P13 45. It is a double stack, series 80, commander size(4.25"") 1911. It has Tru dot night sites, full length guide rod, original guide rod and spring cup, and polished trigger hammer sear disconnect and feed ramp. It's very accurate and reliable. It's currently my daily carry and does show holster/handling wear. It also includes 3 10 round mags and the factory box. 
 Next up is my WASR 10/63 AK-47 variant. This is a good straight one. It shoots great and has never had a single malfunction since I bought it new. This one does have the standard size threaded barrel with slant muzzle break. I sealed the furniture with satin clear and upgraded the grip, and has a polished trigger group. This one includes one 30rd mag and leather sling."

This gun is sighted in at 100 yards with the scope, I never used the iron sights.  The gun is in mint condition other than some very minor handling wear around the grip and magazine chamber.  It is great for a beginning shooter to the most experienced shooters.  Can be used for hunting, competition and competitive shooting.

It is in mint condition and brand new from the factory, only taken out of the scabbard a couple times and never actually used. It will come with the original packaging. The edges on this are absolutely razor sharp and this tomahawk feels nice and solid in your hands. It comes with a Kydex scabbard which you pull the tomahawk out from the bottom. The bottom of the rubberized grip has a screw endcap that you can remove to reveal a hidden storage compartment in the handle. It comes with a sharpening stone in the storage space but you can pretty much store anything small enough in there if you wanted. The endcap also has a lanyard on it which allows you to hold on to it even better. These Shrike tomahawks sell for $425 online, but they have a rather long wait period of about 6 months or more. Because this tomahawk is absolutely brand new and in mint condition I am selling it for $375, which is $50 less than at the RMJ Tactical site, and you don't have to wait 6 months to get it. That being said, I guarantee you this tomahawk is just as perfect as one you would get directly from the factory.

These rifles come supplied with two 30-round magazines and a bayonet lug.
