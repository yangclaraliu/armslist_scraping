These are pretty rare guns and have an interesting history...

They had a development time of nearly 20 years, and only about 15K were produced for worldwide sale.
They operate on a ""Gas Brake"" design similar to the H&K P7 and it has a fixed barrel
it has nearly no recoil and a very light recoil spring.
This gun is known to be super accurate and it has a ""cult like"" following

5 years ago they were easy to find... now not so much... when the magazines come up for sale people pay between $200-$250.00 just to score and extra.

This gun is in spectacular ""safe queen"" condition and comes with two magazines... the serial number is 14,1xx putting it in the last 900 guns produced according to my research that would be around 1988

Made in Austria... this is a serial numbers matching gun with all proper proof marks.

This gun was originally designed and built for the military and as such this is a Mil Spec gun with a chrome barrel that has  Polygonal Rifling 

The grips show no wear at all. and there are no real flaws in the finish
A very slight amount of holster wear at the nose, and the de-cocking lever has a shiny spot.

Asking $875.00 OBO for the complete package with two 18 round magazines and a plastic storage box.

Will Trade for a Winchester Model 70 in 300 Win Mag with a wood stock

I accept credit cards... You have to have the card in person to ""swipe"" and of course the card must match your ID

I will be doing a bill of sale so please have a valid VA drivers license or Military ID

shoot me a message if you want anymore pictures."

This is my third year keeping bees and selling honey. I usually have enough demand from friends at work and church that I don't advertise. But this year was very productive, so I'm trying to reach some new customers. The hives are kept in my neighbor/partner's backyard, so the bees are gathering a really nice variety nectar from plants such as beans, golden rod, cotton, dandelion, maple, raspberry, blackberry, as well as other natural, yard, and garden/agriculture flora in the Hazel Green area. Most of the honey is jarred in quarts, but I do have a few pints and 1 lb squeeze bottles. Quarts are $12, pints are $7, and 1 lb squeeze bottles are $5. If you buy enough(at least 5 quarts), I will gladly give you a small discount. Email through Armslist if interested. I live in Hazel Green and work in Huntsville, so I can meet you anywhere in between after work. Or you can come pick it up at my house, so you can verify the location of the hives and that this is pure local honey."

People who get a kick out of plinking and other kinds of target shooting have discovered the perfect companion: the SIG SAUER® Mosquito® .22LR pistol.
Mosquito, Scratching The Itch. Ergonomically designed to give the best shooting experience, the Mosquito is built on a tough polymer frame and features an accessory rail, rugged blowback system, fixed barrel, adjustable sights, and multiple safety devices. There are five Mosquito models available. The Mosquito Reverse Two-Tone has a stainless finish on the frame with a blued slide. The more traditional Mosquito Two-Tone has a stainless finish slide and polymer frame. For the classic professional look, there’s the basic Mosquito with a blued overall finish. The Mosquito with Threaded Barrel, which also has a blued finish, is designed to accept most suppressors. For those who take their target shooting more seriously, the new Mosquito Sport features a longer sight radius and is fitted with an extended barrel and barrel weight.

It has also been turned from the imported ""hunting"" rifle into a fun sport rifle that features a pistol grip, adjustable stock (TAPCO), handguard (TAPCO), and forward grip (MAGPUL). This is an original Saiga made by Izhmash, the Russian company that created and manufacturers original AK47s and AK74s. This rifle chambers the 5.45 round, a very inexpensive and fun round to shoot that is comparable in size to the 5.56. 

Included with this rifle are all attached accessories, a rifle case, about 500 rounds of Russian surplus ammo, and three magazines. This Saiga has had the bullet guide installed, allowing it to take AK74 magazines. The three magazines include (1) 40 round, (1) 30 round, and (1) 20 round. 

Email me with any questions or for more photos. She's in great shape and well taken care of! As a side note I'd also be willing to sell cans of surplus ammo for a great deal (cheaper than on the net now) if you purchase the rifle. 

Please note that while I do support your right to sell and purchase firearms through private transactions, I will require that an FFL is utilized even for local sales."

According to the Remington folks, this thing was manufactured in 2002, and comes with the Walnut Stock and 28"" Barrel.   It's got the Remchoke 28"" Barrel, with a Full choke installed.   It has the full engraving, on both sides of the receiver.  I haven't seen any like it, most lack the engraving.

This shotgun has a couple of small marks on the end of the barrel, and on the rib.   There are some handling marks on the stock.   It's not a safe queen.  By the looks of the internals, it's been shot a bit, but not very much.   It's in extremely good shape, with a couple of dings to add character.   

This gun, as I'm being told (per Remington Historical Society), retailed for between 900-1000 bucks.   I'm seeing comparable shotguns going on gunbroker for between 700-850 dollars.   I'm asking $650.   Face to face transactions only please.  I'm not interested in trades.  You must be willing to show ID and sign a bill of sale for my records.  This is to verify that you are over 18, per Section 14 of North Carolina General Statutes."

I believe its from 1984. It has a 16 inch barrel and a collapsable metal stock which I dont believe you can really find anymore. The rifle is completely original .  It has very minimal wear and tear.  I would rate it about 90% if I had to put a number on it. Aside from a few minor scuffs it really is in good condition . Not so many in existence for that are for sale. Its really becoming a very rare rifle. I have seen them going for 2-3 k with the fixed stock and 20 inch barrel. I think this is a very favorable one which I really had a hard time tracking down many comparables to figure out what people were selling them for. I would like to trade for a Benelli M4 or similar or a very nice top of the line 1911 which I can ad cash to as well if necessary.

356,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2123356,For Sale/Trade:  US Army Issue Colt M1901 Army Double Action Revolver,"North, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 850,"Listed On: Friday, March 14, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Colt 1901 was a slightly modified version of the Colt 1892 ""New Army and Navy"" revolver.
The first model in this early DA revolver was the Model 1889 ""New Navy"" which went through several modifications, including the Models 1892, 1994, 1896, 1901, and finally the 1903.

These were the first swing-out cylinder double action revolvers ever made, and Colt revolutionized revolvers with the new design. S&W wouldn't get their first swing-out DA on the market until 1896.

These pistols were forerunners of all the Colt DA revolvers that followed, and the basic design was made up until the Colt Python was discontinued in 2004.  These early series guns were discontinued in 1907, with about 291,000 produced for all models.

The US Army and Navy bought large quantities of these revolvers in the now obsolete .38 Long Colt cartridge.  It was this design Colt and the .38 Long cartridge that failed in the Philippines and led to the adoption of the Model 1911 .45 Automatic.

This is a genuine US Army issue M1901 US military model, as evidenced by the  markings on the butt, grips and frame.   The grips are the original smooth walnut grip with the inspector stamp of RAC on each side.  RAC were the initials of Rinaldo A. Carr the civilian government employed sub-inspector at Colt, between 1890 to 1903. The frame is also stamped RAC and L.E.B.  The initials L .E.B. belonging to one Leroy E. Briggs, an Army Captain that inspected revolvers rebuilt and refurbished at Remington's Bridgeport plant between 1898 to 1917.  

The bottom of the butt is perfectly marked ""U.S.ARMY MODEL 1901."" and ""No 157271.""  The serial number indicates it was manufactured and delivered to the US Army in 1901.   The round barrel is clearly marked with two line Colt address and patent dates ending with  “March 5, 95”. The barrel and frame have 90% original blue finish with some thinning and patina to the backstrap and front strap. Dull blue finish remains on the rear surfaces of the hammer with about 50% remaining on the trigger. Action works perfectly and appears to be still in time. The walnut grips are smooth and in very good condition, although one front corner is missing a small chip.  A swivel lanyard strap is on the butt of the pistol. Overall condition is very good. Will ship to your FFL.   This gun is priced to sell at the low end of the 2011 gun values guide and often sell for considerably larger sums.  Offers and trades of like value considered."

This is a 1977 grade 1 Browning BPR - .22 pump long rifle with 11 round tublar magazine. This was the first year of production. The barrel is 20-1/4"" in length with iron sights. The receiver top is grooved for scope mounting. This rifle is in very good shape overall with some handling marks and a couple of light scattered rust freckles on the receiver. The stocks are in great condition as well, free of cracks or chips, and showing just a few light handling marks. The mechanics of the firearm are in excellent working order.    Great for novice shooters, my kids learned to shoot with this and they would consider it to be a tack driver…   This is hands down a great shooting and operating gun!

This is a 1977 grade 1 Browning BPR - .22 pump long rifle with 11 round tublar magazine. This was the first year of production. The barrel is 20-1/4"" in length with iron sights. The receiver top is grooved for scope mounting. This rifle is in very good shape overall with some handling marks and a couple of light scattered rust freckles on the receiver. The stocks are in great condition as well, free of cracks or chips, and showing just a few light handling marks. The mechanics of the firearm are in excellent working order.    Great for novice shooters, my kids learned to shoot with this and they would consider it to be a tack driver…   This is hands down a great shooting and operating gun!

Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an unitterupted top rail that runs the length of the tube.  In addition, the installation of Modular Picatinny Rails is accomplished with little effort. This allows you to have rails anywhere you need them and nowhere you don’t."

As far as condition, it shows some (but not too much) wear, as a 35 year old pistol should. No dings or gouges, no pitting, no rust, and no corrosion. The only changes that have been made are good ones, including an ed brown national match grade barrel, an adjustable ed brown match grade trigger (crisp 2 lb break) and a match grade ed brown bushing. This has a full length guide rod, and is perfect internally. It drives tacks, and really is a great shooter.

The design is based on scaled down Webley Mark 6 ""break-top"" frame, with cylinder chambered for 6 .38/200 rounds. The hammer/trigger group was redesigned, with manual hammer safety lock added, and with separate cylinder lock. This revolver was adopted for British Military service in 1932 as Enfield revolver, .38 caliber, No.2 Mark 1. After 1938, almost all No.2 Mk1s were converted into No.2 Mark 1 configuration.

Enfield No.2 Mark 1 were developed in the late 1930s for British Tank Corps. The spurless DAO hammers were required by Tank Corps command to avoid snagging the hammers on tank internals.

Enfield No.2 Mark 1 appeared in the 1942 as a simplified, wartime design. These guns were similar to No.2 Mark 1, but without the hammer stop. After 1945, all those revolvers were recalled and converted into No.2 Mark 1.

I am asking $450 FTF OBO for this revolver and I am including 60 rounds of factory loaded ammunition for the gun. I am also including a leather holster that was with the gun when it was given to me. Lockup and timing is great. 

I will travel almost anywhere in the Seattle/Tacoma area - maybe farther for serious offers.

656,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2123656,For Sale:  VLTOR Modular Upper Receiver,"Goose Creek, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 250,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 17, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. 

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. 

The MUR comes in two models: one with a Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector and the second with a Shell Deflector only. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door. 

Construction:
7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved; heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment.

Compatibility: 
Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available).

Weight:
MUR-1A (with assist) weighs less than 10 oz.

Dimensions:
Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”.

Color/Finish:
Black matte (anti-reflection/glare) Hard coat anodized (Type-III, Class 2). Bore’s surface in coated with dry film lube, over the anodized surface.

Special Features:
Improved strength over conventional forged “flat-top” upper receivers. Stronger than any “billet” upper receiver with similar material and dimensional characteristics. Tighter manufacturing tolerances, when compared to the competition.

HK USP .45V1 which comes with the following:

-UTL
-5 X 10rd factory magazines
-Safariland drop leg holster (only holds USP)
-Factory 3 dot sights (installed MTM night sights are faded)
-Factory cases for both the USP and the UTL

I am the first owner of this pistol and the USP has only been shot at indoor ranges.  Considering her pedigree, she can take a lot more punishment than I could ever dish out from a range session.  It has never been carried - I purchased the holster on a whim.  The UTL has always been stored with the batteries removed and from the pictures you can see it is in working order.  The reason that I am looking to sell/trade it is that I want something that will be easier to carry (just completed my CCW course).

As for partial trades, I am ""interested in"":

SIG 220 (especially beavertail models)
Glock 21 or 30 (Gen 4 only please)
S&W Ladysmith model revolver in .357 (for my fiancé)
Lever action rifle in .44 Mag or .45LC
Ruger 10/22 (take down model only)

I'm also open to hearing what else is out there for trade.  Unfortunately, I'm not interested in trading for 1911 pattern pistols, shotguns, or any other types of rifles than those listed (sorry). I'm also not looking to part with any cash in the trade.

Of course, cash always works as well.  I'd put the trade value of the package at $1200.  I can also include some ammo (with an upwards price adjustment) depending on the deal.

FTF in NoVA requires 2 forms of ID and BoS.  I will provide the same for a trade.  I am also willing to ship to your FFL for shipping costs."

All traditional firearms share a common problem; they utilize heavy linear operating mechanisms that deliver recoil forces directly into the operator's shoulder.

The engineers at KRISS USA, starting with a clean computer screen and one goal in mind, have solved this century-old problem by creating the patented KRISS Super V System-the only firearm operating system in the world that actually works with the operator to help put more rounds on target, more of the time."

This PTR, American-made on German HK machinery, is a beast, pure and simple. No gas system to foul up, just the battle-proven roller-lock system that has cut its teeth across half a century's worth of warfare in nearly every corner of the globe.
When it comes to delivery, this rifle does not fail, has not failed. Not once. Bolt gap (semi-common problem amongst HK rifles) is good to go. You know if you got a problem the first hundred rounds in.Cash Only"

The rifle is in perfect working order. Smooth shooting. 

Included is a 20 round magazine, quad rails, and 100 rounds of ammo.

When I got the gun it had a cheap foldable stock that was loose. I bought a new synthetic stock and had ir professionally installed by Bullseye Blueing in Columbus. This stock is fantastic, very comfortable, and of douse functional. Also, recently had the piston system serviced.

I am asking 400 for everything, which I feel is a very fair price. I got the gun for 400 with the cheap stock. I have 200$ more in just the stock, installation and service alone. 

A couple more things to save you and me time:

1: I do not want to haggle. This is a fair price. I am the one taking a loss here. I know what I have, so please, do not lowball me.

2: I do NOT want to trade for anything. Cash only please.

I am selling my Raven Arms pocket pistol. The action on this pistol is very tight; it almost feels like you are racking a .45 ACP into the chamber instead of a .25 Auto! I have replaced the firing pin, take-down button, and firing pin spring as well as the grips. It holds 6+1 and has absolutely no feeding or ejecting issues whatsoever. Very reliable PD pistol, easily concealable.

I am selling it with a leather holster, (2) magazines, and 50 rounds of .25 Auto ammo.
