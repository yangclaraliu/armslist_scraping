Fires flawlessly, Extremely accurate, Rifling is in pristine condition as well.

Do a little bit of research on these rifles if you are interested, they are extremely rare and highly sought after. I paid $1000 for the rifle, $160 for the magazines, and $300 for the scope. I would accept $1400 for everything. $1200 for the rifle and magazines. $1100 for the rifle and no magazines.

But the SuperNova Tactical isn’t just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

The SuperNova Tactical comes with either rifle sights or newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights. The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. Optional three- tritium inserts can be easily installed. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. Butt stock options include a tactical pistol grip stock, or the ComforTech® stock. The top of the SuperNova’s receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics."

Hello!
I have a Kimber Custom Shop Ultra CDP II for sale. The gun is in great condition. The rail has nice polished sides with a matte finish on top. The edges are extra rounded for more comfortable concealed carry. Everything on this pistol comes from Kimber with top of the line features from their custom shop. 

Included is two Wilson Combat magazines along with the original Kimber magazine. I have some assorted personal defesnse rounds. 

This pistol is a beauty, as are most of the pistols that Kimber makes. Selling because it turns out not to be my carry style, but that says nothing about the pistol itself, just my personal taste. 

I am not interested in trades. Make me an offer!

You must be over 21 to own a Silencer. The NFA requires a one time per item *** $200.00 *** tax stamp on each Silencer, Short Barrel Rifle (SBR), .. basically any Class III item. The $200.00 Check or Money order is sent directly to the ATF with your Silencer paperwork. I handle all the paperwork for you. You just hand me the check to send in with the paperwork. Or if your not local I can send paperwork to you by mail. You only need sign a few spots in front of Notary and Drop in the mail with the $200 check made out to the ATF. To start paper work you pay for the Silencer and the Serial# that goes on the paperwork becomes yours. We can handle everything through the mail except the actual pickup of the Silencer. You will have to come to the shop or meet us at a gun show to take delivery after it clears the ATF.
So if the Silencer is $479.00 plus .06% county tax = $507.74.. you gotta pay an additional $200 directly to the ATF for the TAX stamp. So total out of pocket would be $707.74. :) Average wait for paperwork to clear the ATF is 5 to 6 months… taking about 9 months now unless things speed up. Of course no sales tax on out of state sales."

The Model 95 may weigh in at a smaller class, but packed into its lightweight bullpup design is the intense power of a .50 caliber magazine-fed weapon, the pinpoint accuracy of a bolt-action rifle and the effortless functionality of a perfectly designed machine.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a lightweight package with an overall length of just 45 inches. The Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power while allowing the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. The steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. All Barrett rifles are designed for easy field stripping, so the two receivers can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation designed for speed, reliability and safety. It slides effortlessly on machined-smooth rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. This bolt carrier assembly is a simplistic design with a quick release lever for fast disassembly. The firing pin is driven by dual springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time.

Adopted by militaries all over the world, the Model 95 is not just proven in battle, it's also fun to shoot.

excellent condition and well functioning, well taken care of, passed down to me from my grandfather but I just don't use it anymore, it's been sitting in its case in a closet for the last 20 years

Stock is in perfect condition, blueing is in good/excellent shape (slightly worn on some of the sharper edges such as trigger guard, lower corner of receiver...but great shape overall), safety is crisp, trigger pull is crisp, action is smooth, was cleaned/lubricated the last time I used it for small game hunting before it was stored away...just pulled it out a couple of weeks ago for the first time in 20 years and it looks and functions just like I put in the closet yesterday

3"" chamber, holds 4+1 and comes with a magazine plug to limit rounds to 2+1 as required by some local hunting regulations

I believe it's a 1963 model making this gun 51 years old, if I'm reading the serial number correctly (last 2 numbers are 63), this model was manufactured by Remington from 1949-1968

  Just when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, Benelli unveiled the Nova Pump. Completely original and innovative, the Nova Pump incorporates its polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics, such as distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and fore-end in place of conventional checkering, complement the Nova’s innovative engineering.
With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova will handle anything from target loads to 3½"" magnums. To help dampen the recoil of today’s super-heavy magnum loads, the Nova 12-gauge is specially designed to accept a Benelli recoil reducer.

Available in the new Realtree® APG HD™ finish, the Benelli Nova is the most versatile pump-action shotgun ever made."

Size

The Glock 26 Gen 3 is classified as a sub-compact 9mm. At 6.49″ long, 4.17″ high and just 1.18″ thick, it’s pretty easy to conceal in a quality IWB holster while wearing shorts and a t-shirt. You sacrifice barrel length over the full sized models by about an inch, but this firearm proves to be just as accurate at respectable distances. And for it’s small size, it doesn’t pack too much of a punch as far as recoil goes. It is very manageable for follow-up shots.A side note on the size of this firearm: People have their own preferences with the size of the grip, as your pinky will be hanging down below the firearm with nothing to wrap around (unless you add a pinky extension plate on your magazine). I have no preference with this, as I shoot the same with or without the pinky extension.

Caliber

A great caliber in a small package. Everyone has their preferred caliber as well as their opinions regarding the usefulness of each caliber. For a close-range self defense firearm, it is my opinion that the 9mm round will get the job done if I am ever in that unfortunate situation. Choosing your carry ammunition is a whole other topic, but once the research is done, you will find that some 9mm rounds even outperform some 40 S&W and 45ACP rounds.

Simplicity

With simple items comes simple maintenance. Glocks are known for easy take-down. Now I’m not talking field strip here (although that’s super easy as well), I’m taking your full-blown take-everything-apart-one-piece-at-a-time-until-you-have-all-34-pieces-of-the-gun sitting in front of you (this includes the magazine). It’s so easy in fact, that I did it in roughly 4 minutes on my very first try, without directions.

Known as the ""BABY GLOCK,"" the GLOCK 26 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994-a market once dominated by the 5-round snubnose revolver. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide."

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

I purchased this approximately 6 months ago and I would say I have shot around 70-80 shells out of it duck hunting last season. 

The gun as you can see is synthetic black. The barrel is 26"" long. I purchased a new end cap for the gun as well that allows you to put a sling on it if you want. I still have the original end cap. I also put a rail and scope on top for turkey hunting. The scope will come with the gun, but I understand it's not for everyone and I have the two original pins if you want to take it off. Can be done in less then 5 minutes.

These are the most reliable and durable shotguns ever made. Selling for a very reasonable price. And you can't beat the SuperMag. Will come with several boxes of BB shells.

This gun has what many shooters consider the best shooting barrel length, particularly for the Bisley. The caliber is .41 Colt which is much rarer than the .45, 44-40, 32-20, or the 38-40. The condition is as seen in the pictures. A lot of bright blue with other areas such as the left side of the barrel, backstrap, and part of the trigger guard blending with a nice untouched blue/brown patina. There are nice areas of case coloring, particularly on the front part of the frame, hammer sides, and inside the frame. The screws are perfect with much fire blue remaining. The action is excellent, with all four clicks sharp and clean and very little movement when in full cock. The bore is way above average for a black powder gun with strong rifling and a mostly bright bore with scattered light black powder pitting. The front sight has been lowered a little and filed to a sharper profile, undoubtedly for accuracy. This gun has been shot for serious effect!. Shipping will be a flat $35 and will be sent priority mail to your door as an antique."

This was purchased in 1979 and I have the original receipt to show for it. It appears to be in like new condition with no damages found on it. Blueing is in like new shape. Unable to determine if it has ever been fired based on condition. It will come with original owners manual, original owner/purchaser receipt, and sheep skin case. This gun would make an nice addition to any collection.

The Enfield .303 is a great all-round set-up. This model is the #4 made by Savage in the good Ol' US of A for the Brits as a Lend/Lease before we got hot & heavy in the Great War. Dated 1942, Comes with detachable 10 round box mag, the barrel is bright and shiny with no corrosion and the lans/grooves look factory fresh, rifle has the peep/adjustable rear flip up sight to allegedly reach out to a thousand meters, full wood stock, front sight wings to protect the front blade, no missing parts. Comes with 56 rounds of WW2 ammo with a bunch of different head-stamps from England and other countries/factories as well. You can use the rounds but they are corrosive and as such the rifle would need to be washed down directly.
I first fired the rifle in 2011 and it was fine and using Remington core-lokts I put up very nice groupings at 100 yards. I have personally put 2 boxes (40rds) down-range and was nicely surprised by the accuracy of a Mil-Surplus classic.
There is an import mark on the bottom of the front of the barrel that reads CAI (Stupid as it's a US made rifle, but oh well), it is barely legible and could be buffed off or even painted over as half the Enfields were flat black paint. The gentlemen I bought the rifle from said he would buff it down but as I did not buy as a pinnacle piece for a collection, I wasn't worried about it.

There are many of these rifles out there for $400-$500 asking, but I feel the $300 firm is fair and as such there is no need for anyone to send low-ball offers as they will be ignored.

	This shotgun is truly a shooters dream gun. The craftsmanship by Beretta’s Gun Crafter’s is well defined in this “EL” engraving. The entire receiver is engulfed by the suburb engravers design highlighted in Gold. The right handed palm swell fits into the hand giving the natural perfect hand to trigger feel and enhances the notable balance of the gun in the hands. The checkering on the forearm and stock is more than up to the standards that’s expected by Beretta. From the Beretta competition logo butt pad to the white bead on the over and under barrels; the balanced swing of this gun; whether on the clay course’s or in the hunting field; was enhanced by all the custom work done to this fine firearm which created the overall shooters dream gun.  
	This Beretta EL Gold 12 Ga. shotgun was sent to Briley; one of the country’s most well renowned crafters of fine sub-gauge tube work. The gun has been completely tricked out by Briley to create the ultimate competition shooting gun package. What’s so nice about this package is it’s as close to being not only a skeet shooters dream but also has all that’s needed to make it the best it can be on the sporting clay course as well; so thus making it more than capable in the field for any hunter. 
	First, the package work consisted of the chamber work. They have been lengthened to allow for 3” shells desired by the sporting clay shooters who use them for those long shots. Back bored to reduce chamber pressures lowering shooter felt recoil for greater second shot acquisition. The barrel has Briley’s unique balanced/slotted porting; not only on the upper barrel but the lower barrel as well. So, no matter what barrel chosen to be shot first, the selective/ mechanical trigger will deliver and the balanced shot is the same from either barrel.
	Second, Briley fitted their entire new style Elite Sub-gauge tube package. The tubes are custom fitted to each barrel. They are color coated to designate its gauge size and which tube fits into the upper and lower barrel. The custom package consists of the entire sub-gauge set…20, 28, & 410. In addition, not only do the 12 Ga. barrels have removable custom designed chokes; the sub-gauge tubes have them as well. Though the trigger on this fine gun has the preferred mechanical trigger already, it was rechecked and set by Briley to be very crisp and assure the 410 re-set is dead on shot after shot.
	Third, the entire shotgun set is in-cased by Briley’s fine case. The case is custom designed for holding the entire gun and it’s components in black felt lined aluminum. It consists of specially designed slots for holding and protecting the entire set up with lockable latches. There are additional compartment for the tools, clean rods and extra choke tubes along with an additional allowance for adding an extra barrel, if/when desired. The slim lined designed case has unique outer-black rubber protection rings. In addition it sports their Briley Logo.
