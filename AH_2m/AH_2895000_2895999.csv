Bulgarian receiver flat, Texas AK double hook trigger group, rivets, center support ($100). 
Bulgarian complete parts kit with original 74 style bayonet and standard black polymer furniture ($299).  Kit is numbers matching. 

I need to get $350 for everything (that is over $150 in savings) or I will part it out at at -5% of cost. I need to hit close to my mark, feel free to make an offer but don't insult me.

Please take a moment to google how to build an AK from a receiver flat if you don't already know what goes in to it.

Cash only. Meet in South Kitsap. Will ship, buyer pays shipping. No FFL needed as the receiver flat is not a firearm until it is bent and heat treated.

Thanks folks. God bless."

Has some holster wear around the muzzle and the cylinder has the ring from being fired, it's a 38yr old revolver after all! I bought it cause the ""Made in the 200th Year of American Liberty"" rollmark caught my eye, but now I'm needing a handgun I can use to get my Conceal Carry Permit and carry, that's the ONLY reason I'm getting rid of this Revolver. Has a NICE trigger pull in both Double Action and Single Action and NO creep in single action, breaks nice and clean!

Trade for the Following:

1911, perhaps a Rock Island or ATI, maybe a Taurus?
Any Glock, preferably 22, 23, 35, 36, 30, 21

This is a Pre Accu-trigger model. This rifle was worked over by King Armory. It includes a Ram line stock, King Armory Brake, and a Nikon ProStaff 3X9 Scope. Underneath the beautiful Krylon Paint job he parkerized the rifle and then added Dura-Coat. I have included a picture of the original setup from him. It will need to have a little bit of sandpaper ran through where the bolt slides in. There's a little Krylon there that doesn't allow the bolt to slide as easily as it could. I also noticed last time I took it to the range that when you cycle the bolt the cartridge might pop out of the magazine every now and then. May just need a little tweaking on the internal mag lips. I am asking $375 or $325 without the scope. Bipod is not included.

Next up is my Wife's Model 111 Trophy Hunter with Nikon BDC 3X9-40 Scope. This rifle has been to the range once. It has had less than 5 rounds through it just to function test. The scope hasn't been sighted in. It has a couple of scuffs on the stock from being in the safe. I believe I also have the box laying around somewhere still. Asking $475 bipod not included.

And last up is 125 Rounds of ammo. Buyer of the rifle's get the option of buying this first. If they don't want it then I'll sell it. Asking $100

I will consider all trade offers but not looking for anything in particular."

This shows that it had never been fired because they would have been on there previously.

PLEASE NO TRADES!

One of Taurus' best weapons, this PT model is chambered in .45 caliber. 

From the Taurus Site:
This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

I bought this gun and simply never had a chance to use it. It's never been fired and has 2 magazines, a loader, brush and original paper work and hard case. It's a sacrifice at $45O.
