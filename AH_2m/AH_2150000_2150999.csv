In my opinion this is a BETTER AND MORE RELIABLE model than the M9 (which is the side arm of our armed forces) even though there are slight modifications done to the M9 to make it a 92fs. This 92fs features a ""straight 8"" sighting system which is superb and more accurate than other combat sights.

The SIX8™ weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.

As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge.

It comes with everything pictures - Glock 22 Gen. 4, the GlockBox, 3 interchangeable backstraps (with tool to change), magazine, speed loader (very handy), cleaning rods, and original paperwork.  Text works better than calls, but if you call leave a message.  Price is pretty firm.

Known for its compact size (the short barrel is just 3.4 inches long), customizable features and contoured frames, the P22 is a tactical pistol that target shooters, law enforcement and civilians can enjoy. Many P22 styles are available, and thanks to features like removable grip back straps and extended magazines, the firearm can be customized to fit the needs of the owner.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from their centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns ... and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

This Walther P22 comes with the original box. It also has a laser, lock, and two magazines. I can also throw in some bullets if you'd like.

I have a very nice condition Bersa Model 383 (very similar to the Thunder series) chambered in .380 acp. It's all black with beautiful wood grips. I recently purchased the firearm to carry while my XDS is out for recall, but it's just not what I was hoping for. It's in great shape and functions perfect (I have not shot it). I have approximately 125 rounds to go with it (mixed fmj and hollow points, 50/50). Also comes with a cheap nylon holster from Double Tap. I can text or email pics if you would like to see it.

Must meet in Thurston Co. (Olympia/Lacey/Tumwater area)

The rifling is strong, however the bore is dark and has light pitting. The stock came unfinished, but I stained it with minwax gel to look similar to the popular Norinco stocks. I have recently replaced the gas valve so its good to go and also comes with 10 stripper clips. I'm asking $400.

Next I have a very early imported VZ24 Czech Mauser. It is in EXCELLENT shape and appears to be all matching as well. It was made in 1937 by BRNO and has the Lions Crest. It still has the original white paint and the bluing is in excellent condition. I'd describe the stock as very good and it also includes the original sling. The only downside is the bore is dark with fair pitting, however the groves are still strong. I can also include 75rds of Yugo surplus, 20rds of PPU SP, 5 nickel plated stripper clips, 100 196 Privi bullets, 14 Peters SP bullets, 35 pieces of brass, and a set of once used RCBS 8mm neck reloading dies. For the lot I'm asking $450.

Lastly I have a early Nagoya Arsenal Type 99 Arisaka in 7.7 Jap. The rifle is all matching as far as I can tell. It was a WWII bringback and even includes the original Aircraft sights! When I received the rifle it was in rough condition so I had it reblued in matte blue to better hide the pitting. It really came out great. The bore is bright and shinny, however the rifling is pretty worn but it is still shootable. The stock had seen better days finish wise, but has no deep gauges or cracks. I'm asking $250 for this.

This is my very LAST one.  Although not the most expensive by far, it has been my favorite.  I probably have the box somewhere, but the last time I saw it was more than 15 years ago.  Based on that fact, I'm just selling the pistol itself in a padded case.

I really don't have much I can add to this pistol except that is an all original Colt King Cobra .357 Magnum in Stainless Steel with a 4"" barrel.  It has been fired, but not by me and I've owned it for around 20 years.  There is a slight mark on the cylinder from where it has turned.  I believe I could easily buff it out, but in my personal opinion, I'd rather have a collectable firearm that has not been tinkered with in any way.  Based on close observation, I seriously doubt this pistol was ever carried.  The leading edges are just too crisp.  There are no marks on the under lug at all.

If you have any questions, just ask.  Any sale must take place face to face in IN and I strongly prefer you have a license to carry.  If the sale is out of state, the purchaser will be responsible to pay actual shipping costs to their FFL dealer and, if their FFL dealer will not accept firearms from an individual, an additional $25 to have my local FFL dealer ship it to your FFL dealer.  These are some of the best pistols out there and are certainly excellent investments."

THE SKS IS SOLD PENDING FUNDS

I have an earlier imported Yugo 59/66 SKS which appears to be all matching and has the early style import marks on the barrel. The rifling is strong, however the bore is dark and has light pitting. The stock came unfinished, but I stained it with minwax gel to look similar to the popular Norinco stocks. I have recently replaced the gas valve so its good to go and also comes with 10 stripper clips. I'm asking $400.

THE SKS IS SOLD PENDING FUNDS

THE MAUSER IS SOLD 

Lastly I have a early Nagoya Arsenal Type 99 Arisaka in 7.7 Jap. The rifle is all matching as far as I can tell. It was a WWII bringback and even includes the original Aircraft sights! When I received the rifle it was in rough condition so I had it reblued in matte blue to better hide the pitting. It really came out great. The bore is bright and shinny, however the rifling is pretty worn but it is still shootable. The stock had seen better days finish wise, but has no deep gauges or cracks. I'm asking $200 for this.

I have a brand new in box never fired Glock 26 gen4 made in the United States in Smyrna, Georgia. Not only is this a RARE USA MADE Glock, but even more rare is that it has the ""P"" proof mark outlined by the state of Georgia. This proof mark means that the gun went through additional testing and withstood the pressure from rounds over powered by at least 30%. You can't just go to your local gun dealer and order this gun, let alone order one made in the USA, as they are all shipped overseas. I just got lucky and got my hands on one on display at my local gun shop, it was sent there by Glock because they were temporarily out of the Austrian ones for some reason at the right time when they had already promised a shipment of 26's. Anyways, I bought it because I knew exactly what it was, and it was all I could do to hide my excitement from the dealer. Comes with everything factory, I haven't touched anything but the gun once to flip it over for pictures. $1000 obo/ will trade for an ar15 or m4, all other trades considered as well just lemme know what you've got.     PS: I have HD pictures of the proof markings and more to prove its real, but I can only upload up to 4mb on this site so if you email me Ill send you more pictures asap."

Pistol has less than 250rds down the pipe and it shows. My only gripe with this gun is that it doesn't quite fit right with my long fat fingers. This is a particularly hard gun to find in 9mm with the ambidextrous thumb safeties, literally took me months to find one. This is a great carry piece or if you're looking for a tactical gun. I'm asking $950 for the gun with all mags (around $50 each if you can find them in stock). This one is single/double action, with decocker and ambi safety. Text is best to get a hold of me quickly.

The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts. Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Magpul BAD Lever Battery Assist Device AR15/M16 

P/N: MAG980 

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger. Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included. Made in U.S.A. 

Features 

•Compatible with standard mil-spec forged AR15/M16 receivers* 

•Thin, anti-snag profile and textured surface still allows for traditional manipulation of the bolt catch while maintaining unobstructed access to the trigger 

•asy attachment to the existing bolt catch paddle via one screw 

•Machined from durable billet 6061-T6 aluminum 

•Finished with MIL-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2 hard anodizing with manganese phosphate on the screw per MIL-DTL-16232G 

•Torx® mounting screw with Nyloc® Blue patch prevents back out under recoil (Torx wrench included) 

* Not compatible with 7.62x51 (.308 Winchester) firearms as well as most AR15 billet or polymer lower and upper receivers due to their larger and/or non-standard dimensions."
