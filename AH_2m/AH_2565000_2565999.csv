x1 Rare Authentic US Military Surplus PASGT Vest in Excellent to Like New condition. Small.
$99 or best offer

This is the original military kevlar vest and is designed to protect against fragmentation and other projectiles, it is not designed to stop small arms rounds but has had mixed success in stopping pistol caliber rounds in various tests. Very durable and the materials are in great condition, haven't seen another this clean. Has some small dirt stains on right shoulder pad, no other wear.

Features include:
Flexible kevlar panels improve movement while wearing vest
Reinforced panels on shoulders
Elastic Adjustment
Webbing for grenades, misc gear
2 Magazine pouches

Even includes the original use and care manual in great condition, great collectors item. Would also be a great training vest.

Size Small
Chest 33-37 Inches


x2 Concealable Body Armor vests in size small and x-small. x2 Level II protection (4 Level II armor panels in each vest). $175 each or best offer.

Size small fits up to a 37"" chest and 5'8"" person, x-small fits up to 33"" chest and 5'5-6"" person. I can send you measurements as well. The vests are made by ABA and the kevlar is made by PACA. The ABA carriers are in very good condition and have no wear or stains on the fabric or straps. Each vest has 2 Level II ballistic panels in both front and back for better than Level IIIA coverage which is the highest rated soft armor. The vests are only slightly thicker than Level IIIA and offer more protection as they are thicker and use the same materials. User also has the option of wearing only 1 panel on front and back for Level II coverage to be more concealable. One level 2 soft armor panel can stop up to 9mm luger at 1175 feet/sec and .357 magnum at 1395 feet/sec. One level IIIA panel can stop 9mm luger at 1400 feet/sec and .44 magnum at 1350 feet/sec. Effectively you are getting 2 level II vests or 1 better than IIIA vest for the price of one. The kevlar panels are surplus and have staining but they are not physically damaged in any way nor do they have any odors, they have been properly cleaned and deodorized with vest-guard anti-microbial cleaning spray. They are manufactured from 2001-2003, but work just as well as when manufactured according to the NIJ,

""NIJ tests failed to demonstrate any significant differences in 10-year-old armor, regardless of the extent of use or apparent physical condition""
...Guide to Police Body Armor, National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center (NLECTC)

These vests would be excellent for women, men under 5'8"" or your children. Great for SHTF preppers or home and personal security.

Open to trades

Body armor is a good investment in our changing and volatile world.

I have maybe put 50 rounds through this gun. These really are great guns.  I replaced the factory front dot sight with a Hi Viz fiber optic sight that has interchangeable lite pipes.

The barrel is 25 inches long and is slightly tapered towards the muzzle. The barrel is marked ""short, long, and long rifle"". The rifling is good and the bore is bright. It comes with one clip which has a large ""W"" stampded on the bottem. The original finish on the barrel, receiver, and stock is really nice. There is no rust or scratches on it anywhere that I can see. The barrell does not have a dovetail for the rear sight, it has two holes that are drilled and tapped on the left side of the receiver where the factory peep sight mounted.

The M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System is intended to replace the M24 Sniper Weapon System used by snipers, spotters, designated marksman, or squad advanced marksmen in the United States Army. However, the U.S. Army still acquired M24s from Remington until February 2010.[2] After witnessing the effects of USSOCOM snipers and extensive after-action reports from SOF snipers throughout the Iraqi theater of operations, the U.S. Army ran a competition involving several designs, including rifles from Knight's Armament Company, Remington, and DPMS Panther Arms.

 New DPMS LRT SASS 308 with brand new Leupold Mark 4 ERT 4.5-14 Optic and Leupold mount. Born out of military necessity, The Semi-Auto Sniper System was designed to provide marksmen a weapon that could accomplish both their long range precision mission and provide rapid defensive fire when needed. Featuring a 18” fluted teflon coated Stainless Bull barrel, Mapgpul® PRS stock, Magpul® back-up sights, JP trigger, Panther® tactical grip and 4 rail free float tube, the LRT-SASS is mission ready for the most demanding tasks.

the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR cartridge, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action."

Easily shoots .75"" or smaller groups if you do your part.  I didn't work up a load specifically for this rifle.  I took my standard 55gr VMax load that was worked up for my target AR & it ""just worked"" so I didn't tinker with it. 

Rifle has about 60 rds through it total.  It's like new condition.

Primarily looking for trades or partial trades to get into other things I'm interested in or to fund other projects.  I have well over $1500 in this rifle so I'd need that in trade value or trade + cash.  Cash offer would need to be close to $1400.

I shopped carefully to put this rifle together & have over $1500 in it.  I'd value trades in excellent condition at a little less than internet new prices.  If you paid $800 for your gun at Gander Mtn but Bud's lists it for $600, I wouldn't call it $775 trade value just because you paid too much.  We can do that if you want & I'd go high retail on everything I put in this build & call it $1900 trade value.  IF you're reading this, it's still for sale - you don't need to email me asking if it is.  No lowball offers - not trying to make this month's mortgage or put food on the table - I don't even know if I want to sell/keep it yet.  Sorry if I sound like an ass, but if you've ever sold anything on here before, you understand where I'm coming from.

Last pic below is scan of some 3-shot groups with this rifle @ 100 yds.  1"" circles & grid.  I wouldn't be surprised if a better shooter than I am could do better, but the rifle is clearly under an inch @ 100 yds with the only ammo I used."

172,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2565172,For Sale:  Surgeon Rifles 6.5x47 Lapua Bench Rest 27,"Newark, Delaware, United States","$ 3,200","Listed On: Friday, January 24, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"The cartridge really works great as a 6.5 mm. It shoots the 107-125gr pills with extreme accuracy, and you can easily reach the best accuracy node. Even with the 140s, speeds are good--it gives up very little (if anything) to a 6.5-08 (Rem 260) with the 140s. Overall, I'm more than thrilled with the gun. I wanted to be one of the first to shoot this new caliber, and so far it has exceded my expectations. I believe, potentially, the 6.5x47 can be superior to a 6BR for the 600-yard game, because you can easily shoot high-BC bullets in the 3000-3070 fps range without stressing the brass. Once the brass was prepped and fire-formed, case run-out (measured on bullet ogive) was very low, .001"" or less. The brass appears to be holding up very well when loading the 120s in their preferred velocity range (3000-3100 fps). And at those speeds, RL15 burns pretty clean and the ES/SD is very good. H4350 also shot very well, with very low ES/SD, but you'll probably max out at about 3000 fps with the 120s. If you want to push 'em harder, use a faster powder."

Reduces recoil to about an AR-15. Excellent brake.

No measurements are required for these muzzle brakes. This clamp on muzzle brake for the Mosin Nagant rifle has been precision cnc machined from billet 416 stainless and offers a substantial reduction in felt recoil and muzzle rise. These brakes significantly improve comfort during firing, as well as, allowing for faster follow up shots. This design incorporates a twist lock design that will fit around the front sight. During testing we found that the 5 port design makes the most efficient use of the available gasses exiting the barrel to substantially reduce recoil. There are 20 .078"" holes drilled into the top of the brake that vent gas in order to stop muzzle rise. The bottom of the brakes have no holes or ports to kick up dirt all over the shooter. Having the bottom of the brake angled outward also helps to reduce muzzle rise. As part of our manufacturing process after the muzzle brakes are machined they are finished with a large vibratory tumbler using Ceramic media in order to provide a smooth matte finish. Cerakote coated. No gunsmithing required."

I got two and don't need this one.  The 517 is much better than other versions because the on/off and brightness controls are on the side not the back.  This allows you to mount a sight or magnifier behind it and it is still easy to use.  (Magnifier in Picture NOT included.)

This is a brand new in box EOTech 517 Holographic Weapon Sight with a 1 MOA aiming dot. The 517 was developed to maximize the functionality and utility of EOTech's Holographic system by moving the controls from the back of the unit to the left side, allowing instantaneous access and for magnifiers and BUIS to be mounted more closely. Additionally, the design of the front of the body has been modified to allow the sight to be mounted over many handguards.

The EOTech features a highly ruggedized design favored by agencies who require the best in close quarters battle speed and versatility. It boasts a highly accurate 1 MOA point of aim and a 65 MOA circle to aid in target acquisition. The holographic reticle is parallax free, ensuring the reticle is always on target. With no magnification, this optic provides a virtually unobstructed field of view, with no tunnel vision. The innovative design of this optic also allows two-eye-open aiming, improving critical situational awareness. The body is aluminum, including a highly durable shroud for the reflector. The lens is 1/8"" shatter resistant laminate glass, and has an anti-glare coating. This versatile optic is fogproof and waterproof to 10 feet, and is capable of temperature variations from -40 to 150 degrees fahrenheit when used with high quality lithium AA batteries. Being powered by commonly available AA batteries, it is not subject to supply line or cost issues. Expected battery life is up to 1000 hours, and an auto-shutdown mode is available to preserve battery life. The integral Picatinny rail mount is return to zero repeatable to 1 MOA when removed.

EOTech sights are proudly Made in the USA.

About the Remington Autoloading Model 1100
More than 40 years ago, the Model 1100 forever changed the way American shooters viewed autoloading shotguns. It was the first autoloader to combine the repeat-shot versatility of early-century models with the sleek, modern lines and handling qualities of revered double barrels.

It's been a field-proved favorite ever since. Its superb balance, handling, durability and soft recoil from the gas operated action are the foundation of the Remington autoloading legacy."

OVERVIEW:

The Remington Model 700,™ a rifle with no equal, and a superior performer in every way. Its accuracy and dependability have become the standard by which all other centerfire rifles are measured and continually fall short. Still the most accurate out-of-the-box rifle made, the Model 700 brings its famous action and renowned consistency to this diverse family of guns. All are newly equipped with our externally adjustable X-Mark Pro trigger system.

The Model 700 BDL has been the hunter's favorite for 40 years because its strong, smooth action, consistent accuracy, and classic beauty make it an unequaled value. Its high-gloss American walnut stock is enhanced by a distinctive black fore-end cap, Monte Carlo comb with raised cheekpiece, and generous skipline cut checkering. Metalwork has our rich, deep bluing for beauty and protection. The Model 700 BDL features a hinged magazine floorplate, sling swivel studs, hooded ramp front sight, and adjustable rear sight.

KEY FEATURES:

Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement
Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming “threerings-of-steel” enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength
Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head
X-Mark Pro™ Trigger – featuring super-tight tolerances and mirror-like surface finishes, it breaks like glass and is adjustable for trigger pull weight"

-Gun is the academy sports version (typical pocket .380 style sights rather than the three dots).  Has 150 rounds through it and runs well.  The Remington UMC I ran through it was flawless.  Finish is excellent.  I'm not sure why the pictures look that way, but it has a parkerized black finish.  Comes in factory hard case with manual, lock etc.

-5 magazines!
-New Everyday Holsters brand hybrid IWB holster.  (Crossbreed style)
-Uncle Mike's nylon IWB holster.  Cheap, but gets the job done.  Comfy and secure.
-An excellent, worn once, flashbang bra holster.  This thing is AMAZING at concealing a gun on a woman even in tight clothes!  Best holster for a well-dressed woman, in my opinion.

So just assume it doesn't come with the deal. This is one of those ""seeing whats out there"" kinda deals. I also have a couple hundred rounds of 45 about half and half hp and fmj. that could be worked into the deal as well.

Asking $850 cash but im willing to negotiate, i would be just as happy to sell as i would to trade.
