This near brand new pistol (""BD"" date stamp on left side indicates 2013 build year) is excellent for conceal-carry. Often used by  SOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) personnel the USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

SALES OVER! No longer need to sell to get another firearm.

Compact,  double-action, semi-automatic pistol with a conventional blowback action.  This type of action allows the barrel to remain solidly fixed to the frame, resulting in improved accuracy over pistols with pivoting barrels (like the U.S. M1911 series).  For added convenience, both the frame-mounted thumb safety and the magazine release are ambidextrous.  The bore is chrome plated, which gives it three advantages: longer barrel life, resistance to rust from the use of corrosive ammunition, and ease of cleaning. Another feature of this pistol is the use of polygonal rifling in the barrel bore. This replaces the traditional lands and grooves rifling design with a rounded, smooth polygonal pattern which has a more ""hills and valleys"" appearance.

These guns are painted, not blued, the finish on this gun is greater than 95%.

Extra Magazines are $35.00 each for this gun. These are double stack 12 Round Mags.

$375.00 cash only.

Synthetic stock with stainless fluted barrel.  I just fired less than 20 rds down the tube a week ago for sighting in purposes only.  She shoots great and very accurate out to 100 yards (farthest I could shoot at the range.)  This is very similar to the TC Encore line with many calibers available for additional barrels through Bergara barrels.

It's a great shooting smoke pole and with the stainless setup all the clean up is a breeze! (compared to old flint locks etc which is what I was used to before an inline)  Looking to get 525 for the whole setup but I'm willing to entertain some offers.  I would be very interested in various rifle models (esp Winchester and Browning) in a .300 wsm.  Feel free to shoot me a line with any questions or offers worst I can say is no!  I have pictures available that I can email or text to you if you would like!

Also, please note that this is listed in the ""Rifle"" section as since this can take rifle cartridge barrels and must be sold as such.  I can do face to face transactions with this firearm; however, it must be shipped to an FFL if purchased out of town.

This is the second generation of these guns Lefever made out of NY in the late 20's early 30's before they got bought out. The second generation Nitros have the pistol grip cap you can see pictured. Also it has engraving of a flying duck on either side of the receiver. To my knowledge all the parts are original down to the butt stock.

It is a hunting shotgun that was used by my family to hunt small game in Oregon, rabbit coyote duck, you name it. It has some dings and scratches because its seen some love, but no major cracks or chips, no rust at all. The gun was well maintained and shoots great still, cleaned after every use. It could use an experienced collector to show it some tlc and good home mounted on a wall."

The SAR16 is a 5.56 NATO, standard 16"" barrel, uses standard M4/AR mags and can be configured ambidextrously and easily be converted to other calibers with available kits.  The bullpup configuration is shorter than a SBR (about the length from shoulder to wrist).

Another feature is that the yellow bulls eye can be used without batteries in strong ambient light i.e. sunlight (the Israelis think of everything). Add $1500 for the MOR sight."

I have the perfect setup for you hunters on a budget (like myself!) I'm regretfully selling my nice old Hoyt compound. Basically everything you need to start hunting right away. It is in very good condition and shoots great! Very hard hitting and accurate bow.
It's a ProVantage Rocket in camo, set at 30"" draw, 60# pull, has a good set of sights, detachable quiver, string silencers, peep sight, and counterweight.

It comes with: Soft case, a good release, 3 good shooting 31"" Easton arrows and 2 good slightly shorter JDA arrows, 11 arrows that need refletched (arrows are 2 different lengths, 28"" JDA and 31"" Eastons) Several field points and some broadheads are included as well. Sharpen up them broadheads and go hunting!

This is really a kickass bow setup in spite of it's age. I have had it for a while and it's such a nice shooting bow that I'd really like to keep it, but I could use the money and it's just been collecting dust lately. This bow might be an older model but they are well known for accuracy, and I know from personal experience that it is as accurate and as powerful as my buddy's $400+ Matthews bow, having shot them side by side. Also, it's a Hoyt! Currently it needs nothing and is ready to shoot immediately, but there will always be parts and service available for this bow.

Price is firm and fair in my opinion (I'm not into the haggling thing) but I would love to trade for a good shotgun of similar value, preferably a 12 ga. or 20 ga. but let me know what you have. Not really interested in other trades.

This rugged field or concealment holster is made from 8-9 oz. steer shoulder. It is tightly molded to the gun, and does not require a thumb strap for retention. The gun is positioned so that the back of the trigger guard is exposed, while the trigger remains covered, ensuring a good grip every time you reach for your pistol. This is our most popular and versatile holster. We make it in a variety of barrel lengths to fit your pistol. This design securely holds the revolver with the opposing tension of the offset belt loops. Holster is designed to be carried either strong side or crossdraw.  The hand molding of the holster, to the revolver’s contours also helps to provide retention. This is the holster that Rob carries his pistols in while hunting and fishing.

For deeper concealment & quick on off convenience, get the bolt on “Inside The Waistband Straps.” This allows you to tuck the holster inside your waistband securely. If you already have the Inside /outs you can have us just punch the holes...belt slots are 1 3/4"" (Pancakes will work fine with heavy 1.5"" belts).

This holster is made for medium and large frame revolvers. The Silver Dollar is a scaled down version of this holster for small framed guns.

If you do not see your exact gun model and /or barrel length in the drop down choices, please choose the closest model and type in the exact gun model and barrel length.  There is also a window to add any additional info regarding your firearm.

Delivery dates are now well into next year for models being shipped back currently. DO NOT BUY any XD-S that has not been warranty serviced, or BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK with the knowledge that you will need to complete the process yourself. 

Stock has been taken off the shelf for warranty service, and - as far as I know - new and/or modified stock is scarce, at best.

I have two XD-S pistols, one in each caliber, that have both been warranty serviced and returned. These little guys (or gals) are excellent shooters, but I do prefer my compact XD(M)s more, so if you're in the market for an XD-S that has been serviced already, take a look at my other listings and shoot me an e-mail and maybe we can come to a deal."

The name ""Pug"" may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (""much in little"") in reference to the small and convenient size.

Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1"" heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark.

Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm ""leash"" on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite.

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

Product Information
 Lapua World-class brass begins with high-quality raw materials and superior smelting and metallurgical competence. Throughout the production process, the focus on quality control is consistent with Lapua's exacting standards. Particular attention is paid to hardness, solidity and grain structure. All Lapua brass is tested to 30% overpressure according to Commission Internationale Permanente, the agency that oversees ammunition and component producers in Western Europe. 

Technical Information
Caliber: 6.5 Grendel
Finish: Brass 

New, unprimed brass should always be resized before loading. This brass has undergone factory annealing which extends brass life, as a result of the annealing process the neck portion of the brass may be discolored until the case is cleaned. This is not loaded ammunition.

Lapua brass is now shipped in an instant ammo box: Lapua is now shipping their 100 count boxes of brass in a reusable plastic box that instantly transforms into a 50-round ammo box when emptied. Inside the box on the lid is a grid that contains holes for 50 loaded rounds of ammunition or empty brass. Simply lay the grid across the supports inside the box and it's now converted to an ammo box.

957,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2326957,For Sale:  CUSTOM STIPPLE WORK,"north charlotte derita, Charlotte, North Carolina",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 7, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"HEY GUYS 

We are now Offering custom frame work to the following
*polymer handguns
*magazines 
*knifes
*grips 
*rail covers
If its polymer we can add a custom texture to it!!!! 

The process is called STIPPLING. 
This process is done my melting small devotes, holes , lines etc.. In the polymer this caused the edges of the holes,lines devotes to be raised giving texture.

This is a permanent alternative to grip tape or the grips that slide over the handle. Grip tape eventually wears down and can be an hassle to remove and install new grip tape. It also isn't very eye appealing on some guns especially on FDE or OD green guns at least in our opinion.
Doing this stippling to your weapon will give you flawless manipulation with it. If you think you can manipulate your weapon just fine under any situation try putting a small amount of soap and water on you handgun then try racking the slide or doing speed reloads. Even holding the handgun can become difficult. 
***(EXAMPLES)****

GLOCK 17 $50.00 
S&W M&P 40 (FULL SIZE) $50.00

*WE ARE OPEN TO ALL POLYMER BASED FIREARMS AND MAGS AS WELL AS KNIFE GRIPS AND SHEATHS...BASICALLY ANYTHING POLYMER THAT YOU WANT STIPPLED IT CAN BE DONE 
**************************************************************
We also offer color fill option. This is where I will fill in the engravings on the slide of a handgun with our custom Powder coating gear.
We can also do AR15 etc etc.. If its an engraving we can fill it with color!!!

In some instances the engraving depth isnt enough and won't come out as clean as the others..leaving a thin color rather than a nice bright clear color..
so please send us pictures and we will let you how it will more than likely will turn out. Glock's and M&P's come out great. As do most AR lower receivers

Prices are to be determined by the type of weapon. So please call text or email with any questions...

There are many different ways to do the stippling so please email for a quote 
Thanks we look forward to earning your business 

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING ORDERS OUTSIDE OF OUR GENERAL AREA AT THIS TIME BUT STILL FEEL FREE TO CALL US TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT WITH SOMEONE IN YOUR AREA!!!!

* also as a special thank you for using us for your custom stippling work we invite you to try our color fill option for free (white only) unless we work another deal out
you do not have to accept the offer but it is free with any stipple work (a $20.00+ value!!!!)
