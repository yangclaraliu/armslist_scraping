Accurate Innovations stocked it with a Hand Crafted piece of AAA+++ of super fancy Claro Walnut with a contrasting grip cap and fore end. They also installed there all steel free float chassis system and gave it 8 coats of hand rubbed oil finish. It was then sent to Colt Firearms where a lady who is one of there Master Engravers did the beautiful wrap around Flure de Lure checkering. She also did the hand engraving on the floor plate as well. The stock has amazing figure and fiddle running the full length of the blank. This is Weatherbys horsepower round and will punch holes in 1/4 steel plates at 600 yards. The blank on this gun alone was 1000 and the checkering was 700 so please do your research before you make yourself look like a BUFFON and contact Wes at Accurate Innovations. He will be glad to help you get started in picking out your blank and other options. This rifle also comes with a one of only 200 made NRA limited Edtion slings that were only sold at the Dallas Safari Club Show. 4300 invested. Will sell or trade. Thanks for looking.

ETC ETC ETC

The reasons I believe that he/she/ is a scammer(s)

1. Those listing are from Gunbroker.com. If you copy & paste the titles on gunbroker, the exact same listings come up from TN, AL..etc. 
(For example: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=393061134)
I haven't contacted the seller on gunbroker but I'm 110% sure that they didn't list it. 

2. If you contact the seller on armslist, he will give excuses about not being able to meet & currently at other locations. He is also willing to ship the firearms directly to YOU. But the firearm(s) will never arrive no matter where you arrange them to be shipped since it's just a scam. (The excuse I got: His mother is very sick and he is currently in FL. He will not able to meet but he will arrange a shipment directly to my location if I paid in advance)

3. Obviously not familiar with NJ gun laws and gun laws in general.

4. If you see something that are not NJ compliant and too good to be true, be careful. 

5. Let's always deal FTF with proper paper works. FID, COE and matching state issued ID

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

First imported and marketed in the United States in 1991 by ChinaSports Inc. Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. The NHM-91 was equipped from the factory with two 30-round magazines and a 75-round Chinese drum magazine. Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition. Stocks on the NHM-91 are of a one-piece thumbhole design with integral pistol grip, and are thicker and longer than the standard AKM/AK-47 buttstock. Made by E.C. Bishop or Boyd and constructed from birch wood or hackberry, the NHM-91 buttstock lacks a separate pistol grip, though the rifle may be retrofitted with a separate buttstock by simply cutting off the lower portion of the stock and grip with a band saw, then fitting a new pistol grip. Like its RPK counterpart, the NHM-91 does not come equipped from the factory with a bayonet lug. However, the front of the barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector welded onto the threads. By removing the thread protector, a muzzle brake can be fitted. Factory NHM-91 rifles were manufactured with a rivet in the magazine release button, preventing use of some Soviet or German-made AKM or AK-47 magazines. Instead, special magazines with a modified tang were manufactured by Norinco for the NHM-91. Since the sunset of the 1994 Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, removal of the rivet in the magazine release allows use of any and all AKM, RPK, or AK-47 magazines.

To give you the value breakdown, the rifle is worth $750+, the ammo is a bit over $150, the three extra mags were $75, the extra dust cover was $35, and the hi vis sight is $15 that's a total value of at least $1025 and it would cost you more than that to put this package together today.

This is the 20"" heavy fluted barrel version that is harder to find and really lets the rifle shine for what it is...a long range precision heavy hitter.  FN guarantees Sub-MOA accuracy from these rifles.  The trigger is exceptionally smooth, and the top and forward rails allow mounting of any accessory.  The rifle comes with 20rd mag, as well as all of the additional cheek/stock pieces that can be used to fit the rifle to the shooter.  Being a semi-auto gas driven rifle it runs very clean and has surprisingly low recoil.  Very low round count and in new condition.

It has 3 heavy duty slide out drawers (100lb heavy duty rated rollers) that have places for padlocks on them so you can store your Guns, ammo or valuables without worry. It was custom built for a '03 Nissan Xterra so it should fit in just about any SUV. It no longer has the rubber mat pictured on top but it would be easy to add one if desired. The top 2 drawers are the same size (28""Length X 17""Wide X 7""Deep) and both have a foam rubber thin pad to keep items from being scratched and to keep them from moving while driving. The bottom drawer (28""Length X 37-1/2""Wide X 6""Deep) has 2 full pieces of 1"" thick foam (the same used in a gun case) that are uncut so you can custom cut it to fit you guns and/or accessories in the foam. Or just leave them on top. 

The entire Box size is 30""Length X 41-1/2""Wide X 17-1/2""Deep. Has stainless handles and padlocks. If you purchased one this size new from a manufacture you would pay anywhere between $800 - $2,000 so this is a good deal if you're looking for one. I have around $250 in material invested in it plus the aggravation, I mean ""pleasure"", of designing and building it. It's heavy duty and built to last using high grade pressure treated / water sealed lumber. I sold the xterra and have had it covered in storage since. 

This thing is great for Law Enforcement personal vehicles, preppers or for hunting. Well built, sturdy lockbox. Would work as well in the bed of a truck if bolted or strapped down.

It needs a water pump seal, the carbs cleaned, gas drained, the brake lines bleed out, a front for seal (which I have) and a new battery.  I am confident it will not take much money to get it running, and will do so this summer if I don't sell it.  This would also make a good parts bike if you already have one like it.  

The motorcycle has 35,400 miles on it, and has tires with 3,000 miles on them.

453,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2681453,For Sale:  tandard Pressure Short Barrel Low Flash Heavy .38 Special Ammo - 125gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (900fps/M.E. 225 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 23,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 11, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=112

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings where we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20E utilizes a Jacketed Hollow Point 125 gr. Jacketed hollow nose bullet. This bullet is designed to expand at low speeds and has no problem opening up at considerably less velocity than our advertised 900 fps, from two inch barrels. Penetration in human tissue is roughly 12 inches. Note my test velocities below from real world, ""over the counter"" revolvers - NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 921 fps (235 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 938 fps (244 ft. lbs.)
3. Ruger SP101, 3 inch barrel - 1019 fps (288 ft. lbs.)

This is a really interesting 1911 – made as a competition target gun with a factory-installed, dual-ported compensator and a fully-adjustable Elliason-style rear sight, the pistol has a shortened slide, and this allows the ported pistol to have the same length as a “standard” 1911 pistol, hence, it can also be carried in a standard 1911 holter, and used as a Duty Weapon or for concealed carry, and you have a super-accurate target gun that doubles as a tactical weapon! The pistol features a coated black slide over a stainless receiver and it has Pachmayr Signature grips. The pistol has the aforementioned compensator and rear sight and also oversize takedown lever and safety lever. The pistol comes with the original Springfield Armory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, and with paperwork, but no extra magazines. The pistol has service marks and grip wear, however the bore is shiny with strong rifling and it has a smooth trigger pull, - overall condition is about 90-95%. If you want “2 guns for the price of one” this is your 1911 – a gun that you can use for target shooting and competition, as well as tactical and defense use"

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2681729,"For Sale:  Browning Superposed Pigeon 12 ga 32"" 1967","Maine, Maine, United States","$ 1,400","Listed On: Tuesday, February 11, 2014",Shotguns,Browning                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Over and Under                                                                                ,Shotgun,"An excellent condition Browning Superposed model 12 gauge with 32 inch barrels in the Browning luggage case. S7 suffix serial number, indicating 1967 manufacture.

I see no evidence that the gun was built with salt-cured wood. See the last several photos. There is no rust or sign of stains where the stock meets the action. The stock bolt and recoil pad screws are not rusted. The receiver serial number is stamped in the stock and written on the black stock spacer. I don't know if that's evidence that the stock is the original one or if factory replacements for salt wood were similarly marked. I'm unable to remove the screw through the forened to examine the metal underneath, but see no signs of runs anywhere around the forened.

The gun has been used, but remains in better than excellent condition. The bluing on the barrels is 100% except for a small rub mark from the forend that results from take-down. See photo 26.

The wood is solid, with good finish and no cracks or chips or problems. The checkering is good, with no depressions or wear. There's hardly a mark to be found on the forend. It remains in near new condition. The screw on the left side of the forend shows some wear upon close inspection. It's not major, but I'd just say that the screw slot is not perfect. See photo 38. The buttstock shows some small marks, but no major detractions. The bottom of the pistol grip has a mark that's about 1/4 wide (photo 52). There's a small rough spot on the right side of the trigger guard, right next to the metal and a tiny dent that measures less than 1/8"" across right behind the tang (photo 53). Lastly, to the rear of the top tang, there's five small lines in the wood, actually under the finish, suggesting this escaped notice at the factory. Barely visible in photo 47. You have to hold the stock at the right angle to see this, else you may never notice.

The recoil pad is in good condition, pliable and not heavily worn. It has been off, and the screw holes are visible.

The length of pull is 14 1/4 inches, with an overall length of 49 1/4 inches.

The receiver looks good. I see no scratches, rubs, stains, finish wear, or marks on the receiver. The only external sign of wear is where the safety/barrel selector rubs on the tang, as shown in photos 11 and 12, and to the gold plating on the trigger. The action is clean, feels solid and locks securely.

The bores and chambers are mirror-bright throughout. The upper barrel measures 0.684"" at the muzzle and the lower measures 0.703"" which I believe is extra full and improved/modified choke. The rib is 16 mm / 0.635"" wide. There's an ivory middle bead and large ivory front bead.

The Browning case is made by Hartmann and is in excellent condition. There's few marks on the outside, just some wear to the stitching around the perimeter. The inside is nice and clean overall, just showing some darkening where the breech end of the barrels rests (photo 55). There's one key.

The shotgun weighs about 8 1/4 lbs. The case weighs close to 9 lbs"

The G42 is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable .380GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine 16"" barrel length in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

Here is some additional info from the manufacturer.

The SAM7R

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

I'm listing this as a TRADE ONLY.. I'm not absolutely sure of what I want, but I'm leaning toward another rifle...

This is an Auto Ordnance 1927 A3 22lr Tommy Gun.  It has 2 sets of hand guard wood ( pistol grip shown and carbine style as well)  the A3 has a stick mag and adapter ( I think I have a couple of the stick mags, but memory may be mistaken) the drum is an Authentic Thompson 50 rnd 45 acp drum. It does not function in this A3. It's only used as an aesthetic, since it fits properly.  I do have a PPS 50 rnd drum, which is identical to the 22lr drum that was an option with the A3, but it is not converted yet. (The drum may be available, depending on trade offers). Also included with the drum would be the drum loading tool.
If.you do some research, you'll see where the value is on this item. I'm only entertaining ""good offers"", so please be aware that I'm not going to waste our time and respond to silly offers.

For reference, my interests are in Daewoo's, AKM 's, AR's,  Tavor, Fal's, but not limited to..
I do have an interest in an FN Five Seven pistol, but no others that I can recall at the moment.
