So, I am willing to accept any offers you might have. I also do have another gun (Ruger 10/22 international model) that I could trade as long as you have some cash or items on your end. Im flexible on price and open to all offers.  Im reasonable on value, but Im not going to take a huge hit or dump a bunch of money on something I know I can get substantially cheaper somewhere. Shoot any offers to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal!

I have some excess ammo available for those who could use it.
The 270 comes from some trades and searching for what the new rifle likes.
The 223 is additional ammo I got as part of a package deal.
The 9mm is HP I got early on. I have found I prefer to use 147gr Ranger instead so this is excess.
I am looking to recover what I paid for it, but if you think the price is too high feel free to make a reasonable offer. Also willing to trade, swapping value for value.

The scope features Nikon's Ultra ClearCoat Optical System to provide up to 95% light transmission, 4 inches of constant eye relief and a sturdy 1-piece tube. Another feature of the M223 is the new return to zero turrets which simplify adjustments for different ranges at the range or in the field.

I bought this scope new a little over a year ago. It has seen very little use on a long range AR and is in like new condition. It is very accurate and never had to be re-zeroed after sighting in at 100 yards. This is the Nikoplex reticle with Rapid Action Turret. Once zeroed at 100 yards the elevation can be adjusted out to 600 yards. Also included is a Nikon M-223 mount, Nikon Flip caps, Butler creek flip caps and the Nikon 42mm ARD (anti reflective device). Its in the original box. The scope cost me $449.95 at Midwayusa.com. The mount was $79.95 and the Butler flip caps were $20.00. I will sell all of it for $350.00."

Rifle was a little rough when I got it but with a little work and money I got it looking good. The previous person that had it (I got this thing about 6 years ago on a trade) tried to do his own gunsmithing. They tried to thread the end of the barrel but failed so I installed a muzzle break. The action cover has been ground down and I do know that it is not the stock action cover. This one is much thicker and looks like it had spots to mount a scope. It didn't have a factory mag when I got this thing so instead of fighting for one on ebay I just ordered a 30 round pro mag. The gun fires and ejects the shells great. The bolt sometimes gets hung up on the mag. I've only fired it just a few times maybe 20 rounds. The original stock was pretty much a rotten piece of wood. It was broken in a few places.
Basically I'm listing this thing as $214 for the stock and $135 for the gun.
The Tapco 20 rnd mags are the way to go with the bullpup stock.

I also have a forward grip for it but no rail on the bottom of the stock on the front. can easily be ordered from SGworks.com for around $25.
and about 100 rounds of 7.62X39 ammo.
The gun fires great and ejects the shells just fine with the new stock. Still like I said in the above paragraph that the action gets hung on the mag. I think a little filing will take care of it. I'm just tired of messing with it and want someone else to enjoy working on it and enjoy shooting it."

It's kinda ratty looking, but like most military ammo, it goes bang.  No hangfires in my rifle on the ones that I've fired, but this is mostly 1950's surplus, so no promises.  This is all stuff that I acqured from Sarco years ago when they were selling the last of their .303 ammo.  

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll. 

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Asking $225 but am very reasonable and easy to talk to/deal with. Just please don't insult me
-Also in the first picture (bottom gun) is a sweet little marlin 917vr .17HMR in great condition. It has a nice Nikon bushmaster series 3-9x40mm scope on it. I would love to keep this one because its extremely fun to shoot and extremely accurate out to 100 yards. I actually know a few people that have taken multiple deer using this exact same rifle. That's how accurate they are! (Head shots of course). Just like the .22 above its ideal use is target shooting/squirrel/rabbit/fox and small game of that nature. Asking $400 for it and that's pretty close to where I want to be with it.

It's very light and throws up and shoulders VERY well! You'll probably never have a better bird/small game shotgun than this for the money. It's cycles very well as long as you keep it clean and lubed up you should never have an issue with it. And for its age it's in amazing condition with very nice engravings on both sides. It resembles the Remington 1100 a lot but a good bit lighter and in my opinion it shoulders better. This gun is designed for light loads, I recommend it being used for birds only. Looking for $400 out of it!
-last but defenitely not least is my ""like new"" mossberg 935 magnum waterfowl edition semi auto 12ga chambered in 3"" $ 3 1/2"" only and is designed to withstand heavy loads for ducks/deer etc. it performs very well and I haven't had 1 problem out of it the very few times I've carried it to the duck blind.

This is an awesome, new production, standard barrel Ruger 10/22 with all the best premium accessories you can fit on a rimfire rifle.  The Leupold scope was mounted and bore-sighted locally at Fisherman's Marine to ensure optic accuracy. 

Both the rifle and scope come with lifetime factory warranties and I have receipts for ALL components listed, along with the original boxes and paperwork.  If you're looking for one of the nicer Ruger 10/22's you can find or build, this is it,  all the legwork has been done for you.  I've invested over $1,000, asking $650 OBO, which is more than a fair price seeing as all of the above is NEW, not used or second-hand, and all professionally installed by licensed Oregon gunsmiths.  

Please either text or email for detailed pictures of the rifle, be happy to send them on and guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Every gun enthusiast should own at least one 10/22 in his or her collection, arguably the most popular rifle in the United States, certainly the most popular caliber.  No collection is complete without one, not to mention they're an absolute blast to shoot, especially when done right.   

Thanks for looking!

Its barrel is hammer forged into a one inch equilateral triangle, with its vertices truncated to form 0.410"" joining radii. Measuring at the radii, and Ignoring the flats, there is the same 0.820"" muzzle diameter found on other Remington models like the Sendero or VFS.

Triangular forms are great for stiffening spans and suppressing group dispersing vibration. Truncating the vertices of a triangle and joining the sides with arches further enhances stiffening compared to round, basic triangular or hexagonal forms. The unique shape of the VTR provides  16% greater surface area than a round barrel for improved cooling and the overall metal removal reduces barrel weight by roughly 8%.

""The new Model 700™ VTR™ desert RECON (in Digital Desert camo) features Remington's patent-pending triangular barrel contour that offers reduced weight over traditional heavy barrels, yet delivers optimum heat dissipation and rigidity.

Built on the famous Model 700™ cylindrical action, Remington® Varmint rifles are the most accurate factory-built models we produce. You'll be stunned by the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won't be so lucky!""

Included is the rifle manual, case, and bipod mount.
The rifle has around 200 rounds max fired through it.
The only flaw with this rifle is a paint scratch on the magazine floor plate. Most people would probably replace this part to adapt a removable mag anyhow. It is not a major deal.

Thanks for reading.

Other info: I just bought this Ruger SR45 a couple weeks ago. It is brand new and unused. It includes everything as purchased from retail including the gun, box, 2 magazines, instructions, and lock. Sadly, other things have come up and I need to sell it. It is still brand new in the original packaging. It's never even had either of the 2 magazines pulled from their wells in the case.

Model: Anaconda 

Serial Number: MM57301 

Date of Manufacture: 1990-1999 

Caliber: .44 Special / .44 Magnum 

Action Type: Single and Double Action Revolver With Swing Out Cylinder 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “Colt Anaconda / 44 Magnum”. The right side of the barrel is marked “Double Action Revolver / Colt’s PT. F.A. Mfg. Co. / Hartford, Conn. U.S.A.”. The frame under the arbor and the arbor are marked “MM57301”. The left side of the frame is marked with a “Rampant Colt” logo. The left side of the grip frame at the top of the trigger guard is marked at the front with “V” and at the rear with “5”. 

Barrel Length: 6” 

Sights / Optics: This revolver is mounted with a rear sight adjustable for windage and elevation and a red ramped front sight. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered rubber with finger grooves and Rampant Colt medallions. There are a few minor handling marks. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Stainless Steel 

Finish Originality: All Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no erosion. 

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 95% of its finish. There are light wear marks on the top of the barrel and receiver. There is thinning at the muzzle. The cylinder has a definite drag line and light handling marks. There are also light handling marks on the frame and barrel. The knurling on the ejector rod and serrations on the hammer are very sharp. The Screw heads on the right side of the frame shows slight disfigurement while the screw on the left side is undamaged. The markings are clear and deep. Overall, this revolver rates in about Fine condition. 

Mechanics: The lock-up on this revolver is Extremely tight. The trigger is smooth in double action, and crisp and light in single action. The action functions correctly. We did not fire this revolver. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: This revolver comes in a blue plastic case and includes an Owner’s Manual. The lid of the case is marked “Colt”. The case shows moderate wear on the bottom and light handling marks on the top. The inside of the case is fitted for the pistol and Owner’s Manual, and is in Excellent condition, as is the Owner’s Manual. 

Our Assessment: Colt introduced the Anaconda built on a new, heavy “AA” frame to compete with the Ruger Redhawk and S&W Model 29 revolvers. Our impression is that this revolver probably offers a smoother double action pull than the Ruger and is more rugged than the S&W. This revolver is great for hunting, and for those fishermen who sometimes run across unfriendly brown bears. If you download to .44 Special, it will make plinking enjoyable, and with lead bullets, won’t ruin all the meat on small game."

I also added an ATI aluminum forend with a rail, a Streamlight TLR-1s mounted on the rail, and some grip tape on the forend. The shotgun is very soft shooting, and will eat anything you feed it. Excellent home defense gun. There are a few surface scratches in the finish on the barrel, from use, but no rust and in great shape. I've got over $600 into this gun. 300 for the gun without the light, if you want the light add 50 for a total of 350. Don't ask me to lower the price, I've already lowered it as far as I'm willing to go.
