I will be constructing and installing  all new parts that I will have to customize and document as I build it for my class, so the condition of everything but the frame and or slide are not an issue. The  blueing can be bad and some rust is acceptable as long as the pitting isn't overly deep. I just need one I  can purchase for the right price or I have firearms and ammo I can offer as trade.

Hi Friends,

Up for sale is a Walther PPQ M1 in 9mm. This is the version with the paddle magazine release, and it's totally ambidextrous. Gun comes with original box and accessories (mag loader, lock, manual, factory test target). I will also throw in an extra 15 round magazine, for a total of 3-15 round magazines with the gun.

Original owner said he shot the gun less than 50 round,s and I've put approx. 320 rounds since I've had it. Gun has been cleaned and lubed with froglube.

The trigger on the PPQ is incredible. The gun has been 100% perfect with ball or hollow points (specifically 147 gr Win Ranger and 124 gr gold dots) and is incredibly accurate. The only reason I'm getting rid of it is because I'm focusing strictly on the .45, specifically the M&P. My loss is your gain.

Brand new these sell for $600, and extra factory magazine will run you $40.

My price is $550. That means $550. 

I'm located in Woodbridge; I can meet at the Wal Mart on Liberia Ave in Manassas or anywhere in Woodbridge. I go to Sharpshooters in Lorton on the weekend and can meet there.

For quickest response, text 757-8nine7-five9four9 or email REDACTED 

Pic is what I had in the photobucket, will try to get some better pics up tonight.

I Just had to have it, and now it just sets in the safe. (Really to nice a gun for me and my uses) These models are basically Colts Custom Shop 1911's and have all the modifications that you would want done to your 1911 all done by Colt themselves. (Why buy a new 1911 and then have to modify it was my thinking) 
Features include a forged receiver, a forged steel slide, a forged stainless steel barrel and a forged steel slide stop and Lowered and Flared Ejection Port. 
Front and rear slide serrations, make it much easier to rack the slide 
The 3 dot Novak sights on it are awesome, and make lining up your aim a breeze. 
The Colt Upswept Beavertail Grip Safety with Palm Swell and enhanced cut under the trigger guard allow for a secure hold on the pistol. Ambidextrous Safety allows for either right or left handed user. The addition of a one piece, full length guide rod rounds out a pistol suited perfectly for the match grade shooting enthusiast or the personal defense user. It has an adjustable trigger to set it as heavy or light as you like. Probably forgetting some of it nice features but you get the idea, very nice Pistol.

I am asking $1000.00 for it, which is about $200.00 under cost, plus you won't have to pay tax or do all the paperwork. 
I prefer to sell, but am also a gun junky, and will consider interesting gun trades (no junk please, you are trading for a COLT, not a High Point)

Description from online: If you’re looking for a fun firearm to get your young shooter started with, consider these single-shot rimfire options. Each bolt-action model sports a blued barrel and the added safety feature of being able to shoot only one round at a time. This also teaches beginning shooters to make every shot count. All are lightweight and easy for youngsters to carry at the range and in the woods."

They have been in storage for over 10 years so some of the boxes are a little rough, but the heaters are intact and complete.

Here is some info on it. 
The dynamics of the battlefield are forever changing. With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) R&D developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF; and the TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR®,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR® underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR® began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR® then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR® was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR® rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR® rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world.

IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR® SAR rifle. 

TAVOR® SAR Features Include:
Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy
Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use
Clean, long stroke piston operation
Detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steel

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles with push button swivels
Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

Last round stays open on an empty magazine
All metal parts treated for corrosion resistance
Integral rubber recoil pad

These are used frequently in Varmint and Long Range builds where a lighter 2-Stage trigger really helps accuracy and round placement. These triggers come pre-adjusted by Rock River gunsmiths as a matched pair and drop in all mil-spec lowers with no adjustment necessary for an easy drop-in install. Rock River 2-stage NM pins are .1555 in diameter and are not recommended or designed to be used with .154 pins or .170 Colt lower receivers. .1555 RRA Trigger pins will install in any standard milspec lower receiver without modification but may be noticeably more snug than the .154 pins upon install. This kit includes trigger, trigger spring, trigger pin, disconnector, hammer, hammer spring, and hammer pin. This 2-stage National Match trigger kit is for a lower which already has a lower parts kit installed. This does NOT include any detents, takedown pins, or other parts to complete a stripped lower.

The PC9 is patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. 
The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. 

The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available  as a shoulder weapon if needed. 

P series magazines fit both the PC9 carbine and the P series pistols.

Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol. The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol."

The 692 model comes with an adjustable comb.

Steelium Plus Barrels Inspired by the Steelium Pro barrels of the DT11 and thanks to a conical profile 5.5 times longer than the 682 Gold, the new Steelium Plus barrels give outstanding pattern quality and precision, improved recoil reduction and reduced muzzle raise. The much longer forcing cone is the key to the improvement in the barrel’s overall performance. At the beginning of the Steelium era, all of the competition barrels had a similar conic profile of approximately 2.6” on a 30” barrel. With the development of the new Beretta 692, Steelium Plus defines a new standard for competition shotgun barrels by lengthening the forcing cone to ~14” on a 30” barrel. What are the benefits of a longer forcing cone? Better patterns, less muzzle raise, and faster target acquisition on follow-up for when you have to make the shot.

Wider Receiver The new Beretta 692 features a 1.3mm (1/2”) wider receiver than the 682 Gold, improving handling and control. This wider receiver adds a small amount of weight for better balance, providing more stability and better handling before and after each shot.

Design The wider receiver is also adorned in a technical yet elegant design. Polished metal surfaces pair with matte finish and “black gold” engraving highlight the unmistakable lines of a Beretta Over / Under with an attractive new design. The selectable safety features a two dot selector showing which barrel is ready to fire first, while the ergonomic over molded opening lever combines form and function. The stock (with optional B-FAST adjustable comb) and fore end come in selected oil-finished walnut.

Beretta B-FAST
B-FAST stands for “Beretta Fast Adjustment System Technology”. This modular adjustment system, specifically designed for Beretta, is new to Beretta’s competition shotguns. B-FAST is a group of devices that give the shooter an advantage by allowing them to easily adjust their gun to fit them.
B-FAST Adjustable Balance System
Each Beretta 692 comes balanced from the factory, but the owner can adjust the gun to his or her individual preference or shooting style using only simple tools. This is thanks to a system of removable weights known as “B-FAST Balance”.

comes with two 12-rd mags, manual, box, receipt, cleaning brush, manufacturer tool.

as you can see, there is a clipdraw attached, with extra tape and alcohol swaps. The clipdraw is a very cool metal hook, that tapes to a pistol, and lets someone attach it IWB. To remove, simply peel off the tape. NO residue is left on the gun.

I will assume if you are looking at this you know what the 27-2 is and don't need to explain it's features. It's widely regarded as the finest revolver Smith and Wesson ever made, and collectible. Pistol dates to 1974. There is some bluing loss around the barrel, butt face and an area on the cylinder. Nothing too major for a 40 year old gun. barrel is bright and looks like new, timing and lockup are perfect.  It has been fired very little almost exclusively with 38 Special, just look at the condition of the recoil plate. It is unbelievably accurate and shows the kind of craftsmanship that is not available in today's modern firearms.

FTF transfer or through local dealer if you like. I will not ship the pistol. Must be legal to own firearm and show valid ID. Must be willing to sign bill of sale."

This carbine is chambered in one of the hardest to find calibers in the 1894 series.  The receiver and bbl/tube assy is a mixture of blue mixed with a brownish patina.  The bore is semi shiny with good rifling.  There is no major pitting that I can see, but there is some minor pitting between the rifling.  The wood is well used and scuffed in several places, what you might expect to see on a 111 year old ranch gun.  The mechanics are not perfect, we don't fire our guns, but it does feed the round into the receiver and the feed and function worked fine.  It appears to have the original saddle ring on it, and it retains both the original front and rear sights.  It also retains the original butt plate, and there are no extra holes or alterations.  All in all this is a nice old honest ranch gun in a hard to find caliber.

This simple and reliable pump action bullpup feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward

P938 Equinox

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.
