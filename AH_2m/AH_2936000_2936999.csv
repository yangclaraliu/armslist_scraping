The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

The rifle was sporterrized by a famous company in California called Golden Sate Arms which was one of the first North American arms companies to start commercially sporterizing military surplus arms. They did this through their Santa Fe Division, (Santa Fe California) and not only sporterizing the Schmidt Rubin 1911's but did Enfields, Mausers, Swiss K31s and a few others. This Swiss Model 1911 was converted to .308 caliber. The "".308"" is clearly marked on either the barrel or the side of the rear sight housing. The barrel was shortened to accommodate the re-chambering and the stock sporterized in a professional manner. These rifles are noted for their accuracy and they are!!!  This model was called the ""Alpine Sporter"".  This rifle was been drilled for a side scope mount and these holes were plugged.  I'm pretty sure this one has never had a scope on it.  This rifle is still in wonderful condition.  It will handle .308 factory loads without issue.  I've done a few things to this rifle myself:  I fitted with a very nice decelerator pad, the bolt was highly polished for super smooth operation and the last thing I did was to take the original trigger and have it modified to remove over 1/2"" of creep and the spring pressure reduced to give this trigger a very smooth and crisp 2.75lb pull.  I have a completely stock trigger assembly that will go with the rifle if you don't like a light trigger.  I shot it at targets so I liked a very light and crisp trigger.  If you've never shot a straight pull bolt rifle you're in for a treat.  The Swiss precision of this bolt is evident and you can cycle rounds in the blink of an eye.  This is also a great first starter hunting rifle.  I'm asking $300 for this rifle so it not so expensive that you have to worry about your young one hurting your expensive hunting rifle.

Send me a message for pictures, REDACTED... Cody.

I have three knives that a collector may be interested in.
1) Case XX- Vintage Stag, Double Folding Knife. 
Pattern Number- V5265 SS.
This knife is in really good shape and comes in the original case. 

2) Case XX- Trapper Bone, Double Folding Knife.
Pattern Number- 6254 CV.
This knife is in acceptable shape it could use a little tlc to get it back the way it should be. There is nothing wrong with the handle on it but the chrome vanadium blades are dull they need cleaned up.

3) Puma- 910 Puma Prince, single lock blade. 
Number on blade lock release- 93574.
This knife is in very good condition appearance anyways. The knife has been used before and sharpened a few times but the blade is still perfectly readable and usable, just thought I would let that be known so there is no confusion.

Next is a Vintage Snap on Torque Wrench 1/2 Drive. 
Product Number- Q 3150 FR.

It works perfectly and looks brand new, also it hasn't been used in many years. My grandfather left it to me when he passed away but it's been sitting in the tool box because I use a different torque wrench. 

Next is 13 Arrows, Gold Tip- Ultralight 600 and 6- Easton- Superlite A/C/C, 3-39/440.
Most of the arrows are fully dressed and ready for hunting. 

Lastly I have 3- Muzzy 75Gr. Broadheads and 3- Muzzy 100Gr. Broadheads with at least 3 packs of replacement blades for the 75Gr. and 3 packs of replacement blades for 100Gr. 

I'm not going to put a price on any of this stuff because the prices jump around all the time. So offer what your willing to pay cash wise and also I'm open to firearm trades. Don't try and Low ball me either I do know the round about prices for all of this."

REALLY, YOU ARE GOING TO BE DESPERATE ENOUGH TO PAY THAT??  Let's prove we have a couple brain cells and let these Scammers choke on their BS pricing.  Fair pricing or don't sell, and if you see someone trying to take advantage of people with highly over-priced items please flag them as such. We all need to look after each other, because the only ones stupid enough to way over pay is the ones that aren't legally allowed to own, it might be your family this felon uses his $500 paid Saturday night $80 valued special on,"

First is a 1959-61 manufacture Model 15-1 Combat Masterpiece. Four inch barrel, 38 Special. It has a dash, but it still has four screws if you're a collector and that means anything to you. Its original blue is in almost perfect condition. Only flaw seems to be a small chip to the bottom of its original diamond checked magna grips on one side. Looking for $450 for this one.

Second is a 70s manufacture 28-2 Highway Patrolman. Four inch barrel .357. Has some muzzle wear, some loss of the always fragile case color hardening on the trigger, and a few small blemishes. Definitely a shooter, but quite a decent one. Very smooth action, perfect mechanically, and one of the easiest guns to hit a target with that I own. Comes with a good number of accessories, as you'll see in the picture. Looking for $450 for this one also, with all accessories included.

Third is a 1917 manufacture M1917 in .45 ACP. About 70-80% original blue with a few nicks. Everything original, however, and its 175XX serial number places it early enough to have seen World War 1 service. Looking for $600 for this one. I have a handful of half moon clips also, and I guess they will all come with free ammo since it's such a pain to get the shells back out of the moon clips.

Up for sale, I have a truly special piece of history—Norwegian heavy water fortified 22lr rounds, specially designed and manufactured by the Third Reich, in an attempt to be prepared for the inevitable dropping of an atomic bomb by Allied Forces upon German assets.  Upon dropping of an allied bomb, these rounds could be fired out of any 22lr, and reach a falling bomb at a maximum range of 2200 yards.  The plant these rounds were made in was a high profile target of SAS forces in 1942.  

These rounds were too critical to the war effort to be stored in ammunition dumps or arsenals; rather, they were dispersed amongst trusted SS men, with instructions to carry them loose in the pockets—if discovered any other way, they would be shot on discovery of such improper ammunition storage.  
If you look closely at the rounds, you can still see remnants of Flecktarn fibers, which indicate battlefield service.  Also, some rounds have been somewhat dislodged and the projectiles canted to a 15-20 degree angle, likely due to early war production rounds being subjected to excessive goose-stepping.  

The brass is mainly clean, and has a German counterfeit mark, which makes the ammunition appear to be manufactured by Remington.  This was a clever move on the part of the Germans, as if capture occurred, POWs could hide the ammunition in the ground, or in their rectums upon thorough search.  If found, such ammunition would appear as commonplace, stolen, or found.  I have photocopies of Wehrmacht manuals which dictate these practices.

Some of the brass has a brown-spinach green tarnish on it, but I am sure that is from the age of the ammunition and the patina that comes even with storage in a climate controlled environment.  

I have 40 of these rounds; the cash price would be $100.00 each, but I would consider trade values around 10 cents each.  Looking for ARs, Garands, or Colts if they are not too beat up.  Thanks, and take care.  No Lowballs."

This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.

ArmaLite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50.  The same great accuracy, but now even more Beautiful.
