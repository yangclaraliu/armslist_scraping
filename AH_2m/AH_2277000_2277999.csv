It rotates 360° and has 2 self centering foam padded vises that adjust to any length weapon. The vises ride on opposed sets of rails with a wide range of angular adjustment. This allows an AR-15 upper receiver to pivot away from the lower receiver with both halves firmly secured. The rails supporting the vises can be angled upwards so that any gun, even with a scope can be securely inverted for working on the underside. As a bonus, a “V” notch gun support and padded platform are furnished so that the vise can be used for 3 – 5 shot sighting in or as a shooting rest. The platform can be angled to match the drop at the heel to provide more contact area for the butt stock.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The price on these awesome shotguns keeps going up and the window of opportunity to own one is closing. Importation has already been temporarily halted once, it is just matter of time before these become banned.

The Izhmash Saiga 12ga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov (AK47) design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Models are available with side optic mounting rails, bead front sight, V notch rear sight or leaf rear sight. 

This shotgun has only about 75 rounds down the barrel...practically new in EXCELLENT condition.

This package comes with about 1175 rounds of Ammo...Mostly High brass but some target.2 boxes of double 00 buck.....Hogue grip, modified with a Tapco T6 Pistol Grip Adjustable stock, a 20 Round MD Arms Drum, brand new, 3 brand new 12 round Mags, a slightly used 12 round mag, a 10 round mag, and a brand new 5 round mag...Price is absolutely firm, FTF only, and buyer MUST agree to sign a bill of sale with Driver's License #.

392,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2277392,For Sale:  TOKAREV 54-1 9MM - 199!,"Puyallup - Renton, Washington, United States",$ 199,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 30, 2013",Handguns,Norinco                                                                                ,no type,no type,Pistol,"Tokarev 54-1 9mm - Nice!

One of the nicer Tokarev variants I've seen. This is a Norinco Tokarev model 54-1 in the gray finish. It has a two stage safety, which eliminates the issue that some Tokarev safeties had with inadvertently going into safe while firing. The safety is easily disengaged with the normal flip of the lever, however, to go into safety you have to push in the bottom of the lever at the same time you flip it over to safe. It's the only way the safety will engage.

I picked this Norinco up recently and I don't know much about it, only that it is a model 54-1 in 9mm with the import mark: A.C.C. INT'L/INTRAC, KNOXVILLE, TN 54-1 9mmx19. The grips on the gun were stippled by the guy I bought it from.

The overall condition is good, which can be difficult when picking up a Tokarev or variant. These were basically the 1911s of the Com Bloc and are so simple in design it is amazing! You can take these down faster than a Glock to clean and maintain.

With that said, I know nothing else about this gun. I do not know the round count and I have NOT shot this pistol. I can tell you that it feeds, cycles and ejects properly as tested with both dummy and live rounds.

I want $199 cash money for this very cool Tokarev, but since I'm reducing the price to way below what it's worth, I'm ONLY GOING TO INCLUDE THE GUN, THE BOX AND 1 MAGAZINE AT THAT PRICE. If you want the extra set of brand new Tokarev flat grips and two more brand new magazines that I just got in last night, it will cost you $250 for everything.

ATTN: LOWBALLERS

Please stop trying to offer me these ridiculous low dollar amounts for this gun. ANY FUNCTIONAL MEDIUM TO LARGE FRAMED 9MM PISTOL IS EASILY WORTH $200! Unless it is a Hi-Point of course.

I'm always in the market for some gun stuff so I will trade for the following:

Other 9mm or .380 compacts such as Ruger LC9, Beretta Nano, Kel-Tecs, etc.

I will also trade for a complete AR upper. That's really about all I need in the trade department.

I purchased it over a year ago and put in well over $600 into it (still have receipts). I replaced the throttle cable, clutch cable, air filter, chain, front and rear sprockets, float valve seal, adjusted valves, grip, fork seals as well as all of the plastics. Also recently put in new transmission oil. 

This bike needs absolutely nothing! Starts first or second kick and runs extremely well! Completed oil changes every other ride to ensure this bike was going to run as long as possible because Honda's will run forever with regular maintenance. Comes with a dirt tire as well as a paddle tire. Both in great condition. I will also include the gas can and a stand for the dirt bike. Both wheels are true and good to go. 

When I first purchased the bike it ran a little rough but replaced parts and worked on it before last season and was able to ride all season without an issues at all. Honestly a great bike and I truly stand by that. Come take a look at it and you won't be disappointed.

I'm looking to sell or trade my M1A Loaded (stainless match barrel model), with extras:

-Archangel stock (fully adjustable LOP and cheek height), paid $225 new for it
-VLTOR Full Length (from stripper clip guide to front-end of handguard) top rail/scope mount), paid $150 used for it
-5 or 6 20-round magazines for it (some Check-Point, some are other brands), paid around $140 for all of them together
-Pivoting Bipod, paid $30 new for it
-Scope in pictures is not included (I'd like to keep it)

I traded for it a while back ($1300 value used), but my interests have shifted (see below), so will be going in that direction now. I put less than 100 rounds (60 rounds Federal GMM 168 gr HPBT, 40 rounds American Eagle 150 gr FMJBT) through it, since receiving it. The previous owner painted the barrel camo, but that would be easily removed (it's a thin coat, as I have rubbed some off of the barrel).

-Armalite or Eagle Arms AR-10, DPMS LR308, RR LAR-8, Smith & Wesson M&P-10, Bushmaster .308 (would really like the model that takes FAL mags, as I have dozens of them still); any of these would need to have at least an 18 inch barrel (heavy or bull preferred)
-Armalite AR-30 in .338 Lapua Magnum
-an AR in 6.8 + a .45 or 9mm pistol (please, no HiPoints, Jimanez, Cobra, Davis, Lorcin or anything like those)
-Keltec RFB (18 inch, or the longer barrel model)
-Tavor
-Springfield Armory SAR-8 Tactical (longer barrel model)
-Yugo M76 in 8mm or .30-06
-Steyr AUG

Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. COMES WITH PELICAN CASE, 2 10RD MAGS, THE NON-ILLUMNAITED LEUPOLD MARK 4.5-14X50MM SCOPE WITH BARRETT BORS ON TOP AND ZERO GAP ULTRA HIGH RINGS.
