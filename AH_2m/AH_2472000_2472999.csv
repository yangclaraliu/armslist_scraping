This is a one of a kind Ruger 10/22 with a green/yellow laminated stock. When Ruger started making laminated stocks, they made up a bunch of samples and only chose a select few. This is one of the ones that wasn't chosen.

This is an older style with the aluminum barrel band, trigger guard, trigger, and magazine release. The inside of the receiver is also cast then MILLED as opposed to just cast and called good, so it has a very smooth action. The hammer and sear in these older rifles were also mated for each other making for a really nice trigger. This is a much higher quality rifle than what they make today.

I have been asked a lot of questions on what is SOCOM Black and why did I refinish it. SOCOM Black is a flat black finish that the U.S. Special Operations Command has adopted for their firearms to be finished in. I refinished it because the Kimber was my concealed carry and I wanted the finish to be in SOCOM Black. It has been my loyal concealed carry firearm for two years and have decided to work on another project. 
This Kimber is the perfect concealed carry pistol, 7 rounds plus one in the chamber 45 acp and trough sights so the pistol won't snag on anything while you draw your weapon. The pistol also comes with a factory .45 ACP 7 round magazine and two Chip McCormick Custom 7 round magazines with finger extenders worth ($25 each). Comes with everything from the factory kit. The MSRP on the ULTRA RCP II is $1351.00, and the Crimson Trace Grips MSRP is $339.00. You can see the links I have listed below. Asking $900 obo. 1911 style. I can provide more pictures upon request. The firearm was purchased used from a dealer.

Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting.
The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy.

Gun shows slight wear around area of picatinny mount, but other than that is in great condition.

The Gen. 1 models are not made anymore because the company was sued by Heckler and Koch since the design was so similar to the MP5. The newer Gen. 2 model (aka the GSG-522) has many differences and doesn't accept the same H&K MP5 parts. Magazines between the two generations fit both models, however."

I will sell the rifle with or without the Burris AR-332 red dot scope. I am asking 900 for the rifle with the scope and 700 without. I have over 1400 invested in the rifle so I am pretty firm on the price of the weapon since it is pretty much discounted already. I am not interested in any trades and we would have to meet face to face in the Columbia area. Also not pictured and included is a FDE Magpul vertical grip.

It comes with two magazines and all that was shipped with it from the manufacturer, including the cardboard 'box' that goes over the plastic box from the factory.  From Beretta:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

The pictures are of the actual pistol and NOT stock pictures from the internet.  Just ask if you have any questions.  Here is a chance for you to get a GREAT 9mm pistol of the highest quality for a discount.  As they say, my loss is your gain!  I posted my lowest cash price for the brand new pistol. If it doesn't sell by Christmas, merry Christmas to me!  I'll just keep the little bugger and list a brand new Glock 26 Gen 4 that I haven't even had out of the box!"

The TA31F is the ""dual illumination"" unit with both the fiber optic on top and Tritium for night reticle illumination. As most already know, the ACOG will never need batteries (and can't even take them). There's plenty of life left on the Tritium. It has some cosmetic blemishes, but absolutely nothing that affects performance. It's dead-nuts accurate, and the BDC is spot-on. I've only shot out to 300 meters, but can hit a 12-inch metal target every single time at that distance. The QD allows you to remove and replace the ACOG with zero shift, eliminating any need to re-zero.

I'm offering it only because I just bought a brand new one today with built-in RMR.

I'm equally open to trade or cash, just let me know what you've got. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. 

$650 with original mount, $750 with new QD mount. FTF only, unless you're willing to PayPal or send your trade to me FIRST -- NO EXCEPTIONS (unless I know you already, then... maybe...)

It looks just as if it were new other than the bottom of the skids on the bi-pod which obviously will get the coating rubbed off when used.  Included is a Super Sniper 16x42 mil dot scope, a one piece 30mm mount \ ring configuration with a level built into the top of the back ring.  I have 180 rounds of ammo that is included with this sell.  The recoil of this rifle is less than my .308 and probably not much more than my heavy barreled 22-250.  The rifle is so heavy and the muzzle break so efficient that recoil is no issue.  There is a good bit of concussion when fired so never ever fire such a rifle without good hearing and eye protection.

1 of 200 built in high polish for Detroit police dept this is #111
Detroit purchased these to give as awards and retirement gifts and to my knowledge were the only 686's to come from S&W in high polish instead of the standard matte stainless. This is NOT nickel its is highly polished stainless and will not crack, chip, or discolor. I bought it from the original officer who received it, there is no box/papers. It does however have a Detroit specific sequence number added under the grip. Due to a death in the family and having to travel for the funeral Xmas cash is a little tight. Open to serious offers. Hate to sell but its the only 686 in my collection that isn't sentimental to me. Will meet within a short distance for serious buyers or ship at buyers cost. more pics on request

If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo. 

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip. 

This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower. Everything is here that you need to save you money on parts and shipping costs. Order one today to bring your lower to its fullest potential."

It rotates across the axis of the firearm without snagging allowing “fluid” transitions from dominant to support handed shooting, a critical transfer in fire-fight conditions where the operator approaches left and right pass barriers/shelters. The mount also permits a rapid transfer in the event that the dominant arm is injured, yet the warfighter needs to continue direct engagement.

My shooting tastes have changed and this low round Magpul version of the standard bearer in AR-style rifles is a real treat to shoot.  Includes the pictured Vortex Viper PST 2.5-10 power scope which is a more than worthy addition, along with the PEPR mount.  Vortex scopes are in high demand from returning military because they are such high quality and an excellent value for the money.  Also included are three 25 round Magpul magazines, only the original G2 has been used, I opened the two G3's plastic but the mags were never loaded.  You also get the original box and a Liberty zippered carry case.  There is at most 250 rounds through this weapon.  Folks, I know we all want ""new"", but once you take it out to the range, what does it become?  This is a $2000 package when new (scope was $700 new). Now, you can get ""almost"" new for a lot less!  Taken out to the range less than five times.  I am including 100 rounds of .223 ammo so you can go shoot right away and an unopened Otis cleaning kit.  $1400 is firm.  The gun has the flip up rear sight (first time I shot it, I was standing at 200 yards and put five of eight on paper, three in black just with the iron sights!) so if you do not want the scope, you can have the gun, ammo and extra mags for $1,000.  If you want just the one OEM mag and the tool kit and no ammo, price is $900.  No trades please, unless it's your sister and she is young and nubile.  Thanks."

This process is preferred for improving tribological and surface properties of ferrous components in addition to improving fatigue strength. Salt Bath Nitriding is a non- pollutive bath operating through alkali metal cyanates. The operating temperature of salt bath is 1000° F. - 1075° F., well with in the ferritic phase of ferrous materials, thus allowing the process to be performed on finished parts. During the process both nitrogen and carbon are liberated at the surface of the ferrous component. These nitrogen and carbon atoms form a compound layer at the surface and a deep diffusion zone beneath the surface. The compound layer provides lubricating properties to the surface and are extremely useful in areas where use of conventional lubricants are ineffective. Nitride Heat Treating Eliminates the need for chrome lining on Rifle Barrels. The barrier formed by this process is far better than any chrome lining process. The resulting barrier on   the lining of the barrel at end result is .001 in thickness. Improves accuracy and eases the cleaning process.

The compound zone formed is predominantly epsilon carbonitride having a thickness of about .00015” to .001”. This zone is mainly dependent on carbon and alloy content of the substrate. The more compact the compound zone, the higher the hardness will be. The process can provide a layer with good resistance to scuffing and fatigue. In addition there is a very high concentration of nitrogen compound and diffusion zones even after a short treatment time. The epsilon nitride   at the surface offers resistance to two forms of wear. The treated components resist adhesive wear as the scuffing or “picking up” is suppressed. They also provide some resistance to abrasive wear. Treated components get increased fatigue strength,  since higher Nitriding potential gives a greater diffusion zone. The hardness that can be obtained in the treatment depends on the presence of alloying elements as well as core hardness of the component. The presence of small amounts of porosity at the surface increases the scoring and seizure resistance. The process by nature is non-pollutive and all ferrous materials can be treated with minimum distortion and virtually no effect on core properties. Treated components have greater resistance to corrosion as well as cavitational erosion.  Corrosion resistance is greatly increased due to the Oxidation of the process. This also produces a cosmetically appealing matte black finish."
