83,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2357083,For Sale/Trade:  1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4x4 Orvis Addition,"West Ashley, Charleston, South Carolina","$ 3,500","Listed On: Wednesday, November 20, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee as I am in need of consolidating vehicles. The vehicle runs and drives great for its age! Cosmetically the exterior has dents, dings, scratches, and few rust spots in areas that are not noticeable from the exterior but that is to be expected in a 16yr old vehicle. It currently has 125xxxK miles on it. The vehicle was purchased new by my father up until a few years ago when I then purchased it from him, so I do have most of the maintenance records for the vehicle. Tires all have good tread on them with Michelin LTXs in the rear and Kelly Safari's in the front (all four tires probably have 80-90% tread left, with the Kellys being purchased recently). The interior on this jeep is in good shape, with minimal blemishes, and overall for its age is very clean!

Again this is a 16yr old vehicle, so it isn't a new 50k dollar luxury jeep. That being said its a mechanically sound vehicle that would be perfect for a first vehicle, hunting jeep, or kick around vehicle when you need it. Having dealt with craigslist issues/crazy people before, I will say that I won't tolerate scams, bs, extreme bs haggling, or other crap. I'm not selling this vehicle because I need to but rather I just don't need the extra vehicle. I might consider a trade for a good running Hunting/Utility ATV but thats about it. I'm asking $3500 for the vehicle so if I were to consider the trade, the ATV must be in the same price range. I work odd hours but I am available and reasonable for meeting to view the vehicle if given advance notice. My number is 843-6zero9-85zero1 and feel free to call or text anytime. If I don't answer please leave a msg and I will try to get back to you ASAP. Also I except cash or certified checks only."

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.


Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.


Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.


When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.


Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics."

Aircraft door with nose art. 

This is NOT a re-creation. It's from an actual, crashed aircraft.

Items of this nature are very hard to find. If they survived a crash, they are usually exquisitely hard to remove intact. This one is completely contained on the cargo door of the  Lockheed. It survived the pictured crash with just a bottom dent - which adds immeasurably to its character.  Color levels are a bit off in this photo. The greenish-looking lettering is actually a vibrant yellow and the aluminum background metal has a clean, high-level shine. 

The picture depicts a cigar-chomping, Stinger-forward - Wasp. He's holding a Tommy Gun under his arm, and a pair of binocs in his other hand.

Impressive, colorful and ready to hang. It retains it's full T-shape door handle and hinge plates, and both were professionally finished on it's backside. Size is about 3 feet X 3 1/2 feet and about four-to-five inches thick (hollow-frame / aluminum structure).

For home rec-room, office, man-cave or business accent piece. It's very lightweight for what it is, and easily transportable. You could hang it with just one good-size nail. There are no sharp edges as the door was made with both rolled-edges and finished ones all around.

You will get the exact item shown. 

An un-beatable conversation piece.

In case you are unfamiliar, it means that it has an extended tube for 7+1 capacity, heat shield, full stock AND pistol grip. (Photo shows it in pistol grip configuration.)
This Mossberg is continually used by police and military, as well as individuals for home defense. VERY durable and reliable. The higher capacity is great because you can't lengthen the tubes of a regular 5+1 Mossberg 500. 
Contact me with any questions. If you have done your homework, you are probably already trying to decide between the Mossberg 500 and the Remington 870. The perks of the Mossberg are its lighter weight, the fact that it is battle proven and the ambi-safety located on the top of the receiver. There is no better shotgun to trust your life with.

This is a ready to shoot package. A perfect gift with the holidays coming up. 
The rifle only has about 200 rounds through it. Which is not even close to being broken in. 
I was going to put a collapsible stock on it but I thought I would offer it up for sale before that in case someone likes the fixed A2 stock.
1200 obo for everything. 
The only trades I'm looking for is a nice Henry Golden Boy 22lr + cash. A nice 22lr revolver + cash or a nice AR pistol I can turn into a sbr. 
But cash is king in this world so.....
Any questions or trade requests just ask.
Thanks for looking and have a great Thanksgiving and a Merry Christmas."

A 6″ Tactical pistol in 10mm, STI International’s 2011­­® technology gives the STI Perfect 10™ more fire power advantage than 1911 tactical pistols. Combining this advantage with less felt recoil and other popular 2011® features, the STI Perfect 10™ is a superior pistol for all tactical applications.

Built on the STI Modular Steel 2011® frame with polymer grip (the essential patented design element for high capacity) the STI Perfect 10™ delivers the added benefit of high capacity magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip. The STI Perfect 10™ is well suited for multiple applications; ranging from police and SWAT teams requiring a firearm with a light rail and high capacity, to the individual demanding a high performance pistol with special features for hunting. The tactical rail milled into the dust cover of the frame accepts all industry standard light mounts.

The STI Perfect 10™ has front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight, and STI adjustable rear sight. The STI Perfect 10™ comes standard with features such as an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel, an STI two piece guide rod system, an STI aluminum magwell, an STI hi-ride grip safety, and STI ambi thumb safeties."

One sold, only one left. These are No longer available from European American Armory.

EAA Custom Shop special ordered slide stop release pin / lever for EAA Witness, Tanfoglio, CZ full size clones, F.A.B 92 and other similar firearms with full size frames. I special ordered one of these hard-to-get pins for my competition EAA Witness .45. which you can see and read about here:
http://www.thefirearmsforum.com/showthread.php?t=90599
Now I wouldn't have a CZ style gun without this pin. I had two other full size EAA Witnesses that I special ordered another two for, but sold the guns before I installed them so I'm making them available for anyone interested in customizing their CZ style firearm. You'll have a slide release that is easily released with the right hand thumb with no difficulty at all. Makes target acquisition time faster and just makes using the slide release a pleasure and not a pain. 

The current EAA Witness slide stop pin is much too short and has no grip in my opinion. This pin solves that problem. It's very well worth the price for the ease of use it provides- believe me! As noted above, I sold one Monday Dec 2nd, and only have one left. Will ship USPS first class certified mail. (Cost or this is 3.00). Pn cost me more than selling price and they are no longer available from EAA. Serious inquiries (buyers in other words), will be provided with my phone number and Ebay ID showing close to 300 transactions 100% positive feedback. Buy in confidence! Priority mail available for $3.85 over pin price for faster delivery (although holiday mail may still be delayed)."

I bought my Nova as a combo with both barrels new from gander mountain. This barrel only has about 25 rounds through it. Just sighted it in and shot two rounds while hunting and killed a small whitetail buck. Selling it to upgrade to a browning A-bolt slug gun I've had my eyes on. It has a Swift 1.5-4.54 x 32 scope on it now that works great. It was $225 new and comes with a manufacturer's lifetime warranty. I will sell it with the barrel or just the barrel alone also. Asking $450 OBO with the scope and rings and $275 OBO for just the barrel. The only markings on the barrel are Made in USA and 3 inch chambered on the barrel. I asked a friend at my local gun shop why it said made in USA as it was bought as a Benelli combo and he said Benelli made some barrels in the US and also contracted with Ithaca to make some. It does not say a company on the barrel tho. I will ship and work that out if done through paypal or cash in person.

 While the new OPTIMA V2 shares the name of its popular predecessor, the “Version 2” gun has a completely different design in many ways. Modeled after CVA’s top-of-the-line ACCURA V2, the OPTIMA V2 features the same trigger-guard actuated breeching lever, internal parts, and “neutral center-of-gravity” trigger. Add in CVA’s Quick Release Breech Plug (which is finger removable without any tool what-so-ever), 100% ambidextrous stock, and CrushZone recoil pad, and you’ve got a gun with more quality features than any other muzzleloading rifle in its price range. Equipped with a 26” 416 grade stainless steel barrel, the OPTIMA V2 is easy to maneuver in the tree stand and comfortable to carry in the mountains. And it comes standard with a DuraSight® DEAD-ON™ one-piece scope mount and CVA’s solid aluminum PalmSaver Ramrod.

Comes with all the original stuff: shotgun, case, manual, cable lock, survival kit in a can.

I wanted a shotgun but after buying this one I really don't like how the mag tube isn't flush with barrel look. The case is air tight and according to Mossberg it will float.

Email me for inquiry, I am in Marietta area near the mall we can meet up and do a Face to Face purchase. Prefer cash, not really looking to trade but doesn't hurt to put possible trade option on the table.

To many Americans, there is only one caliber for a personal defense handgun
and that's the .45 auto. Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the
development of the Glock 21. To those who believe that personal defense
starts with the numbers ""4"" and ""5"" (and in that order) the Glock Model 21
has been the answer to their prayers.

GLOCK INC Generation 4
Glock PG2150203 G21 Generation 4 45 ACP 4.60"" 13+1w/FS Poly Grip Blk
To many Americans, there is only one caliber for a personal defense handgun
and that's the .45 auto. Glock acknowledged that sentiment with the
development of the Glock 21. To those who believe that personal defense
starts with the numbers ""4"" and ""5"" (and in that order) the Glock Model 21
has been the answer to their prayers.

Manufactured in 1986 by Beretta for Fabrique Nationale Herstal and imported to the U.S and sold under the FNH owned name of Browning Arms Company.

First produced in 1977 and discontinued in 1997. Resurrected I believe in 2000 and produced possibly through 2009 with most being in a bright nickel finish. The newest production years is only a guess and based on the fact I have owned several with two that had serial number date codes of 2000 and 2009.

This BDA .380's bright blued finish is virtually flawless and looks as new as the day it was manufactured. Comes in the original Styrofoam box with factory outer box numbered to pistol. Also has two original 13 round magazines along with a factory supplied bore brush as well as the owners manual.

If you are a collector of Browning firearms and wish to have a pristine addition to the stable, this is it.

Offered at $725.00 /No trades at this time. Private party sale, no sales tax or transfer fee.

RUGER & COMPANY INC          Over/Under    
Ruger 4191 Red Label Over/Under 12ga 28"" 3"" Walnut Stock SS Rec/Blued Barrel
Ruger's Red Label Shotgun has returned with its world-renowned rugged
construction, handsome American styling and brings refined inner workings,
a redesigned center of gravity and reduced recoil, making it lively in the
hand and even more pleasurable to shoot. It is perfect for hunting upland
game, waterfowling, sporting clays, skeet or even just informal clay target
shooting. The precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged
barrel is made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel featuring a 2""
forcing cone and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more
uniform patterns. It has a 1/4"" dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib
with brass bead front sight and is stress-relieved, contour-grounded,
precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished
monoblock. The finely polished, stainless steel receiver is
corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws. The Red Label is set
off with a beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American walnut stock
featuring a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless
steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr buttpad is mounted on the 14.5"" length
of pull stock. It comes with five steel-shot compatible, screw-in Briley
chokes, featuring two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one
improved cylinder choke, plus a premium-quality Briley choke tube wrench.
Built by American workers in American factories, the Ruger Red Label
shotgun is another 100% American-made product from Ruger.

The title and the pictures say it all … cool old gun in great shape, with a great patina in the wood … needs a new home.  

I rescued this from an estate sale but really have no use for it.  I have never fired it (it still has the auction sticker on it) but I have looked at it and would fire it myself, if I needed one.   Clearly any buyer should check this out for themselves and/or have a gunsmith inspect it, but it seems OK to me.  I have a gunsmith that will inspect weapons for $25, if you want his contact details.  Search words:  Kid's, short, shot guy, antique, 410, wood, stock.

Power, pure and simple. 

Barrett Model 99 

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again. 

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. 

The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. 

Model 99 in action 

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. 

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on. 



Mounted NightForce 8-32×56mm NXS Scope: 

Since 1992, Nightforce has been a winner in countless benchrest competitions. We have taken that knowledge and success and combined it with the durability and features of our NXS line to create the ultimate long-range field and target riflescopes. Evolved from our tactical line, the 8-32 x 56 offers fast adjustments for precise, repeatable shot placement. The broad magnification range means there is now virtually no target outside the capable shooter’s reach, while it remains highly versatile and appropriate to a wide variety of applications. 

NP-R1 Reticle: 1 MOA elevation spacing and 2 MOA windage spacing are ideal for precision long range shooting, benchrest and all-around use. The fine reticle subtensions are effective for rangefinding objects of various sizes. NP-R1 reticles in Nightforce 5.5-22x, 8-32x and 12-42x NXS models show 20 MOA scale below centerline (at left). In the 3.5-15x, an additional 10 MOA scale below center is indicated on the reticle.

Today, I shot 100 rds. of .45 ACP FMJ Feds through my new ULTRA CDP II I trad WOW!! what a handgun with no malfuntions. I am extremely pleased with this weapon. I shot the bullseye out of the paper; much more accurate than the Colt Defender I used to own. I don't have my CCW renewed yet but wore it concealed around the house the first day I got it and it proved light and quite comfortable with the melt Kimber did as a standard feature. The Colt Defender runs around $1150 now days and this gun at 1,100 has so many more features.

Not a scratch on her, feeds and extracts like a champ both .223 & 5.56.  Gunblast DOT c o m sums this rifle up best:

""The SU-16 has a few unique features that set it apart from the AR-15 style rifles available. Most notable is the light weight of the Kel-Tec, which is just five pounds and one ounce, without magazine. In use, the SU-16 feels even lighter. Another unique feature of the SU-16 is its folding buttstock, which , with the removal of one pin, folds up neatly underneath the barrel and receiver, reducing the overall length from thirty-seven and one half inches down to only twenty-six and one quarter inches for easier storage. In this position, the trigger and hammer are disconnected from the receiver, rendering the weapon incapable of firing until the buttstock is returned to its proper position. The buttstock on the SU-16 also has storage for two loaded magazines, in addition to the one locked into the magazine well. While the rifle is shipped with two ten-round plastic magazines, the SU-16 can also use readily available twenty or thirty round M-16/AR-15 magazines.

The synthetic fore arm on the SU-16 is a two-piece design which, when deployed from its locked position, makes into a handy little bipod for increased stability when firing from a benched or prone position. I at first thought this to be a frivolous feature, but it has proven to be quite useful in the field. The operating handle on the right side of the weapon reciprocates with the bolt upon firing, and therefore provides a built-in forward assist mechanism to aid in the chambering of a stubborn cartridge, if one so chooses.

The bolt head is of the rotating AR-15 style, and the bolt locks open when the magazine is empty. The magazine release is in the same position as on the AR-15/M-16 family of weapons. The gas system on the SU-16 uses a piston to actuate the bolt, and is of a simple and rugged design, much like the system on the AK-47 family of weapons.

The trigger pull on the sample SU-16 measured five pounds and three ounces, and was without any excess creep or overtravel. The rifle wears an aperture rear sight and a highly visible but well-protected fiber-optic type front sight, that is rudimentarily adjustable. The eighteen and one-half inch barrel measures three-quarters of an inch underneath the hand guard, then steps down abruptly to five-eighths of an inch just in front of the gas block, tapering to just over one-half of an inch just behind the front sight. The barrel is rifled one turn in nine inches.""

Yes you read that right...FIVE POUNDS in weight (my AR's feel like a boat anchor now when I take them out), AND the fact that it easily folds under:

 ""with the removal of one pin, folds up neatly underneath the barrel and receiver, reducing the overall length from thirty-seven and one half inches down to only twenty-six and one quarter inches for easier storage""

Makes it the PERFECT backpack rifle....with a nice little amount of firepower!  ACCEPTS AR-15 PMAG's!! They fit like a glove!  I wanted to DESPERATELY try and hang onto this rifle being that it took over 6 months before I was able to finally get my hands on one.  As noted in the title, I searched (using various different plays on the search terms in an attempt to cover as many bases as I could) Armslist immediately prior to posting this ad and found NO SU-16's CURRENTLY FOR SALE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA.  Folks that have 'em are hanging onto them for good reason apparently (just as with the SUB-2000, another that I have been trying to get my hands on).

Reason for selling:  Simple.  I am a retired US Navy Chief and have decided to do the RV living across the US thing and am going from a 1500 sq ft 3 bedroom house into a 30 ft motor home.  Having room/space will become a luxury, simple as that and I have too much invested in my other rifles, so unfortunately this one landed on the chopping block :-/

Asking $1000 O.B.O and am willing to entertain PARTIAL trades (preferably handguns obviously in 9mm, .22LR and .45 ACP only) that have been as equally well cared for as what I am offering in trade. Not interested in abused guns please. Please feel free to make an offer as I am NOT an asshole and will POLITELY accept, or refuse depending. Prefer a WIN/WIN always.

Thank you for making it this far in my somewhat long posting, I felt this offering deserved it as it truly is a beautiful and very innovative firearm.  Hopefully the pics do it some justice.

The HD means that the gun's slide AND the frame are BOTH made from Stainless Steel....

Then, the Stainless Steel is ""Kimpro"" coated matte black and it makes for a very smooth looking-satiny finish. The all-stainless steel construction makes this a very strong gun while still remaining a very comfortable size and weight to carry.

The Super Carry Pro HD has had a ""Carry Melt""....de-horning treatment given to it that removes all the guns sharp edges, especially around the muzzle.

I will meet you at the Blacksburg shooting range if you would like to test fire any of my listed firearms. May consider meetings at local ""gun friendly"" businesses, like a gun shop. I will not meet you at my home or yours, unfortunately there are some folks out there wanting to do harm and we do not have the time to ""get to know"" one another. Hate to do this but you will need to provide your own ammo for test fires. Seems that folks like to make me drag all my guns out, haul them to the range, shoot up my ammo and then not buy anything. Ammo and gas ain't cheap so do not waste my time.

Here we have a very nice 1966 double barrel 12ga shotgun that was built in Spain by Fabrica de Armes and imported by Davidson Arms of Greensboro NC as the model 63B. This shotgun features 28"" barrels choked full/mod, 2.75"" chambers, boxlock hammerless firing mechanism, dual triggers, nickel plated receiver, beautiful walnut stock and very good blue. When opening the breech the firing mechanism ""cocks"" and the safety automatically engages. The action locks tight, the safety has a solid engagement and the shotgun functions as it should. This guns seems to have very little use going by how tight everything fits.

Issues included:
One small ding in right hand barrel
