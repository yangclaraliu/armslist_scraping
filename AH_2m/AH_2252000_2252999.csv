 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

GSG REBEL AK-47 RIA 22LR 16.5"" WOOD STK 2/24RD SPECIAL EDITIONSKUGERG2224AK47RThe .22lr AK-47 manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber âknock-offâ of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, and the look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection.

I have two new AR-15's both never fired with Lifetime Warranties in a completely mil-spec configuration except for the civilian legal 16"" barrel length and commercial buffer tubes which is better to accessorize. The Core-15 has Magpul Flip up Sights and the Wyndham AR has detachable carry handle which I'm willing to swap on either gun.

My price is for one and is firm, it beats the local Walmart price by $50 not including the taxes Walmart has to charge you so really you are saving nearly $100 over Walmart price for top quality well researched AR's. Do your own research on these, you will see they are among the best build quality and they are warrantied forever. These are both chambered for 5.56 and shoot .223 just as accurately.

Streamlight TLR-4 Compact Handgun Laser Sight Flashlight Product Info
The Streamlight TLR-4 Compact Laser Sight Tactical Flashlight is an ultra-compact and lightweight weapon accessory that will vastly improve the accuracy of your handgun, day orimage night. The Stream Light TLR 4 Flashlight/Laser Sight is a dual purpose Streamlight flashlight that utilizes a powerful C4 LED bulb to project a concentrated, 110 lumen beam from underneath the barrel of your handgun. The textured parabolic reflector of the weapon light results in a tight beam shape with enough peripheral illumination to keep your bearings. In addition to the flashlight, the Stream Light TLR4 Handgun Rail-Mounted Flashlight with Laser Sight is equipped with a 640-660nm red laser, giving you precision long-range accuracy with your pistol in any light. The Streamlight TLR-4 Compact Laser Sight Tactical C4 LED Light is designed with an ambidextrous On-Off switch and a three-position Mode Selector switch, allowing you to activate the laser, flashlight, or both at once in a momentary-on or constant-on mode. The one-handed installation interface allows you to adjust or install the laser sight without putting your hands in front of the muzzle. What's more, the Stream Light laser sight can last for up to 11 hours using one (1) CR2 lithium battery, and the flashlight can run for up to 1.5 hours without needing a battery change. Enhance your pistol with the dead-on accuracy and bright illumination of the Stream-Light TLR 4 Tactical Handgun Laser Flashlight.

I just got it back from DDR, sent it in to have the Maxx Glide bearing system installed. This is a very beefie balisong, if you're looking for a flipper or trick knife this might not be for you as it's pretty hefty for flipping. But if you want a heavy duty balisong for using this is it. This is also one of the few balis I've seen that could effectively be used as a kubaton when closed. There is a small blemish on the blade that came from the factory, a small grind mark. There are some scratches on the bottom of the safe handle from the latch. I have a cpuple spare pivots and a spare latch body I will include with the knife. I paid $180 for the knife and $65 to have the Maxx Glide installed. My price is a steal for a quality balisong."

She stacks rounds very well at 100 yards.  She loves to shoot Remington Core-Lokt in 180 gr. ($18 per box at Bi-Mart limit 5 boxes per person)

The bluing on this gun is better than I have seen on any other 1903 Springfield.  The bolt is polished. New Timney trigger, set well out of the box but its adjustable.  I will provide the original trigger as well.  The safety works great.  The empty round/bolt release works perfect.  Free floating barrel on a new laminated sporterized stock from Boyd's.  Rifle sling and NEW matte finish, Burris long eye relief, 4.5x14x42mm scope. Ballistic Plex reticle.

I love this gun and there is only one reason I am selling it.  I am a Sako fan and there is a Sako .300 win mag that has become available.  I have had my eye on the Sako for over 8 years and now I can get it.  I am selling a few items in order to obtain it. Im also selling a Smith and Wesson 9mm

If you don't want the scope on this rifle I will keep it and you can take 300 off the price. It will go nice on the Sako.   I am firm on my price, and I will not trade.

The rifle comes with the boxes of shells you see in the pictures.  The Core-Lokt are the ones to shoot in the rifle.  She may like other brands of heavier bullets but she doesn't like the 150 gr in these Federal or the Remington Sonics.  I think a 1"" group at 100yards is damn good for a 100 year old gun.  You cant find good steel like this anymore.

When i bought the gun it was in pretty rough shape, and would not feed properly. So i decided to break it down and rebuild it, giving it a good cleaning and lube. This gun was in horrible aesthetic shape when i got it. I stripped the paint off the upper with the idea of refinishing the upper. The furniture had been stripped, sanded and refinished with a reddish mahogany stain. Mechanically the gun functions very well, after rebuild i put over 350 rounds through the gun with not a single failure to feed. (I believe it was just dirty/dry when i received it) Unfortunately I recently got hurt at work and bills are due soon, so I have to sell. If you enjoy working on guns this is a fantastic project gun, it will be a beautiful gun with a little bit of elbow grease. If you have any questions please contact me. 719.3.60.76_13.

It's spent most of it's time in my gun safe. It's the largest metal frame Kahr, which is very comfortable to shoot and very accurate as well with a super smooth double action only trigger pull.

This is a current all stainless steel model manufactured in very small production numbers by Kahr. These are very hard to find and sought after. (Currently there are NO T9's on Armslist nation wide or Gunbroker) This pistol is an older model, manufactured in 2002 with it's original, no longer produced adjustable MMC sights. Included with the pistol will be an aftermarket hard case, (2) 8rd magazines, new (extra) guide rod and Wolf springs that have not been used. 

I'm not needing to part with it, but figured since I really don't shoot it, I'd entertain offers of cash and/or a different quality pistol. Feel free to send me an email with a phone number and I'll respond promptly. 

Must be a Wisconsin resident and willing to sign a bill of sale. I have a Wisconsin CCL that I'm happy to show you for your peace of mind as well. Thanks!"

I think this is a great entry level defense hand gun.  It is not very loud and does not kick hard at all.  I think it would be a great woman's gun and its not to small so a guy can carry and shoot it.  I don't think you need a large .40, .45 or a 10mm for defense.  

Why am I selling it?  I am more of a long range hunting rifle guy.  I have had my eye on a Sako .300 win mag for 8 years, that is now available.  I am selling a few guns to get the Sako.
