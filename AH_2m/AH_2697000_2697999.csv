The M&P15T (the ""T"" stands for Tactical) is Smith & Wesson's most expensive and best optioned model in their AR15 model range. The barrel is free-floated for great accuracy, and chrome-lined for great durability and long life. The Eotech holographic weapon sight alone costs about $500, is compatible with night vision devices, and is simply the best weapon optic on the market today. The Surefire M951 weapon mounted light system costs about $400. It has a pressure switch pad that fits into the Tango Down vertical fore grip, so a squeeze of the grip turns the light, with it's blinding 150 lumens, on.

It was involved in an unfortunate life changing experience, that's why id like to get rid of it. Nothing illegal. It shoots great I've put about 1500 rounds through it and finally had 1 malfunction that could have very well been ammo related. It is basically a copy of a CZ that the Turkish manufacture for their military. This is the Turkish militaries side arm. 

Double action single action trigger
14+1 capacity
all steel, this things a bit heavy fully loaded.
Has a super sweet simple loaded chamber indicator, just a sight hole at the top of the chamber.
Has a light/laser/bayonet/blender/whatever  rail.
Has nice sturdy adjustable sights like you get on a tactical/combat 1911. They aren't tritium though.

The finish is in real good shape as far as bluing, but it is missing a grip screw that you wont be able to get locally. You would have to order it online from a metric hardware place. Even with the grip screw missing the grip is still rock solid and I've been shooting it like that no problem.

I don't have a working camera so this picture is of one off the internet, not my pistol.

I'm interested in trades too, it doesn't hurt to ask. Dirt bikes, 4 wheelers, guns, ammo, fun stuff like that. Really need another 45acp pistol though.

The FNS™-9 pistol features a pre-loaded striker mechanism and a manual safety, hence combining fast and accurate shooting and optimal safety.

Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS™-9 results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.

Fast and Accurate Shooting


The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

The FNS™-9 has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.


The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy.

Maximized Safety Systems

In addition to the manual safety, the FNS™-9 features Four Major Safeties:

Trigger Safety
Firing Pin Safety
Drop Safety
Out-of-Battery Safety
1. Trigger Safety

The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a presure on the trigger.
The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.


2. Firing Pin Safety

The firing pin safety prevents the striker from passing.
The firing pin safety is lifted out the way when the trigger is pulled.

 3. Drop Safety

Part of the fire control housing prevents the sear from rotating down to release the stricker unless the trigger is pulled.

 4. Out-of-Battery Safety

When the slide is not fully forwards the sear cannot release the stricker even if the trigger is pulled.

Enhanced Ergonomics

The FNS™-9 pistol comes standard with a large number of ergonomic features such as:
- Ultra nonslip checkered grips for better prehension
- Front serrations for easy press check
- Three interchangeable backstrap inserts quickly adapt to the pistol to the shooter's hand size.


For Right- and Left-Handers

All operating controls are fully ambidextrous:
- Slide stop
- Magazine catch
- Manual safety


Durability and Unequalled Reliability

The pistol features a 4'' hammer-forged stainless steel barrel and ultra-hard coating on stainless steel slide and barrel.

The high quality material is fully tested and fired under severe conditions prior to dispatch.

The pistol accepts all military and law enforcement duty ammunition."

I'm good friends with the blacksmith and I order these just so I can sell them down here in TN and help out his business. All are hand forged and a few of these you can see on his website here http://ehknifeco.com/example-photos.html They all come with hand crafted leather cases that he also makes. Each knife has the price listed on the main picture. 

1. $120 - Polished blade with fish gills hammered in. This is a great little knife with a wooden handle and brass bolster (guard). The blade is 3.5"" long and the sheath is form fitting with a belt loop attachment cut into it.

2. $175 - Sharp part of the blade is polished but the rest is left rough forged. The blade is 5.5"" long. Wooden handle for the first half then antler shaped at the end with a brass spacer in between. Brass bolster and guard. blade is super thick and extremely rugged. Sheath is leather with separated belt loop and button snap for securing the knife in place. 

3. $220 - Damascus forged 6.5"" blade. I'm not going to pretend to know the complexities behind making this type of blade but if you want to know, Henry at the website above can explain it to you. What I do know is that this type of process results in a much stronger blade. This one in particular is a nice curved blade with an all antler handle. The handle is smoothed and finished off with Teak oil. The sheath is nice with a belt loop cut into it. 

Call, text, or email if you're interested. I'll knock off $10 if you buy any two and $20 off if you buy all three. I'm located in Clarksville between Trenton and Peachers mill along Purple Heart PKWY

A true pocket carry gun, unlike some of the others which claim to be, the P238 in .380 ACP is rated for +P cartridges.  The gun is 10 months old, been fired only ~100x and is in impeccably cared for condition as you can see from the pictures.  It feeds all ammo, bar none.  It also has very tight night sights and will come with two sets of grips (black aluminum in addition to the rosewood installed).  Additional pictures upon request, as my pics are too large to display more than two in the ad.

You'll get the P238 along with its original case and contents.  New, this pistol comes with just one 6-rd magazine and mags cost $39.99 or more.  I am selling this with FIVE (5) MAGAZINES, all OEM Sig originals, of which three are 6-round mags and two are the 7-round extended mags.  The final included items are three kydex pocket holsters from the famed Alabama Holster Company.  They are perfect fits molded for this specific gun.  One is a front right pocket curved bottom for regular pants & jeans, one is a front right pocket square bottom for cargo shorts and similar, and the third one is a back pocket holster (looks like a wallet when in your pocket).  In other words, if you buy this P238 package, you'll not spend another dime aside from on ammo.  You'll have it all.  

This all-inclusive package will only cost you $650.00 (firm).  For comparison, buying all of this brand new would be ~$850.00 + tax, and you're getting a like-new gun here.  This one's gotta go to make room for the latest.  You know how that is.  

Buyers with serious interest, please contact Joe by phone, text or replying to this ad.  Number is REDACTED.  Must be a Missouri resident or can also transfer to a kansas resident through an FFL dealer located on the kansas side of the KC area.  A bill of sale is required.

This is a unique example of a seldom found factory engraved Marlin Model that's was manufactured in 1900.The receiver is finely engraved with scroll patterns with a curly and wavy line border. In addition there is a round panel on the left side with a buck in a wooden scene. A similar type of engraving featured on a model 1897 is pictured and described as a No. 1 engraving in William Brophy's book MARLIN FIREARMS on page 531 and 534. The top barrel flat is marked with the two line ""THE MARLIN FIREARMS CORPORATION/NEW HAVEN CONN. U.S.A. PATENTED"". The bottom line is flanked by outward pointing arrows. The upper left rear flat is marked ""22 S-L - L-R"" flanked by outward pointing arrows and the upper right rear flat is marked with ""JM"" in an oval. The top of the receiver is engraved ""MARLIN SAFETY"" with a wavy line border on three sides. The serial number appears on the bottom of the receiver. The barrel is equipped with a dovetail ivory beaded front blade sight and an adjustable rear sporting sight. The upper tang is fitted with a short range Lyman #1 peep sight. Full length magazine tube, all gold washed finish except for blue sights and mounted with a deluxe checkered walnut forearm and pistol grip stock with a crescent buttplate. Information provided by the consignor states that the rifle was shipped from the warehouse on January 15, 1900 with a 24 inch 22 SLLR octagon barrel, full magazine, rifle buttplate, deluxe pistol grip stock and forearm with factory ""A"" checkering, factory #1 scroll engraved receiver with a deer on the left side with a full nickel finish. The gun was returned to the factory in 1922 and fitted with the Marlins Firearms Corporation barrel and new model 39 coil hammer spring, the latter being first available in 1922. The Marlin firearms Corporation was in existence from 1921 to 1924. The gold wash finish was done when the barrel was replaced. An accompanying Cody Firearms Records Office letter verifies the rifle configuration, caliber, 24 inch octagon barrel, pistol grip stock and shipment on January 15, 1900. Corporation Marlins don't show up every day. Of the few Corporation Marlin's produced, between 1921 and 1924, to be engraved and gold washed is extremely rare and unique. Provenance: Len Guldman Collection, Denver, Colorado.
CONDITION: Fine as factory replated/rebarreled. The rifle retains much of the gold wash finish in protected areas with the original nickel finish visible on the balance. There are a few minor dings on the barrel. The wood is also fine with a small area of gouging on the stock near the toe on the left side, a series of small dents on the dings on the forearm and overall crisp checkering. The markings and engraving are crisp and clear. The action is excellent.

The M1A with EBR stock is essentially a civilian version of the M14 EBR. Its a M1A socom 2 with a Sage EBR stock. Had the original EBR stock with adjustable butt stock but was way too heavy in comparison to the EBR stock with the M4 butt stock. This stock will accept any M4 / AR-15 stock and most any M4 / AR-15 grip. If not familiar with the Sage EBR stocks look em up and you'll find they are the best M1A chassis bar none. If you have any questions on the stock feel free to ask as I was trained on this weapon platform. The Socom II comes with 16"" barrel, tritium inserted factory sights and very nice factory trigger. I installed the Sage EBR stock and outfitted it with a stripper clip mounted picatinny rail, Magpul CTR buttstock and X products 50 round drum (new with box and papers). The pictures show a Surefire 951 weapon light, Urban ERT 2 point hybrid sling, Grip Pod fore grip and Aimpoint COMP M4 but I plan on keeping these. I have about 3200 in this set up without the light, grip, sling and Aimpoint. For the right trade I also have the original black synthetic stock, 10rd Springfield brand mag, about 8 Checkmate industries 20rd mags, 2 Checkmate Industries 25rd mags, replacement mag springs, some magpuls and 4 original Vietnam era GI 20rd Mags (various makers). This rifle has about 200 rounds through it and has been more or a safe queen than I would have liked. It did shoot sub MOA at 100 Meters with a Leupold Mk4 LR/T 3.5-10x40 M5-FF using both Black Hills 175gr SMK HPBT and Lake City Match 175gr BTHP XM118LR. Shot right around MOA at 100 Meters using 175gr Privi Partizan Match HPBT no problem, yet never had a chance to test the 200-600 meter waters. I have a Super Match so this Socom II was mainly intended for tight spaces and under 100M usage, but it sat in safe most of its life. I need an AR type 308 so looking to trade for a LWRC R.E.P.R. 308, HK MR 7.62 or a POF 308 preferring an 20"" on the POF and either 20"" or 16"" on the LWRC R.E.P.R or a scar 308 but length of barrel is not a deal breaker ( I might come up with a real good excuse to purchase the 20"" upper if traded for a 16"" barrel, lol ) Email or call / text me at 4O4-3I4-SeVen4O7 I can provide additional pics but it will only let me load one due to the size of the pic. Trade value of 3200.00 or Sale for 3000.00 cash FTF In OKC/MWC/Choctaw/Harrah area."

DESCRIPTION:   
The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
 Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
 The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

- optional bullet tray
- optional electronic early warning low primer system

Dillon bench wrench
Extra slide & cam
Extra primer pick up tube ends (yellow for small primers)
5 extra powder check bars of various sizes for various caliber firearms
435 military style fmj projectiles with green tips (approx 62 grain projectiles, overall length varies due to non-precise manufacturing of these projectiles.  Some are very pointy and some are mostly pointed.  Overall lengths of these loaded rounds varied for me between about 2.240 - 2.260 approximately)
Approximately the same number of new un-primed brass .223 cases, no trimming needed.
2 extra powder measure failsafe rods (1 already on the machine)
Accurate Datapowder 2200 (yes, the hard to find good stuff).
I just opened this container of powder about a month ago.
There is just about 5lbs left (see photos) out of the 8lb jug.
Also will  throw in the 2 large ammo cans as seen in photos.
Dillon carries a lifetime warranty with the machine, regardless of who owns it.
The casefeeder however is out of warranty.
The casefeeder has some signs of use, the motor makes some buzzing noises sometimes, does not turn with as much power as it used to, and you have to tap the switch sometimes when it randomly stops feeding cases, but it works.
I toss about 3 large handfuls of brass into a large open cardboard box, laying on their side, and pump the case lube about twice, and then tumble the cases around in the box, and this seems to be the right amount of lube for the cases.
- do not cycle dry/un-lubed cases into the dies or you may break the shellplate (Dillon will send you a new shellplate for free if that happens, but you still don't want that to happen).
Machine piston likes to be lubed with motor oil.
Be sure to read instruction manual inside and out, and memorize the thing.
The more intimate you are with your instruction manual and machine, the more you will understand it.
I understood it blindfolded upside down, left to right.
You need to know what makes every part of it work.
The primer disc is extremely precise, and the smallest adjustment of the tiny allen wrench equals a substantial adjustment of the locator tab/arm.
Getting the primers to center exactly in the middle of the .223 case is the most challenging part of reloading, takes patience and many adjustments to get it just right.
I will also provide you with many more tips once you purchase this.
Feel free to email me with any other questions, or if you would like any other photos."

the Mauser I am not 100% sure what it is, I have had some help from a fellow Armslister on identifying it.
We have came up with it being a pre WWI DWM German Mauser. It has been factory sporterized/ modernized with scope mounts and new sites, has a left handed? stock. There are no identifying markings on the gun except the makers full name and the serial numbers.
I do not know if it has been re-bored to a 8mm or if its still a 6.5mm or something else, so I have no ammo for it.

The CVA looks to have been fired, but maybe only a few times, I bought on a whim and have never fired and have no use for it & I ahve a box of balls, caps and bottle of powder that goes with it

After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.  This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position.  The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel.  The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type.  The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.  This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. 
 This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. 
All parts and components are new and Polish made.

Hey everyone, 
So i've decided to possibly part with my Like New NAA Revolver. It is the model that comes with both eh 22 magnum and the 22 LR cylinders so it is like having two guns in one. It also will come with all the original paperwork, warranty cards, case, and lock. I also am including 40 rounds of Speer Gold-Dot Personal protection 22 mag ammo that is specifically optimized for short barreled guns. Also it has a small silicone cylinder cover that is great if you want to keep both mags loaded as it keeps the round from falling out. This is the model with the 1 1/8 barrel and is 5 shot. It has had 10 22mag rounds shot through her and probably 150 lr through her with no issues. About the only thing she needs is a good cleaning. This is tiny little revolver that is awesome for conceal carry. Im only selling it because Ive found another toy im wanting to get. Bill of sale required on this one
Thanks all!"

Stainless Steel action & 24"" barrel, #2 medium contour, Harry Lawson famous ""Cochise"" custom thumbhole right-handed rifle stock with maple & other inlays and endcaps (Must see to appreciate), other Lawson customizations including glass bedding, 1 lb-15 oz glass-break trigger, trueing/bluebrinting of action, and silent cross-bolt safety. Extremely accurate rifle.

Rings & base are ""standard style"", all steel, with Browning Buckmark logo on each ring, 1""

Scope is optional - it is a Sightron SII, 4.5-14x40mm with AO

Extras include once-fired brass (large bag), some loaded ammo (Remington Premier 150s factory, less than 1 box), and RCBS reloading die set for 7mm RSAUM.

Great all-purpose rifle; I just have to simplify.  This is a stunning heirloom rifle.  I would recommend searching for ""Harry Lawson rifles"" if you want to know more, or ask me.

I paid $1,725 for this rifle and only put 20 rounds through it.  It is still excellent.  I will take a $250 hit on it and offer it for $1,475 for everything *except* the scope (but you get the rings, etc.)..... Or, for everything including the scope, add $325 which is a good deal for this excellent scope, or $1,800 even.

These are FTF prices.  Add $30 for shipping directly to your door if Okla. resident (per BATFE regs which allow same), or same price to your FFL if not Okla. resident (or if you just  prefer to receive from FFL).

I also have two extra sets of grips for the GP100 that would be perfect for CCW use. The first set is the older style ""compact"" grip which is much shorter than the stock grips. These are discontinued grips and very hard to find right now. When you find them, they are expensive! The ""compact"" grip comes with two sets of inserts; one set of walnut and another set of Green Elder Burl. The second set of grips is apair I bought from an ebay seller in Thailand. I bleieve the wood is teak. These are approximately the same length as the ""compact"" grip, but they are a bit thicker in terms of width.

This is a pristine, like-new, Weatherby Vanguard Sub-MOA Varminter rifle in .223 Rem, with extras.

This was purchased new by me, with VERY low round count.

The ""Sub-MOA"" Vanguards are the ones that demonstrate the best accuracy from the factory.  Then from among the Sub-MOA rifles, the ""Varminter"" ones have the wide-forearm composite stock with palm swell (fiberglass, aramid fibers, and graphite stock), and heavy barrel.  

This one has the 22"" bbl with blued barrel and action.  Comes with box, papers, test target from Weatherby, etc.  1 in 12"" twist rate.  Very very accurate rifle.

This is a ""medium-weight"" rifle; best for targets/bench/""tactical"" applications, but also a good varmint rifle in the field too, if you're not going too far.

Comes with Leupold all-steel ""standard"" base and 1"" rings (turn-in front, windage-adjustable rear).

Comes with or without (your choice) Centerpoint 4-16 x 40mm AO scope, with illum. reticle and target turrets.

Yours for $790 for everything, or $710 for everything except scope (but you do get rings & base)

These are FTF prices. Add $25 for shipping directly to your door if Okla. resident (per BATFE regs which allow same), or same price to your FFL if not Okla. resident (or if you just prefer to receive from FFL). 

Possible trade items shown below. Pics will be posted later, and can be requested by contacting me here:  REDACTED.

Obviously the scope on mine is the described Centerpoint - not the one shown in that pic, whatever kind it may be.  Thanks.]"

993,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2697993,For Sale:  Kahr CM9 with custom Multi-Holster,"East side of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio",$ 350,"Listed On: Thursday, February 20, 2014",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a great carry pistol that only has 250 rounds through it.  The manufacturer states there is a 200 round break in period for the CM9, so now you don't have to worry about spending the money on four boxes of ammo just to break it in. 

The initial 200 rounds were Winchester White Box ammo, and it cycled flawlessly.  I also ran another 50 rounds of various defense rounds through it to make sure there were no feed issues.  I ran 20 Hornady Critical Defense, 20 Spear Gold Dot, 10 Federal Hydrashok and all of it cycled perfectly.    

The CM9 is one of the slimmest and lightest 9mm's on the market, and the double recoil spring makes it surprisingly easy to manage muzzle flip.  Included is the original box, owners manual, and the six round magazine.  I'm selling it for 350, and I'll throw in a custom molded IWB Kydex Multi-Holster for free.  The holster currently retails for about 60 dollars, but if you tried to buy it through Multi-Holster it would probably be back ordered for 8-12 weeks.  It's a comfortable, streamlined holster with good retention."
