I, as well as the rest of the gun community, am getting tired of seeing this happening. People find ammo in their local stores; buy as much of the 22 ammo as they can then post it up for double or even triple the price that they paid. I understand you are trying to make some money, but know you are “steeling"" other peoples' money. By steeling I mean whoever buys your ammo could have bought the ammo for less than half the price you are selling it for. There are other people in the shooting community that just want 22 ammo to go shooting. People like you, that try to make money off 22 ammo, are making it difficult for many others. Put yourself in the shoes of those who are trying to buy 22 ammo just so they can go have fun at the range but can’t due to shelves being empty, not a good position to be in. I've been trying to find ammo in stores for a long time but haven’t been able to find any for a long time already. Just know that when you sell ammo to make money off of it you are putting many people in a hard position, as they want to go shooting buy they don’t want to spend twice as much money as if they would at the store. 
A big part of why we are having a shortage of 22 ammo is because of those who buy out all the 22 ammo from stores. If people wouldn't be buying ammo to resell it then many others would be able to get 22 ammo more easily and at a regular price. Because there are those buy 22 ammo just to resell it, is a big reason for the constantly empty shelves in stores. People see 22 ammo so they buy as much as they can because they are worried they won’t be able to find ammo when they will want to go shooting. Please stop selling 22 ammo to make profit. You are making it really hard for others to buy ammo just to go shooting. 

For those who hoard 22 ammo, know that you too are the reason to the ""22 ammo shortage"".

As for those who are looking for 22 ammo. DO NOT BUY 22 AMMO FROM THOSE WHO ARE SELLING IT TO MAKE PROFIT.
If no one buys 22 ammo from those who sell it for outrageous prices then the sellers will have no reason to buy ammo to resell it.

I'm only looking to sell because I basically only use .22 match ammo in my bolt action and 10/22 now, and do not see myself using bulk ammo in the near future, and have no need to hoard anything. The ammo can is included. It has been stored indoors, sealed."

I bought this pair of earrings which comes with a certificate of authentication and is certified. The retail for $4,495 and I bought them from Fred Meyer Jewelers for $2,499 + tax = $2,673.93. I am willing to trade it away for less than that because It's been past the 90 day exchange period since I was planning to give this to my NOW ex on Valentine's Day. Anyways, the earrings are studs, Canadian Ice, they shine brighter and better than ANY US Diamonds I've ever seen.

Specs are as follows:
Mine: Northwest Territories Canada
Shape: Round Brilliant Cut
Weight 0.95 carat
Clarity: I-1
Color: G
Cut: Very Good
Graded mounted in 14k White Gold

Each ear ring has a serial number etched into it, which is also on the certificate.

This will be one hell of a deal for your significant other considering all it costs is a few good 1911's. I am mainly looking for Kimber 1911's so please let me know what you have and we can go from there. Thanks."

Installed the JTE Performance power hammer main spring.
It has a DPH Arms improved gas plug regulator and has the high reliability recoil spring and G2 performance puck that has been glass beaded and polished.

It has a modified bolt hold open lever to allow for easier disassembly during cleaning. 

The trigger guard has been replaced with the C.S.S. Billet Trigger guard designed to accept AR style lower grips. And currently sports a UTG Scorpion Grip. Very comfortable grip, it fills the palm and cushions well when shooting slugs. 
I have also added an extended magazine release that makes magazine changes much smoother than the stock configuration. 

The stock tang has been removed and replaced with a billet DPH internal stock block adapter with M4 style folding stock mechanism. This enables you the ability to put any Mil-Spec AR style multi position stock on the Saiga. 

It has a billet quad rail for a forearm and has both a full length and short upper rail cover. It is not wearing either in the below photos. 
The vertical grip is an all aluminum grip that has a palm swell that fills the hand well. 

It sports a Phoenix Breach/Break on the barrel with break lock nut. 

Included are 6 SGM Tactical 10 round magazines plus the original 5 round.
I will be including all of the remaining original parts from the conversion as well. 

Please let me know if you have any interesting trades that would be equivalent to this setup.

Rep Kelly Cassidy is picture is attached

SPRINGFIELD - One Chicago Democrat is focused on requiring owners to register every firearm with state officials. Wednesday, State Rep. Kelly Cassidy (D-Chicago) introduced HB 4715, which, among other measures:
•	Provides that every person in the State must register each firearm he or she owns or possesses in accordance with the Act.
•	Provides that a person shall not purchase or possess ammunition within this State without having first obtained a registration certificate identifying a firearm that is suitable for use with that ammunition, or a receipt demonstrating that the person has applied to register a suitable firearm under the Act and that the application is pending.
•	Provides that the Department of State Police must complete a background check of any person who applies for: (1) a registration certificate for a firearm that was lawfully owned or possessed on the effective date of the Act, was brought into the State by a new resident, or was acquired by operation of law upon the death of the former owner; or (2) a renewal of a registration certificate unless, within 12 months of the date the renewal application is submitted, the applicant passed a background check conducted by the Department in connection with the applicant's acquisition of another firearm.

SPRINGFIELD - One Chicago Democrat is focused on requiring owners to register every firearm with state officials. Wednesday, State Rep. Kelly Cassidy (D-Chicago) introduced HB 4715, which, among other measures:
•	Provides that every person in the State must register each firearm he or she owns or possesses in accordance with the Act.
•	Provides that a person shall not purchase or possess ammunition within this State without having first obtained a registration certificate identifying a firearm that is suitable for use with that ammunition, or a receipt demonstrating that the person has applied to register a suitable firearm under the Act and that the application is pending.
•	Provides that the Department of State Police must complete a background check of any person who applies for: (1) a registration certificate for a firearm that was lawfully owned or possessed on the effective date of the Act, was brought into the State by a new resident, or was acquired by operation of law upon the death of the former owner; or (2) a renewal of a registration certificate unless, within 12 months of the date the renewal application is submitted, the applicant passed a background check conducted by the Department in connection with the applicant's acquisition of another firearm.
•	Provides that it is a Class 2 felony to sell or transfer ownership of a firearm to another person without complying with the registration requirement of the Firearms Registration Act."

As you can see from the links below, the least you could buy this complete set for new is about $220, but you could easily spend more on them.

The Troy Folding Rear Battle Sight:
Anywhere from $109.95 - $130 depending on where you get it, plus shipping charges, and often sold out even in the higher end of that range. $100 cash FIRM

Durability and dead-on accuracy have made Troy Industries Folding BattleSights the hands-down choice of Special Ops and tactical users worldwide. Easy to install and to deploy, with no levers or springs to fumble with, these sights position apertures at exact factory height. A stainless-steel cross-locking system ensures sights remain upright and zeroed under extreme combat conditions. A push of a button folds the sights securely out of the way until you need them again (they fold to a profile of just 0.460). Troy BattleSights feature a zero-canting attachment system for use on all military and aftermarket receivers. Features: - No tools are required for adjustment - Blackened Stainless Steel - MIL-SPEC Type III Hard Coated - T6 Aircraft Aluminum construction

To fold simply press the release button located on the left side of the sight. Lightweight construction from high quality 6061 aluminum, the sight is hard coat anodized for a lifetime of service.

The holster is made of high quality leather and is in great shape. The wear you see on the holster in the picture is only on the covering that was applied to the upper section of the leather around the area where the holster is meant to be snapped over the weapon to make it a little rigid in that area. The wear is only cosmetic due to seatbelt wear when i did not have a suit coat on and does not effect the function of the holster.

I embedded it into a custom stock. The bipod/rail assy. has a quick detachment feature from the stock with just a push of a button. The scope is a LSI 10-40X AOE that is shockproof to withstand the recoil of the Mosin. The rifle weighs a little over fifteen pounds which is exactly how I wanted it to help absorb the recoil of the rifle. It has adjustable length of pull and height of the cheek riser. The bolt handle is custom made to allow quick access of the next round and sits in a recess on the stock. In the pics the bolt handle is not all the way down since I had just finished coating it with duracoat when I took the pics. If you're not familiar with duracoat it is a really nice firearms specific paint that can withstand gun solvents and oil. The entire rifle has been painted with duracoat including the muzzle brake. All parts on the rifle were assembled using blue locktite to ensure nothing comes loose. I put a lot of time into the rifle and unfortunately it's gotta go so I'm asking $650 but I'm open to offers. I'm also open to trading it for a decent semi-auto 9mm like a S&W XD-S. Call/text REDACTED

I looked around at several places and no one had this model but they told me if they did it would be selling for over $950 plus tax and background. This is NOT a cheap polymer gun it is all metal."

I have to say i have read mixed reviews online, but this glass is very good actually, all the way out to 500 yrd  (which is the longest ive shot with it) the target is very clear. With these scopes, there is no need to guess what the proper hold over on a target is. You simply range your target and dial in the scope for that distance. it might not be the optic i would recommend for the tactical shooter, but for hunting this scope is spot on. This scope is also said to be by cabelas water proof and shock proof, i have not tried this.

I am selling this because im building this rifle into a tactical  weapon, i want to start shooting matched and i would rather have a mildot type optic, but like i said i had no problem hitting metal plates at 500 yards with this scope. but i am selling to fund another scope for my rifle.

Israel Military Industries is now called Israel Weapon Industries.
The GALIL Assault Rifle is a multi-purpose personal weapon, designed to serve as a basic weapon for the infantry.  The rifle is lightweight, air-cooled, gas operated, magazine fed, shoulder or hip fired weapon. The GALIL is a very robust weapon with high reliability in difficult and extreme conditions and is in use of the IDF since its development - over 30 years.

The Galil is a family of Israeli small arms designed by Yisrael Galil and Yaacov Lior in the late 1960s and produced by Israel Military Industries Ltd (now Israel Weapon Industries Ltd) of Ramat HaSharon. The weapon system consists of a line chambered for the intermediate 5.56x45mm NATO caliber with either the M193 or SS109 ball cartridge and several models designed for use with the 7.62x51mm NATO rifle round. It is named after one of its inventors, Yisrael Galil. The Galil series of weapons is in use with military and police forces in over 25 countries.

There are four basic configurations of the Galil: the standard rifle-length AR (Assault Rifle), a carbine variant known as the SAR (Short Assault Rifle), a compact MAR (Micro Assault Rifle) version, and an ARM (Assault Rifle and Machine gun) light machine gun.

The Chrome lining in the barrel is still intact and the rifle is extremely accurate. This is by far the best coverted Bullpup design, they did a good job of fixing the typical trigger issues with bullpups. The trigger on this breaks clean and crisp and resets when you hold down, which was an isue on older designs. This is a really fun rifle to shoot, it is incredible to have such an accurate gun that is so short. Having a 20"" barrel in a rifle that is <30"" is amazing, great for moving around tight spaces with out sacrificing the capabilities of the rifle. It is converted to take regular magazines without the duck bill, the bolt is also converted to take magazines with or without the bolt closed. (SKS's usually require the bolt to be open to change magazine, this bolt conversion fixes this problem. The bolt conversion, magazines, and magazine adapter are done professionally by SKSMagAdapter (http://www.thesksmagadapter.com/) and they guarantee properfeeding and operation.

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings where we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20E utilizes a Jacketed Hollow Point 125 gr. Jacketed hollow nose bullet. This bullet is designed to expand at low speeds and has no problem opening up at considerably less velocity than our advertised 900 fps, from two inch barrels. Penetration in human tissue is roughly 12 inches."

The Para USA Tactical Target Rifle, TTR-XA is a semi-automatic rifle that’s made in the U.S.A, 5.56mm caliber (can also fire .223 ammo) and features a 16.5"" chrome lined barrel, a Rapid Deployment Stock (RDS) (LOP adjustable from 11 3/4"" to 14 3/8"") and an overall length 34 3/4"" to 38"" (27 3/4"" with stock folded).  One of the great things about this rifle, is the Delayed Impingement Gas System (DIGS), which puts the recoil system up front, above the barrel, which pushes the muzzle back down for quicker follow up shots and reduced felt recoil. Because of the DIGS, the rifle can be fired with the stock folded and the stock locks up nice and tight!  Not only does it have a full length Picatinney rail at the 12 o’clock position and full length forearm rails at the 3, 6 and 9 positions.

The rifle also features a Manifold Injection System (MIS), which expels gases through the bolt carrier, making this the cleanest running auto-loading rifle in the world, plus it can be field stripped with not tools.  These rifles were manufactured by Para USA in Charlotte, NC.  This is the high end model and rarest of the three models Para made. Features a Command Arms Accessories G-27 grip with finger grooves, contoured backstrap and storage compartment.  Made for less than 2 years, but still under full warranty from Para.

876,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2676876,For Sale:  SightMark Ultra Shot QD reflex sight,"Central, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 60,"Listed On: Friday, March 7, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Used.

This is an ultra shot QD reflex sighting aperture. It appears to be in like new condition.

This comes with original packaging, bikini cover,and built in quick release mount. For those who do not know, they have 5 power levels of brightness, and an off setting, and an option of 4 separate reticle patterns. (That's cross hairs to the non gun enthusiast). This is effectively a clone or copy of an Eotech sight, but at a MUCH more affordable cost. Typically the full retail of these sights are around $139.00 - $149.00 but nobody pays retail for anything anymore... THANKS TO THE INTERNET!! I have found them as cheap as $119.00 with a fair amount of shopping around. So, if you are looking for a sight that does not cost $400.00 or more but has reasonable durability and reasonable battery life (you wont get thousands of hours like an Eotech), then perhaps this is the sight for you.

Alas, this is used, but everything appears to be in good working condition, all of the settings work, all of the 'reticles' work, and of coarse the battery appears to work as well. I would love to charge retail for it and make a few bucks, but used is used. And thus the price reflects a used sight. This is not the fancy new digital auto shutoff model, but the 'old school' turn it off yourself model... so maybe not the sight for you if your lazy and don't like turning things off. Clearly I can not make guarantee's as to the performance as I did not make this optic, nor am I a dealer of them. I did however take some pictures so you could see functionality for yourself. The price of $60.00 for a used sight seems fair.

The top picture is the 3MOA dot, the second is the 60 MOA cross hair, the third is a side view of the sight so you can see the quick disconnect.

I do not have time to be on the phone during the day to make arrangements, and then I am out of town in the evenings, and my cell is a company phone which I can not use for personal business... so please communicate by email. Thank you."
