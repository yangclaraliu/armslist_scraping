I only took it out of the box for these pictures.  It comes with everything that was shipped with the firearm from Beretta.  For a description, from Beretta:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

The pictures are of the actual pistol and NOT stock pictures from the internet.  Just ask if you have any questions.  Here is a chance for you to get a GREAT 9mm pistol of the highest quality for a discount.  As they say, my loss is your gain!  I posted my lowest cash price for the brand new pistol."

      Some history on this gun: One of only 3,431 of this model manufactured. This one is probably the 1174th of the total pistols made in Sun Valley California between June 7 1983 and December 15 1984.
       Although some prototype pistols were made as early as 1982, the first production Randall's came off the line on June 7, 1983.
 They were the Service Model A111, which was a standard 1911A1. It featured the typical round top slide with fixed sights and a five-inch, 10-groove barrel.
 The a111 pistols were produced throughout the life of the company,
 and, in all, there were 3,431 produced in a serial number range of RF02000C through RF09208C.
 All A111 Randall's were chambered in .45 ACP.
        This Randall is rare (as are all Randalls) and in excellent condition with some minor scuffs and minimal scratches and handling marks,

This is a great package for a new gun to CCW or IDPA/IPSC competition.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

The gun's condition is about 90%. There is minor holster wear and a couple of small dings. There is no rust at all, and it is kept extremely clean and always fired well lubed with Slide Glide.

I also am including 9 magazines! Each magazine is a 12rd magazine, and each magazine has BRAND NEW Wolff extra strength springs in them. With these springs the mags are like new!

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! High Noon offers an option that is on this holster called ""lining"", and it is basically a synthetic lining that is super slick and reduces holster wear. It also has water repellant properties.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster . It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

Finally, I will include two boxes of self defense JHP ammunition just to sweeten the deal. 

I was originally asking $1,100 for this package - but I want to get this thing sold. I am now only asking $975! With my asking price this low, I am firm on the price."

The barrel is 20' with a 1:7 twist. The lower is an OMNI with magpul CRT stock. This gun has the carry handle in which you can get some nice rail mounts for the carry handle if you plan on getting optics for it. Comes with a nice carrier group (carrier bolt is marked m&p). Barrel is also stamped 223/5.56.
 This gun shoots flawlessly, just needing some extra cash during the holiday season. The stock currently on it is a slide fire stock and will not come with the gun being it's still brand new and runs 350.00 alone. Asking $800.00 I will also throw in a bipod and case if interested. Mags will not be included being I only have 30rd mags and the law states 15 and above are now illegal.

Two 5 round magazines, one 7 round extended mag.  Gun is under recall from Springfield.  When you send it back, they give you a 7 round mag for your trouble.  

Pistol has been amazing, no matter what I feed it it cycles.  From handloads to hollowpoints, it's eating everything.  As far as the recall, I had it out shooting yesterday, fed it about 100 rounds.  I'll be sending it off after the holidays, but I have no concerns about it's safety until then.  So far, about 400 rounds through it.

Pistol is in nearly factory condition.  It's stood up well to daily carry and firing, much better than my Kimber compact which is missing most of it's finish in high-wear places.  Typical, really.  The Kimber was never built to be a utility pistol.   The Springfield XDs is made for one reason, and it does that very well.  

Why haven't I sent it in?  I simply refuse to ship a firearm this time of year due to the sheer volume of mail companies are dealing with.  It's too easy for your package to come up missing.  Springfield estimates the turnaround time at 6-8 weeks.  I'll be shipping the pistol in the first week of January.  Until then, thought I'd see if anyone wants it.  I bought it for summer carry, but I carry my 1911 compact most of the time anyway.

Only 100 of these sets were made. The pictures do not do these rifles justice. They are stunning.

Rifle #1 is the Varmint Rifle chambered in the blistering 22-250. Rifle #2 is the Deer/Antelope Rifle chambered in the flat shooting 270 Win. Rifle #3 is the Elk/Moose chambered in the potent 300 Win Mag. Rifle #4 is the Dangerous Game Rifle and is chambered in 375 H&H Mag. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present – the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadowline cheeckpiece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved crossbolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-’64 style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection.

Not only did Winchester only make 100 of these 4 rifle sets but...they do not make a Model 70 SuperGrade in 22-250 or 375 H&H Mag. This adds to the value and uniqueness of this set. These rifles are NIB...never been fired.

I spoke with an official at the Midway Foundation who informed me that these rifles are among the last Model 70 Super Grades that were manufactured in American facilities. Future manufacturing is being moved to Japan. Get the last of the American made Model 70 Super Grades while you can!"

Right Hand Stock

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide the ability to Slide Fire safely, offering a new element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! 

The SSAR-15 is designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. There are no permanent modifications necessary to install the SSAR-15.

Simply remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided interface block. The SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by simply sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install the SSAR-15 are provided.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to bump fire, the SSAR-15's radical design enables the shooter to fire and AR-15 as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike traditional bump firing. The SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold their firearm and maintain complete control at all times. In addition, as a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round, the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.

In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system. When operating a Gatlin system the shooter operates a crank in a circular motion to activate the firing mechanism. Every 1/5 rotation of the crank will discharge a round. The shooter will then continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on. With the SSAR-15 the shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward to discharge a round. To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward. As with the Gatlin system, an AR-15 equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time other than what is listed below. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only and insured shipping is additional.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL FTF firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.
