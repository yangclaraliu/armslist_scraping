This is the compact version in the SR series.
Looking to sell or trade for a sub compact.
This one has the stainless steel slide.
Here's the info:
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

This is one nice gun."

The Smith and Wesson Model 659 is the Stainless version of the model 59 and 2nd gen of the 5906. Has ambidextrous safety. This model was often used as a duty weapon and was in several movies (The Professional, Reservoir Dogs and others) ... heavy, solid and dependable!  As Boris the Blade said "" Heavy is good, heavy is reliable. If it doesn't work â¦ you can always hit them with it."" ... it's a great home defense weapon, but not really a CCW.


I've had this for 20+ years. Took it to the range a couple weeks ago and shot it for the 1st time in 10 years. Put a box plus through of range grade FMJ without a single FTE or FTF. 

Comes with 2x Mec-Gar 17 round magazines +1 in the chamber = 35 rounds ready to go in case of Zombie Attack!
And a Hunter's Joy holster with extra mag pouch and reversible belt clip for right or left handed shooters.

For an extra $40 I may be able to meet in St. Paul on a Thursday.(instead of Duluth)

I bought this gun 2 years ago brand new. I took it out a couple times to make sure it functioned properly. After that I put it into storage with my bug out bag most of the time just in case of a total SHTF scenario where I may have to hunt for snakes, crows, bugs and other vermin while surviving on my own for an extended period of time. The gun is light and small and would work well as a last ditch means of hunting and protection. Sure I would rather have my AR-15 instead but this is actually small and light enough to put in a pack.

The gun is in excellent condition. After I shot it last time I cleaned it and vacuum sealed it for extended storage without fear of moisture damage. Of coarse the gun is used and may show some small signs of use.

As most people know the gun completely disassembles and fits inside the stock, greatly reducing it's size. No tools are required to break it down and it floats if dropped into the water. The barrel is completely coated in thick plastic making it corrosion resistant and less prone to scratch anything it may bump.

When broken down the gun is not much larger than a pistol but has the benefit of a longer barrel which increases accuracy and stopping power due to higher velocity,  things that are very desirable in a survival situation. Not to mention the light weight and low cost of .22 lr ammunition which allows a much larger amount of ammo to be carried. This rifle is also about as light as a feather, my scale says around 1 1/2 lbs to 1 3/4 lbs.

The gun itself is quite handy and would be well suited as a youth gun. At any rate, for $180 you can't go wrong. Especially with a 500 rd brick of ammo included. It's a steal really. I am only selling it because I have other bug out weapons and I am looking at different survival scenarios/plans.

If this posting is still up than the gun is still for sale. No need to ask if it's still for sale. And again I am in Duluth.. You may inspect the gun to ensure it is what is advertized.  I can hold the gun if I have some money up front, in the past people have sent money to me using PayPal if they cannot get it for a few days. I will NEVER ASK ANYONE to send me money using PayPal but it is an option if you would like me to hold it for you. 

For the sale I need to visually inspect your MN License/ID and I will need to also see either #1 a permit to purchase in MN (free from local police dept.) OR #2 a license to carry in MN OR #3 a receipt from a recent gun purchase from a FFL proving you passed a NICS check. The reason I ask for one of the last 3 items is to know you are not prohibited from owning. I just need to see one of them. Lastly we can sign a bill of sale. I respect your privacy very much and unless the authorities come to me I will keep our business private. My name is Dan, I am also willing to do a partial or full trade for things of hard value, usually not electronics(GPS are ok). Im looking for Guns, Gold, Cool Stuff, Camping Gear, GPS,  Misc.

This ammo is also easy to make the brass out of 223 brass and load with any 30 cal bullets that fit your needs. It also uses the same ar-15 mags used to feed the standard 223 cal rifle.

To complete just gather the parts required to put this together and assemble. 
You need a motor, 4 pillow block bearings, 2 axle/shafts, and a drive pulley and a pair of drive pulleys and a V-belt belt to run it.

You can make a canister out of a lot of things the easiest is to use PVC pipe, media as well can be anything you want to throw in there, but for brass I recommend stainless media as it will last forever.

For $200 in parts you can find at thrift stores, junkyards and farm sales you can do brass like the pros. Just add a small bit of dish liquid and your brass will come out like factory new without residue.

I have very little information from the seller and cannot find much but from what I gather it is a Huglu brand, Turkish shotgun that was custom ordered from the manufacturer and later brought to the U.S. by a military officer stationed in Turkey.  It is labeled as a ""STAR"" model and is chambered for standard shells as well as 3"" magnums.  Fully nickel plated and beautifully engraved and well finished from top to bottom.  The bolt is polished to a mirror finish and the whole trigger action is smooth as silk with a great trigger break and the drilled muzzle brake just tops the whole package off.  Truly top quality from top to bottom and honestly just a badass gun.  This model with wood furniture retails in Turkey for $12-1400 U.S. with no upgrades and the company does not export to the U.S.A.  I cannot find this layout anywhere on the web period.  It is unbelievably light and agile and is just gorgeous.  A truly one of a kind shotgun.  If you want something well built, super light and definitely one of a kind, no matter where you are; this is your gun.  Pictures don't do it justice.

Remington 1100 gas operated semi auto comes with two barrels, one 25'' trap barrel (ported) and one 18 1/2"" ""chopped"" barrel. The receiver has a small crack at the rear (could be fixed with a small welder), but the shotgun has been reliable for 250 rounds including some lighter reloads. Gas system makes it soft shooting and fun for pairs. With the shorter barrel it's light enough in the front for a female or smaller shooter which doesn't like the extra weight. On the shotgun are painted (black with mossy green accent) furniture to resemble ""zombie gun"" styling, but another two forearms and one stock of respectable quality (wood) are included. The magazine tube has been upgraded to a Nordic Components 9+1 capacity. This was part of a parts buy, that's why I'm including all the extras. With the price of one trap barrel being $200 dollars, and the mag tube adds another $75, and the gas system being $115 including action bar and piston/ piston seal. 
     This is just sitting around as I'm no good with clays and there aren't many zombies running around the back yard, so I have no real use for it. The gun works well, and at  this price it's worth it just in parts.

   Used H&K USP fullsize, DA/SA, night sights, manual safety/decocker. Funny story with this gun, a couple years ago this was one of my personal guns! I sold it to one of my long-time customers, and he just brought it in to help pay for a custom 1911 build. So I can certainly vouch for the reliability of this weapon! Shows minor holster wear, but an absolute workhorse. Never a malfunction of any kind, night sights are still very bright & crisp. And easily one of the smoothest, most accurate .40 pistols you'll ever shoot.

Please text at REDACTED if interested or e-mail. Will only consider trades for 1930's model Winchester or Remington bolt action .22's"

These are becoming a collector's item due to their rarity, so this will only go up in value.   This gun was a safe queen I took in a trade, but I'm more of a wheel gun guy than semi auto. It is deadly accurate, well blanched, and is basically a small 1911 9mm. It also has a decocker built into the safety so you can carry a round in the chamber with the safety on and then flip the safety off to shoot without having to re-rack the slide.  Very safe gun to carry.

Please read carefully. I'm updating this listing in hopes of eliminating flakes or buyers who want to meet up for 4AM transactions. Here how this is going to work. Send me an offer only if you have a Pay Pal account! If I accept your offer I will ask you to fund my Pay Pal account with half (of our agreed upon price) via Pay Pal gift. Then pay the other half in person. Sorry I not ship. You can check my feed back on eBay. My user name is GunTuners. This is not a scam this is the only way I can help eliminate all the late night flakes that have spent the last 3 hours flooding my inbox. This lot of ammo should stock you up for your next range trip or rat hunt out east. Priority goes to buyer who offers to take the whole lot. No sales to minors! Please bring valid Oregon DMV or Military issued I.D. Buyer will meet me at a public location in Philomath. If ammo does not sell here this week it will be sold elsewhere on Saturday the 1st. So don't hesitate to lock this stuff in, or you could settle for the junk that's trickling into Bi-Mart and Wal-Mart and being immediately sold in the parking lots for triple the value.

Info from Surefire below:

Max Output -- White Light	225	.0	lumens

M962 KIT01
This kit contains everything needed to equip a Picatinny-railed long gun with a close- to medium- range incandescent white light illumination tool. Included filters allow you to convert white light output to infrared, red, or blue light. Included diffuser provides an evenly distributed flood beam for close range or interior applications. Included opaque cover protects against impact, dust, and mud, and prevents light escaping during stealth approach or operations. Flip-up feature on filters/diffuser/cover permits instantly reverting to white light output. Nylon fabric carrying case keeps it all with room for additional batteries or lamps. *does not include batteries

M600U-A
Compact and extremely powerful, the M600 Ultra Scout LightÂ® uses a virtually failure-proof LED to produce 500 lumens of output, and it continues producing blinding tactical light for 1.5 hours on a set of batteries. This brilliant output is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens into a far-reaching beam with an intense 13,000-candela central area that also provides significant peripheral illumination, making it ideal for close- to longer-range applications. 

The compact size of the M600 Ultraâunder 5.5 inches longâminimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger WeaponLights. It attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. 

The M600 Ultra comes with two switches: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; and (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick VelcroÂ® backing. 

Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600 Ultra is O-ring sealed to keep out the elements. Like all SureFire WeaponLights, the M600 Ultra is built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black or Desert Tan.

968,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2611968,For Sale:  Polish M1948 Full Size .22 Military Rifle,"Santa Fe, NM, New Mexico, United States",$ 275,"Listed On: Sunday, January 26, 2014",Rifles,Mauser                                                                                ,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a very nice rifle and accurate. I have only shot it about a hundred rounds on two occasions. I am picking up several more rifles this week, so I really should make some room. This one deserves to be shot more than I have time to shoot it. I have as some may remember, agonized over selling this one for a couple of months.

This is a  Polish M48 training rifle made in 1950 as you can see from the photos. They are actually a bit rare here in the US, and were genuine Soviet Bloc military rifles.  I have not been able to find any import marks on it, but have not completely disassembled it. It is all matching except for a number on the bottom of the extractor, and I frankly don't know if that is supposed to match. The rifle looks better than my photos. Bore is perfect, action is tight, and it all works great. This is a really over-engineered .22.

 It is quite a bit heavier than my Mosin Nagant M38 Carbine, and about as long overall as a 98K Mauser. A substantial .22, and has absolutely zero recoil. It will come with its postwar Mosin type sling. This is a C&R eligible rifle. I hope you like it as much as I do, and that you get to actually enjoy shooting it.  Price is $275 - less than a Ruger 10/22 and I think it is a LOT more rifle with a nice investment potential. This price is about the same as when the last ones were sold to dealers a few years ago.. Actually it's a bit less than at the end of the import run. Google them and you will see.
 Feel free to ask any questions.

By the way, it is listed in the Mauser category for search purposes, but was actually made in the famous Radom factory.
 Thanks for looking,
