The following information is based on personal experience and discussions with other reasonable readers of this site.

1. If you list on this site be honest about the condition of the item you wish to sell.  it saves everyone wasted time or inquiries.
2. If you list it, respond to inquiries.  Only take a few moments to send a reply to someone who responds to your listing.
3. If you sell your listing, deactivate it immediately.  This saves anyone else from sending a request to buy.  Also have some intregrety and complete the transaction as quickly as possible.  If a seller is unresponsive, flag their listing as unresponsive.
4. Create your listing with everything you want to sell shown in your listing.   Required paperwork  is the best for both seller and buyer.  If your make contact with a buyer share name and phone number so contact for meeting time and location is easy.  Buying some things on this site are like trying to crack a top secret file.
5. Always try to meet in at a business or public place.   Avoid night time meetings or going to someone's house.   better safe than sorry.
6. Do some research on the listed item before you make an offer.  If an item is used and not of special value check a gun site like Bud's Guns to determine the value of the item if it were new.  Way to many listed items are overvalued on this and other sites.   It is not resonable to pay more for a used firearm than a new one unless you are willing to pay the asking price.  There are added costs buying online or from a dealer so this site has merit if the price is right.
7. My personal favorite is the ""make me an offer"" listings.  Sounds like someone is lonely and wants emails.  If you post a listing let us buyers know what you would like for your listing and save our time responding with an insufficent offering.
8. Take time creating your listing.  Properly catorgize and list the value.  If you list ""free"" in the heading how do you charge for what you want to sell.  Proper listings agains saves us all and will help sell your product faster.
9.  Use the ""Flags"" to tag any listings that you have problems with. 
I have made posts at the Forum but many of the viewers of this site do not use the Forum section.  Thus the post here. 

I welcome response's to this post.   Maybe we can improve some of the communication and have an improved environment to sell, trade or buy our firearms."

This rifle has the 1.5mm receiver and a heavy 20"" barrel.  This rifle also has a factory threaded barrel underneath a pinned on muzzle nut.  This is a MAK-90 on some steroids!  It has a straight cut receiver.  The stock is US made by Bishop.  If you would like I will replace the factory trigger with a Tapco.  Chinese rifles use the superior double hook triggers.  Rifle will ship with a 30rd Tapco mag.  Pics up shortly.

Tapco mag will need to be fit as this is a correct factory mag well, not a century hack job.  Wood is the nicer Bishop stock that is US made and counts towards 922r compliance if you decide to keep it.  This rifle is truly brand new and unfired!  I really hate to let this go but I do have another one I am keeping that I shoot.  These rifles tend to be more accurate than other AK's as the longer heavier barrel is more stiff, provides slightly higher velocity, and most importantly increases sight radius.  This rifle will not disappoint!

I do not have the original box and accessories.

Rifle will be cross posted so time stamp matters, preference goes to an ""I'll take it"" in the thread.

$775 plus actual shipping costs.

448,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2295448,For Sale:  1891 Argentine Mauser - 95%+ w/Solingen Brass Grip Bayonet,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 600,"Listed On: Saturday, April 12, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale today is a Mauser Model of 1891 made by Loewe of Berlin for Argentina. Many consider the Model of 1891 to be Mauser's greatest work, and the most beautiful of all the his rifles.

Craftsmanship and attention to detail was at a peak when this rifle was made and is very evident when inspecting it. Fit between wood and metal is simply excellent, and the machining of all the metal parts is second to none. The bolt is highly polished and actually appears to be chrome plated, but is not.

I'd rate the overall condition of the rifle at a conservative 95%. There are no traces of rust or corrosion and the wood is superb with only the slightest of handling and storage marks. The bore is excellent as well. 

Crest on this rifle has been removed like most of them because Argentina required it before releasing them. However work was done well and there is no ugly scar as a result. Then someone at some point touched up the bluing where the crest was so you have to look close to be able to tell there was a crest there to begin with. I've owned the rifle for 30 years and didn't do this work so it was completed a long time ago.

Every part that has a number matches including the receiver, barrel, bolt, stock, magazine, and even the cleaning rod. Additionally I cannot find any importer marks on the rifle anywhere so it may have came over before an importers mark was required. 

This rifle shoots the 7.65 x 53mm Argentine Mauser cartridge. Ammo is readily available from PPU, Graf, S&B, plus a few others, and it's relatively inexpensive. You can find it at Sportsman Guide, Aim Surplus, Graf &Sons, and Cabela's to name a few. 

Rifle comes with a correct leather sling and a model of 1891 Solingen bayonet with brass grips. The brass grip bayonet was only made between 1892 and mid-1893. After which the grip material was switched to aluminum in order to lighten the bayonet and reduce it's cost. There were about 40,000 bayonets produced with the brass grips as compared to about 190,000 with the aluminum. This bayonet is in excellent condition and ones in similar condition sell on eBay for as much as $200 by themselves.

Asking price is $600 includes the bayonet. I also have two boxes of PPU recent production, brass case, non-corrosive ammo that will go with this rifle.

The rifle is considered to be an antique so it's not subject to same rules as modern firearms. Buyer must simply be at least 18 years old. Transaction is FTF with pickup in Brandon."

Up for sale or trade is my fully customized XD 40. First off, this weapon shoots fantastic!! It has 250 total rounds down the pipe, never any reload ammo! 100 stock, and 150 after completing the custom work. Now, about the work done.
Upgrades include:
-fully cerakoted, red frame, sniper grey slide, magazine bottoms, and mag ramps.
-hard chrome/polished controls and indicators
-lightened trigger/polished internals
-extended grip/tang safety (awesome feel)
-polished barrel, mirrored ramp
-full stippling of the frame (excellent grip)

All of the custom work and aftermarket parts were installed by WeaponWorx in Tucson, (these guys rock, but they are not cheap!)

Also including a red cerakoted green laser, a leather blackhawk belt holster, and a black fobus paddle holster, and just under 100 rounds and carrier.

I have spent around $600 on aftermarket parts/custom work... This XD shoots and feels better than any XDM out there! I have decided to start some other projects... And something had to go!

-Eastern block or Egyptian AK47's
-Semi Auto12 ga shotguns
-all pistol trades welcome, but I love glocks (gen 3/4)
-very interested in super compacts as well

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12"" in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly, is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle"

I recently bought it- the previous owner had fired 100 or less rounds through the 357 barrel, but none through the 40. I have shot 76 rounds through the 40 barrel, and none through the 357. So, the gun has a total of less than 200 rounds fired, both barrels tested, and no issues. It shoots wonderfully. The gun is in perfect condition, with no issues whatsoever. I have the black case, instructions, two 12 round mags, and the 357 barrel in Sig packaging to go with the gun.
I love it- it is beautiful. But, I think that I will prefer a more utilitarian 226- one that I am not so worried about messing up the prettiness. Therefore, I would be interested in a trade for a like-condition P226 in Elite, Scorpion, Dark, etc. configuration. Black. No bling. I would also be happy with a 9 MM, because I have a 229 in 40/357. 
I am not forced to do this, and I am very happy with my Equinox. I enjoy getting new Sigs, so the bling is out of my system, and I would be more comfortable with a daily shooter that I don't have to be so careful with. Message me with what you have. I am only interested in a Sig 226 or possibly a 229 in 9MM.
I prefer FTF trade. I may turn you down- I want a 226 that is as special as this one, and I am passionate about my Sigs. I am reasonable- I am not looking for something that is more valuable than what I have. But, I am also not looking to trade down at my loss. You be reasonable, I will be reasonable.
Face to face, have a drivers license or concealled permit. I am not interested in shipping/out of state. Face to face, Virginia resident."

This is a super high performance 45 GAP loading and gives the 45 GAP some serious muscle. The long-for-weight all copper Barnes bullet will penetrate deeply for such a light bullet and will give low recoil, which aids in fast follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 14 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire at all. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As always, we have used real world pistols to generate our advertised velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to determine advertised velocities is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to reproduce such false high velocities in the real world, where it matters."

 Pair of LARGE- Red/Green Signal Gloves, charging equipment and carrying case

 Today's roadways are more dangerous and congested than ever. It's not unusual for police officers, to be injured while on foot directing traffic at an intersection, construction zone, or accident site. Signal Corporation's innovative products use the latest LED technology to maximize safety and save lives.

 Signal Gloves
 Lighted Traffic Control Gloves that Automatically Change Color and Pattern Based Only on Hand Position. While directing traffic, most accidents happen when conditions are less than optimal. Early morning, fog, and wet roads are examples of conditions which may affect roadway safety. Actual stopping distances are 300+ feet due to reaction time and non-professional drivers. Add in the fact that many drivers are distracted, their vehicles have bad brakes or tires or that road conditions are not optimal and you will see much greater distances needed to safely stop. You need to get a driver's attention, ideally 400+ feet away, to give the driver sufficient time to respond and follow your directions.


 Operational Modes:

 Signal Mode:
 Hand Up = RED X
 Hand Horizontal = Chasing Arrows
 Hand Down = All Lights Off

 Strobe Mode:
 High Visibility Strobe Effect

 Arrow Mode:
 Continuous Chasing Arrows

 Flashlight Mode:
 Bright Flashlight

 Each glove works independently - 
 no switches.

 Features:
 •Bright LED's - Reliable, latest technology.
 • Rechargeable Battery - 10 hrs continuous use.
