I only have the 5 round mag that came with it. My problem is this: When I pull the bolt back, it doesn't come back far enough to grab the rim of the the 7.62 round. Instead, the edge of the bolt (boltface) stops just shy of the back of the round and never comes back far enough to grap the rim/lip, so when I push the bolt forward it drags the round crooked until it can't go any further forward then I have to pull the bolt back a second time, this time clearing the rim of the round and thus getting behind it and then it pushes straight and correctly into the chamber. 
The bolt is going back all the way, it's not hanging up any. The rounds look like they are not forward enough as they rise out of the magazine and no matter how I stagger them or push them forward it doesn't fix it); the rounds are sitting an 1/8th or maybe  a 1/4 inch too far back and that's why the bolt won't grab the rim of the 7.62 round.
Has anyone else had this problem?  Did you figure out a fix??

Here is the details on the bike.

1988 Yamaha XT600 Thumper

$2000 Firm need to sell. At this price you will get your money back if you ever decide to sell it.

I had one in high school and searched for years for a nice one. I drove to St. Louis to get this beauty, however I hurt my leg and can no longer start it easily.

I bought it with 1900 miles on it, and rode it to 3900 miles. The fluids were changed every 1k miles with K&N Filter and BelRay oils

It is all original. It is in excellent condition and very nice. I'm moving and must sell it.
If your looking at this ad, you probably already know what your looking at as these were the original thumpers.

Here is what it needs and why it's priced so cheap.

Needs new tires
Needs a Battery
Needs the pilot jet cleaned in the carburetor (slightly plugged and makes it backfire)


Other than that it is a head turner and runs great.

It comes with a new air Filter, 2 Rear Sprockets (one smaller and one bigger than stock to gear it the way you want), and it also comes with a Factory Yamaha Service manual that tells you how to rebuild the motor, to changing a spark plug. It's a factory manual the mechanics use. Has torque values down to the spoke nipples.

It has a CLEAR Oklahoma title signed and notarized ready to go!

At $2k it won't last the weekend."
215,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2218215,For Sale:  Rare & Collectible Military Ammo,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 22, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hey everyone. I've just about finished selling my life long collection of military small arms from around the world so now I've opened up my ammo & accessories safe and I'll be selling it's contents as I have time.  

All of this ammo has been stored in my air conditioned home inside a dehumidified safe.   

A few things to keep in mind: First most of this ammo was originally designed for either military or LE use, and a lot of it is either steel jacketed, steel core or both. So any ammo I describe as magnetic means that it will potentially penetrate targets much deeper than standard commercial ammo. Therefore please be extra cautious with your backstop if you decide to shoot any of it. I feel quite sure that it all will fire so be careful. Second any of the tracer ammo can and will start fires. So again please use with all due caution. Here is the ammo in this lot:  

(2) 20 round boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser. Brass case, non corrosive & magnetic. Very clean military surplus ammo. $35 for both boxes. 

(2) 20 round boxes 6.5 x 55 Swedish Mauser with wooden bullet. This ammo is intended as a blank round but requires a special adapter to shred the bullet at the muzzle. Without this adapter the wooden bullet is dangerous and could be fatal at close range so use caution when firing. $15 for both boxes. 

(5) 10 round boxes of German 8x56R for use in Steyr Straight Pull rifles & carbines. This ammo is brass case, corrosive and magnetic. It's unbelievably clean for being made in 1938. This ammo is truly collectible and the box plus every round is stamped with the German Acceptance Mark. Each box has 10 rounds loaded on 2 stripper clips. These clips & empty boxes sell on auction sites for just about as much as I'm asking for the real live ammo. Price is $20 a box or $80 for all five. 

(1) 50 round box of Kynoch 7mm Mauser loaded on 5 round chargers. Ammo is brass case, corrosive & very magnetic. This box is unopened so I did not want to disturb it. However I have a partial box of the same ammo and it's unbelievably clean... looks like it was just made, but it was actually produced in January 1938, and it's noted right on the box. Vintage Kynoch is among the most collectible ammo available. Asking $100 for the box. 

(1) 100 round bulk box of 7mm Mauser made by FN Belgium in 1936. Ammo was made for Venezuela, and it's brass case, corrosive and very magnetic. This ammo is also in unbelievable condition for it's age. Cases are bright and there are no signs or corrosion or deterioration at all. Very collectible and perfect to display with your South American Mauser(s).  $75 for the box. 

I do have additional quantities of some, but not all of the ammo listed above. So just ask if you are looking for more. 

Thanks for looking."

This particular pistol is in good - very good condition, but it does show some signs of use. No rust, or serious blemishes - rather just signs of normal military use.

Pistol comes with a canvas flap holster, a 26.5mm cleaning rod and a rope lanyard strap.

Asking $100 with pickup in the Brandon area. Must be 18 or older to purchase.

Note 26.5mm flare, parachute & smoke ammo is available online from several sources including Dan's Ammo, Ammunition To Go and Sportsman Guide. The 26.5mm cartridge is a jumbo round at 1 inch diameter, and there is no comparison to the 12 gauge plastic pistols & ammo that are so common today. The 26.5mm pistols & ammo were designed for military use and firing them is quite spectacular!"

The 'B' designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety. CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol.

I am including ~1200 rounds of older 9 mm ammo. This gun shoots roughly 98 out of 100 of the rounds.

I take care of my guns.  I'm selling it because I enjoy using my Nazi Germany 8mm Mauser with iron sights to slay deer and would like the money to buy more ammo.  Would maybe trade it for another gun but I definitely do not need a shotgun or hunting rifle.  I'm more of a WW2 or military type rifle guy.  Would consider some pistols.  Thanks."

I have for sale a 1980's vintage Walther PPK/S imported by Interarms. I purchased this gun from a family friend that stopped concealed carrying, but I now realize I have no use for a concealed carry gun. I am the second owner. Function is 100% and is extremely accurate even out to 25 yards. Marked and chambered for 9mm Kurtz, which here in the states is more commonly known as .380 auto/acp. The pistol holds 7 rounds in the magazine plus one in the chamber. It is a double action, and has a safety decocker.

This was a daily pocket carry gun for 30 years, so the blued finish is down to around 20-30%. Bore is bright and shiny. Total round count is about 2-300. Comes with the factory original mag and a 80's spare by Manhurin. Comes with 20 rounds of Winchester PDX1 ammo- just bought it last week.

Firearm trades are welcome. No hunting rifles or shotguns.

Face to face only at the Norpoint parking lot here in Arlington. No shipping, and I will not drive further south. Cash or firearm trade only. Will only sell to those over 18 with a valid non-punched drivers license. No FFL transfer necessary. Not in a hurry to sell so price is firm."
