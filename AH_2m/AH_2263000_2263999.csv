This is a rare find, I have only found one other like it through the years watching the Auction sites. 
As mentioned above it has the Laminated wood, SRC. (Saddle Ring Carbine) and the much sought after 16"" barrel instead of the standard 20"".
The only blemishes on it are a couple of small indents in the wood where someone must have had it on a tight gun rack. Other that that it has not been fired much if at all. I have not shot it. What a great brush gun with that 16"" barrel !!!
The only reason I am selling it is I don't hunt anymore and this is the last hunting gun I have.
$600.00 Cash only, must be Mn. resident and be able to legaly purchase a gun in Mn.
I don't inflate my prices, I usually ask what I need for anything I sell on line so please, no keyboard cowboys !!! Don't forget a gun case !!!"

Selling the 1000 round case of Tula for only 375 (37 cents per round)
Great way to have 1000 rounds of plinking ammo and not have to worry about paying 45 cents per box of 20 in the stores

Selling bricks of 22LR in Federal hollow points for 75 dollars per box of 550 rounds. It is a little more than what they would be in stores IF they were in stores. I paid 65 per box so just trying to make 10 bucks. Honestly if you bought all 5 boxes I'd sell em to you for what I paid - or consider any kind of trade.

This accurate and fun-to-shoot DA/SA revolver was made in 1940.

I have lots of ammo for sale as well and the gun comes with original holder and cleaning tools. 

From a website... ""Definitely an interesting handgun from an era gone by, the 7-shot Nagant Revolver is an extremely unique design dating back to the 1890s. The most interesting design point is that upon cocking the hammer, the cylinder pushes forward in an attempt to seal off escaping gas; the cartridge case itself then provides the final seal at the point of firing and adds 50 to 150 fps to the bullet's initial velocity.""

 Designed by the Nagant Brothers (Emile and Leon) of Liege, Belgium, the original design was accepted by the Russians in 1895. The initial shipments were produced at Liege, Belgium and exported to Russia. Around 1898, the Russians then initiated their own production at their Tula Arsenal. Originally designated to be replaced as frontline issue after the adoption of the TT30 in 1930, the production on these military weapons actually continued up through 1945 and they could still be found in the hands of reservist troops and police into the 1950s."""

I have had excellent luck with this upper, it is extremely accurate. I regularly shoot sub 1/4"" groups at 100 with tuned reloads, and it shoots about 1/4"" to 1/2"" groups at 100 with match grade factory ammo. The scope is great, very clear and the thin mildot reticle is perfect for target or varmit shooting and making quick adjustments, not to mention lifetime warranty through Bass Pro. I am selling to finance other projects.

Specs on upper:
-1:8 twist
-chambered in 223wylde (will shoot both 5.56 and 223, it is a target chambering)
-24"" heavy stainless barrel

Extra note: If you would rather shoot 380ACP, you can buy a conversion barrel on gunpartswarehouse.com. For around $100 you can buy a 380ACP barrel and barrel press. All you do is swap barrels and you can use the original Makarov magazines to load and shoot 380ACP. They also have threaded barrels and you can add a compensator that has a rail for attaching a laser or light. Just search for ""Makarov"" on gunpartswarehouse.com and you can see the additional parts I'm talking about."

Comes with all spacers for proper fit



FH556-212A
The FH556-212A is a high-performance flash hider for the Colt Commando, C8 SFW, M4, M16, HK416, and 5.56mm (.223 cal.) semi-auto, bolt-action, or assault rifles with Mil-Spec 1/2-28 muzzle threads. It also serves as a precision, rock-solid adapter mount that enables rapid no-tools attachment of SureFire FA556K, FA556-212, FA556MG, or MINI suppressors to the rifles listed above and other rifles with the same muzzle thread/configuration.

The FH556-212A flash hider delivers superior muzzle flash suppression (see demonstration photos at left). This provides three benefits—minimizing degradation of your night-adapted vision, helping to conceal your position, and reducing muzzle rise. Machined from heat-treated stainless steel, finished in a tough, corrosion-resistant coating, all SureFire flash hiders are extremely resistant to gas and particle erosion and will perform perfectly for thousands of rounds.

[NSN: 1005-01-554-3051]

NOTE: SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders also serve as adapter mounts for our Fast-Attach® sound suppressors. If you do not plan to attach a SureFire sound suppressor to your firearm, we recommend choosing a shorter-length muzzle brake or flash hider. SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders that mate with our overlap suppressor models are longer in order to extend rearward over the barrel, a feature that is unnecessary unless mounting an overlap suppressor.

I have been distracted with another project and have decided to sell it instead.  This AK style pistol is made by the Zastava factory in Serbia and is one of the best quality AK's I have seen.  The build quality is remarkable.  One of the reasons I purchased it is the low serial number.  It is one of the first 200 builds and it appears it was built sometime before May 2, 2012.  Features of this 19.3"" long handgun include a dual aperture Krinkov-style rear sight, bolt hold-open notch on the selector and chrome-plated gas piston. The bolt and 10.2"" cold hammer-forged barrel are made from high quality steel alloy. It also has a stamped receiver chambered in 7.62x39mm caliber and two 30-round magazines. The PAP M92 PV Pistol has a Krinkov-style hinged top cover for ease of assembly and disassembly.

I will not respond to  emails asking ""will you take any less?"" or ""what's your bottom dollar?"".  I'll gladly negotiate the details of a potential trade by email or phone (still dependent on each of us examining the other's items), but won't discuss cash price until money is on the table.  

Any transaction will be F2F in a public place (this means I do NOT ship), and I'll want to see an Ohio DL confirming you are 18 and an Ohio resident. I'll also want a signed receipt to keep stating you are legally qualified to buy the gun under Ohio law and any other laws that might apply (this is your responsibility to know), and am willing to give you a signed receipt for your records. I collect and shoot firearms for a hobby. This means sometimes I have firearms to sell that I no longer want, or didn’t appeal to me as much as I expected once I got them. When I do sell one, my goal is to do everything by the book; I've no intention of violating the law. Thank you for understanding.

LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX BOX,"azusa, California, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Saturday, October 26, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=218

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto standard pressure loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel. We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle. Note my ""real world"" velocities from my personal ""real world"" pistols.

So here is what I have. 

I have an M&P 40 full size and M&P compact. They both come with the factory hard cases, backstraps and both have Apex Tactical Kits in them (hard sear and USB). So the triggers are identical and much improved over the factory option. The full size has Ameriglo Operator Night Sights that were just bought a few months ago and the compact has the standard 3 dot sights. I also have 4 .40 caliber 15 round magazines, 2 .40 caliber 10 round compact magazines. They will also come with a 9mm conversion barrel and 2 9mm 17 round magazines. It will also come with what .40 S&W ammo I have left (34 rounds of Winchester Ranger 180 grain Bonded JHP and 81 rounds of Federal 180 grain FMJ). The compact has a X-Grip sleeve that goes over a full size magazine to make the grip the same as the full size. The full size has roughly 500 rounds through it, the compact has roughly 200 through it and the 9mm conversion barrel has about 250 through it.

I am willing to separate.

The pic is the only one Armslist will let me up load so if you want more pics you must e-mail me. 

I am not really sure what to ask for all of this but I know that I have around $1400 in everything. I do not expect to get that back out of it but I will not give it away either. Please make me a REASONABLE offer and expect to negotiate. I will be happy to meet a buyer somewhere in the NE TN/Tri-Cities area. I will not ship and you must pay with cash. Thank you for reading."

You won't find this on Savage's website as it seems to have only been sold to Military/Law Enforcement at discounts. I had never seen one before so I bought it on the spot. I purchased this brand new and completed the Savage-suggested 50-round break-in last week (takes ~4 hours). In the end I decided I have more rifles than time and I prefer my 24"" and 26"" barrels, so this one is up for sale. Here are the specs:

Savage Accustock with Rubber Pad
Savage Accutrigger (adjustable 1.5-6 lbs)
20"" Heavy Barrel with 5R rifling (if you don't know what this is, google it, awesome stuff)
Threaded Barrel with Cap (Standard 5/8"")
EGW 20 MOA Mil-Spec Picatinny Rail
Tactical Knurled Bolt Knob

Scope and bipod NOT included.

To be clear, I am not hurting to sell, so please no low-ball offers. Cash is king, CCW preferred. I also have a LNIB set of Burris Tactical 30mm Scope Rings Available if interested (pictured below with one of my scopes - scope not included).  I also may be willing to take off some money if you want to swap bolt handles...I would like one of these for one of my other rifles. Thanks for looking and please let me know if you have any questions."

771,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2263771,"For Sale/Trade:  13'10"" v-hull alluminum row boat/trailer/motor","Southwest, Jacksonville, North Carolina","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, December 2, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Please read this ad in it's entirety. If you see the ad still up, it is still for sale.

The information below still applies, however, at this time I will sell the whole package for $1,100.00 firm, extremely firm.  The motor is worth more than that to me.

The boat motor is nearly brand new, even though it is a 2007 model, and it is worth a lot to me, just as your rifle that has only been fired 20 rounds is still worth what it was to you on the day you bought it, even though it may have been 15 years ago and the blue book says it is worth less than half what you paid for it in it's current condition.

I have FOR SALE OR TRADE my 1986, 13' 10"", Sylvan, aluminum row boat and 1993 Hawkeye boat trailer. I can't post more than the two pics for you, just ask for more, I have them.

The boat is in good shape with no leaks, just normal scratches and paint fade. It has an anchor and rope winding device, two sets of oar lock mounts, reinforced transom inside and out, and proper title and registration along with my purchasing documentation. 

The trailer is in good shape as well, nothing special, it hauls the boat, everything works but I have not checked the lights lately, I don't even plug them in when I use it. It has a spare tire mount, but no spare tire, had to use it. The tires are like new and hold air just fine. The trailer is properly registered, but my home state does not issue a title to a trailer that weighs less than 2500 lbs, and I have the documentation to back that up, sent to me by my home state when I applied for the title. 

I have my original receipt for the boat and trailer from the person I purchased them from as well. 

The outboard motor is also FOR SALE OR TRADE, either separately or with the boat and trailer for one price, so let me know what you are wanting to BUY OR TRADE and for how much and or what your trade may be. I am the original purchaser and have the documentation for it. It is a Tohatsu MFS98A3S, 9.8 hp, 81 lbs., short shaft (15"") 2007 model. You can look it up on internetoutboards.com. It has MAYBE 25 hours on it, was broken in according to the manual and just never used much due to a lack of time for it. It is a very nice motor, moves this boat right along, no need to go much faster in this type of boat. I have had the water impellor replaced once and that was 2 years ago. I had it out twice this year, it is running extremely well. I have an extra prop for this, the one on it is for heavier loads, the extra is for lighter loads and more speed, I'm not light, neither are my loads (kids). Also have a spare (new this year) water pump impellor, spark plug, starter cord, extra gear oil. 

I'm selling these items for a very simple reason, the boat is too small for the size of family I now have, otherwise I'd keep everything.

The boat and trailer are worth $600.00 to me, I will not separate the boat and trailer, period. 

The cheapest you will find this motor new is from internet outboards.com, at over $1800.00, mine is used, I know that, but it is still like brand new, so again, keep that in mind.

My number is REDACTED, I, (Ryan), will be the one that answers it. Please, DO NOT TEXT ME, I do not like texting from my phone, it is not a smart phone, it is a dumb phone."

I purchased this brand new and completed the Savage-suggested 50-round break-in last week (takes ~4 hours).

951,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2263951,"For Sale:  New Custom Spikes Tactical ""Calico Jack"" AR Pistol 5.56mm .223 Noveske, Troy, Magpul","Long Beach, Los Angeles, California","$ 1,200","Listed On: Saturday, October 26, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"NOTE: The photo is of the gun that is for sale when it was in Colorado! No Magazines are included in the sale and there is now a Bullet Button installed! The EOTech Zombie Stopper is also not included!

For sale is a custom complete AR Pistol built from a Calico Jack Spikes Tactical 5.56mm lower. I have invested over $1,400 into this build that I finished earlier this year out of state in Colorado. I was planning on keeping it for myself, but alas... bills.

This is my ninth custom AR15 type build in the last 12 years. I have never had any issues with any of my builds as I am an experienced & certified Armorer (Active Duty Military). Again I built this specific pistol before I moved from Colorado and threw in a CA Bullet button before I left. It is 100% legal! I have yet to test fire it, meaning the pistol has zero rounds through it.

Major Component list:
Spikes Tactical Calico Jack Lower with CMMG Lower Parts Kit
Complete Pistol Buffer Tube Assembly - Can't remember brand, perhaps Phase 5
Magpul ASAP
Magpul MOE Polymer Trigger Guard
Magpul B.A.D. Lever
Magpul MOE Punisher Logo Grip (Not Pictured yet...)
CA Bullet Button

Complete Mas Defense Upper 7.5"" 5.56 / .223 Barreled Upper
TROY Alpha Battle Rail 9″
Noveske Krink KX3 Flash Suppressor with Pig (Authentic with packaging!)
Magpul PTS Flip Sights(This is the only Magpul PTS anything on this rifle...)

This pistol is new! There are only signs of wear from tightening the locking ring on the pistol buffer tube when my wrench slipped and also on the Noveske flash suppressor from sliding the Troy Rail over it (which was unavoidable). The Noveske is hidden inside the rail so it is not noticeable.

I am not a manufacturer or dealer and this AR pistol was brought in from out of state so I can legally possess and transfer it as a private party in California. Also, as I am currently active duty military, I did not need to register this pistol when I brought it into the state. I am aware of all the California Gun Laws and I have consulted a firearms lawyer, I can refer you to him if you're concerned, but they charge per the hour, so it's best to do your research on calguns.net.

Asking $1,200.00 FIRM. CASH ONLY! NO TRADES! NO LOW BALL! No Return! You may of course inspect & function check before buying! You must be able to meet me at a FFL near Long Beach, CA. Buyer pays all transfer fees. Email, call or text Nate at REDACTED if interested."
