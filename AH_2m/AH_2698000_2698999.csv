The pistol is built on a double stacked frame that is designed to shoot the awesome 22 TCM round (which btw has a muzzle velocity of 2200 fps making it the most powerful handgun round in existence). The pistol is also designed to be able to fire 9mm rounds through a secondary barrel using the same magazines. The only thing that needs to happen is that the recoil spring and barrel of course need to be swapped out. 

The process takes around 3 minutes to swap out everything. 

The pistol came with a 9mm parkerized barrel however I wanted to upgrade the barrel to a 5.755 threaded chrome barrel so it was silencer ready. It was nearly impossible to find a swap out however I was able to get one custom made by Storm Lake barrel's customs department and with some minor fitting with Wilson Combat, the threaded barrel shoots extremely well. I can shoot within a 3 inch circle at 40 yards.

I just bought an old car i'm trying to restore and need to part with the gun for the repair work.

 I've shot around 150 rounds through the 22 TCM barrel and around 250 rounds with the chrome threaded barrel. The pistol is in fantastic shape and is only 3 months old. 

These guns are brand new on the market and I waited 6 months to buy the pistol as its Rock Island's newest and most high end pistol now. 

Whats included in the deal are as follows:

-1911 22 TCM Pistol -Tactical Model with extended beavertail 
-22 TCM parkerized barrel (original)
-9mm parkerized barrel (original)
-9mm custom 5.755 chrome threaded barrel (Storm Lake Customs)

Dont believe me,Call a range and ask them !!! If a magnet sticks to the Bullet you cant fire it at MOST indoor ranges / Bullet NOT the case 


 Confusion over the issues of ""bimetal"" versus ""steel core"" ammo has a great deal of significance for rifle and pistol shooters because many ranges ban any bullet that responds to a magnet - especially  indoor ranges with steel backstops. I've even heard of one range that banned any pistol chambered in 9x18mm Makarov! Why is this medium-strength pistol round so despised by range owners? It's the ""bimetal"" ammunition. The steel in the projectiles chews up steel backstops.

I also have the cleaning kit, and the original top receiver part if you don't like the scope mount.

Sorry, I will not sell the rifle alone, I made the mistake of selling my last SKS separate from these two drums- 
I don't know what it is about these SKS drums by themselves, but they seem to attract scum bags... I had a chance to sell these two SKS drums three times.. two of the buyers were scum bags, the other was in a state about to ban them... 

Disclaimer-
I am very pro gun, but sorry, I don't sell to scum, I would much rather keep a rifle than put it in the wrong hands.
I have done plenty of transactions on Armslist- and Most people I meet to sell or trade seem pretty legitimate, but I do have a built in dirtbag detector- and if I suspect you are a gangster, criminal, or some other type of person that should not have a firearm, I close my trunk and drive away.

Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries."

According to the Ithaca website this gun was manufactured in 1948. This belonged to my wife's uncle. They just do not make them like this anymore.

The bottom-eject on these Ithacas make them appealing to both right- and left-handed shooters. These also make great home defense guns because they are so easy to operate, and the safety is right by the trigger finger instead of on top of the tang like most modern guns. These older Ithacas are really nice all-around shotguns, great for hunting, or shorten the barrel for a home defense gun.

Great rifle, shoots awesome. One of the rarer rifles made by BSA for other countries; EXACTLY the same as the ones issued to the British Military, just with some different stampings. Has all matching numbers including magazine. Nice stock, very good bore. Has original magazine cutoff and screw and stock disk which were purchased from IMA, as well as a sling. VERY handsome rifle. Has South African acceptance marks on top of receiver. Was going to start collecting enfields, but kind of backed off for now.


1918 Danzig Kar98a 

The second is my 1918 Danzig Kar98a. The only parts which do not match are the bolt and one of the action screws (one looks like it might match but hard to read, I'll get back on that one). Everything else matches. It was supposedly brought back by a US GI during the Battle of the Bulge in WW2, although I have no way to legitimately prove that, there is a duffel cut under the rear band which has been repaired. Something I just noticed as well is there was at some time a crack in the very end of the upper handguard but that has been fixed as well. Both of these repairs were done a long time ago; it was also refinished so I'm assuming one person did the repairs too. The rifle also has no import marks. The bore is frosted with light pitting but has a little shine and should clean up better for someone with more patience than me. I ran some patches through it and its starting to look better, like I said, my patience and attention span get the best of me sometimes. Passes bullet test with flying colors. Nice stop-gap for your collection until you can afford a really nice one.

- Also interested in ""sniperized"" mosins or mausers. What do I mean by that? Rifles that are pretty much in their original wood stocks (no cut downs) and hardware, they just have a non-standard scope mount (i.e aftermarket mounts, such as a Savage 340 mount on a 91/30 or weaver bases on a mauser) or at least have the holes drilled and tapped for one. What I AM NOT looking for is your 91/30 decked out in an archangel stock with modern tacti-cool crap all over it.

Comes with 6 Chip McCormick Stainless 8 round mags with removable bottom bumpers, Packmyer rubber and wood grips, Factory box, papers, takedown tool and factory grips. I'm asking $1000 cash for this gun (20% off new for ""used"" gun prices) or $1100 trade value. I also have 4 different holsters for it...I will throw in two of them of your choice. Two holsters are for Tactical Carry and two are for Concealed Carry!
 Below are some links of what this gun costs new. If you can find one in stock at all...look for yourself. No low ballers, if you can find one cheaper then mine with the extras then buy it and simply pass this one by...it is what it is guys (a good deal)! Transfer will be done with an FFL (you pay for it unless it's a trade then we each pay for our own). 


For the right straight trade (FNH Five-Seven Pistol in FDE) I also have 650 rounds of 45 ACP ammo to throw into the deal!!! Thanks for looking!

Now what makes this stand out is the Sig Tac brace that is completely legal and transforms a pistol into a beast of a shooter. BUT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS A PISTOL, IT IS NOT A RIFLE. IT IS COMPLETELY LEGAL TO OWN AND DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY DIFFERENT REGISTRATION THAN ANY OTHER PISTOL DOES.

All the parts used in this custom build are premium, mil-spec or better parts. Obviously this is 5.56/.223 caliber and it has about 90 rounds down range. I Have other AR's and always wanted to go the pistol route, and when the Sig Tac brace became available it made it all worth it. The only reason I am selling is I want an IWI Tavor so the new toy has to go.

Spartan Enhanced Billet Lower (Billet already more expensive than forged lowers. Enhanced means it has threaded pins so nothing goes flying if removing individual items. Also the magwell is flared and enhanced to allow drop free mag removals and also easier insertion on changes) $160

12"" Free Float Handguard upper(increases accuracy, allows positioning of rails wherever you choose) 1-9 Twist Barrel, with the 10.5"" barrel a 1-7 is no more desirable until you get to 14"" and above. $600
KAK Flash Can muzzle tip. Reduces recoil by pushing gases forward, but it does create a heck of a blast. Hence the Flash Can name. $35

Chrome RRA BCG with enhanced ejector $170 or make offer for a standard BCG $100

Add all that up and we are around the $1475 range as it sits. Like brand new. Will sell for $1050 that saves you the money for the build, taxes and shipping. Or make offer and I remove the Chrome BCG.

Everything is as you see included EXCEPT - Weapon Light, Sling, and Mag.

I have at the time a Chrome premium BCG installed. This was almost $200 at the time. If the rifle sells for what I am asking the BCG will go with the rifle. But I will entertain lower offers for a standard mil-spec black nitride BCG. If you know about BCG's the chrome is easier to clean after firing, and retains natural lubricity, reducing the need for lube.

I have other AR's so, the chrome BCG can go in those. Willing to hear offers though."

I hate to sell it but it is time to go to someone that can find the last couple of parts it needs to be correct.  The Barrel is Springfield but WW2 Vintage and every time I find a correct magazine for it someone always outbids me or I think it is too expensive.

As you can see the small parts are either marked clearly with an S or what looks like 100 years of use worn down S.  The grips are original to the gun and those are worth $300+ on their own.

I am not a scammer I have a real phone number and will meet in person to let you hold and look this over.  If you are out of town we can do an escrow service like pistol pay but I hope someone in the Phoenix appreciates what this is.  It is not a shooter it is not for chroming it is for a collector.  This pistol was made BEFORE WW1 and could have seen service in the Mexican Punitive Expedition and then WW1.  

If you are serious I will listen, I have seen what these go for on Gunbroker and the other places not in this good a condition or with missing barrels and grips magazine etc.

This is C&R eligible and I can send it to you if you have a C&R or to your FFL.

My tastes run strongly toward military guns. There aren't many of them that I can't appreciate, but there are some that really capture my attention. The HK Mark 23 is one of those. The Mark 23 is a commercial model of the government issue MK 23 MOD 0 pistol. The differences are the slide markings and that the civilian pistol barrel is manufactured to SAAMI headspace specs. This auction is for the model with two 10rd magazines. The pistol is large. If you have any problems finding a grip small enough to suit you, this pistol is not for you. If you take a look at a glock 21 and imagine the grip if the forward edge were even with the points of the finger grooves. That's the size of the HK grip. Not huge, but definitely for big hands. There's an ambidextrous thumb safety so it can be carried cocked and locked. There is also a hammer drop safety. When the thumb safety is engaged, the hammer drop can't be activated. If the thumb safety is off and the hammer drop safety is used, the thumb safety can't be engaged, and a double action trigger pull is available. It has a three white dot sight system. Front blade and rear notch are mounted in dovetails so Tritium sights can be installed easily. The rear notch sight can be adjusted to correct for windage error. The forward frame has an accessory rail. The mag release is ambi. Two drop free 10rd mags are included, along with spare barrel o-rings, a lock, a manual, and a case. The single action trigger pull is around 5 pounds and the double action around 12 pounds. The pistol is famous for it's accuracy and life. Test pistols still met the accuracy requirements after 30,000 rounds! I took plenty of photos so you can check it out. The photos were taken right out of the case so there's oil and stuff. I didn't wipe it clean first. Enjoy. I can supply the 12rd model, and spare 12 magazines or magazine kits. I will be glad to sell anywhere it's legal, doing compliance work for a reasonable amount as required. So you California, NY, and NJ shooters don't give up. I'll help you get your guns. Email me to discuss your compliance needs before you bid. If you need a payment plan, email me for the details, again before you bid please. I ship soonest for payments by US postal money order. Other money orders or anything called a check are fine with me but they sit ten business days before I ship. I know, I know, it's a bank check and you trust them. It will sit ten business days before I ship. If you want to expedite the overall transaction, send the US PMO for your final payment. By the way, things are slowed down due to the work overload caused by the gun buying activity. I work long hours doing the best I'm able. That's all I offer you. If you need quicker than the soonest I'm able, you should be buying elsewhere. I'm proud of you Americans for arming yourselves. I pray that THE God supreme intends it for our deliverance and not for our destruction. I can't take credit or debit cards. I won't do business with anti-gun PayPal and neither should you. Look where we are as a nation. If the people had hung the politicians and lawyers sooner, we would be in much better shape. Separate yourself from those who are doing wrong to our country and stand up for our heritage. Today's people do NOT have the right to change America. This was founded a republic not a mobocracy. You'll pay me about what UPS charges me for shipping. Email me if you have questions. Thanks for checking out my auctions. Cheers!"

I realize there is a shortage of .22 lately and you probably could have got more for this box. Thank you for fairness and your respect for a fellow sportsman. 

For those who have made it their goal to capitalize on this shortage and make money off of the good folks that want to participate in their hobby,....... what goes around my friend’s. I am a free market capitalist and an educated man. I believe in making money, supply and demand, but there comes a time when we must think of the big picture folks. This may upset some of you folks, you know who you are, but it needs to be said. $95 for a 500 round box of 22lr is a crime, period.

Again, thank you sir for sticking to your morals, and for those of you that may disagree, go away with these words of wisdom, “we must stand together, or we will surely hang separate”."

Magazine capacity	9 rounds



The CZ Vz.38 pistol, also sometimes referred to simply as CZ-38, was developed in 1937 in an attempt to fullfil requirements, issued by Czechoslovak army, for a sidearm which would be more safe and simple  to handle than previously used CZ Vz.24. New gun was designed by Frantisek Myska, and submitted to military trials early in 1938. After trials, which were consdered sucessful, Czechoslovak army ordered significant numbers of these pistols, but Germans took over the Czechoslovakia before any guns could be delivered. A few guns were delivered to Bulgaria in 1939, but  the rest of the production (about 10 000 guns) was consumed by German police and security forces. Production of this gun has ceased by the end of WW2, and was never resumed later. This is not surprising, as the gun was overly big and heavy for the cartridge it used (9mm Browning Short, also known as 9mm Kurz or .380 ACP). Also, the double action only trigger was too heavy, severely impairing accuracy of fire.

The CZ Vz.38 pistol is a simple blowback operated weapon. It is unusual as its barrel at the muzzle is mounted in the special bushing, which in turn is hinged to the frame. Upon the disassembly, operator pulls back the dismounting slide, located on the left side of the frame, then pulls the rear of the slide up. This causes the barrel and slide to rotate up around the axis, located below the muzzle, and also disengages the slide from return spring, which is located in the frame below the barrel. Once the rear part of the slide is clear off the frame, slide can be bulled back and slid off the barrel. This allows for easy diassembly, cleaning and examination of the barrel bore. The trigger is of double action only type, with external hammer. No manual safeties are provided by default (export Bulgarian version had additional manual safety on the left side of the frame). Magazine is of single stack type, magazine release catch is located at the base of the grip.

All Kimber 1911 pistols have a beveled magazine well that aids quick reloading by guiding the magazine into the frame. Special hex-head screws underscore the elegance of premium Kimber grips.

The Desert Warrior™ .45ACP serves equally well for duty and defense. It is tough, absolutely dependable and very accurate.

Both slide and frame are machined from solid steel and wear Desert Tan KimPro II®, a non-reflective finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to wear, salt and the elements. The Desert Warrior also has an extended ambidextrous thumb safety, plus a short (military length) guide rod for fast takedown. Kimber G-10 grip panels ensure a positive grip regardless of conditions, and a lanyard ring offers additional retention options.

Standard Kimber features like match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing ensure unequaled accuracy. Warrior pistols include a 7-round magazine with extended bumper for fast, positive loading, as well as an extended ambidextrous thumb safety that allows fast operation with either hand. The best pistol to carry is a 1911, and the best 1911 is a Kimber.

Kimber builds the world’s best 1911 pistols right here in America. Every critical component is manufactured inside the Kimber factory. The fi nest raw materials come through the front gate and Kimber does the rest, the only way to ensure that every part meets unequaled standards.

Up for auction is a Rock River Arms upper with a stainless steel bull barrel and Hogue floating handguard resting on a U.S. AUTOWEAPONS lower containing the new Tac Con 3MR trigger. With a little practice (about 10 magazines worth for me) this trigger will allow you to controlably dump rounds down range close to full auto rate of fire. I am selling this because I need to sell a few toys to fund other toys. 
The 3MR trigger is a match grade 4 1/2 pound trigger comparible to such triggers as Giessele triggers and are constructed of nickel teflon coated components. It offers zero take-up and no overtravel. The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight. 3rd Mode Has a Positive Reset Characteristic. The Eotech and the pmag shown in the picture are NOT included in this auction.
