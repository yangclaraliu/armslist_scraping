***Please NOTE:  30 round magazines in photos are not included or for sale***

For sale is my lightly used Kel-Tec SU-16C.  This rifle had about 600 rounds of American Eagle XM193 5.56 through it.  Asking $650 OBO.

I had a few issues with the factory alignment as well as the ejector.  However, I just received it back from Kel-Tec with the problems solved.  

The rifle's stock will fold over metal GI mags but seems to feed slightly better with PMAGs in my experience.  

Overall the rifle performs well and makes a great backpack rifle or bug-out rifle due to its versatility and light weight.  

I am only selling as I have decided to go with Russian AK calibers and no longer use .223 or 5.56 rounds.

For now I wish to make a local F2F sale, so please don't ask me to ship it.

Rifle comes with a Yankee Hill Phantom Flash Hider/Compensator combo (5C2),  original 10 round magazine and sight adjustment tool.

Let me know if you have any interest or questions!  Thanks!

I have a Colt 1911 stamped ""US Property"" ""United states army"" from 1918. It has petina, it is not prestine, it fires flawlessly but for 96 years old, its pretty sweet. 
What you see is what you get. 

I am open for trades if you are realistic. If you spent $1000 on a DPMS sportacle during gun scare that is not what I value it at. I build ARs on the side job so I wouldn't suggest offering me ARs as I have too many as is. 

I am interested in M1a, MAK90, Glock 19s, Sig 220, Sig 245, 24"" AR15, AR parts, Kimbers, 300 winmag bolt gun, or Sniper style rifles. 

I will hear any and all offers, worst I will say is no. Don't get your feelings hurt. I have had this gun for a while and I have no problem keeping it for my kids. In other words, I do not need the cash so lowballing me gets you no where at all. 
If your trade is not enough add cash or other guns.

Ranger® Bonded handgun ammunition was specifically created to deliver maximum penetration through the toughest of barriers. This effectiveness is made possible thanks to the Winchester proprietary core/jacket bonding process—and is enhanced with a special hollow point cavity that acts in unison to control expansion, leading to maximum weight retention and deep penetration through hard and abrasive barriers including auto glass. Selected by federal law enforcement agencies for their .40 and 9mm caliber service rounds, the Ranger Bonded gives you the penetration to handle the most serious of threats.

Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat.

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

I chose this scope specifically as it is built to withstand a heavier beating.  What's great about this scope is that the black reticles, if they are placed on anything black, they turn to a gold color.  The scope itself was over $200 and the setup is perfect for shooting in the swamps or putting a bead on a black boar or even a black bear up in Georgia and the 45-70 round is perfect for punching through the undergrowth.  I never got a chance to use it though and instead got accepted to school, so I have tuition to pay.  I can sell the gun separately as well."

I've got 320 rounds of ammunition I could include for the right price. 20 rounds are the Hornady Zombie Max, the rest are 100 round boxes of Winchester white box.

Has been a safe queen for the last few years. This revolver is for serious handgun hunters and probably the most versatile handgun hunting platform ever made. Using the 200 grain loading, this gun is capable of 200 yd shots on medium game. For bigger game, heavier bullets are available that are capable of taking any game that walks in North America. If less recoil is desired, this gun can also use the.454 casull cartridge. For just plinking around, this gun can also shoot the .45 long colt. The .45 long colt can also be hand loaded hot to produce performance equal to the .44 mag. Because of the gun's weight and super efficient muzzle brake, recoil is very manageable and easy to shoot. Also comes with black nylon shoulder holster, black nylon zip-up case, RCBS .460 S&W 3 piece die set, Hornady .454 casual 4 piece titanium nitride die set, 18 rounds of loaded .460 +39 pieces of once fired brass, 41 rounds of .454 casual +113 pieces of once fired brass, 56 pieces of once fired .45 long colt brass.

The parts you can’t see on these sage green desert boots are equally important: non-metallic shanks, dual-density ball and heel cushion, and Converse Shock Eliminator technology that lets the tactical boot take the pounding, not your feet. Removable FOOTFORCE comfort insole provides arch support and heel stabilization to keep leg and back pain at bay for hours. Non-metallic lacing hardware will not rust or corrode, and allows rapid donning. Nubuck non-metallic sage green Desert Boots feature a side zipper for quick donning and a consistent fit.

Converse is a company that has more than a 100 years of experience. Putting its research and development teams to the test, Converse has come up with a fine selection of duty footwear that’s designed to keep you comfortable. After all, this is a company that took into account feedback from real people when it came time to make its selection of tactical and desert boots.

Available in a variety of sizes and styles for both men and women, Converse tactical and military boots feature top shelf construction as well as features to make the wearer’s experience even better. Take for example the Converse “Da Beast” Tactical Military Boot. This bad boy is lighweight, waterproof, and has a removable cushion insole for extra comfort. Plus it has dual density outsole with direct attached PU midsole and “Road Grabber” rubber traction. All around, these are a solid pair of boots.

Converse military boots and Converse tactical boots are also incredibly affordable, making them a great choice for anyone. With desert boots for the military and tactical boots for law enforcement available in the selection, it’s easy to see that Converse is a brand that wants to fit you – no matter what your occupation.


Converse Composite Safety Toe Sage Green Air Force Side Zipper Boots C8990

Our most popular Air Force Sage boot for over 8 years, this full grain leather and nylon aviation boot wraps feet in all-day comfort and support whenever and wherever you need them to. Whether on the flight line, hangar floor, in an ops briefing room or the cockpit, these Converse composite toe side zip USAF boots are built for the rigors of military aviation in the air and on the ground.

This high performance boot has safety, stability and comfort built right in. The dual-density ball-and-heel cushioning Shock Eliminator technology protects feet and returns energy with every step; the removable polyurethane Footforce molds itself to the shape of your feet and never loses its cushioning and shock-absorbing properties. Heel cup and foot stabilizers align ankles and heels to reduce stress on ankles and knees. Plus, an elongated podiatric arch support gives that extra touch of support, stability and supreme comfort throughout the day.

Shanks and lacing hardware are non-metallic and security-friendly while the side-zip feature makes for quick on-off action and snug, secure fit. The ANSI-rated composite safety toe protects against injury and compression wounds.
Benefits of the Converse Safety Toe Sage Green Side Zipper Boots

    ANSI Class 75 composite safety toe
    Lightweight and flexible construction makes working around aircraft easier, whether you’re climbing in and out of the cockpit, loading pallets or re-fuelling
    Sage green leather and 1200 denier nylon uppers have that classic tactical Air Force look and feel while working hard to keep feet safe, protected and breathable at all times
    Non-metallic construction is security-friendly
    Side zipper with Velcro tab allows for quick on-off action and keeps boots done up securely at all times reducing the risk of catching on foreign objects inside the aircraft
    Removable F2 Footforce comfort insole provides arch and heel support and stabilization to prevent leg and back pain
    Dual density ball and heel cushions support strategic areas of the foot that can be vulnerable to over-use
    Built-in shock eliminator absorbs shock and returns energy with every step
    Outsole is high abrasion, slip-resistant, non-marking and features a dual density trail for great tread
    Sole is slip, chemical and oil resistant, great for working around aircraft I just bought these Converse boots. That's right, Converse makes military grade boots. They're a little unconventional but they're more padded than my old boots, and they have that slick side zipper so I don't have to lace and unlace constantly. They got what's called a ""composite toe"". It's not metal, and in fact no part of the boots are metal, so I wouldn't set off security gates and more important for me they don't conduct electricity. Not to mention the cool sage green color"

-- First, a NIB Millett Buck Gold 2-8x40 scope.  Asking $85. These are solid, well built, fantastic scopes with crystal clear optics. I bought two--one is atop a 243 and this one never saw the light of day. Roughly on par with the Bushnell 3200 series in terms of optics quality--maybe a slight step below--but these are built much tougher. Full lifetime warranty from Millett--all paperwork included. This particular model (2-8x) was discontinued but you can still find info on the Millett website about the Buck Gold line. Scope was never mounted and only taken out for pics. I noticed there's a small nick in one of the turret caps--doesn't impact it but figured I'd mention it.

-- Next is a brand new Bushnell model 76-3945 AV 3-9x40 with rings.  Asking $45.  I pulled this off of a Savage Axis I bought my oldest son--traded him for something a little nicer I had sitting around. It was mounted and boresighted (as it came from the factory). The glass is nice and clear.   No box.

Willing to ship any scope for cost of shipping + Paypal fees or PMO.

22 ammo is expensive and hard to find while pellets are cheap and easy to get.  

You can get up to 1,200 feet per second with one pump of the break barrel action.  I believe that is with the very light alloy pellets, you will get just a bit less speed with normal lead pellets, but the heavier pellet hits harder and I have read that they are more accurate.

 It has fiber optic sights, red in the rear and green at the muzzle.

This gun shoots great, please note that this is the NITRO PISTON model that shoots with less noise and vibration of the spring models. I have a 1x30 Red Dot Scope (also can show a green dot) available with the rifle.

Tactical Ambush brand, 16"", M4 feed ramps, mid-length gas port, NOT chrome lined, 5.56 chamber, 1:7 twist. 

There is a small ding on the end of the barrel that can be seen in the last picture. Just a minor cosmetic issue. I was going to dress it with a file and touch it up with a little paint. The finish overall is pretty poor. It looks kind of ""streaky"". A little gun oil might make it look better. You can see small burrs inside the barrel from where the gas port was drilled but those should disappear after your first shot.

Its barrel is hammer forged into a one inch equilateral triangle, with its vertices truncated to form 0.410"" joining radii. Measuring at the radii, and Ignoring the flats, there is the same 0.820"" muzzle diameter found on other Remington models like the Sendero or VFS.

 Triangular forms are great for stiffening spans and suppressing group dispersing vibration. Truncating the vertices of a triangle and joining the sides with arches further enhances stiffening compared to round, basic triangular or hexagonal forms. The unique shape of the VTR provides 16% greater surface area than a round barrel for improved cooling and the overall metal removal reduces barrel weight by roughly 8%.

 ""The new Model 700™ VTR™ desert RECON (in Digital Desert camo) features Remington's patent-pending triangular barrel contour that offers reduced weight over traditional heavy barrels, yet delivers optimum heat dissipation and rigidity.

 Built on the famous Model 700™ cylindrical action, Remington® Varmint rifles are the most accurate factory-built models we produce. You'll be stunned by the degree of precision you get straight out of the box. The varmints won't be so lucky!""

 Included is rifle, manual (If i can find it), soft case, and bipod mount.
 The rifle has around 200 rounds max fired through it.
 The only flaw with this rifle is a paint scratch on the magazine floor plate. Most people would probably replace this part to adapt a removable mag anyhow. It is not a major deal.

 Thanks for reading.

It comes with a manufacturer warranty and Colt guarantees this rifle to have sub-MOA groupings.  At just $1,200 this rifle is a steal.  Included with the rifle is a clean low travel single stage trigger (breaks at roughly 4 lb. pull), optics (a Sightmark 3x magnifier set behind an Sightmark multi-reticle reflex sight), and rail covers. The Monolithic upper provides much more room for mounting optics without the worry of sacrificing accuracy. 

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions and four rails positions for mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found traditional handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating 16.1” chrome lined barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range shooting.

Considering the money I've put into the rifle, minimal use (less than 300 rounds or 10 mags fired), and the extra's being included, this awesome rife is priced to sell at just $1,200.  Please email any offers you would like me to consider.  If you have interest, please email me at REDACTED.  Alternatively, I may be reached at REDACTED.

Lo and behold = when he got home, he had ammunition for a rifle he doesn't have! $40 down the tubes...unless...If you have a .300 WSM rifle,  and want some ammunition, this is either for sale or trade. You can buy it for $35 or even better, if you have some ammunition to trade, that would work. A box of .300 Win Mag would be best, but we shoot lots of different calibers in this family. I'll try to list them below. 

Contact me through Craigslist here with your number and I will give you a call. I couldn't make fun of my son too much, since I have made the same mistake before. Oh well, live and learn.
