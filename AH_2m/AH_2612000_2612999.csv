Forgot to ad, only reason I am selling/looking to trade is wife keeps complaining that the slide is too hard to cycle.  She loves her XD SubCompact in 9mm, she loves her HK USP Compact in 9mm, but wants something smaller, and she really liked the feel of my XDS in .45.

I am pretty firm on the price as I know it's a great deal.  The ONLY trades I would be willing to consider would be for a S&W Shield in 9mm, or an XDS 9mm plus cash on your end ($300 - she would ""Prefer"" the XDS, but said the S&W would ""Be okay too"").  We're up late so don't feel shy about texting REDACTED.  I can meet pretty much anywhere in the DFW area at any time you want.  The LOWEST I will go is $800 cash without the ammo.  Other than the ammo, the package will not be seperated.  Thanks."

Please read carefully. I'm updating this listing in hopes of eliminating flakes or buyers who want to meet up for 4AM transactions. Here is how this is going to work. Send me an offer only if you have a Pay Pal account! If I accept your offer I will ask you to fund my Pay Pal account with half (of our agreed upon price) via Pay Pal gift. Then pay the other half in person. Sorry I'm not ship at this time. You can check my feed back on eBay. My user name is GunTuners. This is not a scam this is the only way I can help eliminate all the late night flakes that have spent the last 3 hours flooding my inbox. This lot of ammo should stock you up for your next range trip or rat hunt out east. Priority goes to buyer who offers to take the whole lot. No sales to minors! Please bring valid Oregon DMV or Military issued I.D. Buyer will meet me at a public location in Philomath. If ammo does not sell here this week it will be sold elsewhere on Saturday the 1st. So don't hesitate to lock this stuff in, or you could settle for the junk that's trickling into Bi-Mart and Wal-Mart and being immediately sold in the parking lots for triple the value.  Ok, round two. Lets try this again. Happy shopping!"

This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It has a super smooth hand honed hand tuned action from the custom shop. AI hand made the stock out of a piece of super fancy walnut with amazing figure and fiddle running the full length of the blank. They also gave it 8 coats of there hand rubbed oil finish. They then installed there all steel chassis system which gives there rifles the amazing strength and accuracy. The flure de lure checkering was done by a lady who is a master engraver with Colt Firearms she also hand engraved the floor plate. This rifle will out shoot the 338 lapua all day long and look amazing doing it. Will punch holes right thru steel plates at 600 yards all day long. Will come with a weatherby 3by9 supreme scope in mint condition. Also a one of only 200 made NRA limited edition slings. I have been getting a lot of screwball and goofball offers for trades and purchase. Do your homework before you say stupid things you know nothing about. Research the caliber and the rifle maker before you make a stupid offer. Once you know what your talking about ill be happy to talk with you all you want. This rifle cost well 4000 to build.

This is my wife's aunt's rifle that she had in a case in her basement for the past 40+ years.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look too good but I was wondering what an antique's gun broker would estimate the value.  I recently took the rifle to a local gunsmith for his opinion about restoring it and he said not to waste my money.  That is his opinion, but I feel there is more value in the rifle than what he stated.

If anyone knows what it is worth in its current condition or what it's potential worth could be properly restored by an antique's specialist... please feel free to contact me.

So this is what I just learned about this gun from a few folks viewing out my advertisement... ""The Remington Rolling Block rifle was a breech-loading rifle produced from the mid-1860s into the early 20th century by E. Remington and Sons (later Remington Arms Company). The action was extremely strong, and could easily withstand the increased pressure of the new smokeless powders coming into use by the late 1880s.

It was made in a variety of calibers, both rimfire and centerfire, including the 12.17x42 mm rimfire, 12.17x44 mm rimfire and 12.17x44 mm rimmed centerfire Swedish and Norwegian cartridges, .43 Spanish (11.15x58mmR), .50-70, .45-70, and later in .22 caliber. Later models were produced in .30-06 Springfield, 7×57mm Mauser, and 8×50mmR Lebel.  During World War I, the British Royal Navy purchased 4,500 Rolling Block rifles in 7mm Mauser from Remington's leftover stock after production had ended, issuing them to the crews of minesweepers and Q-ships"". http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remington_Rolling_Block_rifle

This is my wife's aunt's rifle that she had in a case in her basement for the past 40+ years. Unfortunately, it's not in the best condition but I was wondering what an antique's gun broker would estimate the value. I recently took the rifle to a local gunsmith for his opinion about restoring it and he said not to waste my money. That is his opinion, but I feel there is more value in the rifle than what he stated.

If anyone knows what it is worth in its current condition or what it's potential worth could be properly restored by an antique's specialist... please feel free to contact me. 

Please call Brian at REDACTED. Thanks."

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

These unique AR15s have a proprietary switch barrel system that requires no tools. under the monolithic rail is a slide lock. release the lock slide it forward to expose 2 cam levers. Swing the cam levers out to 90 degrees and pull the barrel and gas tube free of the receiver. Change the bolt or simply have a new carrier/bolt set up ready, install and done. Can be achieved in seconds. 
The truly unique part of the MGI Hydra is the lower receiver. The problem with multi cal AR15s always revolves around the magazine well. 7.62x39 ar15 magazines are renowned for their unreliability, Pistol calibers for their finicky magazine blocks, and limitations of calibers by the size of the mag well. MGI fixed that in this design. The magazine well slide into and locks on machined rails in the receiver. Yes...the magazine well is removable. The magazine wells take the ammunition's native magazine. The 7.62x39 takes AK mags, 9mm takes glock mags with no block needed. Everything from .22lr to .50 beouwulf is already available. Conversion Kits can be ordered directly from MGI and come with magazine well barrel and bolt specific to the caliber and the mag well specific to magazine used. They are also the only ones offering a .308/762x51 conversion in an AR15 (not AR10 frame) by using their mag well and magazine.....why have to carry several rifles or have to keep several on hand. One AR can do it all. Saves space and carry loads.
Comes with over sized pistol case that holds upper lower and 2 barrels Plus ammo can with mags and ammo.

I love these pistols.  So much that I put in a apex trigger/sear that made it much a good gun into a great CC with excellent accuracy. Trigger pull is just under 5 lbs. The only fault with these is that they don't have night sights.  So I had Truglo's added.

I decided to trick it out  but it would be gone for months for the milling, stripping and refinishing.  So, I bought another and kept this one until the new one was finished to my satisfaction.

Now that I have the 2nd one finished, I simply don't need two.

So, for sale is a Like new with truglo night sights, and apex duty trigger kit installed.
Feel free to shop that is $250 in extras not counting tax and installation.

It is priced to move it to the person who sees the value in the add-ons.  (in other words, not interested in removing the add-ons or trades).

Comes with everything S&W sold me.  Box, 2 mags and 3 different sized backstraps.
(except their test casing-you will have to make your own)

$550.


May consider selling the C/T for it ($375 new, let it go for an additional $250 but not less, it works great and like new as well)

You must have a current NC ID and CC permit.  Willing to show it and sign a bill of sale.

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

Currently has 240K for miles but dont let them scare you. it was a shop truck for many years with highway miles just picking up parts. I have been around a lot of lightnings in my time and this one is solid. No trades, only selling because im selling both my cars to upgrade to something else. hasnt been daily driven for 5 years now so the miles will not go up. Asking 8200 obo cash talks and im a motivated seller, truck has just over 5K in upgrades. You wont find many cars this fun/fast and defiantly no trucks for this price! Only thing needed would be tires and i will absolutely keep that in mind while negotiating a price. You can email or text me and ill get a picture over to you of any shot you want.

Constructed of premium horsehide, the Royal Guard has the rough side of the leather out for greater stability in the pants, while the smooth side of the leather lies against the handgun for a slicker draw feel. The butt-forward cant increases concealability when worn behind the strong hip, while the addition of a raised sweat guard protects both the handgun and the gun carrier. The new black-colored metal-reinforced mouth allows easy one-handed return to the holster. The Royal Guard is supplied with removable black belt loops fitting belts up to 1¾”, with optional 1¼” belt loops available for wear with narrower dress belts. All these features combine to make a truly professional-grade IWB holster.

Appraised by 3 different reputable gunshops, all 3 valued it between $275-$350 in it's current condition, price varied due to the market, so at only $195.00 its more than a fair price, so save your lowball offers.
