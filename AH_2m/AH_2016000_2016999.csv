This is a refurbished rifle - probably in the Ukraine as noted by the markings on the butt stock.  This is a numbers matching rifle which means the barrel, bolt, magazine and butt plate serial numbers are matched.  The magazine, as with many, was force matched during the refurbishment process as noted by the ""line out"" of the old serial number and the restamping of the new one.  The rifle has an excellent, like new, bore, is not counter-bored and has an excellent crown.  The stock has some chipping of the shellac and some scratches, but nothing serious and does not detract from the overall appearance of the rifle. The stock has many interesting cartouches as well.  This rifle has been meticulously cleaned and maintained in a low humidity environment. The rifle has no rust. Firing pin protrusion has been set and headspace is perfect. The firing chamber is immaculate and chambers/extracts rounds easily.  The trigger is very crisp for a Russian 9130. There is no residual cosmoline (axle grease) on this rifle, although the stock may ""sweat"" a little in the sun.

Overall this is a very nice example of the Mosin Nagant 3-line rifle and is ready to shoot right out of the box. As with all used firearms, however, the buyer should ensure safety by having a licensed gunsmith inspect the rifle prior to shooting.

I will include a bayonet (non matching), a couple ammo pouches, a sling, an oil can and cleaning kit if you desire.  If FTF transaction, I will throw in 20 rounds of ammo free.

Purchase requirements:

I prefer a face to face meeting within the State of Michigan but will ship at the buyer's  expense.  I WILL NOT ship out of the state of Michigan without first receiving payment and a signed copy of the transferee's FFL. C&R is ok. It is the buyer's responsibility to know if this rifle is legal to purchase in their state.

I WILL NOT ship within the State of Michigan unless first receiving payment.  Unfortunately, I will have to ship to an FFL and would need a copy of that license prior to shipping.

Payment:

Payment can be made via PayPal (gift to friends and family), personal check, POSTAL Money Order if shipped. Note, that I have to ensure a personal check clears prior to shipping.  That could take up to a week.  If FTF, cash is required.  If you want additional pictures, I will be happy to send them to you.  Thank you for looking."

I mounted this on my AK and decided to go a different route.

UltiMAK M1-B optic mount. Its Picatinny style rail is positioned well below the iron sight axis, making this the lowest optic mount available for the AK. With a tubular sight mounted low, you will be able to use your optic without a comb riser and still use your regular hold. The system allows for co witnessing (the ability to use your iron sights right through a 1x sight as a back-up sighting system) when used with a tubular reflex sight. This heavy duty mount replaces the original steel gas tube and upper handguard, so it adds less than one ounce to the weight of the rifle, making it by far the lightest optic mount installation in the world. The forward positioning of the optic gives you faster, easier and more natural targeting while maintaining your full field of view. Multiple target or moving target engagements, with both eyes open, become second nature.

Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include .75” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands.

Sidenote!  This G17 has had the grip slightly modified(shortened at the bottom) to accept Glock 19 mags.  I did this because it basically gives the G17 a G19 grip and is therefore a bit smaller feeling in the hand than a full size G17 grip.  See pics.  Grip still fills the hand but does not hang out the bottom of your hand.  The mags that come with the gun are Glock 19 (15rd) mags."

Super Black Eagle is the 3 ½"" round semiautomatic that embodies all Benelli’s research and technology. The Comfortech system significantly reduces recoil on firing and allows a rapid return to target. Barrels and chokes are cryogenically treated for excellent accuracy. The trigger guard, with its aggressive design and personality, allows rapid access to the trigger and ensures a solid and safe grip. Power, comfort, accuracy, stability, shooting speed and reliable operation: the Super Black Eagle is all of this.

Asking $1,100 - will consider partial handgun trades (I have current MN Carry Permit) or use as partial trade for a motorcycle.

The Model 845 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
