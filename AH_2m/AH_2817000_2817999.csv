I have run out of time, money, and interest in this project. I just want to get it out of the way and start new on another boat. Lets start with the trailer. It was brand new tires but the trailer lights are busted out. Brand new wires so reinstalling lights would not be a daunting task. Needs sanding and a little paint on trailer wouldn't hurt to replace carpet on boat holders. The hull of the boat is in fair condition its just an ugly old bass boat. the transom has been replaced and there is a small leak coming from the drain hole. Other than that the boat rides and fishes decent when motor is running. The motor is a 1981 (i think) Mercury 40HP 2 Stroke that is not running because the Control box is fried. I had just replaced the Stator ($250) when the control box went out. I have been told that this is common when you replace one and not the other. Also comes with old fish finder that works and Minn Kota Power Drive V2 trolling motor. It has been on water twice and i still have box for it as well as a replacement prop. the batteries i have are garbage so I'm just going to recycle them. Original plan for the boat was to build a larger deck area on bow for a bass boat type platform. Then it changed to burn the hull and start new on an aluminum jon boat. now i just want out. I would even take a trade for an older 4 wheeler (250cc or larger) in working condition or some guns ( run it by me all i can say is no). Please no super low ball offers i have put a lot of time and money into this project and am anticipating a loss already so don't make it worse. $700 cash obo"

The optics are beautiful and crisp. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. The rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase.

I have not even popped the steel band that holds the crate secure. 

My price is $205 and it is firm. If you look around the web, there seems to be very little on the market right now. The place I bought this from, SGAMMO.com, has none. The market price has risen a little since I bought this, and people are gouging on Armslist ($300+). I'm asking what I paid for it.

Below is the description of the lot that I bought these from. The picture is also from their website. If you want, I can send pictuers of the crate I have at my house, which oddly enough looks exactly like the picture.

880 rd crate - 7.62x54R Rissian 148 grain Light Ball Silver Tip ammo manufactured in the 1970s.

The ammo itself is 1970s production, mostly 1975 from factory 188 in Russia. Real Cold-War Soviet era Russian made ammo with copper washed steel cases for smooth function. The bullet is 148 grain silver tip steel core. Packages 20 rounds per bundle, 22 bundles in a hermatically sealed spam can, 2 cans per crate.

This is the surplus ammo regarded by most Mosin Nagant and PSL enthusiasts as the ""finest"" made. We have sold large quantities of this ammo many times before and it is extremely nice ammo manufactured to perfection. Truly some of the finest quality surplus ammo ever available. The ammo is in like new condition packed in hermetically sealed 'spam cans'. This ammo appears to all be 1970s production but there may be cases outside of this range in the mix. You must order a full 880 round crate to get a can opener tool."

This is the most beautiful Walnut stock I have ever seen on one of these Marlin Carbines. 

Marlin only made this gun a few years (1966-1978). It was styled to resemble the 
US Army M1 carbine, with eighteen inch barrel, handguard, barrel band, nine shot magazine even with the end of the stock! This was prior to making the cheaper and widely popular model 60. This features the better walnut stock VS the newer birch stock. It also has a brass feed tube instead of the steel one found on the model 60. 

If the buyer lives in South Carolina I would have no problem in having them picking up the gun in person so they can save shipping and transfer charges. I do not sell to California or Florida. I DO NOT TAKE PERSONAL CHECKS I only except Money orders or Bank Checks.

I have shot less than 50 rounds through it and have done a little cycling with snap caps. Therefore, it has very little wear visible at all. It shoots awesome, just like any H&K. Below is H&K's website for the P30 if you don't know what it is.

http://www.hk-usa.com/civilian_products/p30_general.asp

If you don't know much about H&Ks, consider this: during a 2009-2010 endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures. That is most likely more rounds than most of us will put through a single firearm in our entire lives. Are there people who shoot more? Sure, but most of us don't come near.

My price is $850. That is about $100 less than you can find it around the web (a true Variant 1, not one that has been modified to be a Variant 1). The way I look at it, this gun is basically new, and when buying from me you don't have to pay taxes, ship it, transfer it, do a background check, have the ATF know you have it, etc, etc, etc... 

That said, I will not sell it to anyone who I know cannot legally own it. You must provide a current Ohio DL (prefer CHL) if you are going to buy this face-to-face. If you buy this from afar, it must go to an FFL licenced dealer and will be shipped by my FFL licenced dealer. You must pay shipping. If bought from afar, you will have a 3 day inspection period with no firing (you would still pay original shipping AND return shipping) After that, or after you fire it, there will be no refunds."

The Crosman nightstalker is a whole new ballgame, because it has blow-back action. It's a revolver but functions as a semi-auto. Not just another pretty face, the sci-fi design of the ergonomic synthetic stock is a reflection of the technology and thought that went into making this rifle. Crosman's unique Mohawk sighting system includes a rear aperture sight with two hole sizes, and you can quickly switch from one to the other by flipping the sight. No tools required. Plus, the front sight is also adjustable. You'll acquire targets much quicker. If you like scopes, red dots or lasers, you can easily mount one on the 11mm dovetails. Powered by an AirSource CO2 cartridge, the rifle will give you up to 350 shots.

Boasting power throughout its feature set, the gun has automatic blowback re-cocking, a firing velocity of up to 580-feet-per-second (FPS), and can fire 12 shots in a row, as quickly as you can pull the trigger.
An AirSource 88-gram cylinder feeds up to 350 rounds without replacement. The exclusive Mohawk Sight System lets you sight those shots via your choice of two differently sized peep sights with adjustability for windage, as well as a unique front sight that's fully adjustable for multiple elevation levels.

You all know what a 19 is, so I won't go into a long drawn out description.

It does however have a Grip Force Adapter kit installed. Which is basically like adding a beavertail from a 1911 style pistol to the 19. For me, it eliminated the bite I would get from the slide due to my over sized hands. It is removeable for those of you who wish to go back to factory. 

It also has an extended slide release, and extended magazine release. Both Glock Factory parts. As well as an aluminum American Flag etched slide plate cover.

I am a huge fan of the Ruger striker fire and the SR line as I own a Ruger SR22, Ruger SR9, Ruger SR9c, and the Ruger SR45. I am selling it as I would like to take the funds and put them towards a 1911.

I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

1st review
 I've carried this as my primary duty weapon for over 15 years. It's never jammed, or malfunctioned in any way. I qualify in the high 90's with it consistently. It has fixed sights, but is very accurate, lightweight and also is my off duty weapon. Very concealable for a full size 9mm.

2ND Review
Own one and carry with me all the time , purchased approx. 10 years ago, the most dependable and accurate handgun I ever owned, excellent handgun.

3rd Review
Me too. Mine is probably 12-14 years old and has the big magazines. I carried as my duty weapon for many years and used it when I updated my Range Master certificates...Never has a jam or stovepipe. I carry it occasionally now; I have smaller lighter easier to conceal autos that I usually carry

4rh review
I carried this on duty and off duty for several years and never has a problem with it.

5th Review
Have owned this model since 1996 and have had no problems with it whatsoever. I carry it on and off duty with or without a holster. It feels quite comfortable (for me, anyway) tucked in my waistband when off duty. No problems hitting what I'm aiming at on the range. Haven't priced them lately, but the $500 listed on the Gear Review page is about right, if not a bit lower than what I paid for mine. All in all a 'handy' and quite good hand gun."

The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board in India, soon after the Sino-Indian War of 1962.  you can text me for a faster response but i do check my emails as well.

This pistol was fam fired or shot for qualification, but that's it.  Everything about it is museum quality.  All markings on slide and frame are correct, including lightly struck Ordnance Stamp behind left grip at top.  I've tried to get as much detail as possible in close up photos.  Smaller marks include ""P"" just behind magazine release and on top of slide forward of rear sight.  There are also capital letters ""GHD"" on left side of frame between trigger cut and grip.  There is a very small ""W"" and triangle at the top of the trigger guard on the left side, and a ""21"" at the same place on the right.  Brown plastic grips, lanyard on butt, checkered hammer and trigger, blued barrel and magazine are all correct.  The only mark on the gun is a slight rub from slide on barrel at ejection port, consistent with very limited use.  This Colt is as good as they get, and it comes with Enger-Kress M-3 shoulder holster, also issued to the Navigator above, and in astonishingly good condition for a piece of leather over seventy years old."

An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors.

Not to mention it just looks cool! Except for the snakeskin metal treatment, this pistol is identical to the Executive Elite in all respects. This no-nonsense design has an elegant simplicity that has yet to be matched. The Kobra is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different.

It does have the monsoon sound system with 6 disc changer and steering wheel controls, moonroof, dual power seats with leather and suede inserts, information cluster, heads up display, remote start, gets great gas mileage.

I have the original intake that goes with it. I'm asking $12,500 obo that's with newer hancook ventus v4 and the K&N"

914,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2817914,For Sale:  Slide Fire SSAR-15 SBS Bump Fire Stock AR15 Right Handed,"Hopkins, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 260,"Listed On: Sunday, March 16, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand new in box! Up for bid is a Slide Fire SSAR-15 SBS bump fire stock for an AR15. Right Hand. The Slide Fire Solutions SSAR-15 SBS (Standard Battle Stock) Bump Fire Buttstock is the latest iteration of the company's groundbreaking SSAR-15 OGR Original Bump Fire Stock, incorporating the same performance, reliability, and superior craftsmanship of the OGR with a new look designed to appear similar to many of today's popular, modern battle rifle stocks. The SSAR-15 SBS allows the shooter to safely bump fire their AR-15 from the shoulder, effectively and legally simulating fully automatic fire, and allowing for an unprecedented measure of control that is severely lacking when attempting to bump fire a rifle in the traditional, ""from-the-hip"" manner. The SSAR-15 features a shelf that positions the shooter's index finger in a fixed position in front of the rifle's trigger. To fire, the upper receiver is moved forward with the support hand pushing on the forend, thereby bringing the trigger to the shooter's finger and discharging a round. The rifle's recoil causes the upper receiver to move rearward, allowing the trigger mechanism to reset. When the right amount of constant forward pressure is applied, the rifle will continue to fire as the trigger is brought forward and depressed by the shooter's stationary index finger, causing the gun to Bump Fire. With a little practice, the shooter will be capable of delivering accurate single shots, bursts, or even full magazine dumps on demand using the SSAR-15. The SSAR-15 is designed for installation onto any Mil-Spec Diameter AR-15 Collapsible Stock Receiver Extension Buffer Tube. Installation involves removing the factory pistol grip, replacing it with the included Interface Block, and sliding the SSAR-15 onto the buffer tube. No permanent modifications or gunsmithing required! Each SSAR-15 assembly includes the SBS Buttstock, an Interface Block, Hex Key, Instructions, BATFE Approval Letter and Lifetime Factory Warranty. Made in the USA. Payment I can do a F2F and prefer cash, however if you would like I can ship the item to you if you pay shipping cost.

This is a basically brand new rifle 10 rounds fired. I had a 3x9-40 Nikon on the gun initially when it was sighted in last year and took it off to put it on another gun because it wasn't powerful enough for the distance and accuracy of this rifle. I bought a brand new Oculus 4-16x44 mil-dot side focus and put on and bore sighted it only at the first of the year. I bought the gun planning to coyote hunt and never went. Gun comes with case and 4 boxes of 32 grain Hornady ammo minus ten rounds. Below is Rugers specs from the website. I'm selling gun, scope, and case for $950, if you want the rifle only it's $800 firm. I've got around $1296 invested not counting taxes. Trades welcome trade value is $1100. I also have a new bipod and sling I will throw in for the $950.  This is a great deal if you've tried to find one of these.

3.3"" Black Stainless Steel Polymer Frame 6rd +1
738 TCP is the lightest semi-auto in the Taurus line; plus it's lighter than any Taurus small frame revolver. The 738 TCP offers 6+1 shots of .380 ACP, a durable polymer frame and low-profile fixed sights.
This is a great little pistol, and a nice shooter. Less than 100 rounds fired. Meticulously cared for and cleaned after use. Shows slight signs of wear since it has been carried in the kydex holster pictured. The kydex holster is included in my asking price. Also included are two spare mags, which would not come with the pistol if you were to purchase new. Look around online, they’re not cheap. I have the original box and paperwork, and the two locking keys used to secure the firearm while stored.
This is the lightest, slimmest and smallest gun I have owned, and just about the easiest firearm to conceal. When carried in the kydex IWB holster at about 4-5 o’clock it just disappears, and you can barely even feel that it’s there. Nobody ever knows that I’m carrying when I carry this one. It draws smoothly from the kydex, but is held securely enough that it would never fall out. This pistol can also be pocket-carried very easily, which I do sometimes as well. Same thing, it barely prints at all and looks like maybe a cell phone or a wallet.
At this time I prefer to sell, but might entertain a trade for an M&P shield in 9mm only.
