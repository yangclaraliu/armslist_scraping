This will usually pull up a link to the site the ad was ""borrowed"" from.

Scammers usually register day of listing if they register at all. Typically they put up 3 items like AR's, all with different backgrounds in the pics. Usually if you google the name of the listing you will find it's a gunbroker auction. You can also search images in google as well. If you see the word auction in the listing it's probably cut and pasted from an auction site. If the seller has items listed in 3 different non contiguous states, probably a scam. Many legitimate sellers will put there location down as ""state, state"" such as ""Oklahoma, Oklahoma"" but scammers do this as well.

My understanding is that these were police used guns in germany. It comes with a sig sauer box, police holster, 3 mag pouches, and 5 mags. It also comes with a really nice new right hand leather holster ( I believe desantis).  Also comes with new complete spring replacement kit and roll pins $26 value. This is a good shooter. This handgun is very comfortable, and shoots very well. The rifleing is very good, probably not shot much. The blueing on slide shows a lot of wear, prabably from being in leather holster.

Never an issue with any ammo or anything whatsoever. I trust my life with this gun. Shows some normal wear but no abuse or anything that affects safety or operation in any way. I treat others like I want to be treated and expect the same. I have plenty of pictures if interested.

We do not certify our casings as ""once-fired"". We collect our brass from several public ranges, sort it, clean it, inspect it, and sell it. We visually inspect each case for defects as our experience tell us. We feel certain 95% or more of these casings are ""once fired"" but we did not buy, shoot or were present when the new ammo was fired. To represent them as such would not be the right thing to do.

Rifle casing orders are filled with the exact quantity ordered. All pistol casing orders are filled with the quantity ordered plus 10% in additional casings.

9-shot round ball, plus one shot .20 gauge shotgun!
I always wanted to handle one of these;  Possibly the most interesting black powder pistol made!  A RECENT CLOSE EXAMINATION SHOWS THAT THE PISTOL APPEARS TO BE UNFIRED! very minor light rust near a few nipples.   Barrel and cylinder are excellent condition.  It has just come to light that the former owner was a C.W. Reinactor, and apparently belt-carried the pistol resulting in some dings near the knurled knob in front of the cylinder. I would have to call this 90% or better.  More pictures on request.
NOTE:  After taking a series of pictures and examining the bores and cylinder bores, I would have to describe the various bores and chambers as looking ""unfired"".  One small line of  rust under the blue behind the cylinder shield in a corner; and then there are the dings.  Otherwise, pretty nice.  Remember, retail is over $1K"

Bersa Firestorm .380 Review: Not top-of-the-line, but hard to pass up
3/12/12 | by Jim Downey   3 44
The Bersa Firestorm
Bersa is an Argentine firearms company that isn’t hugely known in the U.S., which is a bit of a shame because generally the Bersa handguns I have handled were quite nice and very good bargains. The Bersa Firestorm .380 ACP is no exception to this.

In this review I will also reference the Bersa Thunder as well as the Firestorm because the two are pretty much the same gun. The Firestorm model is actually assembled in the U.S. with Argentine parts, and, in the end, has only a couple of very minor differences. Since the Firestorm is the version I have shot more recently while testing its ballistics for BallisticsByTheInch.com, it is the basis for this review, but I think most everything I have to say would be applicable to the Thunder version as well.

Where it got its good looks
The Firestorm is a direct blowback, medium-sized .380 built on the Walther PPK design. A design, I might add, that has proven itself to be dependable time and time again for more than 80 years.

Overall the Firestorm is a well-made little gun and manufactured with quality materials. The frame is an aluminum alloy, which contributes to the lighter weight (just 20 ounces), but also proves to be strong and durable. The slide and other components are made from high quality steel. For costing, at most, $300, these guns are durable. There have been reports of Bersas lasting 50,000 rounds before having problems.

The gun features a fixed barrel (mounted to the frame) that helps give it stability and accuracy. The beavertail on the back of the grip is a little longer than on the original PPK design, which helps keep large hands from getting ‘bitten’ by the operation of the slide/hammer (something I very much appreciate). And there is a finger extension on the magazine that also allows for better control—a design tweak introduced on the PPK about 40 years ago.

Fit and finish for the Firestorm is likewise good. It’s not the same quality that you’ll see on high-end firearms, but it isn’t bad at all.

Trigger and Action
The Firestorm has an exposed hammer and de-cocker, which is, again, similar to the PPK. The long double-action pull on the trigger for the first shot is followed by a crisp shorter single-action pull for subsequent shots.

I’ve found the triggers on all the Bersa guns to be decent or better—the Firestorm I would describe as “good”, but without the roughness you might find typical of lesser-priced firearms.

Differences between Firestorm and Thunder
The Firestorm has a front-dot sight and a rear notched sight, which is outlined in white. This is one of the minor differences between the Firestorm and the Thunder versions: the Thunder has a three-dot sight.

Another minor difference is that the Firestorm comes with a rubber wrap-around grip with finger indents, whereas the Thunder has traditional side panel grips with a grooved backstrap and smooth front.

Final Thoughts
A lot of people consider the Firestorm/Thunder to be a “pocket pistol.” I tend not to. With the finger grip extension and 20-ounce weight, I think they are a little too big for that use.

In this day and age with a variety of ‘micro .380s’, there are probably better choices for use as a pocket gun. But that is not to say that the Firestorm or Thunder is too large for concealed-carry duty. Hardly. It would disappear into a belt holster or into a shoulder rig (the way the PPK it was modeled on did for James Bond). And personally, I like the slightly larger size and weight to control recoil and increase accuracy. I consider this gun to be a very good choice for self-defense use. Yes, even though it is chambered for the .380 ACP, which is adequate with the correct ammunition.

Bottom line, if you get a chance, take a look at the Bersa guns, particularly the Firestorm or Thunder. They are well made, the company stands behind their product (for life for the original owner) and while the fit and finish may not be top-of-the-line, neither is the price. It is a very good value firearm.

This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol.

With two mags, box, and all original papers.

Customization:  ""Ribbing"" or stippling of front strap; not perfect but it's functional (see pic); helps keep support finger from slipping (if you put the offhand index finger there).  If this modification is not of use to you; if you don't value this mod, then you just simply won't want this pistol.  I am not lowering the price any more than it has been already; so please don't ask or point this out to me.  I want to sell it only to someone who sees this as an improvement, not a negative.

Great lightweight, reliable, but shootable carry gun, packed with features including:  7+1 capacity, windage-adjustable rear sight, 3-dot sights, manual safety, automatic trigger safety, internal striker-block safety, loaded chamber indicator, true DA/SA action (w/2nd strike capability), steel mags, steel sights, steel guide rod.

Note:  This is NOT the cheaper 709 SLIM product that comes with one mag, cardboard box (no case), and fixed sights; this is the more premium product of the two (two mags, adjustable sights, plastic hard case/box), with an MSRP of $403.98.  The receipt you see in the picture shows it cost me $433.48 out the door from H&H after tax.

At least one person is unable to read the foregoing paragraph for some reason (despite me trying to explain it to him), so I'm going to repeat it in case his siblings or cousins read this and contact me next:  Note:  This is NOT the cheaper 709 SLIM product that comes with one mag, cardboard box (no case), and fixed sights; this is the more premium product of the two (two mags, adjustable sights, plastic hard case/box), with an MSRP of $403.98.  

The second mag alone is $33 plus tax - that is, it would be, if you could get one:  http://www.midwayusa.com/product/715984/taurus-magazine-taurus-709-slim-9mm-luger-7-round-steel-blue?cm_vc=ProductFinding

Nevertheless, due to the fact that some won't value the box, and this other product is out there, I've lowered the price by $10.  But I like the pistol a lot.... don't care if I sell it.  Won't be lowering it at all below this price. Thanks.

Old Price:  $330
New Price:  Yours for $320 firm.  This is more than $110 off new when you count tax.

This is a FTF price. Add $25 for shipping to your door if you are Okla. resident via FedEx ground, or to your FFL's door anywhere in CONUS if not an Okla. resident. Please note that if I send to you directly rather than to FFL, as allowed per BATFE regs, I need to see some proof of Okla residency (text me pic of driver's license), and I do my own OSCN background check for felony convictions."

The Model 60 always ranks up there with the 10/22 as the most popular semi-auto .22 out there!  This rifle comes equipped with a vintage Redfield 1 3/4-5x scope.  This scope is very desirable.  This scope was formerly on another rifle so it needs to be zeroed to this one.  No front sight.  Filler screw present where sight was removed.  Sling swivel studs are already installed.  If you don't want the scope, I'll sell the rifle alone for $200.00.  Please text Matt @ (732)2oneThree-79foursix.  I'm in the Cedar Creek area of Greeneville.  Feel free to offer up something in trade.  Worst I could do is say no..."

Hard to find and I am not pressed to sell but if you need one and don't want to wait, this is your chance. Brand Vltor Mur 1A (forward assist) new in the sealed box!

Spec below.

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door."

The existing backstrap and the gun's front strap have been lightly stippled professionally. It looks great and feels even better. I used the gun in a couple IDPA competitions and the stippling helped with grip immensely. I am the second owner of this gun, my brother being the first. He doesn't know where the other two backstraps are or else I'd include them.  I will give the buyer 100 rounds of good target ammo to make up for the missing straps. I have had an apex trigger kit installed so the pull is much lower. As far as the sites, they are Warren brand Sevigny competition sites with black rear and interchangeable fiber optic front. 
The gun is very clean overall with no blemishes or holster wear.

I've gotten several questions about the German markings on the slide: 

The gun is a .380 but is marked 9mm kurz on the slide because kurz is German for ""short."" 9mm kurz, or short, and .380 rounds are the same thing, just different names. So basically it is for the German and American reference. Which also explains why in Bond movies they refer to his guns as 9mm, when in reality Bond is carrying the .380 PPK as offered here."

I removed it and it has been in the safe ever since. This 2 piece rail is free floating and is designed so that you don't have to remove the front sight or gas block. This is one of the lightest and most secure rails that I've ever used, very rigid once installed. It is visually appealing and once you hold it, you realize that it is made from quality materials. There are some VERY minor scuffs from installation, and honestly you have to look very hard to notice them, but I have a 100% positive seller rating for a reason and I want to keep it. I could sell this as new, but I'd rather be honest about the installation wear than have an unsatisfied buyer. I tried to include this in the photo, but my camera wouldn't pick up the wear because it is almost nonexistent.

I have included a complete description from the manufacturer below. Please be aware that you will have to remove the delta ring and spring, but it is easily installed without the need for a gunsmith. Please email me with any questions you may have. I will only accept Paypal or cash in person. Price includes shipping with tracking. Thanks for looking!

Our patent pending C4 rail system is a lightweight, rugged, 2 piece free float rail that when installed gives the uppers a continuous 12 o’clock rail. Our design allows the installation of the rail on an upper assembly without removing the front sight post or permanently attached muzzle devices.

It kicks my skinny self too hard and so I flinch when I shoot it.  Stock is kinda scratched up. Gun shoots fine and drops deer like no other.  I paid a little over  $300 for the gun and rings so I think $150 is a fair price. Don't low ball me. My boat needs new seats and I don't need this gun so it's gotta go.

This is a beast of a revolver that feels like it ought to be taking zombie heads off.  The gun is in mint condition for a gun made in 1996, and the glossy blueing is almost perfect.  No scratches, and only tiny wear spots on some corners.  It sports a 6.5″ long ribbed and ported barrel with adjustable rear sight, and holds 7 rounds.  I tried a few heavy .357 loads through it, and the weight and balance of the gun make them extremely controlled shots.  The action is very smooth, with a crisp single action pull.  Practice with .38 specials and you hardly know you’re shooting anything.  The gun is accurate as well as beautiful.

To complete the package, I’m including a custom made leather drop-leg holster with adjustable thigh strap and buckle.  It puts this heavy piece in a comfortable draw-level position, and looks completely bad walking around camp.  Nice to wear while riding an ATV to have it right there on your leg.

I don’t know the whole history of this gun, but I have only put a few rounds through it to see how it shoots.  The guy who sold it to me said it basically sat for 10 years.  I went over it in detail.  Tight lockup, very clean–It looks like a gun only a couple of years old.

I’m including with it the original black rubber grips that were on it, but I just added a set of $75 hardwood grips with finger grooves that feel and look awesome.  This pistol honestly shoots almost as well as my Smith and Wesson .357.  Since I have both, I don't use this one much.  It’s tempting to keep it, but I’m looking for a smaller revolver right now.  I might trade for something like a J-frame Smith and Wesson or Ruger SP101 with 3″ or 4″ barrel.

You can check this other site that has a few more pictures: http://utahguns.com/category/307/Handguns/listings/28789/Taurus-607-357-7-shot-65-Revolver.html.  Now that I've dropped the price, I'm pretty firm on price, but it comes with several extras.  I'll even give you a box of .38 practice reloads to get you started if you want.  This is a sweet gun and needs a home!"

Gun has a small Kimber mag well added, it is barely even noticeable.  It is in excellent condition, has BARELY visible holster wear using the naked eye, has less than 1,000 rds through it and meticulously cleaned often. Comes with aggressive VZ grips, some of the best I've ever shot with. Night sights as well. Local gunsmith Mike Fields did a simple trigger job on her, and the pull is now very light. It functions flawlessly makes me smile every time I fire it. I am the original owner, bought it around 2007. Mostly lived in safe, never carried. This particular gun does have some blemishes from normal use. I will happily send pics of the blemishes upon request! Just ask! But only ask if you are serious about buying or trading with me at the value listed. I'm not willing to ship, nor am I willing to drive more that 20 miles outside of the wilmington area to affect a sale/trade. You may call or text me at REDACTED thanks!!!!"
