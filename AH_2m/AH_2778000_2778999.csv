From the Northwoods to the Texas hill country and in every deer camp and lodge in between, the .30-30 rifle remains the perennial choice of whitetail hunters. More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it's a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America's most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. 

Like every Henry rifle, it's 100% American made, with its select American walnut stock and forearm, it is a masterpiece of finely crafted gunsmithing.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

This combination provides the control and reliability of the Commander with the easy concealment of the Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP in the two provided 7 round flush base magazines, you won’t feel under-gunned.

To make it more comfortable and make it disappear even easier while carrying concealed, i bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce the overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. To help control recoil, we included an undercut trigger guard and our new “Chain Link” pattern on the front strap and mainspring housing. The slide and small parts are coated in the same “Duty” finish that we use on the Valor. Like all of our night-sight models, you will find dual colored Tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO wears a medium length trigger shoe to facilitate faster draws and a better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled Shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional.

I purchased a new firing pin and spring and installed it.  Havent had time to take it back to the range to test fire it.  I assume it shoots fine, but if not there isnt much else that can be wrong with it and the parts are super cheap for this gun. It comes with 2 mags and about a half a box of range ammo.

The pistol features a coated black slide over a stainless receiver and it has HIGER Signature grips. The pistol has the aforementioned compensator and rear sight and also oversize takedown lever and safety lever. The pistol comes with the original Springfield Armory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, but no extra magazines. - overall condition is about 98%.

These rifles are pieces of history that work. Extremely accurate with factory two stage trigger and they cycle extremely fast. The action on this one is like butter. They shoot the .303 round which is utterly devastating at long range. 10 round removable magazine which is double what most bolt actions had (or have).

Included are five stock 36-round magazines and the new-manufacture spare parts (including a spare firing pin) shown in photos below. The barrel is quick-detach and the stock folds. 

I am only looking to trade face-to-face.

This SW760 comes with a legal 16"" barrel, but 8"" barrels are available (e.g., an 8"" Suomi M31 barrel fits) and can used if you are willing to pay the appropriate one-time $200 tax to the ATF. Also, Suomi M31 36-rd magazines can be adapted for use with this rifle. 

A bit of history: This is a semi-auto clone of the Vietnam-era Smith & Wesson S&W 76 submachine gun, which, in turn, was a clone of the Carl Gustav M45 submachine gun (AKA the ""Swedish K""). The SW760 and its predecessors are all chambered in 9mm. The seals of the Vietnam era wanted to purchase the M45 from Sweden (if only because it would fire straight out of the water), but the Swedish government said ""no."" S&W then agreed to build a clone for the US military. Ironically, the S&W 76 went into production shortly after the Vietnam War ended."

I bought this gun two weeks ago and then went to a gun shop and saw the Thunder CC model and liked it better, so I bought it. I no longer want this one. I have not fired this weapon once. It's brand new, mint condition. Comes with everything you get from Bersa. Original box and all its contents.

With the price of the gun, shipping and FFL transfer fees combined, I have $325 total invested in the gun. I've priced this gun under what it's actually worth. I'm ok with losing money on it simply because I want to sell it quick and not sit on it. I'm not a gun collector, so if I'm not going to use it, it's got to go. Standard price for a new Bersa Thunder 380 is usually over $300, not to mention your shipping and FFL transfer fees if you're not buying in-peron. I also have this gun on gunbroker.com and has several views and watchers. If you contact me and commit to picking it up, I'll remove both listings. I'm willing to meet face to face around the Atlanta and Stone Mountain area's.

If you want it shipped, shipping fee will be determined once you inform me of which type of shipping method you desire. Also have your FFL transfer information included so I can ship promptly.
