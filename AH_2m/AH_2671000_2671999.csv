This is it, a Westfalia that will climb hills effortlessly and 4 wheel off road. Conversion and restoration accomplished the Baker Brothers at WWW.Subagon.com Subaru SVX Motor Conversion (imported from Japan). This link http://subagon.com/best/bobs-1990-syncro-westy-svx/ features my 1990 AWD Syncro on their website.

I was riding my motorcycle, and a driver ran a stop sign and T-Boned me, I have had, 3 foot operations, 2 knee operations, and 4 back fusions, so I find myself unable to camp out as I used to. Because of this I am being forced to sell my “Syncro”.  

Mr. Joe Baker at www.subagon.com can tell you about this and verify the value of this Westy is more than the price I am asking.  You can have them build one, and wait, and getting Syncro AWD 4WD is going to take a while or be very costly if you are in a hurry. They were extremely limited in production, and very few imported into USA. Canada and Mexico have some. Importing and paperwork is a hassle. Here are the facts about this Syncro. Conversion costs around $25k if you can broker a good deal. No wimpy gutless, sluggish powerless van. This will climb mountains with ease. Call or text Mr. Joe Baker at 9REDACTED) or email him at REDACTED . He was the contact at Subagon.com that brokered this contract for me.  His brother is not aware I am selling this so Joe will be your best contact for info. He is also on the road a lot lately so be patient on text/email replies.

I have the original SUBAGON portfolio, original paperwork, reciepts for all post work and service. 4 new axles, CV joints. You can add a AWD decoupling kit (temporarily disengages AWD to 2 WD),  that will really increase your mileage, but I have been in the hospital too much and recuperating unable to get out and do anything. The conversion can be done for about $3k with warranty and can increase gas mileage dramatically. VW dealers work on this Van and love it. Older parts are available via http://www.van-cafe.com/ and they can get any part the VW dealer may not have. Friendly staff and quick shipping.  This is currently fully titled (full and clear) in Colorado, currently registered, insured and working, stored in my garage for winter. It has been winterized, but will pump winterized fluids with ease for testing.

This is powered by a 3.3 liter SUBRAU SVX engine (same kind as used in the sports car and ultralight aircraft). Full conversion to Subaru SVX 3.3 liter pancake engine By Subagon.com. Power plus Speed, Subaru Computer controlled. These conversions can be done for $20 to $30k if you find the right place and work a deal, around $15K if you do it yourself and have a working knowledge of conversions and the computers that run the engine.  I have put about 9,0000 miles on this since the conversion, fixed some minor things like a new power steering pump, the A/C thermo-resistor replaced. There are some minor chips in the windshield. I will have this replaced upon non-refundable deposit $5k for contracted sale, or give you an allowance to replace we agree upon at final payment. The fuel gauge sometimes does not work (suspect bad sender), and I will also give you an allowance to fix this we agree upon. The plastic plate on the exterior Electrical cover disappeared (I suspect the spring broke and pin slipped out.) I will replace or give you the cost of the part and shipping allowance for this as well from Van Cafe. Nothing hidden or covered up, you are getting all the info. I have attempted to include everything here but, may have forgotten some items.
ABOUT THE SVX CONVERSION: The conversion to the SVX engine and computer, mechanics, wiring, was contracted with SUBAGON.com in Redding California. Van was torn down, painted and restored with original parts, excluding the SVX upgrade and some minor items. The Subaru SVX computer was wired in and all wiring done to fully utilize all original VW functions. 

IPORTANT ITEM IS when licensing and registering, THIS IS Still considered a regular car/van so insurance is cheap, and your Homeowners association can’t stop you from parking at your place as it will register as a regular car/van. Not considered a conversion Van (Class B). This is a really nice plus if you have an HOA, and I do and was not permitted to park an RV at my place. My costs for insurance, license, registration and plates cheap (will show you receipts).The canvas in the pop top is all new and works fine with no leaks. PopTop Has extra opening for a window type view with mosquito netting in the canvass so sleepers in top can see out. All poptop arms, mechanism new. Wired for 110v, external water, external LPG. Inverter powered off gas mat deep cycle battery, so that all your 12v appliances and lights work on the battery and/or the inverter supplying power in both 12v/110v. Switch behind seat to enable switching from external 110v to internal. Solar panel charges this entire system when parked. Add up the costs for all this and you will see my price is for a quick sale, and beats others at Go Westy and other places. Go to SUBAGON, do your build list price then add the VW…. You will find that Mine has additional options and will cost a lot more than the $50K price tag.
SALE PRICE IS $52k 
Terms: signed contract, $5k down, as a non-refundable deposit, $47K upon picking up vehicle, and these funds in cash or a cashier’s check, postal money order(s) that will require you wait until it clears through my bank (sorry).

The auction ends this evening. There is no reserve and someone has bid on it. Any way you look at it, the opportunity to buy this rifle ends tonight. If you're serious about it, don't wait. 

I have the pleasure of offering a nice Bolt Action Mauser in 45-70 for sale or trade!
It will take down any animal in North America, up through the largest of dangerous game.  This cartrige has been used to take down elephants and cape buffalo. In this action the cartridge can be loaded up to .458 Win Mag equivalence.

If you want to go to the range and have The Biggest Gun (unless somebody shows up with a .50 BMG), this is the gun for you.

The cartrige has been around for almost 150 years.  It is fired from a German designed action.  All it needs is your scope & rings.  The sasety is simple to operate and verify the setting (The Mauser was, after all, a military weapon, so it had to be GI proof).

This Gun:
It is ready for your choice of scope and rings.  The stock is good looking, but has the occasional dent and scratch.  I have LOTS of photos that include the little details and things.  I will happily e-mail them to potential buyers.  (I can only post three here)  It has a good recoil pad.  The bolt locks up tight, but works easily.   And the Trigger.  The trigger is Niiiiiice!  Disengage the safety, line up your shot and make the decision to fire and it's Gone!  You won't miss a shot because the trigger is too heavy or creepy.  

Whether you want to have The Big Gun at the range or have the right gun to protect yourself from the bear or moose that decided you're too close, this gun will Do The Job.  It isn't a super shiny, pretty gun.  It sends heavy bullets out of itself and makes Big, Big holes.

I live in Ohio and can do business face to face with other Ohio residents.  Seeing an CCW card is reassuring, but seeing your driver's license well enough to verify that you're from Ohio is also sufficient for this transaction. You will also be asked to reassure me that there is no reason that would prevent you from buying a firearm, legally.  As this rifle is rather pricey, I am willing to travel within the state for the right deal.  The price is absolutely negotiable.  Make an offer and it'll open a dialogue.  Maybe it'll end up with you buying a cool and unique rifle.

If you live outside Ohio, I can ship to your FFL  by one of two methods.
1: If your FFL will accept shipment from individuals, I will ship to the shop at cost estimated by the UPS website (dimensions and weight and sufficient insurance).
2: I will take it to my FFL to be shipped to your FFL for what my FFL charges.

Payment will be something we'll have to sort out when all of the other details are resolved.  It's a lot of money and it's important for everybody to have their assets protected.  Postal money orders are nice and allow the buyer the recourse of the postal service if there are issues with the transaction.

It's up as an auction on Gunbroker, so one way or another, it's going to sell.  Don't wait.  It will get away and you'll be left with alternatives that aren't as nice and/or cost more.

Picture Collectors: By all means, drop me a note. Sending e-mail is free and this gun is relatively unique. I'll be happy to send photos even if you have no intention of bidding."

It is brand new and unfired, havent had a chance to take it to the range yet.  Comes with all the Gen 4 stuff, back straps and three 9 round mags, however one of them has a Pearce +2 extension on it for a larger grip and 11 rounds.  I've also installed a Glock OEM 3.5 connector in it (Standard in the G34 and G35) that lowers the trigger pull a bit and considerably smooths out the pull.

I'm looking to trade it towards a motorcycle of some sort.
I'm pretty open and I like cruisers, standards, and sport bikes.  I'm preferrably looking for a cruiser that's at least 750cc's or larger, or a sport bike/standard that's at least 600cc's and up (will make an exception for a Ninja 500).  I'm not interested in dirt bikes, enduros, or anything that has been chopped or bobbed. I can add up to $800 for the right bike on top of the Glock.  I know its not a ton but it is still winter and I'm not looking for a Harley.

Otherwise I'm not picky about make or model, however it MUST be in good riding condition with a title.  Doesnt have to be perfect cosmetically but no projects or junk.
If you're looking for cash only and not interested in trading I can offer around $1000 for something.

I have my ccl, as well as my motorcycle license.
Feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers or questions.
Please be sure to say what year and model bike you have as well as pictures if you have any.

Can post pictures of the Glock later, but it looks like any other glock.
Thanks!"

This is not a 25 year old Sig like most people are trying to sell on Armslist; it was manufactured 2 years ago. The best part about a 229 chambered in .40 S&W is the ability to easily switch to .357 SIG or 9mm by simply purchasing a drop-in barrel. The handgun will come in the original box with all manuals, two 12-round magazines and safety lock. Currently, it is wearing the original-style P229 grips (as shown in first picture) which I will also include. Price is $795. No trades. Thanks for looking and feel free to ask any questions!

These are some of the best iron back up sights made, period. As you can see from the links below, the least you could buy this complete set for new is about $220 MINIMUM. You could easily spend more on them but that would be the cost to obtain them from the lowest priced seller. I will sell whichever one you need to you at a great deal (individual prices listed below), or buy them as a set and I will make you an even better package deal ($175 FIRM). I have only one set of these for sale at this reduced price. Please do not waste your time or mine making lower offers - if you think they are worth less then be my guest to find someone else to sell them to you for a lower price. 
Both of these are brand new in the package, very high quality, very low profile, all aluminum and stainless steel, and MADE IN THE U.S.A., not some Chinese factory 

The Troy Folding Rear Battle Sight:
Anywhere from $109.95 - $130 depending on where you get it, and often sell out even in the higher end of that range. I have one brand new (black) that I will sell for $100 cash FIRM, which is below the best price you will find ANYWHERE else.

Durability and dead-on accuracy have made Troy Industries Folding BattleSights the hands-down choice of Special Ops and tactical users worldwide. Easy to install and to deploy, with no levers or springs to fumble with, these sights position apertures at exact factory height. A stainless-steel cross-locking system ensures sights remain upright and zeroed under extreme combat conditions. A push of a button folds the sights securely out of the way until you need them again (they fold to a profile of just 0.460). Troy BattleSights feature a zero-canting attachment system for use on all military and aftermarket receivers. Features: - No tools are required for adjustment - Blackened Stainless Steel - MIL-SPEC Type III Hard Coated - T6 Aircraft Aluminum construction
