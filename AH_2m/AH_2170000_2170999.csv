Call or text REDACTED.What is a Mossberg 308 bolt action rifle worth
This rifle was originally designed by Louis Seecamp and Carl Benson in the late 1960s for Montgomery Ward to sell in their stores. Montgomery Ward decided not to sell them, but Mossberg took up the type and sold it in its various incarnations into late 1970s. 
The Model 800 had a strangely-shaped S-shaped bolt handle - bent forward, then back. The rifle is well-made and looks good. Internally, the bolt is also unusual, having two rows of three lugs (most rifles only have one set of lugs). The extractor uses a rather short blade, but its spring is especially strong, saving space and giving the Model 800 reliable case ejection. The early versions used a walnut Monte Carlo-type half stock, with the pistol grip wrist having a plastic white cap and the buttplate having decorative white spacers. The pistol grip wrist and fore-end had impressed skip-line checkering. 


The model 800 had a few variations which affects the value, although not by much. Very Good condition would be worth $600 to $750. The model 810, about the same."

Although SIRT pistols were advertised to work with standard Glock magazines, there have been a few reports of narrow magazine wells in recent manufacture. I performed this modification, notified the company of the problem and its resolution, and now this SIRT will work with both the NLT magazines and standard Glock 17/22 magazines. The red paint is chipped by the rear dovetail, both on the right side and the top of the slide, from the previous set of sights (the rear dovetail is interesting, Warren Tactical sights were loose and needed the set screw to tighten the fit, and the Ameriglo Defoors were relatively tight, however both needed blue Loc-tite for a firm fit). This SIRT recently went back to Next Level Training for new springs and an inspection, their customer service has been quite responsive and communicative.

(NATO) AR-10 w/ 16"" barrel. and ""Hunter"" style rail.  This rail is much easier for mounting larger optics and for holding a ""C Clamp.""  (I had to select POF as a manufacturer on this site as there was no selection for a ""Hogan."")  Included in sale are Larue Tactical R.I.S.R. (cheek riser) Magul extended pad on stock, and Troy QD sling attachment.  Rifle comes with stock SR-25 PMAG and the original box.  Rifle was built specifically for me by a friend at Hogan.  They sent it out to be Cerakoted in OD Green.  I paid just shy of $3400.00 with tax.  I require a WA. CPL for verification that you can legally own a firearm.  

Exactly 100 rounds downrange through this.  60 rounds of Federal XM80C and 40 rounds of PRVI 147 grain NATO.  I zeroed a scope with it, then did a couple mag dumps to check function of the rifle.  It shot without so much as a hiccup.  It was promptly given a complete Frog Lube treatment and stored in a temperature controlled gun safe.  

It's in mint condition, I have simply decided to go a different way with other calibers/platforms and don't need it. Plus, I could use the money more than the gun. Serious offers only please as I am not hurting to sell this rifle. I'm not interested in your baseball card collection, kittens, puppies, old cars, or your lifted toy trucks and 4x4's. 

 A little about Hogan: It's a gas piston driven rifle made by one of the best.  For those that don't know, Hogan used to build all of P.O.F.-U.S.A's rifles.  They still do work for many companies, to include building GA Arms Precision's sniper rifles for them.  

I'll include links for reviews done by world renowned and former world record longest shot U.S.M.C. MARSOC Sniper Steve Reichert.  This is one of the finest, if not the finest .308 platforms that your going to find.

The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system.
Each piece of operating system is hard chrome plated and/or melonite heat treated making them almost self lubricating and act as non stick surfaces making them easy to clean and maintain.

Hey.  Im selling my little bolt action rodent annihilator.  This is a great little gun with lots of fun potential.  The 17hmr round is explosively fast (2500 fps+) and powerful for a rimfire round.  This rifle is painted olive drab with Krylon ultra flat paint, which gives it a tacticool look.  The rifle comes with an illuminated BSA Huntsman scope 3X9 X40 with Butler Creek  flip up scope covers and Weaver rings.  The rifle comes with approx. 115 rounds of 17hmr ammo.  I would prefer to do business locally or near the county.  I can send you more pics at your request.  You pay the FFl fees.  Send me an email if interested or want to know anything else, i am a fast responder. Im also selling a brand new Mossberg 4x4 in .30-06 and the package deal goes for 800.00 bucks so let me know.

The OKO reflex red dot sight was engineered to provide accurate sight acquisition in all shooting conditions.

A wide range of dot sizes are available, including 3 MOA, 4 MOA, 6MOA, and 8 MOA. The OKO sight is one of the lightest full size tubeless design sights on the market.

Nikon 3x32 P-223 Rifle Scope 8496 is a powerful close-range rifle scope that combines high-brightness optics with quick adjustment capabilities. These effective Nikon rifle scopes feature a 3x magnification and a wide, 32mm objective lens that is fully multi-coated, providing an astonishing 98% light transmission rate, allowing you to do some great hunting during sunrise or sunset. Optimized for the trajectory of a 5.56 NATO round, the Nikon P223 3x BDC Carbine Reticle Riflescopes are equipped with a BDC Carbine reticle with 400 and 600 yard hashmarks; using Nikon's Spot On Ballistic Match Technology, you can tailor the reticle to your specific load. 
Adjustments in windage and elevation are easy to make with these rifle scopes, which utilize 1/4 MOA tactical-style windage and elevation turrets with a zero reset feature that makes adjusting the reticle of the Nikon 3x32mm P223 Ballistic Match Rifle Scope as easy as dialing in the appropriate range.

All these adjustment possibilities plus a 100 yard parallax setting makes for some highly accurate shooting with the Nikon P-223 Rifle Scope. Not only is the Nikon P 223 3x32 Matte Black Rifle Scope precise and accurate, it is also comfortable to use, easy to mount, and as durable a rifle scope as you'll find anywhere else. Nikon has equipped these scopes with generous eye relief that's big enough to guard against heavy recoil, harsh shooting angles, and lighter rifles. 
For a close-range rifle scope that combines fast target acquisition with precise windage and elevation adjustments and crystal clear optics, mount the Nikon P223 Matte BDC Carbine Scope to your rifle of choice.

ALL OTHER CALIBERS AVAILIABLE. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES ( SHOWN BELOW ) THIS IS THE NEW R8 MODEL FROM BLASER. ALL OF THE GREAT BLASER FEATURES PLUS MORE. YOUR CHOICE OF SIDEPLATES. A New Era of Perfection ""The beginning of a new era of perfection"", is how Blaser CEO Bernhard Knoebel has named the launch of the new Blaser bolt action rifle R8 in his preface of the brand-new catalog. For the past five years, there has been one lingering question for the hunters and engineers at Blaser, regarding the Blaser bolt action rifle R93: How can this technically superior concept be taken to the next level? In order to answer this question the Blaser engineers, most of them passionate hunters themselves, kept a close connection to hunters around the world in order to respond to their requests. Detachable Magazine When the development of the R8 actually started the detachable magazine was right at the top of the optimization list. Blaser found an ergonomically superior solution that essentially supports fast and intuitive handling. Magazine and trigger unit merged into one compact module. The magazine buttons are positioned right above the trigger guard. Thus, the magazine can be released blindly and within a split second. When removing the magazine, the R8 automatically de-cocks and once the magazine is removed, the cocking slide cannot engage anymore. Today, this is a very important safety feature securing the rifle against misuse by unauthorized persons. Blaser Precision Trigger The detachable magazine is just one of a multitude of innovations that turn the R8 into the new worldwide benchmark when it comes to bolt action rifles. Enhancing the reliable and precise performance of the trigger posed a very special engineering challenge that has been brilliantly mastered. The new Blaser Precision Trigger breaks crisp as glass at a trigger pull of 750 gram / 1 5/8 lbs. Thanks to its extremely short release time it turns the shooter’s thought impulse immediately into an accurate shot. The innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing, which marks the next leap in rifle technology. The desmodromic trigger mechanism offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Perfect Stock In order to make shooting with the R8 as comfortable and safe as possible, Blaser attached immense importance to optimizing the stock, reaching a new level of perfection here, too. Different from traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. This results in increased muzzle stability and a substantial reduction of felt recoil. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Design Besides achieving maximum performance, Blaser gave particular attention to superior style and design. Concave and convex lines discreetly shape the rifles appearance. Contours of stock, action, mount and bolt handle blend perfectly, giving the R8 a dynamic and unequaled elegance"

This is the newest version of the PT92 as denoted by the accessory rail and slide serrations.

I originally bought this gun because it was the cheaper alternative to the Beretta 92FS Inox.  However, after shooting both I can say that the Taurus shoots just as well as the 92FS and looks MUCH BETTER in my opinion.  It also has a nice weight/feel to it, has never failed to feed/fire, shoots very accurately, and has little recoil.

I've only put about 500 rounds through it and have always cleaned and polished after every use.  Other than a few fine scratches, the gun is in like-new condition both inside and out.  The picture I took with my cell phone does not do the gun justice.  

Extras included:
(2) 10-round factory magazines
(1) 18-round Mec-Gar magazine; sold with the gun as a parts kit only
Set of Hogue grips (installed)
UTG accessory rail light w/batteries

Based on current prices, buying a new PT92 with the essential extras above + tax will easily run you over $750.  So this is a great deal if you're in the market for one, I think.  :)

Meeting/Buying Terms:
1. I currently live in Chino, CA and prefer that potential buyers meet me at the Turner's Outdoorsman in Chino Hills.
2. I don't mind driving up to 20 miles from Chino to meet you halfway somewhere, as long as it's at a location with a FFL dealer that can do PPTs.
3. The private transfer fee at any FFL dealer is $35 ($10 transfer + $25 DROS) and the buyer will be expected to pay for that to the store as well.
4. Cash is preferred, but I'll also take Paypal if you add $15 for the 3% Paypal fee.

Trades:
1. I'll consider trading everything + extra cash for a S&W 686 revolver (4"").  How much extra cash will depend on the version and condition of the gun.

Please message me if there are any questions or if you're interested in buying, thank you."

This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA."

This is a brand new Kel-Tec RFB Hunter with a 24"" threaded barrel. It comes with a 20rd magazine, two point sling, Kel-Tec hard case and all the original paperwork and manual.Weight unloaded (no magazine): 9.8 lbs. Length: 31"". Barrel length: 24"". Magazine: 20rd. Practical range: 1200m. The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included*. Barrels have a Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and the Hunter comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel."

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully.[4

I do not hunt or collect, so I'd rather see it go to someone that does. Ruger stopped making the Magnum model in 2006. These are very much sought after. Do a search on them and you'll see that the price reflects that. It will come with a Tasco Pronghorn 3-9x32 scope & a good quality padded case. Please be specific when inquiring. Asking $900 or best reasonable offer. If it looks like a scam, spam or phishing, I will not reply.

Postby Parke1 » Mon Sep 30, 2013 9:11 am
I have up for trade an unfired S&W Shield in 9mm. Come with box, papers, lock, both mags (7 round flush and 8 round extended). I purchased this a couple weeks ago with intentions of carrying it, but I've found that I don't really like the size of it.

I'm looking to trade for a Glock 19 primarily, but will consider other options. I'd also be open to a hunting handgun (.357 or larger, 5"" barrel minimum), or a base model 1911. I have some cash I could throw in for a nicer 1911.

I'll also throw in a nice Desantis ankle holster (right hand draw) and an unknown maker belt slide holster on the deal.

I'm located in the Akron/Green area. You must be able to meet me in this area, as my work and home schedules right now are very hectic.

Email me if interested and I'll get back to you FAST!
Thanks!"

Stopping Power for Close Combat

The FN P90® submachine gun and the SS190 ball ammunition team up to defeat the enemy in all close combat situations.



High Accuracy

The high velocity of the 5.7x28mm ammunition guarantees a virtually flat trajectory up to 200m for outstanding accuracy.



Fully Reliable

The simple design of the mechanism, the unique feed mechanism and the materials used to manufacture the FN P90® make it highly reliable, whatever the conditions.



Rapid Deployment

The FN P90® is carried ready to fire. There is no need to extend any folding buttstock. Despite its shortness, the FN P90® is designed to be fired from the shoulder, giving maximum stability.



Quick Aiming

The FN P90® Standard is fitted with an integrated optical sight without magnification. The user can therefore shoot with both eyes open. Performance is fully retained in low light conditions thanks to a tritium capsule.



Easy to Carry

The compactness of the FN P90® allows easy movement in confined areas. The magazine is fully integrated in the upper part of the FN P90® for optimized ergonomics.



Fully Ambidextrous

The cocking handle and magazine catch can be operated from both sides of the FN P90®. The fire selector is under the trigger and can be operated in either hand. Empty cartridge cases are ejected downwards. The FN P90® can therefore be handled by right- and left-handed operators without any modification.



High Magazine Capacity

Since the 5.7x28mm rounds are light and small, the magazine fitted above the barrel can accept up to 50 cartridges."

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included from the factory. The Barrel is 18” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All Kel-Tec RFB barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) finished, because it is tougher and will last longer than chrome-lining. The bolts are now finished with Hardened Titanium Nitride to assist with smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. Forward Ejection. Fully Adjustable Gas Piston can be set for use with any ammunition or suppressor. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. This gun is absolutely NEW, UNTOUCHED AND UNHANDLED in Perfect Condition.

************************************************************************************************************The OKO reflex red dot sight was engineered to provide accurate sight acquisition in all shooting conditions. The various mount and configuration options allow the OKO sight to be mounted to a wide variety of pistols and rifles. There are OKO models for Weaver Rail mounting, Dovetail mounting, and mounting directly to specialty mounts such as 1911's, STI's, CZ 75/85, CZ97, Tanfoglio, and more. The OKO sight is one of the lightest full size tubeless design sights on the market. The lens has a special water repelling coating, so if you have to shoot in the rain, a rain drop on the lens won't spoil your day. The OKO sight gives excellent battery life, using the readily available 2032 coin cell battery.

Here is an ultra rare custom Springfield Armory 1911.  This was part of a joint project between Stephen Camp (http://www.hipowersandhandguns.com) and Teddy Jacobson (http://www.actionsbyt.com/aboutus.htm).

The idea was to take a Springfield Mil Spec 1911 and turn it into a completely reliable carry weapon.  You can see Stephen Camp's write up:

Stephen Camp's write up on the modified Mil Spec 1911 with Teddy Jacobson's work  http://www.hipowersandhandguns.com/Springfield%20Armory%20MilSpec%20Update.htm

The entire inner workings of every part of this gun has been gone over by Teddy Jacobson himself, he selected the best, and most reliable parts for these guns and pieced them together.  

There were only 25 of these guns made, you had to talk with Stephen and Teddy to get selected for the project.  Then supply a Springfield Mil Spec 1911 for Teddy to perform the work on.  This is the ONLY bi-tone gun, all of the other Mil Specs were either completely blue or completely stainless. 

I received it setup, tested it with a few defensive .45 rounds to select the best one for my needs and put it in my safe.  It has never been carried.  

I swore I would never sell such a rare piece, but it is my only .45 and I never, ever shoot it.  It is a complete safe queen.  

This is your chance to own a piece of history and the same exact gun that famed writer Stephen Camp owns and has endorsed as a reliable weapon that he trusts.  This is a very, very rare opportunity.  

Includes original case, everything that came in the case, all original parts, original grips, slim aluminum grips, original Springfield magazine, 2 Tripp Cobra magazines, a Wilson Magazine, and the box that was shipped to me from Stephen."

The Glock 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box
precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore
caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of
the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact
dimensions, the G30SF is the first choice of plainclothes officers and
security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of
the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and
control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

Description:
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.
