I will meet you at the Blacksburg shooting range if you would like to test fire any of my listed firearms. May consider meetings at local ""gun friendly"" businesses, like a gun shop. I will not meet you at my home or yours, unfortunately there are some folks out there wanting to do harm and we do not have the time to ""get to know"" one another. Hate to do this but you will need to provide your own ammo for test fires. Seems that folks like to make me drag all my guns out, haul them to the range, shoot up my ammo and then not buy anything. Ammo and gas ain't cheap so do not waste my time. 

Federal law dictates you must be a VA resident and of legal age. Bill of Sale will be provided with each purchase.

Up for your consideration is a Iver Johnson top break safety model 2 built in 1904. This hammerless revolver is designed to fire the 38 S&W round loaded with black powder, use of modern smokeless powder can result in damage to the firearm and/or injury to the user. The 38 S&W round IS NOT the same as any other 38 ammo available. There are no manufacturers producing the correct ammo but all the needed components are available to load your own. Starline and Remington make the brass, Missouri bullets cast the proper lead bullet, the brass use regular magnum small pistol primers and you can load with your choice of black powder or pyrodex. The rounds I have fired used FFFg Pyrodex pistol powder. All said and done you could load your first batch at .50 a round, .30 a round after that since you already have the brass. 

This revolver indexes well, has a good bore and appears to have been used very little over the 110 years it has been on this earth. The only noted external blemishes are flaking nickel plating and minor rust, overall the metal is very smooth and could be easily replated if desired. Noted internal blemishes include lead build up in the rifling, minor bore pitting and the trigger return spring is broken."

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.

The full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

(Included as well) The stock is a pillar bedded Choate Ultimate Sniper stock. I mounted a short action rail on top with top grade mounts to hold the repeatable Barska SWAT scope. The scope is quite amazing. 10-50 X 50mm. Yes. 50x zoom and full paralax. Lazer zeroed at its lowest setting at 100 yards. Which is very close up for this rifle. The barrel has a Kontrol Solutions custom made clamp on muzzle brake that nearly eliminates recoil. Equipped with a Harris bipod. And camo work done with Magpul FDE duracoat with brown and olive accents. I've invested a LOT of time and money into this rifle, but I don't have the range to justify shooting it.

The SureFire X400 Ultra WeaponLight integrates stunningly powerful white-light illumination and bright red laser aiming capabilities in one compact rail-mountable package, an extremely effective combination for close- to medium-range engagements in law enforcement, military, and self-defense applications. 

A high-performance LED generates 500 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X400 Ultra’s 5-milliwatt laser sight, located below the primary light, emits a high-visibility red (635 nM) beam. The laser's aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. 

Activating the X400 Ultra is done is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. A separate switch at the rear of the X400 Ultra allows you to (1) activate white light illumination only, (2) activate white light illumination simultaneously with the laser sight, (3) activate the laser sight only, or (4) disable the entire X400 Ultra. See illustration at upper left. 

Optional DG grip switches (for pistols) and a pressure activated XT07 tape switch (for long guns) permit the X400 Ultra to be activated without altering your grip on your weapon. 

The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment/detachment from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture.

The quality of the one's I just got in stock is not very good.  They are safe and the wood looks good but they have other small flaws.  I am dropping the price on them to cost to keep from sending them back.  I would not mind owning one in fact I may keep one for myself but if you want one at a reduced price, now is the time.  I have sold them in the past for $295 and you can see the savings. 

 Each barrel has it's own trigger and can be fired one at a time or if you feel brave then you can pull both triggers at the same time.  Someone will help you up off the ground.  There is nothing more intimidating than to have a double barrel shotgun pointed at you.  Remember the old western movies when the bartender would pull the 12 ga out from under the bar and everyone stopped what they were doing.  If you look at these two barrels staring at you then you will understand why they did.  A shotgun is a good home defense weapon because it does not have a long range, they spread out well so that you find it hard to miss and it is a scary weapon to the bad guy.  They usually give up the fight right away and leave keeping you from having to clean up a bloody mess, not to mention explaining to the police why the guy is dead on your living room floor.  Come take a look at it and you will see what I am talking about.  The close range prevents you from shooting a neighbor in his house when you shoot.  The wide spread of a shotgun blast means that you don't even have to practice for accuracy, it is hard to miss.  Oh yes, don't forget scary, just hope they don't hurt themselves while running away.

A great gun.

This is a great example of what a battle rifle should be. The M1 Grand, the greatest battle implement ever created. The barrel and receiver match July-august 1944. receiver s/n 3091xxx. Barrel drawing #1-S-A-8-44. This was the first step I made in vetting this rifle, Further research from various websites and books by M1 Garand expert Scott A. Duff the bolt is March 1944, the trigger group is November 44, the op rod is Oct 42 - Dec 43. The barrel and receiver has all the correct proof marks along with the correct cartouches. On the left side of the stock there is a number painted on it, A34. From talking to vets I know they informed that when they were issued a rifle for the day, week, and so on they had to give the armory they're weapons card. Once they returned the rifle they would get the card back. On this card was the matching rack number in this case this rifle sat on 'A' rack in slot 34. I will provide all the research and documents to the buyer, I also found on eBay a weapons card, unfortunately the card is not for this rifle, (I wish it was). I called the CMP and spoke with the master armorer, he confirmed all of my findings, in my notes is his number and extension. I have tested the head space with the Herters ""go"", ""no go"" and field gauge. The rifle has passed all three gauges. I also bought an M1 Garand tool from eBay. It Measures various things in the Winchester and Springfield rifles, one of which is the muzzle diameter, to test whether or not the barrel is ""shot out"". The barrel and bore are clean and tight. I have taken this rifle as far as I can with the research, now it is time to sell it. It was a fun project, now on to the next one. All offers will be entertained."

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. The unit completely disassembles, without the use of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and .22 Magnum rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50.

The E1L Outdoorsman — now with 90 lumens of maximum output — is an ultra-compact, dual-output, extended-runtime flashlight featuring a virtually indestructible power-regulated LED emitter and a precision Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens. 

The E1L has a click-type pushbutton tailcap switch — press for momentary on, press until it clicks for constant-on. The switch is also used to select the light output level: press or click for a 5-lumen ultra long-runtime low beam that's perfect for reading a map, performing tasks inside a tent, or navigating around a campsite without degrading your dark-adapted vision. Release and press again within two seconds, or click again within two seconds, for a powerful 90-lumen high beam to reach deep into the dark. 

The E1L's small size and high-strength steel clip allow it to be securely stowed in a pocket or pack and provide quick and easy hands-free illumination by clipping the light to a hat brim or bill. Machined from aerospace aluminum and finished with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for resistance to abrasion and corrosion, the E1L is O-ring and gasket sealed, making it waterproof to a depth of one meter. 

For a slightly longer version of this flashlight with higher maximum output and longer runtimes, see our two-battery E2L Outdoorsman.

You see the Remlin versions selling cheaply for a reason! The older (all stainless steel internals) version sold for for more than they sell this cheap new version for. I am the original owner, this gun has seen maybe 200 rounds and is just getting broken in.

Gun shoots great, grip just seems a little to small for my gorilla hands :/. As with all the bodyguards, it does come with an insight laser mounted to the gun but is removable (supposedly, haven't messed with it). Cylinder release is on top of the gun in order to make it user-friendly for leftys. Comes with a nylon holster to wear on a belt. BTW goes without saying but it is .38 special +P rated. Great concealed carry option or home defense and has one of the better triggers of small 38 revolvers. Asking 400 and is negotiable but don't try to lowball me. I do not appreciate it and will not respond. Trades might be considered if it is something worth my time, if I do not respond its probably because your offer didn't interest me (sorry just being honest).. Thanks guys and gals."

 My father purchased this gun in the 70's.  Put three rounds through it and never fired it again.  Somehow my uncle ended up with it and it appears he fired it more than a few times.  It's nice and cleaned up now and the pictures show it.  For a 40 year old gun it's in great shape.  Comes with the smaller hand grips that came with the pistol at time of purchase, the book/parts list, and the carrying pouch.  I also have a box of bear loads to throw in as this was going to be my bear gun to carry in the woods.  But it's too nice to kick around outdoors.  Adjustable sights, and the grips are in nearly flawless condition.  An identical example of this security six just sold for over $500 on gun broker last week. And it did not have any of the original grips. From what I gather a lot of these ended up as service weapons for police and security so it's always a treat to find one in this kind of shape.  The pistol is also for sale on an auction site so availability is subject to change."

I bought this about 6 months ago intending it as an alternate to rotate in my carry lineup, but just like my regular EDC pistol too much to rotate it out.

Armorer's mark is Izveskh Alpha Numeric series. Has hallmark of being selected for sniper testing but was not drilled for the Zeiss conversion due to the proximity to the end of the war. Afterwards it shows that it was refurbished by Arsenal in Ukraine then put to work for the Soviet civi services. This rifle is in excellent condition and is an ideal example of a late wartime Mosin.
