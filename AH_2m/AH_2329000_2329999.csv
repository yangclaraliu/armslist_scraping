No annoying lemon squeeze on the grip like XD but still is just as reliable and more accurate then glock. An Im not an anti glock woman i own a 21 they are good guns too same with XDs they are nice but this offers loaded chamber indicator and tactical striker indicator features ambidextrous safety and mag release so even a lefty would have no problem handling it. also comes with large 17+1 capacity and 3 magazines (51 ready to go at any moment) a hard case ruger lock original paper work and stamped round.. this gun feels amazing and has adjustable grip so it will feel good to any shooter..below i added more ruger info-The SR9 is recoil operated with a locked breech. It features a staggered column box magazine (double-stack magazine) with a capacity of 17 rounds, The pistol has a very low slide profile; this holds the barrel axis close to the shooter's hand and makes the Ruger SR9 more comfortable to shoot by reducing muzzle rise and allowing for faster aim recovery in rapid shooting sequences. The slide is available in either brushed or blackened through-hardened stainless steel, and the frame is fiberglass-reinforced nylon polymer, resistant to warping or failure. The frame is offered in black or olive drab.[9] The SR9 also has a reversible backstrap which allows the owner to select either a flat or arched grip housing, based on personal preference. In addition, the SR9 sports a Picatinny rail for the mounting of laser sights and tactical lights.
Loaded chamber indicator indicating a cartridge present in the chamber of a SR9c.
The SR9 boasts multiple safety devices such an ambidextrous manual thumb safety and magazine release, a loaded chamber indicator, a visual and tactile cocked-striker indicator, and a firing pin block safety which prevents the pistol from firing if it is accidentally dropped. The SR9 also features a magazine disconnector.[1][2][3] The Ruger SR9 can safely be dry fired with an empty magazine in the pistol. A Ruger-issued warning states that, due to the disconnector, dry firing the pistol without the magazine inserted will cause unnecessary wear to the striker block,[3] but published firearms industry information notes that the SR9's disconnect can be deactivated simply by removing some of the disconnector linkage.[2]
The SR9's open iron sights are of the three-dot enhanced contrast variety, and offer drift adjustment on both front and rear blades for windage, as well as rear-sight adjustment for elevation....my glock doesnt do all that :("

Simple design, yet fast, strong, and dependable. Designed by Michael Treadway, and adopted by Tomahawk Bows®.

 Tomahawk Bows® are known for their impressive combination of speed, smoothness, and stability. The secret is in the design. Our unique ""trapped"" deflex/reflex limb profile and special core of two inner edge-grain laminations in addition to the two outer flat-grain laminations provide the ultimate combination of inner strength and outer beauty. Experience for yourself the shot stability, strength, and speed that only a Tomahawk Bow can deliver.

 The SS has been called ""Super Smooth,"" ""Super Sweet,"" ""Super Shooter,"" and many other things. The stained Bamboo adds an elegant look that makes this model stand out as ""Top of Class"" among all longbows. The riser is Cocobolo Dymondwood with black phenolic accents. Limbs are Super Action Wood and Carbon between Yew belly and stained Bamboo backing.

 All Tomahawk Bows use Gordon's clear Bow-Tuff fiberglass, phenolic tip overlays, and high-performance Fast Flight® Flemish twist string. Risers are cut approx 1/16"" positive of center with a black calf hair rest and plate installed.

Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel. We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle."

A friend gave me this revolver a few days ago before moving out of state. I am heavily into modern weapons, but nothing of this nature.

This revolver has been appraised by a company specializing in Civil War era pistols. The company’s information and appraisal sheet regarding this revolver is available upon request. 

I have attached additional links below if you are interested in viewing additional pictures. Just copy and paste each link into your browser and you’ll be directed to the website where I uploaded additional photos.

The antique pistol company will have this pistol on display at the Costa Mesa gun show on November 30th - December 1st. They will be charging me a fee of 20%, lol, so it would behoove me to attempt in selling this pistol myself before that date.

Regarding the Revolver:

Make: Starr Arms 
Model: 1863 Single Action
Caliber: .44

Barrel: A flashlight was shined down the barrel to better see the barrel's condition. The appraisers were impressed. There is very little pitting for being a revolver of that age (see link for photo).

Mechanics: The revolver is in excellent working order. I was advised against shooting this revolver after telling them I was tempted to shoot it. (see link for photo)

Markings: On the right side handle, you can see where the military cartouche is located. On the right side of the revolver, it reads “Starr’s Patent Jan, 18.1856.” On the left side of the revolver, it reads “Starr.Arms.Co.New.York.” (see link for photo)

Revolver’s Finish: I was told the finish was 99% gone (see link for photo)

Cylinder:  The nipples are in excellent condition and the timing is tight (see link for photo)

As with most anything used it does have some scratches and missing finish, but this rifle does have the wooden stock, and has quick disconnect sling swivel studs mounted / made on the rifle.

This rifle has new open sights and fiberglass ramrod with brass ends. Rifle comes with the following accessories; bullets & sabots in 3 different weights. 10 - 250 grain bullets, also 10 - 300 grain bullet’s & sabots and a 12 pack of 250 grain power point aerotip bullets still un-opened. A new box of Proxen 50 grain Proxed powder pellets, plus several powder pellets still in tubes that came with some of the bullets.

The #11 percussion caps that came on the rifle were not hot enough to ignite the pellets reliability, and have been replaced with a bigger / hotter # 10 nipples, there is one on the rifle and two new ones still in the pack, along with a new box of CCI #10 percussion caps (might be 6 or 8 missing). There is also a powder horn, this is a real powder horn and could be made to work, but because I use the powder pellets and I’ve just never fooled with it so for now it’s for looks.

There are also two knives (from Smokey Mt. Knife Works) these knives have fake Damascus blades and plastic handles. I had hoped to make new handles from deer horn and sheaths from deer skin…

Other accessories included a Black Powder cleaning kit, an old military pouch I use for a possible bag and a zippered camo rifle carrying case made by Allen Co.

The scope has a quick yardage adjustment dial on top for long shots. Comes with a few rounds of stock .270 ammo, a rifle sling, and a soft carrying case.

Just pulled it out of the box. I love the shotgun but I already own a keltec KSG so I figured I'd let this bad boy go considering I need the money more than I need a shotgun. This gun is a very unique piece. It holds 14+1 shells in 2 separate chambers. You have the option of shooting one tude of 7 then the next or shooting both in an alternating fashion. The action is behind the trigger assembly so the gun is similar to a bullpup and is very compact and light. The back of the gun can open up in case of a jam and can be cleared in seconds, and the tubes load on the top making it easy to load, both almost giving it the advantage over the KSG. My ksg however has some sentimental value so I'm keeping it over this, but the decision was very hard as they're both great guns. Add this to your collection as everyone will think you're rambo and you're surely going to get laid. So buymy gun now, get laid later..."

Carbon Fiber Stock and Forend. Ramped 10x8mm Ventilated rib.
The Benelli SuperSport and Sport II are the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun for sporting clays. These two Benelli shotguns are truly “speed guns.” The SuperSport’s ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it’s doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system’s special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. For traditionalists, the stock of the Benelli Sport II features beautifully figured A-Grade walnut with a satin luster finish, a right-hand contour gel recoil pad and cut checkering on both pistol grip and forend. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport and Sport II, with their superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, are almost like having an unfair advantage."
