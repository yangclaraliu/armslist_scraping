I purchased these in the last year and find we rarely travel to use them. They have been kept in our home in their case. If you are used to high value glass, this is a great choice over the greater magnification. I sold my 8 x 42 power set because of the weight; these are much lighter and the clarity is astounding. The only reason I am selling them is that I am undertaking an advertising venture in my business so am selling a new Sig 239 (listed here too) and these.


Update: I was asked about possible trades plus cash, and answered in the affirmative, but only if quality firearms, locally: Colt ARs, Sig 220, Benelli, Rem 870 (defense configuration)... with cash preferred, however.

(This is not a Star Grade rifle)
Rifle as it came from CMP $695

I will include a nearly new Truglo 36X scope (used three times at range as I got a deal on a Weaver T-36) With scope for $750 

Rifle includes everything that came with it from CMP (Rifle, Front and Rear sights, autheniication letter, inspection certificate and supplied trigger lock, packing box and shipping box)

On inspection, this rifle has all it's parts and the rifle itself. On careful inspection (I had to look over couple times) to find a very light razor mark 5” long on the left forearm. There is a couple bumps on the right side of the forearm, but they must be felt with fingers as not visible to the naked eye. Not to say that under a magnifying light, they could not be distinguished as blemishes to the wood. Considering the way these were handled in the 90’s under inventory control. This one is very nice. Bolt and Rifle serial numbers match and this one is GM001xxx.

I hand picked and purchased several of these rifles in August and the first one I used was a good shooter, so I am going to sell a couple of them. 

I will transfer the rifle at this point, one of three ways. I will ship to your FFL dealer if they will receive from an individual. If not then I will have the rifle shipped through my local FFL dealer. The fee depends on how much he charges me. Or I will do a FTF transfer in Sebastian, Florida. I can legally ship person to person using USPS within the state of Florida ONLY. Buyer is responsible for all shipping cost. Cost within the state is $30 insured and priority 2nd Day.

**************Added note: The factory trigger with no modifications can be adjusted to as low as 13oz. If you have a gunsmith disassemble, add the available replacement trigger spring (which goes with the rifle), and hone and polish both the trigger foot and sear. The trigger can go down as far as 5oz I believe. The one I shoot is 10oz with replacement trigger spring. The receiver is dovetailed to accept a scope*****************

Replaceable sights, improved internals making recoil easier, and better handling of +P rounds, tactical rail, bulkier in places it needed, and slimmer in places it needed.

Took it shooting, and just... wasn't feeling it. So I'm seeing what else is out there before I dedicate time to getting used to how it shoots and feels. Maybe it's just because I don't do 9mm often. But no problems whatsoever.

I did purchase quite a few things with it, so hold on while I put some math out there, using prices that are commonly online.
Gun: Average is $600 from online places. I figure that even if the cheapest place has them in stock, $600 will be a great deal after FFL holding and check fees, so I'll just leave it at that for price. I paid more, since I bought from a local shop, but I'm not going to keep my reciepts just for proving a number to whiners.

Magazines: Comes with 3-17 rounders, which I shall deface a little bit to limit the round count, similar to what gunshows do, and I have 5-15 round magazines, since two rounds is the difference between a safe American, and a psycho. A bit over $100 for all 5.

TLR-1: Had to get a tactical light. Lowest on Amazon is $99.99999 or so, but I got mine for cheaper.

Cheap holster: It's mainly a house gun for me, but I got one of those cheap-O holsters.
Got it from a friend, so $free.99

And I have 100 rounds currently. Getting more when I find good deals. $30-ish.

Now's about the time that I should state that I don't really care for people sending me emails on how long or short a post should be. If you wanna only post that you have some ""9milly"" then that's fine. I like information. And I have nothing better to do...

All that comes out to $829, which I'd happily take, if you want to give it to me. But I think $700 would be more reasonable to start with. OBO.

I picked this up used. Originally had a pink frame that someone painted olive drab. Action seems to work OK, but has trouble cycling the slide. This seems to be a problem with this, and other semi-auto .22lr pistols.   Check YouTube for more info.  I'm tired of messing with it. If you are good at fixing / modifying these, or need parts, this is a good deal. If you expect to shoot it trouble free out of the box, buy something different.

I purchased these in the last year and find we rarely travel to use them. They have been kept in our home in their case. If you are used to high value glass, this is a great choice over the greater magnification. I sold my 8 x 42 power set because of the weight; these are much lighter and the clarity is astounding.  The only reason I am selling them is that I am undertaking an advertising venture in my business so am selling a new Sig 239 (listed here too) and these.

These guns have received great reviews.  The only comment has been having no forward assist or dust cover.  Some tests have been run trying to make it malfunction but it still performed well.

The good news is that if that is still an issue (this was my original plan), you can have an upper receiver installed with a dust cover and forward assist for about $100.00.  This gives you all the features with the Smith & Wesson quality for a great price.

I'm the original owner of this 45.  The double action trigger is absolutely great.  I'm not sure of round count but it isn't particularly high.  I'll guess 250-350.  Definitely no more than 350.  It's a great shooter but a 3"" 45 ain't exactly a plinker for all day on Sundays so I haven't worn it out by any means.  It's just getting broken in.

Comes with original case and documentation plus CD and lock.  Two 7 round magazines.  I'll toss in an extra main spring (hold on now....that's a $4 value!!)

This has been a flawless gun.  I'm only selling to fund another platform that I don't have at this point.  45 ACP, I have.  Not a single issue since day one.  Everything I fed in, it's processed.  The only SD ammo has been Hornady XTP 185 gr.  Everything in 200 and 230 ball ammo has been great.  

It has a little holster wear but not much.  It carries absolutely great, IWB, but I kind of always wondered if it was just a bit to good looking for me to carry regularly.  I haven't carried it a great deal since I have a farm and I'm crawling under tractors, splitting wood, etc.

SS and alloy, cocobolo grips, ambi safety, match grade 3"" barrel, Trijicon nights sights that are very bright.  Ramp and bore very good.  It's all cleaned up and lubed w/TW 25b.  Ready to rock.

I will ship if necessary but I'd rather do a local deal....who wouldn't I suppose.  No trades please!  Meeting place will be something logical/reasonable.  No out of state in face to face.

The XR9-L is truly the finest pocket pistol money can buy, representing the pinnacle of performance, accuracy and low recoil via an exclusive ""mid-buffer"" that absorbs harsh recoil. Using select 9mm +P ammunition, this pistol generates over 500 Ft-Lbs of muzzle energy with felt recoil similar to a .380 ACP. Using standard-pressure 9mm ammunition, the XR9-L produces felt recoil similar to .22 LR. The pistol features an integrated Picatinny rail to support several commercial lasers and flashlights.

The all-stainless construction of the P220® Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long. As the next generation P220, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG’s new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite.

I will be removing this listing tomorrow night and will put it back in the safe ... there have just been too many time wasters and those who think an energy drink is an even trade (yep....I'm being sarcastic) ... :P

Let me know what you have, I just might be interested.
I've been collecting gemstones for years and my interests have changed, time to pass on the collection. Every stone has been purchased through reputable dealers, no online/ebay/unseen stones. All are 100% authentic, naturally produced stones (except 1 Lindy stone, a simulated blue star sapphire). The bulk of them are centerpiece stones, but there are also plenty of accent stones for designing your own jewelery.

This is the ideal collection for anyone looking to design custom jewelery for loved ones or for anyone looking to collect/invest in a tangible asset that does not lose value.  The set has been professionally inspected and valued between $1400-1800.  This is simply a retail estimate, not my asking price. I am flexible and willing to make a deal as long as the offer is realistic. And NO, your single shot NEF shotgun with a few boxes of ammo is not a realistic offer.
