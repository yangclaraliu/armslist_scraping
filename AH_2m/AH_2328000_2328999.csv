Sig Sauer Zombie Pistol .45 Cal 5"" Match Barrel, May 25, 2013

Sig Zombie 1911 .45cal Review 02-10-2013 I recently purchased a new Sig Sauer Zombie 1911 .45 cal pistol. The slide / frame fit is tight and slick. Balance of the pistol in hand is great. Function of the slide is smooth. Trigger pull and break is outstanding. Shooting handloads of 185gr XTP's and lead hard cast 225 gr. bullets resulted in super sensational accuracy off a rest at 75 feet. Dropping 4.8 grs. of Red Dot powder for the 225 gr. hard cast bullets resulting in all powder burned and no un-burned powder left anywhere in the gun. The gun cycles rounds super fast; double taps are less than a blink of an eye. The engraving of the biohazard symbol on top of the slide very precise and detailed. Weighs in at 41.6oz. Very nice match barrel, field strips easier as the gun breaks in. Magazine follower has raised dimple in the middle to facilitating feeding. While first getting use to the trigger pull and feel of the recoil of this Sig Zombie 1911, I shot a few unintentional double taps, and then realized then just how fast the gun will cook off, surprisingly “SPEEDY”. I recently read that these special edition guns have all been sold & Bill Hicks is out of inventory, yet some can be found on the web for sale new from personal owners. This gun has far exceeded all my expectations, while carrying it with a Bianchi 1911 holster is very comfortable and shows no print with a loose shirt, the engraved biohazard symbol is visible on the top/back of the slide through the holster along with the aluminum Zombie theme grips, the gun provides a distinct experience for both high performance accurate shooting and radically different cosmetics. Overall quality is outstanding. Those who are bashing this pistol on the web have obviously never handle one or shot one, I have and it is an intimidating smokin fast shooting accurate piece of steel that will not dissapoint even the most seasoned of shooters, it could easily be used in competion and give all the participating contenders a run for their money, and that's no B.S. Shoot one for yourself and you'll then understand what this pistol is truly capable of. E<>R

Stay away from this person, they say they are a female and won't meet unless she knows who you are, says that after the agreed meet time.

We agreed to meet today at Cabellas in Columbus at 10:30, emailed when I left Mansfield, didn't hear back for over an hour, the first email I did hear back was that she has not left the house yet, this was at 10:40 or so.

Then she says the email she was asking about who I am, that her computer never sent it, yeah right !!

When I did get a cell number, no response to my text, and then this person wants me to wait another 30 minutes, I already have been sitting and waiting 35 minutes past our agreed meet time.

This persons email is as follows;

REDACTED


Stay clear, don't make any deal as this person will just stroke you along, and not show up.

I don't appreciate wasting over 3 hours of my time.

This has me do pissed off, I'm a CCW permit holder, and this person says they don't meet people they don't know, if that's the case, then they should get the hell off Armlist.

I'm sure that person will flag this ad, let's hope the mods keep it up, so that everyone will know about this person also..

At first this person tries to justify that the email she sent me was never sent, then this person says that it was supposed to have been sent, but this person would not respond back to an text message I sent them, and they actually expected me to stay and wait another 30-35 minutes, after the agreed upon meet time.


Dont waste your time with this person, very flaky, very weird, and I would not mess, or waste your time with a person that lives 10 minutes or so down the road from the meet, and still wants you to wait 35 more minutes.

I'm adding a pic of the GSG they say they have for sale.

It appears to have been rebored by the germans and adapted to take stripper clips as well as the newer ammo (shoot at your own risk, it is a very old firearm) Rifle Turk stamped Ankara 1940. I have taken it apart and cleaned the cosmolene off the metal parts, but should still be inspected prior to trying any type of ammo through it.

It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

And more $$ at other outlets....but mine is nearly new, used very little and is just 25 bucks.
As you can see, a small bit of the powder coating on each of the two snaps has chipped off, but that will happen in just five minutes after you put a new one on any rifle, so what you get are savings. The rest of the sling, elastic ends, sling covers, etc. is all LIKE NEW. Big, comfortable and reliable with a great price, no tax and no shipping...a great deal.

If you do some research on this gun you will learn that it is the exact same gun as the Beretta Cougar from the past and it is even built on all the exact same machines. The only difference in the two guns is the name and where it was manufactured. This gun has been described as a compact Beretta 92/96. Its operations are all identical to the Beretta. It is a full metal frame gun which gives it plenty of heft to make it great for the range or even winter carry. I love shooting it but i also love getting different guns to try out for a while. I have only had this gun since last November and it has not been shot a ton as I normally shoot my IDPA guns while I am at the range.

406,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2328406,For Sale:  Rare Low Recoil Heckler & Koch USP Compact 9 MM Stainless,"bmatousek@cox.net, Wichita, Kansas",$ 975,"Listed On: Monday, January 13, 2014",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Looking for a quality pistol with low, low recoil?  Look no further!  This Stainless H&K USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) is a double action/single action, de-cocking lever, and has no safety.  With less than 200 rounds through it, it is in pristine condition.  Two 10 round magazines and case are included.

The USP is a semi-automatic pistol with a mechanically locked breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system has a large rectangular lug over the barrel’s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm (0.12 in) of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile has left the barrel and gas pressures have dropped to a safe level. A shaped lug on the underside of the barrel chamber comes into contact with a hooked locking block at the end of the steel recoil spring guide rod, lowering the rear end of the barrel and stopping the barrel's rearward movement. The recoil spring assembly is held in place by the slide stop lever’s axis pin and a round cut-out at the front of the slide. For enhanced reliability in high-dust environments, the locking surface on the front top of the barrel’s locking lug is tapered with a forward slope. This tapered surface produces a camming action which assists in positive lock-up in the presence of heavy fouling and debris. In this way, the USP shares many design features with the M1911 pistol, although apparently updated for easier operation.

One of the most significant features of the USP is the mechanical recoil reduction system. This system is incorporated into the recoil spring assembly, located below the barrel and consists of a heavy, captive coil spring around the guide rod. Designed primarily to buffer the slide and barrel and reduce recoil effects on the pistol components, the system also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter up to 30%. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and does not require adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.[3] Using this same recoil reduction system, one of the related H&K Mk 23 .45 ACP pistols fired more than 30,000 high pressure +P cartridges and 6,000 proof loads without damage or excessive wear to any major components. Abuse and function-testing of USPs have seen more than 20,000 rounds of .40 S&W fired without a component failure. Milspec environmental tests were conducted in high and low temperatures, in mud, immersed in water and in salt spray. In one particular test, a bullet was deliberately lodged in the barrel and another bullet was fired to clear the obstruction. The barrel was successfully cleared with only minor structural deformation and continued to produce consistent groups when test fired for accuracy.[6]

Major metal components on both the USP and Special Operations Pistol are corrosion-resistant. Outside metal surfaces, such as the steel slide are protected by a proprietary ""Hostile Environment"" nitride finish.[3] Internal metal parts, such as springs, are coated with a Dow Corning anti-corrosion chemical to reduce friction and wear.[7][8]

The USP is composed of a total of 54 parts and is broken down into 7 major components for maintenance and cleaning: the barrel, slide, recoil spring, recoil spring guide rod, the frame, slide stop and magazine. This is done by retracting the slide back to align the slide stop axis pin with the disassembly notch on the left side of the slide and withdrawing the axis pin."

The PMAG X4
The PMAG is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine with round-count windows. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.  The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Angled Fore Grip (AFG) 
Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.  The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

XTM Rail Panels 
These XTM Rail Panels are a two-piece design that attach anywhere on a 1913 Picatinny rail without having to remove previously-mounted accessories. The combination of design and material used in the XTM Panels ensures they will remain securely in place under all operating conditions, but may be easily removed using the tips of two rounds when necessary.

B.A.D. Lever.  
Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.  Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

Battery Storage Core. 
Internal core unit for the MIAD, MOE Grip, and MOE+ Grip designed to hold two (2) AA type batteries in a self contained waterproof unit.  Included internal spacer provides rattle free storage of either (2) AAA or (2) N size batteries (commonly used for EOTech sights).  Rubber cap has two sides with marking to identify ""spent"" batteries and can be opened with a push of the thumb.

The Magpul CTR buttstock
(Compact/Type Restricted) – Commercial-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Commercial-Spec Model includes an extended 0.55"" rubber butt-pad to provide positive shoulder purchase and accommodates the longer, slanted back common to most commercial-spec tubes.

The MOE Grip
Provides Magpul quality, feel, and durability in an economical, drop-in upgrade for the standard AR15/M16/M4 pistol grip. The ergonomic, hand filling design combines aggressive texturing with storage core capability. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, the one-piece reinforced polymer construction provides simplicity and a reduced cost while still maintaining the durability needed to withstand operational environments. The MOE Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. All mounting hardware included.

EO Tech 512. 
The Model 512 is the most popular model HWS.  This tactical optic is perfect for agencies that want the best in CQB speed and versatility, without the need for night vision compatibility.
AA Battery Model (supports Lithium and Alkaline)
Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot
Includes rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-less mounting bolt
Interfaces to 1” Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) or Weaver rail

The GG&G EOTech 
Lens Covers fit between the EOTech hood and the body of the EOTech housing. They are spring operated so that once pressure is applied to release them from the closed position, they spring open. The rear cover lays across the top, so as not to interfere with the field of view. The front cover opens and serves as a sun shield. However, if heavy brush etc. is encountered, the front lens will fold back so that it is not damaged. Because of the contours of the EOTech housing, these rifle scope lens covers are not 100% waterproof, but they do prevent most dust, debris, rain and snow from accumulating on the lenses. These unique lens covers for scopes can be easily operated with either hand to provide flexibility of operation. The design and methodology is so unique that we were awarded a patent

FSL-3 Laser System Smaller and Smarter  
Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date.  Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.  Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.  The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

 This rifle was purchased earlier this year and is in perfect working order. I take care of my items and they are spot on. My son and I have only put about 350 rounds on this one since we got it. It's a triangle stamped 1972 dated mil-spec trunion. G2 trigger, polished feed ramp, this is NOT one of the poorly made AK's. Granted its not milled but its not priced as such either. sights are dead on and are NOT canted. I hand finished the stock and grip in a Russian red with several coats of clear after the stain process. It looks great and is completely water proof now and smooth as glass. Comes with original manual, price tag, id badge, bayonet, (8) 30 round mags and (2) 40 round mags, plus over 2100 rounds of ammo in a ammo can and spam can crate. Also comes with a tactical carry case in od green. $1575 o.b.o or open to partial trades and cash.

They truly don't make them like this anymore. S&W took over production of the PP line over a decade ago and altered the design. Most people will tell you the pre-S&W guns are much better.

I can reload the following cartridges 7mm Rem Mag, 308 Winchester (using small base RCBS dies so the rounds feed reliable in semi autos), and 500 S&W.  Price will depend on your specifications and whether or not you supply the components.  I have several years experience and my equipment is high quality.  All brass will be ultrasonic cleaned then polished with stainless steel rods in a rotary tumbler.  The case will then be trimmed for length using Lee case hand trimmers.  Once primed I will use a rcbs volumetric powder thrower to load each case.  If you want more accuracy in powder weight I can use a digital lyman powder trickler and scale that is accurate to a .1 of a grain.  Digital measuring of powder will cost extra because it is more time consuming.  I will seat the bullet and crimp to your specifications.  Overall length will be measured using calipers.  Basically you will receive ammo that is the same quality as factory if not better at a lower price.  Let me know what you are needing and we can discuss price.  All you need to do is supply brass.  It will definitely be better than paying the outrageous retail price."

The barrel is a Bison Armory 1:7 Twist that permits the use of both supersonic and subsonic rounds (90 grain up to 200 grain). Rifle will function reliably for all forms of SPC II rounds. The barrel has 75 rounds through it.

The bolt is a LWRC 6.8 enhanced bolt, which is Nickel Boron from the factory for better reliability. These bolts are some of the best on the market, for 6.8. The carrier is a Nickel Boron Black Rain Ordnance. The carrier is smoked from the DI gas but still is as slick as ever.

The charging handle is a PRI Gas Buster with the big latch. This pushes gases out to the right side of the rifle, instead of getting a face full of gas. The magazine is also a PRI and is 25 rounds. They are capable of using the longest OAL rounds for the 6.8 (140 berger) and are the most reliable magazines on the market.

The flash hider is an AAC 51T mount that is capable of accepting any AAC suppressor that is 51T. 

The stock, grip, sights, rail protectors and angled foregrip are all magpul. The grip itself is the MOE+ (Rubber coated) and very comfortable.

The trigger is custom 2 stage from White Oak Armament and has a very clean break.
