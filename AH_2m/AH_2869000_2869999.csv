 The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use. The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position

No BS, smooth transactions. Local pickup is available for those around Pittsburgh, PA or we will ship to your local dealer for $20. 6% sales tax in PA and all ATF paperwork as required by law.

I have not had it officially authenticated or appraised with paperwork but i have had it looked at by two antique arms dealers and a civil war military/Indian artifact expert and they all concluded that it was authentic. It has been modified and cut, and shows wear but the unique part is that it has been wrapped in leather and sewed together with sinew. It has also been brass tacked for decoration or use. You can see wear from use and how that the oils from the hands and face have discolored the leather. it is a absolutely extraordinary piece.

I could tell you they retail for 400+ dollars but a quick google search will tell you they're available for cheaper than that. Bottom dollar price. I've been seeing is around 250 for a knife in this condition. I'll ask $240/best offer for now. 

Email me with any offers. I'd consider trades for firearms/ammo if the deal is right but mainly looking for cash right now. 

Let me know what you've got!

Thanks."

I have addressed all issues these firearms were known for and replaced all problems with Wilson Combat Bulletproof parts. I changed the extractor, fitted bushing, beaver tail grip safety, and skeletonized hammer. The new grip safety gives you a nice, high ride grip, whereas the factory grip safety pushed your hand off of it. I also had the feed ramp reground and polished to cycle any and all ammo-hard ball, hollow points, etc. I also have a new 18# spring in it, that was just test fired and has 2 magazines on it. We also polished the trigger, and it is light and smooth as butter. The pistol is very accurate, very clean, excellent condition- especially being a 30+ year old collector item. I know the original owner who kept it in a safe and rarely shoots. I fixed all the problems and made a nice pistol that will run with the best of em. I am more interested in cash, but may take a really good trade on my end, or a partial trade preferably for something as good as cash. I have plenty of 1911's, and this isn't something I am looking to beat up or compete with, and I don't think beautiful shooters are made to collect dust. I am quite far into this gun with gunsmithing, quality high-end parts, and running it around to different experts to piece together a fantastic shooter. My loss is your gain.

The rifle is my dad's. He's a police officer for City of Wyoming and signed the rifle out every day for three  years. When the city switched to M4s, he was given the option to buy it. So he did and it's pretty much been in his gun cabinet ever since. 

This rifle comes with a Bushnell 1.75-4x Scope with caps and a 10 round GI mag (same magazines as AR-15.) The rifle was only in service a few years with less than 500 rounds fired.  It's got normal signs of use (small marks on left side of receiver) that do not effect the overall appearance.
It's currently waiting on a replacement stock pad (it shipped) and will have it replaced before it's sold. Let me know if you have any questions.

A dueling tree is also an excellent training tool that will help sharpen your shooting skills. The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50. You can email through the sight or call or text me @ 931-312-912two

Rimfire trees:
6 paddle = $200
8 paddle = $225
AR500 trees:
4 paddle = $275
6 paddle = $325

For an unbeatable deal, order one 8 paddle rimfire tree and one 6 paddle AR500 tree and get BOTH trees for only $475! You can't even buy 1 commercial AR500 tree for that price! 2 commercial trees like this would be well over $800.00!"

The assembly includes the base, the 30mm ring, and the spacer which brings the centerline to SOCOM Height for Lower 1/3 Co-witiness with the Back-Up Iron Sights.  

This mount functions smoothly and easily.  By depressing the lever, and twisting the magnifier to the side, the ring disconnects from the base allowing for removal of the magnifier.  This mount is original Aimpoint equipment, but will work with any 3X Magnifier with a 30mm diameter (Eotech, Vortex, Primary Arms, etc.)

This mount is brand new.  I tested its function on my rifle before ordering an American Defense Flip to the side mount to match my optic base.  I never fired the rifle with this mount attached.  There is no box for the mount as it came with my Aimpoint Magnifier.  This is an excellent upgrade to any factory magnifier mount.  It could also be used as a Quick Detach Mount for any 30mm Red Dot Optic.  It locks up tight, so removing the optic from the weapon platform, and returning to zero upon reinstall action is a sure thing.

I am including a link below for this product on Brownell's for further info.  Note that the mount sells for $180 without the Co-Witness Spacer.

The SA Sports Badge was a decoration of Nazi Germany that was issued between the years 1933 and 1945. It was a political version of the much more generic German Sports Badge which was also issued in great numbers by the Nazis. The SA Sports Badge was issued in three grades (bronze, silver, and gold) as well as a special version known as the ""SA Sports Badge for War Wounded"". Although originally designed as a physical fitness badge for Nazi stormtroopers, the SA Sports Badge was issued across every German military and paramilitary organization.

In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!



Description: Up for auction is one of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS.

Videos of firearm in action with ""Walmart special"" Federal 1200 FPS 8 shot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2JPS7XkMqI&index=2&list=PLrEG-u9iWTBVCJtC08XY19EEWp3whSt-X

I have for sale a VEPR 12 semi-automatic AK platform shotgun.

 - The barrel has been chopped and a Tromix Monster brake welded on @18.5"" (not an SBS). Professionally done by Tac47 here in Houston (a well-known name in the Russian firearm game).

 - Bonesteel side folder installed

 - (2) 5 round Molot magazines included

 - Bolt and trigger group polished by myself

 - CSS low power recoil spring to counter reduced gas pressure of the shorter barrel. Tested and prove. Have videos for proof.

EOTech XPS2 not included


If you're unfamiliar with this firearm, it is a lot like the Saiga 12 but much better:

 - Last round bolt hold open - holds the bolt open on the last round. My favorite feature.

 - ""Auto-regulating"" gas system - no need to change settings on the gas plug for various loads. Although I'm yet to find any sort of regulator, I think it's just gassed to hell as it has 5 ports in the barrel as opposed to the Saiga's 3.

 - Bolt release button

 - Mag well - No need to ""rock and lock"" magazines. Just slap them in. This combined with the LRBHO and bolt release makes for nearly AR15-speed reloads.

 - Overall higher quality control, fit and finish.

 - RPK style sights - elevation and windage adjustable

 - The S12 barrel are bored. As in a solid stock with a drill bit ran down the middle. This leads to all kinds of variances. If the bore is a little off center, the barrel wall varies, which creates huge differences in applied gas pressure. The VEPR barrel, like all Molot barrels, is cold hammer forged. Same as the rifles. Better stressing, more consistency with gas pressure and barrel wall. This is the main reason the S12 is not commonly used in competition.

 - hinged and railed dust cover"

I may have forgotten what else it came with but I'll edit this post when I get back to my home in about a week.
Only one blemish on the rifle, the mag-well of the receiver has a little bit of the finish worn off from the previous owner practicing mag changes a little too zealously.
Other than that it had a relatively low round count for a used gun (under 500).
The reason the price is what it is, is because the receiver is rare along with very high quality, and the rifle is entirely foreign built, and they aren't made anymore."

Beware of a guy who posts higher grade rifles on the cheap. He has had a few Rock Rivers, S&W M&Ps and a couple of Colts listed for beyond good prices. When contacted, I did so for tangible evidence, he only requests a bank transfer and will then send the ""details"", no FTF with permit, cash and bill of sale. These rifles are posted for a few hundred less than the actual valuation. He is posting the rifles listed in Illinois, Illinois. It's a scam and all should beware.
