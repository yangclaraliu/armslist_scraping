Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

The price is firm and I need cash for this. The only way I would take a trade is if it's in my favor because I'll just need to turn around and sell it. That takes time."

I purchased the gun from Gander Mountain a while back in there used gun section and loved it. After a full strip and cleaning the gun was and is in great condition. I replaced a few of the common wear out points and springs and found the gun would not cycle hollow point ammo. it would get hung up on the feed ramp. I machined and smoothed out the internals of the gun and did some fitment work to make it as close to perfect as I could. I have roughly 30 hours of work in the gun and it was fun the entire time. I have 250 rounds through the weapon and not one malfunction since. I am looking to sell the weapon since it is tax time and could use the money to pay my taxes. thanks for reading this and hopefully it will perk your interest and I will be hearing from you."

Im not a 16 year old girl i dont have time in my life to text back and forth with another grown man about this gun listed. If your going to super low ball someone grow a sack and call them on the phone instead of requesting 300 pics all damn day.  
Far as trades go if your gun doesnt say USP compact .45 on the slide im not interested in it. I can see that craigslist has spilled over to this site. Its a shame."

There is nothing wrong with the weapon, except that I can't get past the fact that everything is backwards and it really is a ""lefty"".

-Diamondhead Handguard
-1/9 twist chrome-lined barrel
-Left side ejection port (ejects up and away, so can be easily fired by

much cooler, and is much easier to clean than gas-impingement rifles.

The Del-ton upper is a lightweight upper with the low profile.  It is a 16"" carbine length.  The lower is a New Frontier Armory polymer lower.  This lower actually has one of the nicest stock trigger i have felt.  If you don't know anything about the New Frontier lowers i recommend looking at their website, they are impressive.  
The lighter barrel really improves ergonomics the perceived and actual weight is significantly less.  Without the added barrel weight at the end of the gun it is better balanced.  Of course the polymer lower cuts down on weight too.  I don't remember the exact weight but it was well below 6 pounds.  Its hard to get too much lighter than this combination. 

I am the first and only owner.  You may ask why I'm selling such a cool AR-15.  I built it as a lightweight upper for my wife to shoot.  Surprise, Surprise, having her own lightweight AR-15 wasn't as big a deal for her as I thought it would be...so I'm selling it.  It was only shot once.  We put about 50 rounds through it no problem."

Hi, my name is John and I have been out to new Castle 2 times in last five years and loved it. Love it out there and looking for some antelope hunting property. I figured someone on here must know of a landowner or maybe themselves that might have some land for me and my brother to hunt. We used to hunt this guy named Vern's Ranch but his son is not letting us not that his father I belive has moved on. In past years we have stayed four or five days and spent a lot of money in town(helping local economy, which I do as well in my small home town in the upper peninsula of Michigan.) Looking for some insight of a direction to head. If you know of anyone allowing us to hunt with a trespass fee only please let me know or just a couple of numbers I can call of people with hunt able lanf. I understand your time is money so I wouldn't mind throwing a finders fee for you or whoever might get us on a decent property. I have a hotel booked in new Castle the first week of October. I would like to stay within an hour drive of NC. Please let me know. Thank you so much. Very responsible and respectful. Looking to build a relationship nor future hunting trips.

It's what you would call an ""ex dragoon"" because it started it's life as an m91 dragoon and was updated in 1930 to an m91/30. All of the numbers match except the bayonet, and the rifle is in good shape.  It didn't go straight from the factory to storage like most of the 1940's rifles; it was carried around by troops and used as a combat rifle, and it does show some wear accordingly.  There's no rust on the rifle, but the shellac is worn and scratched in some places as you can see in the pictures.  The rifle shoots well, and is fun if you can stand the kick.  This mosin has more history behind it than most of the ones you see for sale, I've enjoyed always having the oldest rifle at the range.
