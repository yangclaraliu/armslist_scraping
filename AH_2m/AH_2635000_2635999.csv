Description from Condor:
The Condor Summit Soft Shell Jacket is designed with a three layer integrated shell fabric technology with reinforcement on the forearms. The breathable shell wicks moisture from the body, prevents water penetration, while maintaining body heat. Underarm vent zipper to control temp, and multiple pockets are provided for utility and storage. Also available in a lighter version, the Summit ZERO, for warmer climates. 
This durable, waterproof, lightweight, breathable fabric contains billions of microscopic pores smaller than a raindrop, but hundred times larger than a molecule of water. The triple layer combination wicks moisture, stops water from passing through, and circulates body heat.

The Condor Summit Soft Shell Jacket is designed with a three layer integrated shell fabric technology with reinforcement on the forearms. The breathable shell wicks moisture from the body, prevents water penetration, while maintaining body heat. Underarm vent zipper to control temp, and multiple pockets are provided for utility and storage. Also available in a lighter version, the Summit ZERO, for warmer climates. 
This durable, waterproof, lightweight, breathable fabric contains billions of microscopic pores smaller than a raindrop, but hundred times larger than a molecule of water. The triple layer combination wicks moisture, stops water from passing through, and circulates body heat.

Makes short work out of trimming large quantities of rifle brass. The RT 1200B is used just like a standard size die. The big difference is that while you are pushing the case into the die to size it, a 1/4 horsepower electric motor driving a carbide cutter is trimming the case to length. Chips are drawn off through a vacuum manifold that clamps to the outside of the special size/trim die.

(Vacuum cleaner and hose not included.) Outside diameter of manifold as 1.250""

The RT1200B is equipped with a quick-disconnect power cord; and it can be used on any standard reloader, single stage or progressive.

177,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2635177,For Sale:  Ammo: Speer Gold Dot 9mm 124gr - 50 Round Boxes,"north columbus, Columbus, Ohio",$ 50,"Listed On: Friday, January 31, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi. I have several 50 round (not 20 round) boxes of Speer Gold Dot 9mm 124gr JHP, new in the box. These are the best 9mm self-defense hollow point rounds available and even used by law enforcement. They are highly rated. Again, these are FIFTY (50) round boxes, people. The going price for JUST the twenty (20) round box at Gander Mountain and Vance (which are sold out) is $27.99/box + tax (total is $29.87 at 1.0675% tax). If you do the math, that breaks down to $29.87/20= 1.49 per single round. Therefore, a 50-round box at the same price (which they don't sell in town at all) would normally be $1.49ea x 50 rounds = $74.69 per 50 round box.

Using that logic, I propose a very fair price of just $50.00 per 50-round box (only $1.00/round). I consider this to be fair and not price-gouging by any means. (which I have noticed recently here on this website). Hope this helps.

I'm in the north columbus area (Polaris/Westerville/New Albany etc) and any buyer(s) would need to meet me in this general area (21 and over only). Don't ask me if I still have some; if the ad is listed, then they are available. Price is firm. Face to face only; I will not ship them. Thanks.

Here is an old Colt (circa 1951, I believe Ser #803377) along with a belt and holster.  The holster would look good with a little shoe polish or dye, but I am showing it without any tampering.  The revolver is stamped C.P.D. on the butt so I'm guessing Cleveland PD.  My father bought it 30 or so years ago.  It has some holster wear but is tight.  This makes me think it was carried more than it was fired.  Its a good shooter and, of course, very reliable and simple to operate.  It has a trigger shoe installed, which makes double action feel lighter.  It would make a great house gun for anybody who does not want to worry about the complexity of many modern auto pistols.  It fires every time the trigger is pulled with a good round.  If there is a misfire, pull the trigger again.  No feeding, jamming or stovepiping. Low power reloads and shotshells function well with no fear of being too soft to work the slide.  A classic."

Product Description All business, no nonsense. The X-Bolt stalker isn't flashy, but it is durable, accurate, simple, and has all the elegant lines and curves you'll find on its ""prettier"" siblings. More and more hunters are turning to the Composite firearms for many reasons. Probably the biggest is that they no longer want to bang up that pretty Walnut stock. The X-Bolt Composite Stalker is an excellent rifle choice for deer hunting in conditions where a hunter may not wish to take the traditional Walnut stocked rifle. The X-Bolt Composite Stalker's stock is made from tough, Composite material that can take a beating. Don't think it would be slippery, unattractive or uncomfortable to fire. The stock is textured for a secure grip from forearm to pistol grip. It also has a comfortable palm-swell and a Dura-Touch Armor Coating over a flat, black finish. The barrel, bolt and receiver are also finished in a flat, durable non-glare surface. This is a rifle with all the deluxe features of the X-Bolt family, but rugged enough for the demanding hard core deer, elk and sheep hunters. • Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. • The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. • Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. • Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform. • Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass."" • Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact. • 60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion. • Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. • Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change. •Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged. • Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil. • Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare •Dura-Touch Armor Coating provides positive gripping surface that is both comfortable and easy to hold onto during all weather conditions.

As I am sitting here in the freezing cold with nothing but the comforts of modern chemistry and ancient distillation to assuage the boredom of a long winter night I have decided to try and type up a listing of this cartridge collection.

However there are still many unusual and interesting pieces to ponder Old and new. Some may seem entirely modern and mundane but were included as samples of type or have whiz-bang bullets of some kind and in 50 years time will perhaps be oddities in their own right.

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con's patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

While I understand you want to get the most you can for what you have keep in mind that this is not gun broker. If you want the full cash value of your weapon I suggest you go there. If you buy a weapon for $1000.00 and take it home, you have just lost value because very few people will pay an individual retail especially when they cannot return said item. Most people on here have run of the mill weapons. If you come on here with a gold plated 1911 with all the bells and whistles and say you want to trade, then don't be a dick when someone contacts you with a couple lower end guns. That kind of trade is what this site is about. Granted you may very well trade your gold plated $10,000 pistol for a platinum plated grenade launcher. But what fun is a weapon you are never gonna use.

The bolt is the smoothest I've felt on any bolt rifle in any price range, it's the stainless version so it will stand up to moisture, and it shoots under 1 inch at 100 yards with every ammo I've used. It also has a very crisp adjustable trigger on it.  It has a 4-12x40 Redfield Revolution scope with 4.2 inches of eye relief (made be Leupold in the USA), and I swapped the factory rings with the DNZ game reaper one piece mount. The rifle is in perfect condition and only has 60 rounds through it. It will come with the hard case in the picture. I will not ship this rifle anywhere, I will only sell it face to face."

This is an old well-made Smith although I don't know the manufacture date.  Serial # is 6025xx.  I am selling it with the original wood grips not the Pachmyer rubber grips as in one picture.  There are some spots where surface rust was removed without cold-blueing for touch up on the frame and cylinder.  It has a 5"" barrel.  It has not been fired much as the drag line on the cylinder is faint and bore is very good.  In fact, it got its pitting from improper storage laying on one side for 30-40 years.  Bluing is worn off at the muzzle to some degree.  Without the pitted spots, bluing would be VG to Excellent, I'd say.  Additional pics available on request.  Only 3 for Armslist.  A good shooter, reliable and easy to operate.  No stovepiping, dropped mags or failure to feed.  Loads can be low power for practice without fear of reliability problems.  Shotshells can be alternated with lead rounds.  Wadcutters can be used."

Mechanically, this truck is perfect. No ""check engine"" lights or anything. I drive it everyday and it is 100% dependable and will take you anywhere you could possibly want to go. It was not abused or taken ""Off-Roading"". The 4x4 works great, i tried it just to see if it works, but it is never used. The reason I am selling is because it is just me and my wife and we both have big 4x4 SUVs since she got one for Christmas. So, I am ready for another sports car around the same price range as the Tahoe."

I believe this rifle was a factory rebuild as the barrel is stamped 12-43 and it has the later pistol grip stock. I don't think it was ever issued after the rebuild. It is in great shape, blueing is outstanding, the wood is very nice and has no significant imperfections, action operates smoothly and the trigger is very nice; everything about this rifle is correct and I can find nothing out of place or incorrect about it. I bought this rifle in 1987 when the Firearms Protection Act of 1986 allowed the importation of surplus military rifles into our country again. This rifle is from the first batch of imports from that era and these early imports were hand picked and were the best of the bunch.  When I got this rifle I removed the cosmoline and brown storage paper this rifle came packed in, wiped it down, and fired 20 rds of non corrosive ammo thru it for a functions check, everything worked as it should and it shot a very tight respectable group. I then cleaned the bore, applied a light coat of oil to everything, then put it into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat largely untouched since. This rifle is complete, fully intact, fully function, shoots to point of aim and has not been modified, restored, or altered in anyway from its original configuration. The bore has no pitting or rust that I can see with a bore light and the rifling is excellent; the lands and grooves and sharp and crisp.  You will not be disappointed with this rifle. I am retiring and have too many guns than I can take with me when I move so I am selling the last and best of my military rifle collection. I will meet buyer between Charlotte Hall and Upper Marlboro for a FTF cash and carry deal during daylight hours in a public setting. This sale has no tax, no shipping or transfer fees, no paper work, no govt registration, and it is available now, and this transaction is 100% legal in the state of Maryland. Buyer must be a MD resident who is not prohibited by law from owning firearms or active duty military living in MD. Not interested in trades of any sort, pls do not contact me if you are prohibited from owning firearms or for any kind of strawman sale. thanks for looking, pls email with any questions.

I also am trying to standardize my weapons to enhance my shooting.  I have too many different guns to shoot all of them well.  Although this weapon has a polymer frame it feels like a very solid gun when shooting.  Don't let anyone convince you that you need to spend $800 to $1200 for an imported gun to defend yourself.  Save some money for ammunition and skill development.  Ruger is a great American brand that offers excellent quality at a reasonable price.  They are well-made, no-nonsense, practical tools.   It comes with the box, paperwork, lock and two mags.  One is a 10 round and the other is a 17 round that comes with a grip extension.  There is also a flat mag floor-plate to replace the finger rest floor-plate and make the small mag more compact.  It has adjustable sights, a loaded chamber indicator, a trigger safety, and an ambidextrous  manual safety.

 It is a brand new, unfired, still tagged, 12 gauge semi-automatic shotgun. I have very little information from the seller and cannot find much on the web about it. From what I gather it is a Huglu brand, Turkish shotgun that was custom ordered from the manufacturer and later brought to the U.S. by a military officer stationed in Turkey. Huglu is known for making top notch over under and side by side hunting shotguns that are truly world class. They normally sell for a good deal of money and are next to impossible to find in the states. This one has a more tactical look with a muzzle brake and composite stock and fore grip instead of the usual wood stocks. It is labeled as a G-505 ""STAR"" model and is fully nickel plated, beautifully engraved and well finished from top to bottom. The bolt is polished to a mirror finish and the whole trigger action is smooth as silk with a great trigger break and the drilled muzzle brake just tops the whole package off. Truly top quality from top to bottom and honestly just a badass gun. This company does not export to the U.S.A. I cannot find this layout anywhere on the web period. It is unbelievably light and agile and is just gorgeous. A truly one of a kind shotgun. If you want something well built, super light and definitely one of a kind, no matter where you are; this is your gun. Pictures don't do it justice!!!

21 MAGAZINES ( 13 ALUMINUM, 8 STEEL, ALL IN GOOD WORKING ORDER)

NICE SLING

3 GERMAN CAMO MAG PUCHES, WITH ALICE CLIPS ATTATCHED (THEY HOLD 2 MAGS EACH)

Also 3 original HK Cleaning Kits ( not pictured) 

about 273 rounds of brown bear ammo ( most already loaded into magazines) 

This is a really fun rifle, this package is ready to go for a great day at the range or the apocalypse. 
I hate to sell it, but my collection has, according to my wife, gone out of control. So I must thin things down a bit. 
I am not interested in any trades at this time.

It is double action and single action, 5"" barrel, made between 1840 and 1926. The top rib has some very faint illegible writing. Everything functions but the cylinder advance is worn and is a little loose. The right side grip has a piece broken off. As far as I'm concerned this is a collector/wall hanger.... way too old to safely shoot. I am not sure of the manufacture date... I expect it to be late 1800's or early 1900's.

I am selling and advertising custom painted bass fishing lures for a friend of mine who owns and operates his own customized lure and fishing guide business. He custom paints, sells, and also refurbishes old lures if your baits are in need of a new paint job. He also coats the lure with a clear protective coating.
Having fished and won many bass tournaments for many years he knows what is needed in lures to get results. This guy won the Big Ten College Championship back in his college days so he knows his stuff. I have seen his lures in action and guarantee their quality.
Here are just a few of the many colors, patterns, and styles of lures he can provide you with. He operates out of Bloomington, IN.
