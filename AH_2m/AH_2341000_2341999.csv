Price is OBO. Could throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, but would rather keep for the next press. Thanks for looking. Possible trades include FOID."

This has never been fired other than from the factory test fire. It has the recall upgrade already done as well and will come with the certificate stating so. The XDS has upgraded sights which are the XS big dot tritium night sights. This is the fastest target acquisition sights on the market. I will also include the factory fiber optic sights that it came with which are also good sights, but not night sights. Installed on the grip of the pistol frame is the rubber grip from Talon Grips. It will come with 5 mags total. Two are the standard 5 round mags with the Pearce finger extensions and the other three are the extended 7 round mags. The finger extensions all have the same Talon rubber grips on them except for one of the 7 round mags. Included is the G-Code/Haley Strategic INCOG holster with mag caddy. This is a premium inside the waistband (IWB) holster. There is a 6-8 week waiting period for one of these holsters thats how popular they are. It is the best IWB holster on the market IMO. I have one for my glock 17 as well. It can be worn with the mag caddy or be removed if you want to run it with the holster by itself. The holster is right handed. Will come with 24 rounds of Winchester PDX1 (Personal defense ammo) and 200 rounds of 45acp FMJ target/range ammo. Comes with all the Springfield goodies too which include the paddle holster for the gun and mags, lock, extra fiber optic plastic for factory sight, and the nice padded hard case. I will include the padded mini case that Springfield sent the gun back in after having the recall upgrade done. I have the original floorplates for the mags with the finger extensions and will include it also. Comes with manual and factory firing case as well. I guarantee you will not find this complete package anywhere else. Everything here is top of the line stuff and was a pain in the ass to get together. Sure its a lot of money but you get what you pay for and you also cant put a price on your life! With that said you really are getting a lot of stuff and it is a COMPLETE package. If you are looking to get everything you need for self protection at one time, this is it. This is NOT overpriced for what's included! This is basically what I paid for everything minus all the hassles of waiting and getting everything upgraded. If the ad is up than its still available. Thank you for you interest!

Bright nickel plated cases aid in visibility in low light conditions, and loaded with low-flash propellants.

Since their inception, conventional hollow point pistol bullets have performed well, but have never delivered 100% reliability especially in self-defense situations. The patented Flex Tip technology used in Critical Defense ammunition eliminates the clogging and inconsistency that often plagues hollow point bullets. Hornady achieved this by using the same tip material as used in LEVERevolution ammunition.

All Critical Defense ammunition is loaded in nickel cases for increased visibility in low-light situations. Premium low flash propellants deliver proven performance, even in very shortbarreled handguns, and won't disrupt your vision. Reliable expansion and dependable terminal performance can be counted on for concealed carry/personal protection.

Specifications and Features:
Unaffected by thick and heavy clothing, including denim and leather
Patented FTX bullet delivers superior controlled expansion and large, deep wound cavities over a wide range of velocities
Clean burning and stable propellants reduce recoil in lightweight handguns, and perform consistently in all temperatures
Minimal muzzle flash protects night vision
Feeds reliably in all pistols
Shiny silver nickel plating prevents corrosion, and is easily visible in low light situations
Bullets are cannelured and crimped to avoid bullet setback

Sphinx Systems Limited is a Swiss-based manufacturer of high quality pistols used mainly by special forces, elite police units and sports shooters. Sphinx was founded in 1876, specializing in tooling and machining, and then diversified into the firearms industry during the 1980's. Sphinx is best known for its ongoing development of the original Czech designed CZ 75 pistol, which has been evolved into the Sphinx 2000, Sphinx 3000 custom competition pistol, and Sphinx SDP Compact.

Sphinx started its work with pistols based on the CZ 75 design when they redesigned the ITM AT-84 licensed copy of the Czech CZ 75 and ITM AT-88, a first evolution of the CZ 75 that had been developed in Switzerland by ITM who later went out of business.

Sphinx manufactures all pistols in Switzerland, slides are made from solid billet steel, frames from casts, forgings or also from billet, and fits each pistol with high quality barrels. Each pistol part is machined to extremely close tolerances and assembled by Sphinx master gunsmiths, which has given Sphinx the reputation for creating extremely accurate and reliable firearms.

All Sphinx pistols except the AT380 are shipped with an actual test target, which confirms the accuracy of each pistol.

Past Sphinx pistols were not mass produced and were hand fitted to tight tolerances, so Sphinx pistols were more expensive than mass-produced products. In 2010 Sphinx joined KRISS Group and began production of the SDP Compact in 2012. The SPD Compact is Sphinx's first mass produced firearm, which lowered the price by over 66%; partly due to Sphinx earning their ISO certification in 2013. Initial reviews have been very positive and the Sphinx SDP Compact has been featured in Combat Handguns, Recoil (which found it to be 25% more accurate than a full size CZ SP-01), and more.

Although Sphinx products were historically imported to the United States by SILE corporation, and until 2008 by SABRE Defense Industries. Sphinx products are presently being imported into the US by KRISS USA in Virginia Beach, VA."

NOTICE Some reason Armslist doesn't have 10mm in the drop down. I selected 40 caliber but this is a 10mm glock.

For sale is a Glock 20 10mm Gen3. It comes with two magazines and a loader. I keep the gun in a safe with a gun sock and I'm not sure where I put the original box for it so you might not get the proper box for it.

I bought this gun a little over a year ago and used it for my fishing trip. A few years ago I encountered a bear during one of my fishing trips and luckily nothing serious happened. I decided to get a hangun that is capable of stopping wild life and came across the 10mm and picked up the Glock 20. I used it last year on my fishing trip up north and loved it and felt safe even though I never had to use it. I load it with heavy Buffalo Bore 10mm rounds that is 220 gr and it has been great. I absolutely love the feel of the 10mm.

So why am I selling it? Well as you know the 10mm is very pricey to shoot. I was going to the range and decided to try to get 100 rounds and couldn't really find any rounds and spent nearly 60-70 dollars just to shoot the gun and I have to constantly order it online and hope its in stock. Personally love the feel of the gun. It is awesome and great but then I got to consider prices of the ammunition and I don't think it's worth it to reload.

For now, I'm going with the .357 magnum for taking up fishing trip. Seems to be a lot cheaper for about the same power.

I'm fairly firm on the 400 dollars price tag. Looking at various other sites, they appear to be listing for about the same price and this is in very good condition.

I will only meet someone IN state of Virginia. I require a valid driver license with a voters card or ccw permit. I will not make any adjustment to this requirement and if you do not have it I will not deal with you."

 One 17 round extended mag and one 10 round mag
 All other factory goodies included
 Pick up in Tulsa, OK.

 The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

 The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish.

This shotgun has served me well. App 2k rounds down the barrels and they still shine like mirrors. Fit/finish is not great, but its an entry level O/U and thats what you get at this price point. It's accurate as you are. Lockup is tight and the trigger is clean and easy. This shotgun has brought home the ""25 in a row"" patch for shooting a perfect game twice from the Kenmore trap range.

Not terribly pretty. The finish on the ""stainless"" portions has gotten minor surface pitting and it was knocked over once at the range making a little scar at the front of the forearm and a small crack in the wood that I repaired. Neither of these things affect function, but that's why I'm only asking $425.

These MRE's are the military issued brands and are hard to come by. As of now, I have 18 unopened MRE's and I always am getting more and more. These MRE's are the most up to date and have not been sitting around for years, unlike many other posts on here. They have been in a climate controlled environment and have recently been tested. The average shelf life for a MRE is 25 years, so this is a perfect thing to have for any kind of unknown situation. These MRE's are great for anything, whether its for camping, survival, disaster preparedness, or any other outdoor activities you can use these for. I have the ability to ship to anywhere in the US, just let me know how many  you want. Im selling them for $8 each, which is a $2 discount for you. Or I can sell all of them for only $130.

It's a ""Squeeze Cocker"" for those of you who know what you're looking at. I'm selling this for a buddy of mine. He purchased it new back in 92-93 time frame. According to my research and the HKPro forum these are rare, especially in the factory nickel finish. It's not perfect by any means, it has some minor finish issues. I can email or text pictures of it to you. Hasn't had many rounds through it as he's not an avid shooter. If you're interested I'll send some pics. Then send me an offer and I'll run it by my buddy for approval. I can provide additional photos if needed..."

The mask is in good shape, with some wear marks from being worn and the lenses have some scuffs in them (I would eventually replace them, luckily they are cheap and easy to replace with your choice of tinted or clear lenses, lots of vendors for them online). The filter is a couple years old so it should be good for at least another 8-10 years (they recommend changing the filters out every 10 years). This is a top quality gas mask and not super easy to find, especially one that is not a small or medium size, and there are tons of parts and accessories available for them as this is current issue stuff, not some 1960s russian gas mask that the seals or filters are questionable and the visibility is poor when wearing it. The price is $60 for the mask and bag, this is a great deal as this mask easily brings 100-150 bucks online and while I might sell it online if I dont get replies, I want to sell it locally.

This rifle is nicer than anything you will find at Cabela's or Gander Mountain. All parts are original and were manufactured in 1933 at the Izhevsk arsenal in Russia.  All cosmoline has been thoroughly removed from all parts of the rifle, and the bolt has been polished to a beautiful shine.  The hex receiver has a beautiful, smooth blue finish. Unlike the wartime rifles, this piece was milled with care and with much more attention to detail. All numbered parts match, and all non-numbered parts bear the Izzy markings. The wood has been treated with oil (typical of the earlier pre-war rifles) and not that yucky dark lacquer that you find on the vast majority of M91/30s.  I will also throw in a lovely, sharp bayonet along with 40 rounds of Barnaul 7.62x54R. Price is $250 and is FIRM, cash only, no trades.
