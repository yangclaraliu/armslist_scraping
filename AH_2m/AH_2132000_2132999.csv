Everything works as good as it left the factory.  It has absolutely no rust and the blueing looks perfect.  Stock is in great shape as well.  I've had this gun for a few years and only shot it about 10 times to get the scope dead on.  I actually love to shoot it, but I inherited a 30-06 about two months after I bought this Winchester and fell even more in love with it.  So I don't need this one any longer. Its a bolt action that is really smooth to operate.  Comes with Tasco 3x9x40 scope.  I've already taken it to the pawn shop and those scum suckers offered to give me $350 for it.  They actually offered me a lot less but after chatting we got up to $350 since deer season is right around the corner and they would be able to sell it for $500.  I don't want to make those jokers any money so I'll sell it here for $400.  That's how much I have in the gun..this also saves you a bunch!  It will come with a soft case and leather sling.  I would rather not trade, but I might be interested in a concealed carry pistol or 12 gauge shotgun.  Depending on what you got.  Any question feel free to ask."

Beautiful gun and though I am looking for a heavier gun for the wife I went overboard on this bad boy. I love it but do not have the room for it as I need to find her that gun that fits just right without much recoil. This gun is in amazing condition and compared to all my poly guns of course it feels like a pee shooter. Unfortunately however much I like it the wife considers it a very pretty brick that she does not like having to hold up for a long period of time..per the low round count. Oh well at least I got to fire one of these finally and loved its accuracy and tiny recoil. Built like a tank. I will consider a nice handgun caliber carbine as I am trying hard to find something that fits her just right. Otherwise my shield is up for trade NIB and this I prefer to sell as these are not cheap tools unless you send me a trade offer I cannot refuse. I would consider a Beretta 92 compact, a cz 75 compact, beretta 84, depending on what you have. High end reliable metal frame with a good grip, decent capacity, and heavy enough to let her shoot with ease, light enough she does not feel like she is holding a brick....Man I wish I had the room in the safe/extra cash to keep this one as I love it. For some reason I cannot upload the other pic but the other side is just as clean and new looking as the side in the pic..I will figure out how to get the pic up. 525 obo

But I'm going to sell or trade my 220 Elite Scorpion. It is my dream gun, but it's a little out of my league at this point in my life financially. I just acquired it last Friday, brand new and I only fired 72 rounds out of a box of 100. I hit more targets dead center with this gun than I did with a full size Kimber. It fits in the hand perfectly and the trigger is perfect. I have the case, 2 mags, the gun,  and I may or may not include a brand new Blackhawk! Serpa holster. The gun is equipped with night sights. 

The issue is that I just moved here and I don't really have the money to have a $1,200 gun sit in my safe. I can't afford to purchase a second gun right now to train with at Front Sight. I'm in the process of getting my NRA Instructors certification and I need a gun that I can beat up, bang around, and open carry and not worry about how pretty it is.  If you take care of it, I will buy it back for what you paid in a few months. However, you won't want to let it go."

I do not have a round count, but I guess it to be a couple of thousand rounds.

Included is the case, manual, target from factory, spring (for different velocity loads), tool, and two replacement front sights (25yd is on gun, others are for different distances).  All of this comes with the weapon, from the factory.

This weapon was engineered for the CCI Stinger .22LR ammunition.  I have had success with the Blazer (silver box) 40gr ammunition.  If you want to use other ammunition, you may have to switch out the springs, for that velocity.  These are finicky with what ammunition they like to shoot.  As was stated, they were developed using the Stingers and they shoot great with those rounds.  However, those rounds are more expensive than other .22 offerings.  It's still a lot cheaper than 9mm, .40, etc., which is what I bought this pistol for.

I am selling it because I recently had a baby and need money more than I need the pistol, unfortunately.  It has also become a safe queen, since I started reloading.

I vastly prefer a face-to-face sale.  I am willing to drive some, for the right deal, but I do live in Emporia and don't intend to be in Topeka, KC, or Wichita, anytime soon.  If you'd like to test the weapon, you will need to bring your own ammunition, or work out a deal with me (I may be able to provide some, depending on current stock.  I know ammo is still hard to come by.).

Here's a beautiful copy of the Colt Single Action Army revolver that was carried by one of America's most famous military figures, General George S. Patton. This revolver was commissioned by the American Historical Foundation and is based on a Uberti Single Action revolver that has been elaborately hand engraved and silver plated, just like the original. Chambered for the .45 Colt cartridge and wearing a 4-3/4"" barrel, this is a fully functional firearm, not just a work of art. The imitation ivory grips have special medallions indicating the years of Patton's birth and passing. The right panel is scrimshawed with the General's initials, just like the original. Condition is perfect with the exception of some slight tarnish to the silver in the protected spots which would easily polish bright if desired. There is no rust, pitting, or handling wear. The revolver was zip-tied at the factory and remains so...never cocked. It comes in a very high quality glass sided display case that allows the gun to be displayed on a shelf or table top and viewed from either side."

Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 tactical is available in 9mm.

BlackHawk 1.5-5x32mm .223 Ballistic-X Rifle Scope Product Info

Blackhawk .223 Ballistic-X 1.5-5x32mm Rifle Scope is a brand new riflescope from Blackhawk that combines high quality optics with a cutting edge reticle specifically designedimage with .223 Remington cartridges in mind. This high-powered rifle scope has a variable zoom ranging from 1.5x up to 5x magnification, using a relatively small 32mm objective lens. This lends the BlackHawk! riflescope a lower profile than scopes with larger objective lenses, giving you more accuracy with less sighting necessary. Fully multi-coated optics provide excellent light transmission and clarity, even to the very edges of your field of view. A unique feature of the Black Hawk Ballistic-X Riflescope is its accurate .223 Ballistic-X target reticle. This reticle is optimized for use with 55 grain .223 Remington cartridges and has the measurements and indicators you need for precise long-range shooting. Black Hawk has made minute adjustments easy with finger-adjustable windage and elevation turrets, both of which have a 1/4 MOA adjustment rate. As durable as it is powerful, Blackhawk has built this rifle scope out of tough materials; the 1"" thick tube features single-piece construction for added longevity. For a durable rifle scope with a decent range and an accurate, specialized target reticle, mount the Blackhawk 1.5-5x32mm Ballistic-X Scope on your rifle of choice.

First, its ok to ask whatever you want when selling anything.  If your asking too much, like the front page clogger, then your stuff just won't sell. 

The problem here is this guy can't sell his junk  because of the high prices, so he posts it several times a day, bumping other ads off the front page.  He is abusing a free site.  Maybe this guy is the New American.  The kind that thinks its ok to take advantage and abuse a free service.  The kind that lays down and takes it, as opposed for standing up for what is right.

Pics. are here http://imgur.com/a/5gzGP 

It retains all early features: volley-sights, cut-off, windage adjustable rearsight, round cocking piece, and lightening cuts on rearsight protector. The receiver, barrel, forestock, and front sight leaf match. 

The bolt is pre-1915 RSAF Enfield bolt, with a matching numbered cocking piece. The magazine is the only other replacement part I found when I took the entire rifle apart. 

The stock disk indicates that this rifle was issued to the 6th Battalion of the Border Regiment in Feb. of 1915. The Border Regiment was training in France at that time, then left for Gallipoli in late July. This rifle sports a crudely made leather sling, and shows signs of having been on fire near the nosecap. I bought this rifle from a collector a couple years ago, and he bought it from Century about 12 years ago, along with a variety of Turkish Mausers. 

Based off of its condition, the stock disk indicating issue to the Border Regiment in early 1915, the fact that it retains all early features, that the crude sling was sewn on the the rifle, and that it was part of a large group of arms and ammo imported from Turkey, lead me to believe that this rifle was captured by the Turks sometime during the Gallipoli campaign. However, I have no absolute proof of this.

I will travel up to an hour from Raleigh if you purchase Lots 1 and/or 2 complete. Otherwise, delivery of smaller amounts, and Lot 3, are limited to within Wake and Durham Counties. 

Lot 1: 1430 rounds of Georgia Arms remanufactured .308/150g/FMJ. 
Pictured below in five ammo cans. 65 cents per round when bought per can. 60 cents per round if you take the entire lot of five cans for $858. 
Four cans have 300 rounds each at 65 cents per round = $195 total per can. 
One can has 230 rounds at 65 cents per round = $149. 
All five cans together = $858.

Lot 2: 1100 rounds of Winchester 7.62x51/147g/FMJ. This has worked fine in my M1A. Pictured below in boxes and ammo cans. All this ammo originally came in boxes from Winchester, but I transferred a bunch to the ammo cans. 
Each can contains 300 rounds at $1 per round = $300 per can. 
Two cardboard cases containing 200 rounds at $1 per round = $200 per case.
Five 20-round boxes = 100 rounds at $1 per round. I will sell the five boxes together only when you purchase at least one additional can or case.  
The complete lot (two cans, two cases, and five boxes) for 90 cents per round = $990.

Lot 3: 400 rounds BERDAN PRIMED 7.62x51/146g/FMJ. Military surplus. I believe these are from Australia, but I’m not sure. Brass cases. In two ammo cans (not pictured). They were advertised as non-corrosive. I believe I got these from MidWayUSA, so I trust they are non-corrosive as advertised. I’ll let these go for 40 cents apiece since they are virtually impossible to reload without the right tools and primers. $160.

A slight mark in the butt stock on the right side (see photos) but other than that nothing to report. The breech face and bores show it has not been fired, and the gun is nice and tight. The 20 gauge Rossis are especially nice because the frame of the gun is actually sized for a 20 gauge instead of just having 20 gauge barrels mounted on a 12 gauge frame. This is a really nice gun.

 These Rossi shotguns are great because they are solid and reliable, and there are no extra safeties like the unnecessary tang safety that you find on currently manufactured hammered shotguns.
