This is an awesome weapon and about the same size as a sig p229 and not much larger than a glock 19. Beretta calls this the inox 92fs compact type L with rail but in reality it's the m9a1 compact(frame is marked m9a1) because it has a shortened grip m9a1 frame which features checkering for added grip, beveled mag well for ease of mag changes and picattiny  rail for lights or lasers. Unlike current 92fs guns this one has a steel guide rod too instead of polymer. Gun has 3 upgrades on it as well. It has the elite ii skeletonized hammer ($40) , elite extended mag release( which you can't buy anymore ,was $35) , d spring ($15)for better double action pull.   So that's $90 in extras on a practically new weapon (50 rds fired). Gun costs around $650-675(online after paying ffl) In a store they would be over $700 if you can even find one, Ive never seen one around here . $650 firm.This gun came out not too long ago. Comes with box , manual and 2-13 rd magazines. Here is what one sold for on gunbroker recently.

Condition is excellent, its in basically brand new shape, and functioned flawlessly when I shot it. It has the Magpul ACS stock, and a Blackhawk Ergo grip (upgrades from the ugly Sig furniture they are putting on new these days). Comes with everything else it came with from the factory, a NIW 10 round PMAG, the iron sights, grip panels, sling, lock, and all in its original box. Its really an excellent, smooth shooting rifle, but I prefer to save my .308 ammo for my bolt rifles.

Info from the Sig website:
Familiar Handling, Unfamiliar Power, SIG SAUER® has taken the proven features of the SIG516™ and applied them into a potent AR-based rifle chambered in 7.62 x 51mm. Utilizing the short stroke pushrod operating system, an M1913 Mil-Std rail, free-floating barrel, aluminum forend, telescoping stock, and Magpul® PMAG®, the SIG716 is the rifle of choice when you require the power of a larger caliber carbine."

WILL TRADE FOR:

I am interested in guns chambered in .22 lr, 9mm, 45 acp, 7.62x39, .223 and 308 win. Willing to look at anything labeled colt or HK.

As for 22's I prefer either a rifle (if its semi auto, the ruger mini 14 with removable barrel is rockin, you can send other offers but no promises), or a 22 lr revolver, preferably with a long barrel(longer than 4 inches).

As far as 9mm go I am either interested in a glock 17, 19 or a beretta 92fs.

In 45 I am interested in the following brands only and in this order: HK, and glock.

As for 7.62x39, I am interested in ak's for which I will add ammo (up to 1500 rounds of high quality ammo for the right gun if the value diff is that high). as far as sks's go I would only do this for a straight trade. Bolt action 7.62x 39 would be evaluated on a case by case basis.

For .223 I prefer firearms that also are chambered to fire 5.56, beyond that I am not too picky as long as it is in great shape.

As for .308 win, Im open to most things, bolt gun, semi auto, send an offer.

I would be willing to look at 30-06's if they come with ammo (i can trade some ammo with mine to if needed).

I will also consider dillon reloading presses (progressive only) in great condition.

Please remember that while I am willing to bring up to 1500 rounds of high quality brass cased ammo in .45acp to the table, will not be bringing cash So if that is gonna be n issue, please dont waste anyones time asking for cash, just pass. 

Look forward to trading with you.

Brands I am not interested in: Smith and wesson (unless its a .500), kimber, khar, taurus (unless its a revolver), uberti, hi point, and pheonix arms. If it isnt on this list and i didnt mention it above, I may be willing to consider it."

Here's more info on it:

Features a 2.53GHz Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB of 1GHz (1066MHz) DDR3 RAM, and a 250GB 5400-rpm hard drive. Both models ship with the same nVidia GeForce 9400M graphic chip (which was used in the aluminum unibody MacBook) that shares 256MB of main memory.
When Apple released the aluminum unibody MacBook in October 2008, the differences between the MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop lines narrowed to a point where folks began to wonder when Apple would decide to merge the two lines into one. With the introduction of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro model (in two versions)--and the reconfiguration of the MacBook line so that it now features a single white 2.13GHz MacBook--a clear distinction between the two lines is back."

I honestly cannot find a single mark on this knife. The spots you see in the pictures are dust. To me, it appears to be unused.

The Model 99 uses a rotary magazine to hold the cartridges.  The rotating magazine uses a spring-loaded spool with grooves to hold the cartridges. The Savage 1899 took advantage of the spool to include a counter to indicate how many shots are left. The Model 99 continued using this system for many years, until its replacement with a detachable magazine. 

The magazine design allowed the rifle to be one of the first lever-action rifles to use spitzer bullets. Previous lever-action rifles used tubular magazines, which placed cartridges of ammunition end to end. With spitzer bullets, the pointed tips of the ammunition would contact the primer of the cartridge in front of it, possibly causing an accidental discharge. Another novel safety feature: upon cocking the rifle, a small pin would protrude above the top receiver to indicate the rifle was cocked and ready to fire. 
The .300 Savage cartridge is a rimless, .30 caliber rifle cartridge developed by the Savage Arms Company in 1920. It was designed to replace the less powerful .303 Savage in the popular Savage Model 99 lever-action rifle. Despite having a short case and a rather stumpy neck, the cartridge is capable of propelling a 150-grain bullet at over 2,600 ft/s with an effective killing range of over 300 yd.

Also comes with the scope and sling you see in the pictures."

This has only had 160 rounds go through it, so although it is very lightly used it has also been broken in since it requires around 100 rounds to fully break in.

Ever since it broke in, it has not yet stove piped or otherwise jammed, this was inserted into an S&W MP 15 and worked excellently.

This has been fully cleaned and lubricated so it's ready for use in your AR15.

It comes with the retail packaging, conversion bolt, and a single 25 round magazine.

This comes with a lifetime warranty, this company will replace it if it were to malfunction.  I have heard nothing but good things about this product and this company.


I will accept Cash only, and will meet in a public place.


This sells for $225 after taxes, so you're getting $45 bucks off on a mint condition unit."

There is some evidence to support this, however, I consider the identification to be speculative at this point.
The crest on the opposite grip represents the UAE Armed Forces. The falcon (not eagle) is a common Middle East symbol of strength and the seven stars represent the Seven states making up the UAE. The Arabic at the bottom of the crest is Mashat Furat (Armed Forces).

Although these resemble the Ontario M7-B bayonet, they are not made by Ontario. They are likely a product of China."
