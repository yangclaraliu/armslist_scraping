For those of you who don't know or are to young to know the S&W 3rd generation 5906 was one of the toughest and most durable 9MM's ever made to this day.  You cannot wear them out and were used by hundreds of police agencies for several years.  Even when you find old police trade ins today the may look bad but still function flawlessly.  Anyway, this one was not a police trade-in.  This one was gotten, disassembled, inspected for wear which there was virtually none, 30 hours of hand polishing to a bright high luster finish, properly lubed which most people do not do, and reassembled.  It is a gorgeous pistol and certainly stands out from others.  It comes with a non-factory hard case and two factory 15rd mags.  It is really something to look at and very reliable.  If interested just hit me up.  Thanks."

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL âB-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desirable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6â drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

The gun has been used 3-4 times, at a range. I hate wanting to sell at a loss but thats the way the market goes. It is a great rifle for target shooting. I would prefer to keep my case, but that is open for negotiation. If I trade for a firearm with case I would do that no problem.

Cash or,
One to two handguns.
Either a nice higher quality handgun or something like a 9 or 45, and a smaller gun maybe .380 auto maybe still a 9 or 45 but compact.
I am mainly looking for an good concealed carry handgun.
If you have something nicer maybe I can add some money, or vice versa as needed.

Bolt operates like new.  Trigger pull is amazing!  The Swedes really made the best mausers!  Am told the sling is correct.  Hereâs more:  I reply to questions, CHECK YOUR JUNK FOLDER!  The Model 1896 rifle in 6.5x55mm (6,5 mm GevÃ¤r m/96) was adopted in 1896 for infantry use, replacing the Model 1867-89 Remington rolling block rifle in 8x58mmR Danish Krag. Swedish production (under license) started in 1898 at Carl Gustafs, but additional rifles were produced by Mauser during 1899 and 1900 because of delays in shipping additional production machinery from Germany to Sweden.
Standard production at Carl Gustafs continued until 1925, but approximately 18,000 m/96 rifles were manufactured by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB during World War II for civilian marksmanship training.
Mauser produced 40,000 m/1896 long rifles between 1895 and 1900, Carl Gustafs Stads GevÃ¤rsfaktori 475,000 m/1896 between 1896 and 1932 and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks AB 20,000 m/1896 between 1942 and 1944. Giving a total of 535,000 m/96 long rifles.
All Swedish Mausers, whether built in Germany or Sweden, were fabricated using a Swedish-supplied high grade tool steel alloyed with nickel, copper, and vanadium, a product noted for its strength and corrosion resistance.  You can find cheaper ones, but they DO NOT LOOK LIKE THIS ONE!  An avid collector I know believes it's worth every bit of $600 if not more because of its condition.....VERY accurate rifles....CALL FOR DETAILS/SPECIFIC PICS REDACTED"

Would make a great all-round gun for carry or home! $275.00, and that's a deal. They used to be the ""sleeper"" bargains on the market, but now, they're running 475-530, since people have caught on to Bersa's and their excellent reputation. So why am I letting it go for that? I'm thinning out the collection, and already have another one of these that will long outlast me. And, these are hard times for a lot of people up North here, and while I've been blessed & fortunate, many others haven't been. Someone out there needs a quality defensive arm that is affordable and within reach, and I want to pay-it-forward, so to speak.

New in box, I mounted it on my Tavor. Took some pictures and headed to the range. This was my first Eotech, and have read all kinds of good things about them so I was excited about this new optic for my Tavor. After sighting it in I was thoroughly pleased with my purchase and it was a done deal.

Now, last weekend I go out with a buddy who just recently purchased a 1x4 Scope with CQB illuminated reticle. He let me shoot it and now I am in love with the true 1x CQB style of site, and then being able to adjust to 4x made it a pleasure to shoot. My eyes are getting old and wore out, not to mention a bit of astigmatism so my poor baby wont be wearing an Eotech anymore, but a 1x4 scope soon.

Anyways, as you can see in the pics, not a scratch on it. Except a slight scuff on the bottom from mounting on the rail. Date of manufacture from Eotech was November, 2013 so you can be assured it is fairly new. Still in factory pelican box with all paperwork, and warranty card ready to be filled out by new owner.

I am asking $410. Price may be negotiable, depending on offers. I have over 170 flawless feedback on Ebay (for what that is worth). PM me for my user name if interested.

EOTech 517.A65 Holographic Weapon Sights. On this sight, the buttons have been moved from the back to the left side for instant access, allowing a magnifier or a back up iron sight to fit closely to the HWS body. This new button position allows the user to operate the HWS function switches easier than ever before. Additionally, a portion of the front base has been raised to allow the sight to fit over standard hand guards found on many M-4 or M-16 style weapons. In June of 2013, AR15.com listed this sight as their favorite EOTech for the money.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL âB-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6â drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

The UTS-15 has a 28.3â overall length with a 18.5â barrel, chambered for 2 Â½â , 2 Â¾â and 3â magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weight only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included).



  The following features are standard on all UTS-15 models:

=============================================

-Bullpup design: pistol grip and trigger are located forward of the barrel breech and action assembly. This allows for the same barrel length as a traditional shotgun but shortens the overall length of the weapon.

-Top mounted picatinny rail: allows for the mounting of a wide variety of iron and optical sights.

-Twin magazine tubes: set above the barrel to allow for easy access to the loading ports.

-Alternating or select tube feed: a selector switch located on the top of the tube/barrel assembly allows for use of multiple ammo types (ie: buckshot and birdshot; buckshot and rubber pellets; etc).

-Built-in laser/light controls: the right side of the grip is reserved for controls (a button) for controlling the optional light and laser assembly.

-Threaded barrel: Beretta-style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to be adapted for any situation and a range of attachments. 





Accessories:

============================================

-Phantom tactical RED GREEN two color reflex sight

-Heavy duty front and rear flip-up sights

-NCstar Red and Green 5mw laser (cr123a battery) with pressure switch
