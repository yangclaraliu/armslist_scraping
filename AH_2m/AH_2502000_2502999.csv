About 30 rounds through the pistol.  Comes with everything in original case, 70 rounds of 300 grain Hornady FTX ammo and Redding reloading die.  Great and extremely accurate pistol and recoil really isn't that bad if you are shooting under 350 grain bullets thanks to the compensator.  Getting rid of it because of a career choice where I'll be moving and I won't be able to hunt elk anymore.

The pistol will also come with 20 extremely rare 700 grain ""Tyrannosaur thumpers"".  These are enormous bullets that really aren't that unmanageable thanks to the barrel length and compensator.  I've seen testimonials of these bullets one shot dropping moose and elk, again, these are, I believe, by far the biggest things you can shoot out of a pistol.  

All the ammo included is worth about $250 on its own.

It was made between 1884 and 1888. It is in very nice shape for being 120+ years old, no rust or corrosion. it has 30.75 inch damascus steel barrels.  All components are original matching numbers.  These guns are rare and very collectable.  Baker was one of the high end gun makers back in the day when LC Smith bought them out in 1888.  LC Smith was then bought out by Marlin in the 1940s. This gun comes with a note from Ahlman's gunsmith varifying that it is still in fine working order and safe to shoot with light blackpowder loads (comes with the note from ahlmans themselves for proof). This is not necessarily a wall hanger since it is able to shoot. This was conservatively valued at $600.

The Star Model PD is a compact and lightweight semi-automatic pistol which was manufactured from 1975 to 1990 by the firearms manufacturing company Star Bonifacio Echeverria, S.A., located in the city of Eibar in the Basque region of Spain.[1]
The Model PD can be loaded with six .45 ACP pistol cartridges in the detachable internal magazine, plus one in the chamber, and was very popular with police and civilian users in the self-defense and backup gun role, especially in the United States.
The Star PD improved on its predecessor (Star Model PKM) by using a low-profile adjustable rear sight and by removing material from the slide and other small changes. These modifications, combined with its aluminum alloy construction, resulted in a slim, compact, lightweight and relatively powerful pistol, revolutionary for the time. As it also bore an external resemblance to the well-known M1911 pistol, the gun sold very well in the U.S. until it was replaced in 1990 by the Firestar M45."

Some people complained about misfires earlier on, but this is a recent model which is perhaps why it doesn't have any problems.

Russian Capture marked by small x on receiver, original markings intact however. Nice thing about this rifle is although mismatched, all parts marked are made by Mauser of Oberndorf, 1942 (two different waffenamts or maker codes). A small bonus is I've acquired original and authentic German capture screws, sight hood and threaded cleaning rod which are included, as well as a quality reproduction leather sling. Price reflects this as these can be expensive and difficult to find.
Majority of parts blued and in very good condition, bore in good condition despite some slight pitting towards the receiver. Bolt cycles easily, functions as it should. Regularly cleaned and maintained, kept in air controlled storage.

*Priced accordingly placing into account the additions you won't find in the standard RC (100.00+ separately)

This is a semi-auto pistol chambered in 22 KURZ (short), this is the rapid fire model. These pistols were made for and used in the 1936 Olympic Games, where the Germans dominated the small bore pistol events. The Olympia Pistole has a 7.4 inch barrel, alloy slide, the frame is drilled and tapped for under frame weights, wood grips. All the serial numbers match on the frame, slide, and magazine. There is also a leather holster that comes with the gun. The holster has a German name on, but it is very tough to read. The story that I have been told is that this pistol was carried by a German Officer, and at some point was taken from him. I am unable to confirm if this pistol was used in the 1936 Games or not. All the records from Walther were destroyed during the war. I can tell you that the winner of the 1936 Olympic games 25 meter rapid fire event used a Walther Olympia Pistole, rapid fire model. This model of pistol was made from 1936-1940.

I AM IN GEORGIA. I have multiple feedback on ar15.com, ebay and gunbroker. I have never had a negative transaction. 

The lower will come to you in one of two ways. I will leave its original finish on it(it needs a refinish IMO) or i will refinish it in KG gunkote ""socom black"". Right now its in its original condition. Pictures available upon request. The price is 850 shipped to your FFL dealer. I will only take USPS money orders. I can provide a receipt from when i purchased the rifle(recently, not in the 80's) showing that the rifle was purchased as a complete rifle and not as a lower. You can also call olympic and they can probably give you basic info, but their records were destroyed in a fire in june of 2000 i believe. 

contact me with ANY questions you have. I will happily provide screen names for all 3 references mentioned above if asked. I can also reply to a message on any 3 sites should you be a member as well."
