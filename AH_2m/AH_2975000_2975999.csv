For Class 1 Tractors under 45 HP

These are Midwest Industries Freedom Hitches. The system is similar to the DeltaHook Rapid Hitch and/or Triangle Quick Hitch. They are comprised of male and female ""V""-shaped structures. The male inverted ""V"" is pinned to the tractor's three-point lift arms. A female inverted ""V"" channel iron receiver is permanently welded or pinned on the implement being hitched. To hitch, the tractor's male inverted ""V"" aligns with the implement's female receiver when the tractor lift arms are raised, and the latch pins automatically lock in place.

The best demonstration of what these do can be found at http://www.deltahook.com/. Check their pricing too for reference.

This listing is for ONE upper and ONE magazine. Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, however, may take any number of extra packages at the same price and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a complete upper that enables owners of AR-15 type rifles to convert their gun into something as good as an FN P-90 rifle, for about 1/3 of the usual cost. This is PW Arms’s AR57 Upper. The receiver and its component rails begin with a single block of Aircraft Grade 7075 T6 aluminum, rated at 83000 PSI strength. The entire upper is precision milled to within .002 tolerance. This upper is well ported for heat dissipation, and comes with an integral picatinny quad-rail system. The assembly process’s final steps include Infused Hard Coat Anodized finish on the alloy, and parkerization on steel surfaces, installation of front and rear sight area picatinny rails. GBQ Parkerizing process ensures finish durability on the steel. Barrel is 16.04 inch 4 channel fluted, free floating with open ended flash suppressor. Rate of twist is 1: 8.5 inches. Bolt is heat treated 4140 chrome alloy parkerized, like the barrel. Receiver and rail block measures just over 17 inches overall length; from the receiver back to the muzzle end, total length is 24 9/16 inches. This upper receiver comes furnished with a 3 5/8 inch Carbine buffer; owners of A2 rifles will need an AR type buffer. The most important feature of this upper, writes the factory, is its reliability. Unlike many other receivers, they continue, there is no gas system to become clogged with carbon or fouling. The chamber stays clean well beyond extended shooting sessions. Simplicity is key, they summarize, with the free sliding bolt being the only moving element. Its easy removal makes maintenance literally a snap. The AR-57 system ejects spent rounds through the lower’s magazine well, another plus. Factory cautions against using non-factory or non-FN magazines; against using reloaded or non-SAAMI approved ammunition. While we have never heard of any of these requiring the receiver to be fitted, that is always a possibility that a buyer needs to be prepared for. While these assemblies do not come furnished with any magazine from the factory, we are including the buyer’s choice of an FN Factory 10 rounder or 50 rounder. We might even have a 30 rounder on hand. Replacement pricing on uppers of this quality and caliber ranges upwards of $1000 per unit in many areas. We’re offering the complete PWA AR-57 Upper with bolt, buffer, and FN Factory Magazine, the ones in the photos or their identical mates for only $ 689.00. FFL not Required, but, Not for sale to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, District of Colombia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction where AR15 or AR57 Rifles are restricted to Law Enforcement. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the Upper is legal but 50 round magazines are restricted, we will sub a 30 or 10 shot magazine: includes Colorado and Ohio.

The mag is an 8 round mag. I have 1 for sure, but thought I had another. I will try to find in the meantime. You can pick up extras, or even 15 rounders from sportsmansguide online. 
This one isnt perfect. first off, the buttstock cap has a hole in it. So its not 100% waterproof anymore. although you could epoxy it and possible fit it.
Second, it has our typical feed ramp problem. I thought I could fix it by adjusting the angle of the magazine with jb weld. it has worked, but not 100%. 

I dont shoot this gun anymore, and its not my favorite to clean. So thats mainly why im selling. it is surprisingly accurate.
There is no rail on top, but many people have modified it for rings. Ive done that and have had a scope mounted on there (never shot with it though with scope). So I can possibly include rings for the deal.

The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens This unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability at the user level.

The Barrett MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new trigger module that is easily accessed for maintenance adjustment and replacement. This match grade trigger is drop fire proof and combat ready. The thumb operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.

Integrated into the Barrett MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a Picatinny M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. At 21.75 inches the rail offers plenty of space for in line night vision devices. Configurable side and bottom rails allow for mounting a number of other accessories.

The Barrett MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed stock rifle creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action the rifle is the same width overall folded or extended. Made of a temperature resistant polymer the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle to user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its multi-positional quick-detach sling sockets to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment-every detail of the Barrett MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

Despite its small size, the P224® maintains a double-stack magazine for a capacity of 12+1 rounds of 9mm
and 10 rounds of .40S&W or .357SIG giving the P224 a decided advantage over most subcompact
competitors. Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count.
Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. Initial models
will be available with the Double-Action Kellerman™ (DAK) trigger and be chambered in .40S&W. and
.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.
Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in
most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."

It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Army, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO-M150CP features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.

The main module of the P250 is an internal stainless steel frame fire control unit which consist of the integrated fire control group (trigger, hammer and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one on each side of the pistol), ejector and four slide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P250 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.The trigger is a self-decocking DAO trigger system with spurless and recessed hammer,

Restrictions apply on higher capacity magazines in some parts of the United States, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for THREE magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional magazines at the same per-mag price and no extra shipping. Here are never issued factory Beretta Magazines with all steel body construction, blue finish, high impact black polymer follower and floorplate, 15 round capacity for any Beretta 92, 92SB, 92S, 92F, M-9 pistols. These are all PB stamped Italian Made Beretta Factory magazines. This particular batch of magazines came to us from a Law Enforcement trade, and they were never issued. They are just like they shipped in 2005 – 2006 from Beretta in bulk. Their only surface detractions are occasional contact evidence, no ejection or insertion whitening at all. Buyers will receive magazines from the same batch as the photo specimens. Factory magazines like these free-fall eject like they’re supposed to, and most important, never fail during a firefight. Replacement pricing on these in our area is upwards of $50 apiece, when a person can even find them. Wholesale is upwards of $50 apiece on these. Our Single Mag price is $33.00. We’re offering these fine, genuine Italian Factory Beretta Magazines, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $26 per; buy 3 for only $78.00.

This shotgun is in really nice shape. The action works flawlessly and is smooth, no rust with a beautiful professional re-finish on the metal and on the stock.  No dirt, (but maybe a little lint from sitting), anywhere that I can find. The stock is checkered and beautifull. You won't be disappointed in this one and I think you would be hard pressed to find another one in this shape. This shotgun is really nice. The guy that owned these before really knew how to take care of firearms and his passion was shotguns. He passed away in May and left these with his wife and I ended up with them to sell for her. The gun is blued and the stock is rich with a really nice finish. Has a 28"" blued barrel with no rust and is a Slide Action Shotgun. It has on the left side of the receiver it has J. Stevens Arms and Tool Co.  It is of the ""HAMERLESS HUMPBACK"" version Slide Action shotgun.

OUR TERMS and CONDITIONS;
Buyer must be 18 years old for long guns. You must be legally able to own or possess a firearm. You must secure a current FFL in your State of residence and in your area for us to ship the firearm to. I will only ship this firearm to an FFL. I will need a legible copy of his FFL with dealer ID, signature and expiration date. If I can't read it or I can't check it out or it is not clear and legible I will not ship the firearm. Please have your FFL put the buyer/owners full name, home address, home phone number, and his information on the FFL for our records and so I can match the buyer to the FFL and to the firearm.

I am a Federal Firearm Licensed Dealer. You must abide by all Local, State and Federal Laws and it is YOUR responsibility to know your local laws before buying. Not my responsibility! There will be a 25% re-stocking fee if the firearm cannot be delivered as agreed on any canceled or returned item after payment. Shipping will be paid to and from by you accepting the firearm and on any return firearm.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out. Your payment, by cash, Personal Check, Certified Check, USPS Money Order, and now we accept Credit Cards as well. I wouldn't recommend cash but if you must send cash, go ahead, I'm honest and will accept cash as your payment. Personal Checks must clear my bank and I will not ship until I get confirmation your check has cleared, usually about a 7 to 10 day wait after deposit. Certified Checks must also clear but usually have a shorter wait time. USPS Money Orders must also clear but usually very fast and sometimes I can cash them at the Post Office. All major Credit Cards are accepted, except Discover, but you must call me to give me your CC information, number, expiration date, CCV and Name on the card. There is a 3% up-fee/surcharge on Credit Cards on the full amount including shipping but as soon as the funds show up in my account I will ship. Usually about 24 hours.

Your payment is due in our hands or account within 7 calendar days after you agree to buy. NO excuses, NO extensions accepted. Call me or e-mail with your information. If you do not pay within the 7 days as agreed I will re-post this firearm. Your call or e-mail will not change this. Longuns, Rifle, or Shotguns etc., firearms will be shipped UPS Ground for $38.00, paid by you so add to the amount of the firearm, and Alaska is an extra $10.00 with a signature required on all firearms. Insurance and other shippers are optional and may cost extra. I almost always add insurance to the shipping.

The name of my company is ""Gid-R-Dun Rod and Gun"" and we will Gid-R-Dun!

Please if you cannot or will not pay on time please don't tell me you will.

Restrictions apply, however, we cannot ship to civilian non-dealers in jurisdictions where AK47 Rifles are restricted to Law Enforcement only, that includes California, Connecticut, Aurora IL, Chicago Cook County IL, District of Colombia, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, or any others with similar statutes. Please read this entire ad carefully, then, before bidding or offering to buy. The best way to get payment to us is GA Pay. Apart from that, a two page fax with photo ID or FFL, quantity desired, and a complete MC, Visa, or Discover number set. Photos show one of only a few almost-complete parts kits we just got for the venerable Kalashnikov Rifle, known as the AK-47. This parts kit is the descendant AK-74, but fully interchangeable. Bolt face and extractor are mated for 7.62x39 caliber. All this kit needs is a receiver, barrel, both barrel trunnions, and magazine. We have partially finished receiver billets available but not included in this low price. Manufacturer is Arsenal AD of Kazanlak Bulgaria, that nation’s principal small arms manufacturer; and all these parts were made on Russian milling equipment. Their quality, then, is second to none. Condition is Excellent; the diligent workers of Croatia selected and retrieved these parts, and each kit includes a factory Inventory Sheet. These kits contain full component inventory for a Kalashnikov Rifle. All that is needed for a complete rifle is a receiver, a barrel and the trunnions for the barrel. Parts included are, to the best of our ability to identify them: stamped steel receiver cover ; milled steel bolt and operating assembly; stamped steel & brown polymer Gas Tube/Forend assembly; milled steel rear sight assembly with block; underfolder type stamped and cast steel side stock assembly with folding buttplate; brown polymer pistol grip; brown polymer forend; cast steel front sight assembly; cast steel gas block; steel cleaning rod; Stamped Steel Trigger Guard Assembly with Magazine release; cast steel handguard support with sling loop and lock lever; milled steel trigger hook assembly; milled steel sear; steel sear spring; coiled braided steel hammer spring; milled steel hammer; milled steel trigger pin; milled steel hammer pin; stamped steel safety selector / dust cover assembly; cast steel threaded muzzle brake; stamped steel selector lever stop; milled steel disconnector; stamped steel bolt carrier rail assembly; single hook milled steel trigger; milled steel barrel pin; milled steel barrel bushing lock; milled steel gas retaining pin; barrel bushing lock spring. We do not guarantee our labels to be correct, we are neither competent nor gunsmiths. Surface detractions are minimal, only edge whitening, as the photos show, and buyers will receive a kit from the same exact shipment lot as the photo specimen. These parts are greased, but that very grease is the reason they are in such fine condition. Everybody knows what AKs are selling for these days. We estimate that a barrel, both trunnions, and a receiver will cost something like $300.00. We’re offering the Bulgarian Arsenal AD Kalashnikov Rifle Parts Kit in the photos, or one of its identical mates, per kit only $ 199.00. Add a rear trunion for just $25.00 more.

What is that??? That is the most common thing that my customers say when they see their target for the first time.
Ultimate Targets are made with the highest quality AR500 steel on the market. They are built with care and attention to detail and are built to last for years. Used properly, a target from Ultimate Targets will outlast the shooter. Do you have a concept for a target? I can work with you to make it a reality!

Gongs are made from AR500 and are rated for ammo at 3,000 fps and slower. A stand and all harware to hang it is included. The entire unit disassembles and stores completely flat for super easy storage and transport. Sizes go from 2""- 20""
DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick.

Silhouette is AR500 and 3/8"" thick and is also rated for all pistol and rifle ammunition @ 3,000fps or slower. 1/2 scale, 2/3 scale available. Target stands right at 5' tall. The legs remove to make transporting easier. 

These targets will withstand tens of thousands of bullet strikes. If you are building a shooting range, I can help you get the most targets for your budget! I can offer discounts on package deals. I can do custom builds to fit your exact needs. The sky is the limit to what I can build. We can customize a range to your exact specifications and needs!

Also, be sure to like the Ultimate Targets page on Facebook. 

Every target from ULTIMATE TARGETS is made by American hands! No robots, illegal immigrants or communist mass production junk! Every target I build is made one at a time, with care, to ensure every target is built RIGHT! I guarantee all of my work. I've never had a target returned for any reason. You can buy these with the confidence that you will get a very well built target that will last you a very very long time.

This one is an 1943 Izhevsk in a post war stock. During the Soviet refurbishment, it was re-blued and was also counter bored to restore accuracy. I’ve blurred part of the serial number just above the Izhevsk stamp. I haven’t taken this one to the range yet, so I don’t know how it shoots. All I’ve done to this one is the initial cleaning.

It's a cheap gun that's accurate, powerful, tough as nails and will only go up in value. Everyone who was around when the surplus German Mausers hit the market are now kicking themselves for not buying more. They used to sell for $100-150, now they're $450+.

So don't dither, buy one. You don't have to buy it from the link above, but buy one. Buy 20 if you can.

Protips: Polish the chamber. Get a recoil pad - the full size Mosin kicks hard, this carbine model is lighter and kicks like you wouldn't believe so, seriously, get a pad (Amazon has a custom fit pad for $9 http://www.amazon.com/Mosin-Nagant-Rubber-Recoil-Butt/dp/B001HIT1UO ). Get the proper tool if you need to drift the front sight. Be sure of your backstop, the military round punches right through big trees.

NO New York City. This listing is for THREE Magazines. Hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price, and with no additional shipping charges. For the past few years, American Tactical Imports has led us to appreciate Turkish Gunmaking Finesse. Here is ATI’s factory 10 shot magazine for its well made, slick-finished FS9, CS9, and HP9 series of pistols, modeled and named after John Moses Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Italian influence, rather than Belgian, is more in evidence on the pistol itself as well as on its magazine. The tell-tale marking on the magazine is its patent number 5386657, a Mec-Gar patent. These magazines also fit the ATI FS-9 and CS-9 pistols. Interestingly, it will not fit a 92F series Beretta, but it works just fine in the Beretta 8000 Cougar pistols with only a quarter inch or so of protrusion past the butt of the Cougar’s grip frame, as the photos show. Construction is smooth bright blue finished steel, with steel spring and heavy duty black polymer extended floorplate and cartridge follower. This magazine flush fits the grip frame of the HP-9 pistol, as opposed to its standard issue extended twenty rounder. The ATI FS CS HP 9 series pistols are not, sadly, on the California DOJ Roster; we are happy to report, however, that our blue Beretta Cougars are indeed on the Roster, and that’s one reason we bought these magazines – for our Cougar customers. Replacement pricing on this magazine often approaches $60 apiece for the ten rounders, even more for the issue magazines that usually come with the pistols. Our Single Mag price is $29.00. We’re offering the ten rounders in the photos, however, or their identical mates, in lots of 3 or more at only $23 per. Own 3 for only $ 69.00.

The gun has all new internal springs, has a very light trigger, and has a beavertail and combat hammer, and pachmayer grips which make the gun a real joy  to hold and shoot, and dont interfere with the IWB holster I am including as well.  (see next line)

I have a IWB Galco holster which is very smooth to draw from and has served me well that is fitted for a commander sized 1911. (4.25in).

There is nothing wrong with the gun itself and it shoots as well as some of the higher end 1911s, I just dont have an emotional attachment to it and like trying out different weapon systems.  The gun has 2 magazines, the stock one and an aftermarket.  The stock one struggles to feed hollowpoints at times due to an aging spring, but still feeds FMJ rounds just fine.  The aftermarket one feeds everything I've tried with no issues.

If you email me I will happily email back pictures of the gun and holster, but please include what you are planning on offering for it as well in the first email, because I'm not interested in wasting my time or yours with an email chain that is going to end in me not wanting what you offer me.  I dont have pictures in the ad because for some reason AL wont let me upload right now."
