For sale is a FN Browning Model M1910/1922 32 ACP produced under German contract during WWII. This weapon came home with Grandpa after WWII and is in Fantastic condition. Records for FN Browning are less than complete however, we were able to track the serial # to post 1936 and during a German contract order without the waffen mark. After much research online and in person we have seen a few other examples that do not compare in condition to this one. Value ranges are all over the place based on condition and appear to be from $850 to $1100. This pistol fires and operates as it should! No pits, No rust! Clean bore and actually accurate. The M1910 was the pistol that started WWI, the M1922 was the second variant of the M1910 and was designed to be more accurate. This firearm was THE gun to have in Europe and continued to be produced and issued to militaries and police well after WWII. We are looking for SERIOUS offers only!!

I suggest you research TROY's uppers. They are not only extremely rare , pricey , and are on a 6-12 month wait ( I checked) but they are one of the best. The rest of the parts are pretty much run of the mill but it all forms a light ,tight &accurate weapon. 
This rifle has exactly 30 rounds down range. I do this with all my builds. 3-10 mags. 1st 5-10 for sighting in , next are a few double taps , and the rest is as fast as I can pul the trigger. 
It's flawless, smooth and accurate.

One thousand (1000) rounds .308 Winchester 150gr. FMJ ammunition in a sealed crate.

Rifle has been well cared for and is ready to shoot.

The Ishapore 2A/2A1 has the distinction of being the last bolt-action rifle designed to be used by a regular military force other than specialized sniper rifles.
Externally the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifle was based upon (and is almost identical to) the .303 British calibre SMLE Mk III* rifle, with the exception of the distinctive “square” (10 or 12 round) magazine and the use of the buttplate from the 1A (Indian version of the FN FAL) rifle. The 2A was designed to allow the British Pattern 1907 (P'07) sword bayonet used on the SMLE MkIII to be attached. There were other differences to the Ishapore 2A/2A1 rifles that include the use of improved steel (to handle the increased pressures of the 7.62mm NATO round), and a redesigned extractor to cope with the rimless round. Production of these rifles started in early 1960s and is believed to have been discontinued in 1975. The original (2A) design incorporated the Lee-Enfield rear sight which had metric graduations out to 2000 meters. The re-designated ""Rifle 7.62mm 2A1"" incorporated a more realistic 800 meter rear sight."

Designed and endorsed by John Plaster. this stock will fit any Remington model 700 Long Action rifle. .270 winchester, 30-06, 7mm.

Product Information
 Shop more Choate products The Ultimate Sniper Stock features a completely adjustable cheekpiece and buttpad for a perfect fit. The A rear elevation screw, coupled with an angled forend, provides precise elevation adjustments. Includes flush mounted sling swivel studs on the left and right, front and rear. The aluminum bedding block free-floats up to a 1-1/4"" bull barrel while the 2-1/2"" wide forearm provides a steady shot. Length of pull is 13-1/4"" and can be adjusted in 3/4"", 1/2"" or 1/4"" increments using spacers (sold separately). The bottom of stock is heavily serrated behind pistol grip and has a fine elevation adjustment knob that is removable. Angled forend makes bi-pod legs less likely to snag when folded. Durable polymer construction with a lifetime guarantee. 

Notes: 
The Choate® Sniper and Varmint ADL stocks will work with Remington® Model 700™ ADL and BDL firearms. The ADL uses a blind magazine well, the BDL uses a hinged floorplate. The BDL will work with the Choate® ADL stocks, but once installed it will have a blind bottom magazine. Modification by a gunsmith is necessary to allow the use of a hinged floorplate with Choate® Sniper and Varmint stocks.

The 20” Hbar Melonite treated barrel is one of the most durable, long lasting barrels you can buy, plus the lightweight rail system reduces the weight from the SASS rifle without negating accuracy.

I have Been trying to order a new one from Grizzly ""G0704"" but they seem to never be in stock when they have a good price or when I have the liquid cash and as usual I have the funds but they are out of stock.

Like the BF20 BF30 or Seig X3 X4 Size... Most the Machines are similar

What would be Perfect and Preferred is a Used Grizzly G0704 or other Square Column Mill, Precision Matthews PM25MV PM30MV, Lathemaster LMT25L, Optimum BF20 or BF30, Etc. Some links to the machine types.

Are you aware that you can build your own AR-15? It's perfectly legal to manufacture your own gun as long as you never sell it without ATF approval. 


Many people are afraid of a project like this because they lack the proper tools and experience. We're here to fix that problem. Keep reading to see how it works.

LCT Products is a machine shop. We have all the tools needed to complete your AR build. We'll supply everything you need, including a competent instructor to handle all your questions while you work. 
We will supply you with a forged ""80%"" lower receiver. This is simply an aluminum lower with 80% of the work already completed. The hard stuff is already done for you. 
We will supply you with the fixtures needed to insure you machine exactly where you are supposed to. 
We will supply you with the cutters and drill bits needed too. This alone can save you a considerable amount of money. 

You will set up an appointment to work on your project. At the chosen time, you'll come to our location in Lawson, MO (Just north of Kansas City). We'll supply you with safety glasses and an instructor will introduce you to a Bridgeport milling machine where you will machine your lower. It's really that easy. When you are finished, you have a completed firearm according to the ATF.

Are you aware that you can build your own AR-15? It's perfectly legal to manufacture your own gun as long as you never sell it without ATF approval. 


Many people are afraid of a project like this because they lack the proper tools and experience. We're here to fix that problem. Keep reading to see how it works.

LCT Products is a machine shop. We have all the tools needed to complete your AR build. We'll supply everything you need, including a competent instructor to handle all your questions while you work. 
We will supply you with a forged ""80%"" lower receiver. This is simply an aluminum lower with 80% of the work already completed. The hard stuff is already done for you. 
We will supply you with the fixtures needed to insure you machine exactly where you are supposed to. 
We will supply you with the cutters and drill bits needed too. This alone can save you a considerable amount of money. 

You will set up an appointment to work on your project. At the chosen time, you'll come to our location in Lawson, MO (Just north of Kansas City). We'll supply you with safety glasses and an instructor will introduce you to a Bridgeport milling machine where you will machine your lower. It's really that easy. When you are finished, you have a completed firearm according to the ATF.

Absolutely no wears, scratch or dens on the gun. It looks like new.

I am asking for $800 for the entire package  FTF in Rochester or Twin Cities area only. 

Thank you for your interest. Pictures are available upon request

P/S: I also have a like new TTGunleather holster for USPc models in black color that is on sale too."

2 1/2"" Snub / 6-shot / .38Spl /  Blue /  98%+ condition / no box

A classic Colt ""Snake"" gun not made since the mid-80's. 

The Colt Diamondback snubby is a surprisingly compact revolver.  It's a beautiful combination
of all-steel manufacture and a full six-shot capacity. It's a carry gun without peer. Colt gave this
one compellingly beautiful lines – and especially so in its snub-nose variant.

Whether you'll put this one into action, or just sit back and just let it rise in value, this one will not
disappoint.  We probably won’t see these levels of quality (and beauty) from Colt ever again.

Will follow all F.O.I.D. rules.

The M1903 not only replaced the various versions of the U.S. Army's Krag, but also the Lee Model 1895 and M1885 Remington-Lee used by the United States Navy and the United States Marine Corps, as well as all remaining single shot trap-door Springfield Model 1873's.

The bolt is machined and the scope can break away, there are iron sights on the gun as well, this is a collector’s weapon. It was officially adopted as a United States military bolt-action rifle on June 19, 1903, and saw service in World War I. It was officially replaced as the standard infantry rifle by the faster-firing semi-automatic 8 round M1 Garand starting in 1937. However, the M1903 Springfield remained in service as a standard issue infantry rifle during World War II. 

This one has been Sporterized, and is in excellent condition. The weapon is dead on at 100 yards and is 3 inch below bullseye at 200 yards . I have shoot the gun and it operators perfect and is a joy to shot!

This is the Cruiser model:
-	Holds 8
-	Parkerized finish
-	Comes with the Tri-Rail accessory rail to hold everything you want to put on it!
-	20” barrel
-	Front sight bead

Practically new… only shot a few rounds through it, cleaned it and put it up.  Have the box, papers, lock, etc...  

Added the BlackHawk Knoxx recoil reducing adjustable stock.  This is a great stock as it greatly reduces the kick when shooting defensive rounds like double or triple 00 buck, etc... Has a nice butt pad plus the recoil reducing spring technology and has 6 (I think, maybe 7) adjustable positions to match the shooter and the situation.

Does have a mark (not a scratch) on the barrel where something rubbed against it (see picture - looks much worse than it is).  I’m sure it can be removed but I haven’t tried.

FTF in Greensboro and all laws will be followed.

Ruger 77/17 .17HMR Bolt-Action Rifle w/ 20″ Stainless Barrel, Scope Rings, 9+1 Capacity – Ruger 7033

Small to Medium Game Fun in a Full-Size Rifle. In 1983, Ruger responded to the many shooters who desired a high-quality, adult-size 22 rimfire rifle – one that was built to centerfire standards of strength, accuracy and aesthetics. Focused on building a rifle that was accurate, economical, and extremely handsome, Bill Ruger launched the family of bolt-action rifles using the rotary magazine.

Comparing favorably with custom-made firearms, the innovative Ruger 77/22® (available in 22 LR, 22 Mag. or 22 Hornet), the powerful Ruger® 77/357™, Ruger 77/44® and the flat-shooting and superbly accurate Ruger 77/17® (available in 17 Mag. or 17 Hornet) have all established themselves as the perfect rifle for small game hunters, ranchers, and long-range informal “plinkers.” Offered in a variety of calibers and configurations, these rifles boast all of the technological advancements of the M77® Mark II rifle with the rugged and utterly dependable Ruger detachable rotary magazine.

Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.

The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz.
