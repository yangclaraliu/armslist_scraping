The V69 Destroyer is a conventional-class backpack with unconventional features. They are more fully detailed than most packs in this class. In the tradition of our focus on practical field use, we've built the 60 liter (3660 cubic inch) V69 Destroyer and 99 liter (6050 cubic inch) V90 Battleship to be extremely capable and comfortable load bearing systems. With very similar features, the main difference between the two is one of scale. Choose the slightly more compact V69 if you need smaller capacity and prefer to go as light as possible. Choose the larger V90 if you simply need to get serious and haul some big loads. 
For its scale, this pack is extremely light weight. We've carefully chosen new materials that give the optimum balance between high strength and light weight, and arranged them very cleverly, if we do say so ourselves. Every feature and detail has a purpose, and many of them have multiple purposes. 

Includes full rain cover, which stows in a pocket on the bottom of the pack. Compatible with either WXP3L or WB2L hydration bladders (two bladder compartments; one on each side of pack).

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

Savage 93R17-HV .17 HMR Rifle with 21″ Heavy Barrel, Synthetic Stock, Blued Finish – Savage 96700

The R17F rifles has the AccuTrigger, a revolutionary design that will forever change the way shooters expect triggers to function. The AccuTrigger gives the shooter the flexibility to set the trigger pull to individual preference without have to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. Also, even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. A newly designed teardrop safety is an additional feature on rifles with the AccuTrigger. It provides for better acquisition of the safety button and operates smoother and quieter. Enhanced accuracy is another benefit of the Savage AccuTrigger, is the crisp, clean light trigger pull allows the shooter to maximize the accuracy potential of the rifle.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 is available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Unlike other polymer based pistols the steel frame on the P250 controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with lasers, lights, or other accessories mounted to the polymer grip's molded in accessory rail.

 Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

On a personal note, I really like this pistol. It has a bobbed no snag hammer design and the smoothest D.A.O. trigger pull I have ever felt on any semi- auto pistol.

Very nice 1972 LW Commander in the rare 9mm caliber. This does not have box or docs but is a very nice survivor. The matte frame on these was very prone to wear and while this one has some scuff it is in much nicer condition than most. The bluing on the slide is very nice and it retains its stock grips."

Taurus did it right when they made this one and it works well with about any brand of ammo that you want to feed it.  Work the slide one time and you are ready to fire 7 shots by just pulling the trigger 7 times.  How simple can it get.  Perfect protection for men and women.  Oh! did I mention that it only weighs 10.2 ozs and is just over 5 inches long.

I bought this two years ago to shoot 5 stand, I really lusted after this gun. There's two reasons I'm selling it. First, this gun doesn't fit me.  My scores have certainly increased, but it's not as comfortable FOR ME as other guns I've shot. Friends of mine have felt very comfortable with this however.  The second reason is that I reload shotgun hulls and an over-under is just easier for reloading purposes.

Increase in federal excise tax on ammunition from 11% to 50%
Increase in NFA tax (pre-’86 autos, SBRs, suppressors, etc.) from $200 to $500
Increase in NFA AOW tax from $5 to $100
Increase in special (occupational) tax for importers, manufacturers, and dealers
Adds semiautomatic pistols “chambered for cartridges commonly considered rifle rounds, configured with receivers commonly associated with rifles and capable of accepting detachable magazines” to the list of items taxable as NFA items (26 USC § 5845)
