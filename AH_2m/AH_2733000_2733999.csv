This sweet thing is SBR ready!!

THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, DON'T CONFUSE CZECHPOINT WITH OTHER COMPANIES THAT ASSEMBLE FIREARMS FROM PARTS KITS. THIS PISTOL IS 100% MADE NEW BY CZECH SMALL ARMS.

The Sa vz. 61 Scorpion is the semi-automatic version of the legendary Sa vz. 61 submachine gun (machine pistol) designed in the late 1950´s in Czechoslovakia. The Scorpion was designed for reconnaissance units, tank crews, Special Forces, and for security forces of the Ministry of Interior. The Scorpion was developed to fulfill a specific need: a firearm that could be worn like a pistol (in a holster) and capable of full automatic fire.

The design of the vz. 61 Scorpion was unique in its time. It uses the following common operational features found on a submachine gun: an unlocked bolt, magazine inserted into the bottom of the receiver (outside of the pistol grip) and a folding stock. These common features are combined with the following characteristics not usually found in submachine guns: extraordinary small size, fires from a closed bolt, and uses a rate reducer to slow full automatic fire.

The vz. 61 Scorpion offered by CzechPoint is the semi-automatic version of the original military issued firearm - it is as close as one can get to owning the legendary Scorpion submachine gun. Except for removal of the full-auto parts and rate reducer, and three modified parts with new safety, this firearm is like those used by Military and Paramilitary units in nearly 20 countries around the world. 

As shown in the photo, the vz. 61 Scorpion finish is comprised of a blued lower receiver with a black paint upper receiver (paint cured at 300 degrees fahrenheit).

With hammer down and trigger forward there is a slight amount of rotation movement in the cylinder. I would rate this at 97-98% condition since it doesn't have the original rear sight and has been fired.

Description:
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

With transmission holography optics, parallax free, this sight offers amazing visibility. The eye relief is unlimited and at 4 inch setting it offers a 30 yard field of view. The front window is made from thick glass to withstand any shock and damage, while the rear window is made out of resistant laminate. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

Prefer to sell as a package! 

The only trade I will consider is:

950rds .22lr SK Pistol Match

Not using it, so I figure somebody might want it. Before you complain about the pricing, keep in mind that this is NOT BULK AMMO & check out the prices at MidwayUSA (http://www.midwayusa.com/product/REDACTED/sk-pistol-match-ammunition-22-long-rifle-40-grain-lead-round-nose?cm_vc=ProductFinding) and other sites. This is less than what MidwayUSA would be charging (before shipping) if they had it in stock. I figure as long as folks are paying premium $$ for .22lr, they might as well get premium ammo (instead of $50-$60/500 for traditional bulk ammo.)

Even the S&W factory is out of stock. These mags will fit all 59 series S&W 9mm pistols and will fit the 69 series with an adapter sleeve. This lot includes two S&W 14 rd factory mags in very good used condition and five Eagle Alpha brand 16 rd mags.

The S&W factory mags both function perfectly in all aspects of operation. The Eagle mags function properly when loaded but some will not hold the slide open when empty and some will not allow the slide to close when empty without dropping the mag. Some will not drop free and must be pulled out by hand. For the amateur gunsmith, a Dremel tool or file would probably fix these issues. The Eagles would be good only for target practice and are sold as is.

Selling all as one lot; will not sell individually. The two S&W mags alone would cost more than the price of this whole lot.

If you are a potential buyer locally, I do not mind sending pictures by email that I took this evening. 

You may see this at my office and upon purchasing, I will prepare a bill of sale and a transferable certification certificate for you to send in to applecare. I again spoke with applecare about this and this is fine and is how I have sold computers in the past when upgrading to newer macs. 

I will then schedule a genius bar appointment, that day if possible, which normally can be accomplished in the next few hours,  and they will restore it to its factory settings which takes about 30 minutes; you may then meet me at the apple store at the promenade or pick it up at your convenience at my office. 

This computer works perfectly and I use it every day in writing appellate briefs. The price is a steal with applecare, and it is firm. I do not mind keeping this but thought I would offer to sell it here.

I have a Sig Sauer P220S Sport model. I purchased the gun about a year ago off armslist from a collector --original owner-- in NC (He had multiple 220s and didn't need this one) who fired only 75 rounds through it. 

Gun comes with everything pictured, including a SRT kit which was never installed. After receiving the gun I put 100 rounds through it with a couple of FTFs (4-6). I contacted Sig and had the full Sig Service package performed (see below). I haven't fired it since (Sig test fired 25 rounds no problem). I'd keep the gun, but I have since fallen in love with 1911s and would like pick one up: so that's the reason for selling.

From what I know, this is an uncommon/rare Sig. Its a triple serial number, made in Germany (hand-fitted), match components (barrel, hammer, etc) work of art. Some models came with a compensator, this does not have that. The gun is full stainless steel, DA/SA, 2 original Sig magazines.

Full Sig Service Package:
Full Service Package – Detailed stripping and complete and thorough cleaning of the entire pistol. Professional safety inspection of critical components by factory certified personnel. Replacement of springs prone to wear ( trigger bar spring, slide catch lever spring, recoil spring) and any needed small parts. Then lubrication to factory standards, reassembly and function testing. (Not available for 1911-22 or Mosquito models). $84.95

I purchased this setup in November new from a Member, put one magazine through it and am now selling my non-necessary  toys to buy a ball and chain (yup getting engaged).  

The gun is an AR57 12"" complete upper (gen 2.).  There are clearly a set of Magpul MBUS on the pistol.  The lower is a AR57 lower with AR57 grip.  The LPK was a hodge-podge of pieces I had laying around (read nothing special) but does have a Spikes Enhanced trigger guard.  The AR57 has a special buffer that is setup in the the buffer assembly and the tube is a Thorsden Customs with cheek riser.

The new upper as cheap as I can find it online would be $670, new lower is $100, LPK ($60), Buffer Assembly ($70), Thorsden Customs Buffer Cover w/ Cheek Riser ($40) - all w/o shipping.  Call the list price roughly $950.

Looking to get $800.


I also have a whole bunch of spare AR57 magazines (10 Extra New Mags) I will sell way below list if the buyer is interested.  Similarly I have 400 rounds of AE57 ammo that I'll also let go below current prices on GunBot.  

If interested in the whole lot - I'll be willing to cut a better deal.  


Sooo help a guy get engaged and buy my AR pistol.


For those not in the know, this is registered just like any other pistol in Michigan, but there are some rules around it - you cannot at a VFG if the OAL is below a certain length (26"" I believe) and this is just on the border of that.  Clearly, because it's a pistol you also cant put a normal stock on it - that would make it an SBR - but cross your fingers that is in legislation now so we may get lucky soon.

The AR57 Upper Receiver Assembly converts an AR-15 to shoot 5.7x28 FN ammunition. The unique upper design loads on top and accepts FN PS90 magazine and ejects downward through the AR-15 magwell. This upper is precision machined from a one piece aluminum forging. The integrated picatinny-style quad rail system allows attachment of various accessories. A parkerized chrome alloy bolt and full-floated barrel ensure reliability and accuracy. The teflon-infused hard coat anodized aluminum upper and rails guarantee durability for years of shooting enjoyment. The updated charging handle and magazine release of the Generation 2 allows for easy manipulation of the controls. New and improved lightening features, such as the fluted barrel, shave a pound off this receiver when compared to the Generation 1 upper assemblies. The top feed and bottom eject also help to make this upper fully functional for right or left handed users."

500 round display pack of 70's vintage CCI Mini-Mag 40 grain copper plated solid points. To the best of my recollection these were bought around the time I was graduating from high school which was 1977. The ammo is packed in the old orange 100 round plastic boxes with the old graphics. The ammo itself is bright, shiny and sure to fire. The cardboard counter display sleeve is in good condition but does have some minor yellowing/staining from age. $100 

(2) 50 round boxes Winchester & Western .22 Mag ammo. This dates from late 60's to early 70's. Ammo condition is excellent and boxes are good. $50 

50 round box US Ammunition Company .38 Special plastic case ammo. USAC came on the scene in the early 80's with the neat idea of plastic cased ammo that could be reloaded either by hand (the bullets snap in with finger pressure) or with a very inexpensive hand held tool they were going to sell. They did a ton of marketing initially and even sent out 6 round sample boxes to dealers around the country. However it just really never caught on and it was probably because there was no real price advantage. So they went bankrupt before they really ever got going. 

I had a relative at the time who worked on Wall Street that was part of the team who was working on taking USAC public, but alas... it never happened. However he did get a few free cases of prototype ammo in the 50 round boxes that USAC was going to use commercially. So a bunch of it ended up with me and I shot a lot of it. It was great low to medium power target and plinking ammo. Now I just found a box of it left over and I think it's probably pretty collectible now especially in the 50 round commercial box because I don't think much was produced in this configuration. Ammo is in perfect shape and box is fair. Includes an  
original advertising/instruction pamphlet that was to be packed in each 50 round box. $100 

All ammo is pick up in the Brandon area. Must be at least 21 to purchase."
