This barrel boasts CMMG's W.A.S.P. salt bath nitrocarbuerization treatment, sometimes known as nitriding, which offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance as compared to chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without build-up, so accuracy is not compromised.

How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in dissassembly with their Dragonov stock repacement. Their current SKS offering is $875.00. The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers an adapter to use AK47 mags. $575.00

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

This gun was purchased brand new at the Kittery Trading Post on 7/3/13.  It has been fired once and it's sites are dead on!  I fired approx. 25 rounds.  Never used again.
I had a home ""invasion"" through a locked window during the month of September.  They stole my ammo and a hand gun but weren't able to conceal the rifle while on foot.  I moved the weapon to a friend's house where he could secure it in his gun safe.  That is where it has been stored since.  The robbers came back two days later (surely and predictably looking for the rifle they had left behind) this time entering through my ""doggy"" door!  I work a 12 hour shift, they know my schedule, my dogs have to go out while I am at work.  I don't have the money to purchase a safe and would rather own a hand gun that I can take with me and conceal.  I don't want to get ripped off so I am not interested in selling this weapon to a dealer who can purchase it for themselves at wholesale prices.  I would like to sell to a private person who is looking to buy brand new and would like to save some cash.
I have had a bunch of offers to trade weapons or to trade with some money.  I have lowered the price by 50.00.  I want to sell the item and the price is firm."

I have the .32 and the .380 so am parting with one. I did not know how well made and nice of a gun these were until I started reading about them.  The customer service is excellent and they have a lifetime warranty.  They are partnered with Kahr and the frame has Kahr's stamp on it.

I have the .32 and the .380 so am parting with one. I did not know how well made and nice of a gun these were until I started reading about them.  The customer service is excellent and they have a lifetime warranty.  They are partnered with Kahr which explains the quality and service.

Retail price is $599.99 + $48.00 sales tax + $21.94 shipping for a total of $621.93

This one is yours for $550 picked up ($71.93 savings).  Only reason I'm selling it for less than retail as it won't fit in my car, and will be a pain to return to the store.  A truck or large SUV is recommended for pickup (I can help load it in your vehicle if necessary, total weight is 138lb).  If I can't get my asking price, I'll just borrow a truck and return it for a refund.

Based on what I've seen online, it will be delivered on a small pallet in a wooden crate.
