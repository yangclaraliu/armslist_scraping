I guarantee you haven't seen a 1961 Gun this nice since maybe 1962!
It is beautiful, and you will be proud to own it, or even give it as a gift or keepsake gun.
The gun is way nicer than pics show, its hard to show how nice a long gun is on here, and especially with only 3 pics...
I have attended dozens of gun shows and stores in the last year, and this gun is one of the nicest I have come across on the market, especially at this low price.
These guns can bring asking prices of nearly 2000 dollars on the market depending on all the options, conditions, year etc. 
The gun comes in a case to protect it during transport.
I'm sure every serious gunner out there knows this gun by it's reputation and style.
This gun is a 1961 model according to Browning records researchable on the internet.
It is a beautiful gun that will make a great shooter or trophy gun for your collection.
I am more of a pistol and rifle shooter, but this gun was offered to me and was way too nice for me to not take ownership of, but, it should be in a shotgunners household..
I am open to offers of firearms of about any type, please just understand that I will always pay extra for things that I love, and something less for things that I won't keep.
I am always fair in my valuations, and I am often on here selling really nice weapons.
I can be reached on my cell by text or calling me at REDACTED, Joe"

Aside of about 100 rounds through it without issues, this gun is flawless.  There are a couple scratches around the safety lever which according to S&W is acceptable. Turns out the only other 1911sc I've seen has them too.  I'm sure they can be colored and they only show when the gun is on safe.

Night sights are standard on this gun.  Two mags came with the gun, one with a bumper pad on it (both 8 rounders).  I'm including two chip mccormick mags (8rds).  I had two custom holsters made for this gun that are very comfortable and slick so you can count on much less holster wear than you'd get with leather.  Good coat of silicone spray inside keeps the edges from wearing.  THere are no imperfections with this clean gun and it fires perfectly.

THis gun, which is fairly hard to find, is worth $1200 (comes with case and papers)
Holsters = $85
2 CMC mags = $60
210 rounds of 230gr FMJs = $150

This handgun is high polished, fully engraved factory new, with only a few modifications: adding a bit larger and more visible front sight and a better pronounced rear sight. The original durable plastic main spring housing is exchanged for a stainless steel housing, which also has the lanyard option. Compared with earlier models, this gun has a more elongated spur on the grip safety, and two half moon shaped grooves on the frame behind the trigger, giving a more convenient index finger position to right and left handed shooters alike.

Unfired.  Trigger Job and pillar bedded.  I've had this for at least 4 years, I never got the money together to put the kind of scope on it that it deserves.  For those unfamiliar with the SPR it was basicly a ""screw you"" from FN to the rest of the precision rifle community.  The story goes that FN was told that they couldn't build a sun-MOA boltgun with a chrome lined barrel.  FN disagreed as, according to them, they had built plenty of sub-MOA M240 barrels.  So they built the SPR with a chrome lined barrel and sub-MOA accuracy.  In most precision rifle the barrel is considered a wear item good got a few hundred to a few thousand rounds, depending on manufacturer and shooter requirements.  The SPR barrel, being chrome lined, should last pretty much forever.  Hence the attraction.

I should keep this, but other projects need funding.  Comes with 4 5rd mags.  Mags are normally $60/each if/when you can find them.  Great rifle, great price

I shoot this ammo a lot through a  LWRC REPR and it can hold pretty tight half dollar size groups at 150 yards. It is pretty good ammo and reload able.

The U.S. Army Ordnance Department accepted the modified Enfield rifle for the use of American troops on May 11, 1917.  .303 Pattern 1914 Mk I rifle production at Eddystone, Pennsylvania effectively ceased in mid-1917, as the plant re-tooled to begin making the U. S. Military Rifles, .30 caliber, Model 1917.

At this time the Remington Arms Company of Delaware employed 10,500 workers at Eddystone, but many were still working on completing the final batches of .303 Pattern 1914 Mk I rifles. Employment decreased to 3,917 on July 15, 1917, but gradually increased to a maximum of 15,409 men and women on September 27, 1918, all working on the U.S. Model 1917 rifles .  Eddystone was awarded a contract for 450,000 rifles; and later another contract for 250,000 for the US Army in WWI.  Production of U.S. Model 1917 rifles at Eddystone began on September 17, 1917, and this facility delivered its first order of 450,000 rifles long before the promised date of June 30, 1918. The second order for 250,000 rifles were also completed by that same date.  The Eddystone Model of 1917 went on to see action through WWII by some troops.

This rifle is one of the rare survivors of the 700,000 Eddystone rifles produced before the US entry into WWI.  The stock is fairly rough and could use some work but this rifle is a great shooter!  The bore is excellent with no rust, strong rifling, and grooves.  It will make a great 30.06 shooting rifle.  Even the barrel is an original WWI barrel.  All WWI inspector marks are still on the receiver and the stock.  The rear hand guard does have a WWI repaired crack that is strong.  Grab this piece of history while you can."

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. **Stock: BLACK** Caliber: 5.56 NATO** Barrel Length: 16 1/2** Weight (lbs):7.9** Overall Length: 26 1/8** Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy. Mil-Spec , chrome lined, cold-hammer forged CrMoV barrel, 6 groove 1:7 RH twist. 100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left hand bolts for 5.56 NATO and 5.45x39mm. Integral folding adjustable backup iron sights with Tritium front post (flat top models only) Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles. Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies. Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR®SAR parts. Uses standard AR-15/M16 magazines. Last round hold open on empty magazine. All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance. Integral rubber recoil pad. Assembled in the US from Israeli and US manufactured parts. Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use. Clean, long stroke piston operation. Body constructed of high-strength impact modified polymer. NO TRADE ! NO TRADE ! NO TRADE !"

For those not familiar, Windham Weaponry is the old Bushmaster.
When Cerberus bought Bushmaster, they did not buy the machinery or facilities.
The old owner of Bushmaster hired the old employess and they started making the same guns on the same machines and named the company Windham Weaponry.

It has been polished by hand, and blued. The magazine tube and bottom of the receiver has a high polish to reduce wear and smooth cycling, the sides of the receiver has a 400 polish which  is the original finish type, and the top strap has a bead blasted and blued finish for a non reflective surface. 

The First Barrel is a Full Choke 30"" with stainless front bead. This barrel is the original barrel and has the original 400 polish.
The Second Barrel is an 18 3/4"" Matte Blued barrel that has been ported. The bore is a cylinder bore with a lengthened forcing cone to provide stable shot patterns at medium range. this barrel is excellent for home defense, or just plain having fun at the range. 

The Wingmaster has had absolutely no alterations performed to the trigger group or slide bars. This Shotgun is an exceptionally smooth slider and simply has to be felt to believe how smooth it is. It has been extensively gone through, inspected and cleaned. Both bores are at 100% with no interior scratching or etching. 

The Stocks are the original stocks, only the checkering patterns instead of being cheap pressed checkering it has been cut by hand. Both stocks have been finished with a hand rubbed Velvet oil finish and the checkering has been sealed so it will last longer. 

This shotgun again is a 2 3/4"" gun with two barrels. The sporting or hunting barrel is a Full choke 30 and the Defense barrel is a Vent rib 18 3/4"" with a Cylinder Bore."

Up for sale is a Thompson Centerfire (TC) Hawken Black Powder 50 caliber muzzle loader.  This gun is very nice and is in great condition.  It is clean and ready to fire.  See the pictures to identify the condition.  I think it is in great condition but I am not a gun expert.  The gun has scope mounts already installed.  I have a basic scope that I will include in the sale of this gun or you can simply mount yours to this gun.  Don't miss your chance to buy this great American gun.     

The gun is one of the most copied rifles in the history of firearms, the Hawken was designed for the American shooter. This famous rifle is complemented by solid brass hardware. The buttplate, trigger guard, and contoured patch box have been inletted and fitted to the American Walnut stock. The Barrel is a 28"" blued steel octagon with a 1 in 48"" twist. This rifle features adjustable rear and bead front sights, hooked breech system, and a 45"" overall length. The rifle comes drilled and tapped for scope mounts.  

I prefer cash but I am willing to accept a trade for any of the following items:

- Scrap Silver (Pre 64 Dimes, Quarters, Halfs, or Dollars) any silver any condition
- Rifle in 30-06 Caliber (Prefer a Remington, Tikka, or Savage but will consider everything)
- 1911 45 caliber handgun (Not going to be particular on the brand send pics and info)
- Semi-Automatic 12 Gauge Shotgun (Not going to be particular on the brand send pics and info)
- .223 ammunition however I am not going to trade if you are valuing your ammo at over 0.30/Round
- I may also consider ammunition in the following calibers (9mm, .40cal, 45 cal, .380, 8mm Mauser)

If you have something above that you would be willing to trade but you think it is worth more than my gun please still send the offer.  I may consider trading for the gun and some money.  

Thanks for looking.  If you are a serious buyer you can call, text, or email anytime.

There are a lot of people demanding proof of Permit or believing they need to provide a Permit in order to buy/sell non-handgun related firearms (even saw a guy selling ammo and requiring a valid permit).  A Concealed Carry Permit is irrelevant on the topic of long guns, i.e. rifles and shotguns, and anything not labeled as a handgun.  Please do not sell and/or purchase firearms until you are aware of your state laws.  This is the kind of ignorance that will come back to bite lawful and well meaning shooters and hunters.

There is a small nick in the paint next to the ejection port, but it's not bad. Can easily be touched up or covered or even duracoated for a decent price. I know a guy in town if you would want to go that route.

Pump up (multi-pump) powered. This air rifle is in very good, very clean condition. It works perfectly as supposed to. Adult owned. This air rifle shoots more accurately than normal break barrel air rifle due to there is no recoil!

Rifled barrel.
Shoots .177 pellet and BB.
Pump 3-10 time to shoot. (Just to be clear, it is not semi-auto.)
Pellets use a fast loading clip, BBs loads from a internal chamber.
Rated 600 fps for pellet, 625 fps for BB.
Recommended by Crosman for target shooting, pest control, and small game hunting.
Has two picatinny / weaver rails on the top. Can easily mount a scope, red dot, laser, or flashlight.
Has two picatinny rails below the barrel. These two rails are useless due to the space needed to pump up.
The air rifle includes a set of removable iron sight. 
Peep-hole type rear sight, adjustable for windage.
Front sight is adjustable for elevation.
These iron sights themselves are very well made. They can be used as serious iron sight.
The ""fake"" magazine can be detached and used as a tool box. It has a piece of foam inside, so the things you put inside won't make noises.
A cross bolt safety in front of the trigger.
Adjustable stock.

Overall, this would be an accurate air gun for target shooting or plinking."

I am willing to negotiate a little on the price by removing certain items (optics) to help you afford it.  All transactions are final and I only accept cash.  I can email more pictures and if you'd like to meet to shoot the gun at a range, that will be fine.
