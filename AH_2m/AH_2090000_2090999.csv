I bought it last year at a gun show in OKC and have built it from completely stock into almost entirely custom.  As a preface - I love this gun and would rather keep it forever than lose money on it.  If I didn't need cash at the moment, it wouldn't even be an option.  That being said, below is a list of the equipment:

Olympic arms upper & lower - $1,099
Magpul stock (came w/ gun purchase)
Hogue grip   (came w/ gun purchase)
Magpul B.A.D. Lever - $33
UTG free float rail - $100
Low profile gas block - $40
Caldwell AR bipod - $60
Troy extended latch for charging handle - $25
Magpul trigger guard - $9 
Magpul angled fore grip - $42
CAA mag well grip - $30
SIG SAUER laser/spotlight/strobe - $160
Tactical innovations suppressor - $40
NC Star Zombie Stryke scope w/ biohazard reticle . Sth432z - $210
100 rd drum - $200
Single point para cord sling in OD & Black - $40
Magpul pmags (2) - $60
Magpul window pmags (3) - $90
Swamp fox mag (1) - $27
Metal mags (2) - came w/ gun purchase

450 rounds of Federal/X-Tac/Remington - $400
20 rounds of Tula steel - $10
Tactical camo bag - $70

So as you can see, I have about $2,200 in the gun itself - about $2,700 package overall.  Unfortunately, I bought the gun itself when prices were ridiculous last year, so I understand fully that I overpaid for the gun and that these prices do not reflect current value.  I am willing to work with a buyer, but as stated previously, I'm not willing to give it away.  It has been fired less than 10 times due to the absurd ammo prices and limited availability when I first bought it.  If you have questions, please don't hesitate to ask, but please, serious inquiries only.  

Asking $2,000 for everything listed.  Might be willing to separate some items if you don't want/need them, but nothing goes without the gun itself.  I also have original packaging for the scope and SIG laser.

Looking for cash only.  Only gun I might be interested in is a brand new or like new Ruger SR 1911 or Colt Commander, plus the remaining cash obviously."

45,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2090045,For Sale:  Arsenal SAM7K AK AK47 layaway SAM7K-01,"central, Lawton, Oklahoma","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, September 8, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm presenting an Arsenal SAM7K-01. The milled receiver is marked ""Made in Bulgaria"" and ""Arsenal Las Vegas NV USA"". It has the circle 10 brand if you're familiar with that. The milled receiver makes for a more solid firearm. I don't believe it necessarily makes it more reliable but there's definitely a nice solid feel to them. This pistol is chambered in 7.62X39. The tip up dust cover is hinged near the front trunnion. It opens and closes easily. The fire control parts feature a dual hook trigger. The trigger has no slack, 3/8"" of fairly smooth creep, and a crisp let off at an estimated five pounds. This could be smoothed into a nice trigger pull. The safety selector can be engaged from the traditional lever on the right, but Arsenal incorporated a left side lever like on the Galil. That left side selector is forward on safe and must me moved rearward for fire. Not the most desirable but, when you examine the mechanism, you'll understand why it had to be that way. There is a receiver rail on the left side. The dust cover mounted rear flip sight has two settings: a notch and a ghost ring. You select which you wish to use via the lever on the right side. While the flip sight can easily be changed without the lever, the lever is probably welcome when wearing thick gloves. The front sight is standard AK adjustable for elevation by screwing the post in or out, and for windage by drifting the cylinder. The front sight and gas block assembly has a muzzle device attached. Here's how I think it's arranged...I believe the block is threaded, probably 24mm. The barrel extends about 2.5"" beyond the threads. The device is threaded onto the gas block threads and pinned into place. Thus, the muzzle device is a mock whatever. It is neither a brake nor a flash hider. The pistol comes with a 5rd magazine. I have 30rd mags and mag kits"

It has been sported but has not been permanently altered meaning you can easily return it to as issued condition by simply putting it back together using original parts.

The Winchester made 1917's are the rarer of the three and average $1200 when in as issued condition. in order to return her to full military condition you will need 1. hand guard ring, 2. center band, 3. front band and stock set. The parts for 1917s are cheap and plentiful. It will run you roughly $300-$325 for the parts which will in return leave you with a $1000 U.S. military WW1 rifle. I can provide you with many online resources to acquire these parts.

I do have an original stock set that I will include for an additional $250

The rifle is in very good condition with no rust or pitting and the bore is spectacular. As this rifle sits, I can consistently achieve 4 inch groups @ 200 yards. A shooter with a steadier hand and better eyes can probably shrink that group by 1/3.

I will ship at buyers expense which is usually $26-$32."

This rifle is new and unfired (other than factory test firing, signed test fire card included). It is in the factory shipping box and original plastic. I do not want to sell it, and it does hold some sentimental value to me (was given to me by the world's best 3-gun shooter, Daniel Horner), but my financial situation requires me to let go of some things.

Anyhow, this 18"" rifle is built for speed and accuracy and is one of the best 3-gun rifles out there, and very hard to find right now. Clint Upchurch, Colt's pro shooter, shoots this rifle in 3 Gun Nation matches and does very well. I won't go into the all the specs of the rifle here, but the main selling points are the 18"" stainless fluted match barrel (1:8 twist, button rifled), 15"" Samson Evolution modular handguard/rail system with full-length top rail, extended-length tool-less adjustable gas system, and Colt's factory triple-port muzzle brake. All of these features make this rifle fast and extremely accurate. You can fine tune the gas system to your loads and virtually eliminate recoil and muzzle rise. I have also added:

-BCM Gunfighter MOD3 Charging Handle ($50)
-Magpul BAD Lever ($30)
-Magpul RSA Sling Adapter ($30)
-Noveske QD Sling Mount End Plate (perfect with the MS3/MS4 sling) ($30)

Serial number dates it to 1978 Model 66  no - dash NOT a 686. This would be the first or original or the 66 series with no modification.

I pick this up in a purchase of a entire collection.  The man stated he had it for years and never fired it. He collected nickel and stainless Smiths just for the beauty of them and also claimed to have worked for S&W until the early 90's when he retired. 

He said he added the grips around 2000 just to change the look a bit. He claimed he put the wood grips in the box and was unable to locate it. So obviously I do not have the original grips or the box and papers but he said he would call me when he found them. If I did I would be asking more and it would be listed on gunbroker.

Has it been fired before? I really cant say for sure not I have no reason to doubt him. There is no drag lines on the cylinder, bore is perfect with no build up or traces of lead, copper or powder residue. Also there is zero power charge marks at the area between the upper portion of the frame and barrel where it meets with the cylinder.

They've started doing steel shoots near him so he pulled his revolver out of the safe, only to find that the Tasco wasn't quite big enough for his eyes anymore. We went shooting last weekend and got him sighted in with a new red dot, and he gave me this one.

Here's the trouble - he took the battery (batteries?) out so they wouldn't corrode, and I can't figure out what is supposed to go in there. I called Tasco and they told me that all of their ProPoint sights take CR2032 lithium coin batteries - well, I'm no engineer but there isn't any way one of those will fit in there.

I tried all kinds of little batteries and the closest I could get was a pair of Energizer 76 batteries out of a Christmas ornament - it lit up very briefly and then went out again, I'm guessing because the batteries were weak? Maybe it takes lithium batteries instead? I don't know, but it's not doing anything for me at this point.  I'm thinking $40 OBO"

uses uzi mags
Deciding to sell or trade my 9mm AR rifle. just finished a sbr setup so now i can replace this one. 
THIS IS A CUSTOM BUILD. I cannot tell you where all the parts came from. i can tell you it WORKS! i do know know the lower is a superior arms lower and i have pinned the spikes tactical mag block adapter with 3 small pins all the way thru the lower. this way the block is correctly positioned and will not move. anyone who knows 9mm conversions understands this is where most failure to feed/function problems come from. i think the upper /barrel is a spikes 9mm.  this one is built right. and i have fired over 1000 rds just to make it right. various magpull accesories. cmmg revolution free float small profile rail with attachable sections. might include millet red dot. spikes tungstein buffer, heavy spring. extra stroke for rifle cartrige length shortened with delrin plug. 
i can answer any other questions.
rifle has some wear and has been used. a super fun fast light carbine 
have about 6 or 8 mags. 1 colt 20 rd. 2 cmmg 30 rd. 4 or so converted uzi mags.
uzi mag speed loader.
bulldog case.
let me know what you have to trade. i know what time and money was put into this build i will not respond to unreasonable offers. thanks!

Throughout the world today, Colt's reliability, performance, and accuracy provide the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt's LE6920 Carbine shares many features of its combat-proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this carbine is its 16.1"" chrome-lined barrel. With a 1 in 7"" twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited, including the heavier bullets preferred for stopping power and long range. This rifle has an A2 style pistol grip and 4 position adjustable stock. It has a ""F"" marked front sight gas block and an adjustable, removable rear sight.

The SOCOM model offers several operational upgrades over the already competent 6920. It features a heavier profile barrel for more accurate shooting, and cooler operation under sustained fire. A quad rail hanguard is fitted for easy installation of tactical lights, lasers, and bipods. The ambidextrous safety makes operation for anyone.

This is a brand new, never fired rifle, but does appear to have some minor quality control issues from the factory. There are several scuffs on the handguard, though they are purely cosmetic and will not affect functionality. There is a scratch from when the heat shield was riveted to the handguard. Rail covers are included.

I really love this gun but I just don't get around to shooting it as much as I thought I would. The poor thing just sits in my closet so I would rather see someone else have some fun with her. I bought it preowned from a local shop and was told it was sold to them by an older gentleman who had dreams of competing in Cowboy competitions but never got around to it. Was told the owner only used it a dozen or so times times and never competed. I personally put about 400 rounds downrange with the gun. Gun is in pristine condition and shoots like a dream. Gun is heavy and extremely well built. Looks and feels like the real deal 1866 and loaded with brass. This model is a .38 Special cal specific gun as marked on the barrel.

Additional info / specs.
Windham Weapons MPC Ar15 M4.  Windham Weaponry tests each 158 carpenter steel bolt. For a stronger and heavier bolt, Windham Weaponry chrome-lines the bolt carrier and adds a MIL-SPEC M16 contour. The barrel is a 4150 chrome moly vanadium steel, chrome-lined barrel with bayonet lug, detachable carry handle, M203 barrel mount cut out, A2 flash suppressor and six-position collapsible stock. A4 dual aperture adjustable rear sight and adjustable square post with A2 standard front sight. The carry handle is removable to reveal a Picatinny rail, so you may add any optic of your choice.

Not a Bushmaster!

Had to pick Bushmaster as the manufacturer (Windham Weapons)  was not in the drop down list.  In case you have not already heard, Richard Dyke, the previous owner of Bushmaster started Windham Weaponry after Bushmaster sold out to Freedom Group. Though Dyke uses Bushmaster’s equipment, these are not Bushmaster clones. Dyke and all the Windham Weaponry employees are meticulous about building a rifle as close to MIL-SPEC as they can. Their attention to detail from the internal to the external parts of the MPC M4 prove they care about producing a top-quality, dependable gun. With over 20 years of experience building AR-15s—these guys clearly know what they are doing!

The result of over four years of research and engineering, the 24/7 PRO™ offers a combination of features and enhancements unparalleled in modern handguns. The exclusive Taurus Single Action/Double Action trigger system delivers a level of speed and reliability no other handgun can match. Accuracy prevails thanks to a hand-mated frame, slide and barrel, all with matching serial numbers to assure a flawless fit, finish and functionality previously unheard of from an ""out of the box"" firearm. The 24/7 PRO also leads the industry in ergonomics, featuring Taurus' exclusive Ribber Grip® which provides a comfortable, customized feel for every user and every hand size (not available on .45 ACP). In addition, the 24/7 PRO has already set numerous world records in speed shooting competitions, winning high praise from top military, law enforcement and security professionals from around the world. Available in 9mm, .40 caliber and .45 ACP and three distinct barrel lengths, the 24/7 PRO is the duty-use sidearm of the future - and the next pistol that should be at your side.
