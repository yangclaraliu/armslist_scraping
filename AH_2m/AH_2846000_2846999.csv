The pistol features a coated black slide over a stainless receiver and it has U.S. Signature grips. The pistol has the aforementioned compensator and rear sight and also oversize takedown lever and safety lever. The pistol comes with the original Springfield Armory plastic box, serial-numbered to the gun, but no extra magazines. - overall condition is about 98%.

This is the russian ammo, and I will be honest, I dont believe in this ""ammo ban"" bs. The reason prices are high and ammo is in short supply because of all these people buying into these fake stories the ammo companies have fringe news groups release and cause the panic by running to buy everything.
This ammo is not going anywhere.

Why would I say that? Doesnt that hurt me trying to sell this?
Not at all.. thanks to these sheep panic buying, you cant find this ammo anywhere. Its $11 a box at walmart but no walmart within an hour of raleigh has it. I know because I spent hours driving around looking for it and I finally broke down and purchased 1000rd online.

This is 600rd, I paid $15 a box shipped online for this stuff..
I am asking that exact amount of 15a box. Why should you pay this? Because its not available at walmart or online and the local gun stores are asking 18 a box screwing people.

12 boxes of 50rd for a total of 600.
$180 is my price and is firm. I am willing to split the ammo into 300rd but charge $5 more total for the annoyance.

Rifle has a low round count and is in excellent condition. The 6.8 round can fit into regular ar mags but due to it being a wider round it can only fit around 15 before the mag starts to bulge. The spc was developed by the military for special forces who needed more knock down power than a 5.56 but less than a 7.62. The round is excellent and the only down fall of it is that it's only been around for 10 years so the rounds aren't as cheap as a 5.56 but then again it's in mine and most others opinion a much better round! If u have any questions about it just let me know and I'll try to answer them the best I can?

Just today the extractor stopped working. It is still covered by the Mossberg 2 year warranty and I am planning on sending it back to Mossberg to have it fixed. I do plan on purchasing a Benelli M2 so am considering just not going through the hassle of sending it in. It has operated flawlessly up to this point and absolutely love this shotgun just something weird happened to the extractor. Everything else is fine and the outer finish is in good condition. Put around 700 shells through and all target loads.

If you are interested in getting a cheaper 930 and just sending it into Mossberg yourself than let me know. 

I would sell this used for $600 but because of the extractor I will let it go for $500. I am not desperate to sell and if it doesn't I will gladly send it back into Mossberg. That being said, it will not be available long."

I have some used USGI M9, 92, 92fs, 92f, C92, etc mags for sale or trade. These are GI 15 round mags and not the 10 round mags you can find everywhere.These are issued mags and show very obvious signs of usage and wear. I took these to the range and put a good amount of rounds through them all and had no issues with the mags. The contractor for these specifics mags is ""Check-Mate"" and all have the date stamp of 04. These worked great and actually still have the desert tan paint on the bottom of the mag-plate. Im asking $16 per mag which is way less than what ive seen them go for at shows below average of what i have found them ""in stock"" online.

This would be a great stock for field or casual use, even tougher than the original because the expert refinishing it put in brass pins as reinforcement of areas - notably in the selector cutout area - where cracks were known to be likely. These pins are hardly visible when the stock is on the rifle. Ask any stock refinisher: Brass pins make the stock stronger than it was, before!"

Nothing is more irritating than some guy that thinks his used 10-22 or gen 2 glock is worth $10 less than what he paid for it. At least a pawn shop or dealer have to keep their prices close to reasonable  and their customer service up or they go out of business. My suggestion is that the folks who host the Armslist put a reasonable restriction of the dealer postings. We, as consumers, should continue to flag the dealer listings that are not properly noted and exercise our consumer powers by not shopping anywhere that breaks the rules. Remember WE hold the money. If we don't spend it, they go out of business."

1941 Izhevsk 91/30 Mosin Nagant rifle, chambered in 7.62x54R. It was my first firearm and I put a lot of careful love and attention into it. It has been stripped, sanded, refinished and given a triple polyurethane coat. In addition, I had a brass stacker low eye strain scope mount attached. Currently it has a 4x AIM scope sighted in to 50 yards. The rifle has been well maintained, cleaned immediately after every use and the rifling is in great shape. No fouling or pitting is present. The rifle came with a bayonet, a sling, a cleaning kit and 2 clip pouches. I cleaned out the pouches, stained them a darker brown, and treated them. This makes them match and makes the tough leather much softer and easier to work.
1085 Rounds of surplus 7.62x54R ammo. Comes packed in paper wrapped quantities of 20. 100 rounds are Bulgarian made, while the rest is Russian. Mid 70's-80's production. These are the light steel ball ammo with corrosive primers, 147 gr. It will come in a wood crate with a coveted can opener if you decide to obtain more ammo later on. Finally, I have 125 rounds on stripper clips, not the cruddy new production clips but original Russian clips that work very well. 
I am not looking to ship, sorry. The rifle is large, the ammo is heavy, and it would be unfeasible. Thank you for looking"

The action is still intact and working. It also has the original pushrod on it. This particular rifle originally had a nearly full length stock. At some point long ago, the stock was either shortened or replaced with a shorter one. Whoever did it did a very good job and it looks as if it belongs on the rifle. If not for this fact the gun would be worth considerably more. I got several estimates from experts as to the worth of this gun. They said it was worth 600-700 dollars.

The gun is in pretty good overall shape.  It was manufactured in 1941 and is the G model.  It is a takedown rifle with checkering on the stock.  The metal on the gun is in really good shape with a bit of blueing wear on the bottom of the reciever small imperfections in the barrel blueing.  However, the inside of the barrel is in very good shape with no rust or pitting and strong rifleing.  The metal is in better shape than most of these I have seen.  The lever still has the case hardening on it.  It has weaver side flip scope mounts and a Tasco Woodland scope on it.  The Stock had a slip on butt pad on it for a long time and it left a mark on the wood.  There is also small bits of rubber still on it.  The forestop is very nice and the number on it matches the number on the rifle.  The rifle functions flawlessly.  I have put 40 rounds through it since I got it and the gun is accurate and handles very nicely.  This would make a fantastic hunting gun for someone.  The 300 savage cartridge has plenty of power for big game hunting with very little recoil.  Ammo is available in town at bass pro shop or online.
