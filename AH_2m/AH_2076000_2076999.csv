It is an all original, complete, numbers matching real sword. Not a replica. I've been collecting over 10 years and letting go of some things. 

This type 95 was made between late 1938 up to mid 1941. Late 1938 they changed the tsuba or guard to the 9mm thick brass from the 11mm thick brass of the first issue. And then in mid 1941 they changed the guard to the black iron style. 

Has the aluminium tsuka or handle. These are machine made blades, not handmade and signed on tang. Has matching serial number on blade and scabbard throat. 

The Blade was made by the Nagoya arsenal. Two arsenals made the blades, a third kokura did not make any but was a supervising arsenal of the type 95 project and their mark will be found at times along with the nagoya or tokyo first arsenal. This blade and sword were made by nagoya and you can tell on them by when you read the serial number. when you read the number the cutting edge of blade is facing up and it faces down as you read number on the tokyo first blades. 

The Fuchi Stampings, the piece right under the guard is stamped with three symbols, Gifu, Nagoya and Kokura. Gifu is the corporate logo of the group within the arsenal, there were six of these altogether. This one is Gifu, Second is the Nagoya Arsenal stamping and third the Kokura arsenal stamping which sometimes accompanies. 

The blood fuller is full length and the tip is correct, scabbard is correct and the blade is in good shape. few small dark spots but overall nice shape. 

I know what they sell for, if you can get them for 200 at your local gun show then I would advise you to just go buy it there or buy it for 200 and sell it to me for 400. Double your money. I will not ship either. Face to face. I will meet in wisconsin rapids or stevens point, tomah, or mauston

Estimates are that there were a total of 1000-2000 FBI pistols that were able to make it to the civilian market.  I have been unable to find an estimate of how many of the 50-200 testing and evaluation guns made it to the civilian market.  When was the last time you saw one of these for sale.  

Since I now have two of these confirmed testing and evaluation unit FBI 1076’s and still don’t have a 1046, I am looking at selling my second FBI 1076 to build some funds for a 1046.  I would not be selling this if I had a 1046, but being that I don’t, I am willing to sacrifice it.  I am looking to get $2200 shipped for it, but may take a partial trade for other 10mm's or S&W 3rd gen gun.    

I am posting a couple of pictures, but if you want more, let me know.  I took quite a few of it.  The gun has some scuffs on the top and the left side, but the right side is just about perfect.  There is no box or paperwork with the gun.

You must be over 21 to own a Silencer. The NFA requires a one time per item *** $200.00 *** tax stamp on each Silencer, Short Barrel Rifle (SBR), .. basically any Class III item. The $200.00 Check or Money order is sent directly to the ATF with your Silencer paperwork. I handle all the paperwork for you. You just hand me the check to send in with the paperwork. Or if your not local I can send paperwork to you by mail. You only need sign a few spots in front of Notary and Drop in the mail with the $200 check made out to the ATF. To start paper work you pay for the Silencer and the Serial# that goes on the paperwork becomes yours. We can handle everything through the mail except the actual pickup of the Silencer. You will have to come to the shop or meet us at a gun show to take delivery after it clears the ATF.
So if the Silencer is $479.00 plus .06% county tax = $507.74.. you gotta pay an additional $200 directly to the ATF for the TAX stamp. So total out of pocket would be $707.74. :) Average wait for paperwork to clear the ATF is 6 to 9 months."

After doing a little research have narrowed down rifle to have been manufactured sometime between 1954 and 1956. This is confirmed by Serial number on rifle 19617 which can be seen in pic supplied.
 Rifle cosmetically is fair to good condition which considering it is 58 years old. Gun cycles and functions perfectly! I would give Rifle based on Blue Book a honest 80% to 85% due to freckling of bluing. Function of rifle is great which simply means take her hunting. Nice GUN to add to collection to have a rifle that is this rare yet you can take hunting. Wood in good shape by the way, 85% TO 90%. 
 I have recently taken to range and at 100 yards first time I had ever shot gun put 2 out of 4 rounds in 4"" bulls-eye. Other 2 were half inch left and quarter inch lower left of bulls-eye. Brought gun home and gave it a hour worth of TLC and put her up.
Rifle has a nice Tasco Scope which is mounted where Iron Sites still available for use if desired.  
Prefer to sell outright but might consider a trade depending on what you have.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72  bbl) from CZ to
feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the
NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913
accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion
resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the
family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. The SP-01 utilizes
an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing
for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key
areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by
the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous
models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The
SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ
75  SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on
terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling
characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of
sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit
include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place
respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Great hunting rifle, super accurate. It shoots sub moa groups.. Has taken several deer, an antelope and dozens of coyotes. It has a few cosmetic dings and scratches in the stock but the bore is in great shape. Smooth action. I have used this gun exclusively for hunting so ive only shot about 60 rounds through it including sighting it in. I really dont want to sell it but my wife is making me sell off a few guns to pay for a plumbing issue we have. Call or text me anytime.

It pains me to let it go but I have no choice. Its a 1911 style 10mm and being a Colt its basically top of the line. No major scratches only some slight holster wear. It has the solid trigger and military style hammer. Both sides of the black handle have the Delta symbol as does one of the three clips (the others have the Colt logo). Eight shot clips, very safe to carry with one in the chamber. Comes with a forward tilted (I believe its called FBI canter style) Tagua leather right handed holster, a right handed fobus holster a bianchi dual clip (single stack only) holster, a leg strapped thigh holster and a two gun shoulder holster that also holds two clips. Also with it are cleaning supplies includng a special dry lubricant for stainless guns, a couple tactical knives, and a brand new range bag for storage and transport. Ammo is included and is 100 wadcutter rounds (twenty of which are Buffalo Bore's) and 250 hollow points. Most are winchester silvertip, hornady's, and midway's but there's a handful or federal personal defense with a central pin and even a couple of the old original winchester black talons! Now I know you can get the newer delta's for about $850 (not stainless but black or blued...sorry but I'm color blind!) However being that mine is the older version and stainless it raises the value. I hope whoever buys this realizes what an amazing piece of machinery it is, its highly accurate (I avarage 3"" groups at about 50ft.), beautifully simplistic and in my opinion one of the best handguns one can own. Whether its for concealed carrying, home defense or just a beautiful addition to a collector's shelf. Cash or moneygram. Only way I will take a check is if I go to the bank and it gets cashed before the transfer. No paypal, no credit cards and no trades. The price is negotiable within reason but please keep in mind these range from $850 up to $1400 depending on the finish and year made, if you're gonna offer half don't bother...its a waste of both our time. I don't expect this item to stay listed very long as.   these particular models are fairly difficult to find."

It is currently my favorite pistol to shoot, but i plan on getting into competition so i'd like to sell it and go with one of the long slide models. First off, it is the Flat Dark Earth model. This color was only made in limited runs and is highly desirable. The Glock 19 is considered the quintessential Glock as it is able to perform many tasks. It's perfect for concealed carry, home defense, or even just a fun day at the range.
I'v taken my pistol a leap forward with quite a few upgrades.

33 Rd Extended Magazine $40.00
Extra 15 Rd Magazine $20.00
Trigger Bar and internals Polished by my local gunsmith

It would cost $600 after taxes to buy this gun in a shop, plus i have over $350 worth of upgrades on it, making it around a $1000 gun. My asking price is $500 dollars. I have priced this gun to sell.

Now, about the condition of the pistol. It is a little over a year old. All of the upgrades are only about a month old. I honestly couldn't find a single scratch on the reciever or the slide of this gun. It really looks to be in perfect condition. I would like to note there are 2 small wear marks on the upgraded barrel.  Also, i will include the stock barrel, guide rod, and all of the original stock parts that were originally on the gun. I have the case and everything that came with the gun when purchased. I have 3 15 Rd Magazines for the gun, and 1 33 Rd Extended Magazine (the happy stick ;)).

The accuracy of this gun is phenomenol. I can shoot a 1.5 Inch group of the 10 at 15 yards, and a 3 inch group of 10 at 25 yards, and i'm certainly not the best shot out there. This Glock 19 exhibits perfect ejection patterns, EVERY TIME. I have never experienced one BTF issue with this like i have with some other Glocks out there. Gen 3 Glocks have been known to be more reliable. This gun is not only aesthetically pleasing, but mechanically sound. I know that who ever happens to buy this gun will be one happy camper.

I am sad to be selling, but living where I do and with my schedule I am embarrassed to say that I have literally never made it to the range. I went shooting with a buddy and loved it, then having some money to spare at the time I bought it in a rush of blood and wanted to get into shooting. Now months later I haven't even put a single round through this gun.

The gun features the Savage Accustock and Accutrigger, as well as a fluted barrel and muzzle break. You can see product description and pictures here: http://www.savagearms.com/firearms/model/10FCPK/

The only slight blemish on the gun is in storage a little section of the recoil pad came off. You can see from the pictures that this will not affect performance at all and can be replaced in minutes with a new pad.

I would prefer to sell the rifle alone for $700, but if you want the scope also I will throw in the whole setup with rail, rings and scope for another $300. 

The scope is from Millet and based on many customer reviews is one of the best scopes you can possibly get for the $400-$500 range. Attached with picatinny rail and Millet 30mm tactical rings.

Some features are:

- Tactical riflescope with 4-16x magnification and 50-Millimeter objective lens
- Mil-dot bar reticle with thin line, dot, and adjustable green illumination
- Reticule excels in varied lighting conditions to ensure pinpoint accuracy
- Multicoated optics produce bright, crisp image, 3.5-Inch of eye relief
- 0.1-Millimeter click adjustments, 30-Millimeter tube diameter, matte black finish

I also have a plastic case that I will throw in to transport the gun if you need it.

 Mine is not an 800$ piece. No box or papers and it's been shot some, but value is what it's worth to YOU. I value it between 500-600 dollars.
