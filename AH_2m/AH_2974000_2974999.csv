I know Smith did re-run these as a replacement but they didn't have the same marking as the originally issued ones. This one, please see the pics, is an original issue that came with the gun new, NOT a re-run. I have not used it, played wit it or anything it just been sitting in my safe. It may have had shell or two loaded in it from the original owner it does look like that is possible but I can't be sure either way but clearly hasn't seen any use in my opinion. I purchased from the original owner that lost the gun in the divorce and kept the magazine until I talked him out of it, with the firm understanding that she was not to get it, haha.

I've tried to find a value on it all over the web but they're just aren't any available from what I can find.

I'm told they will work in the 645 & 4506 but its not recommended because of the multi-latch slot catch that they use, I know 645 & 4506 magazines don't latch in the M945.

The stock looking thing is Sig Sauer's ""arm brace"". Designed to turn the average shooting hobbist into mega man. And yes, it IS legal to shoulder fire it. ATF released a statement saying so. It's legal to shoulder fire any pistol, just stupid for most.

+Sig Sauer ""arm brace"" and pistol buffer tube
+Red X Tactical upper

This gun is in like new condition and does not appear to have been fired since leaving H&K.
The 1989 Import Ban, enacted by President George H. W. Bush, bans from importation all semi-automatic rifles with a folding or telescoping stock, separate pistol grip, bipod, ability to accept a bayonet, grenade launcher, night sights, or flash suppressor. The HK 91, 93 and 94 models were all on the import ban list.  At the time of the ban, about 130 or so HK91s had already been delivered to the U.S. but had not yet cleared customs. H&K complied with the ban by renaming those HK91s as HK911 (basically stamping another ""1"" after the name) and adding a Bell-Carlson thumbhole stock. H&K was also required to put a spot weld over the end cap detent because the ATF considered the hole to be a bayonet lug. This prevented addition of the bayonet. The HK911 did have the standard HK91 threaded barrel but this was covered by a pinned thread hider/cover.
The HK911 eventually turned into the SR9 in 1990 which had the new 20-inch polygonal barrel. The first SR9s imported had wood grain stocks. The SR9 was also referred to as the ""Orion."" Soon, H&K switched to black stocks. Right after the black stock guns were brought in, H&K also included a standard 91 stock set along with the SR9 thumbhole mounted stock set.
HK SR9T Receiver.
Then the “T” and “TC” models got in, even though they had pistol grips. They got exempted as they were then thought of as target rifles of the currently allowed SR9 series. President Bill Clinton pulled the plug on the importation of all HK SR9s on April 6, 1998 because they could accept a standard capacity magazine.
There were a total of 125 TC’s. Initially 25 were made in response to requests for an SR9T with the PSG1 buttstock. H&K did not have these in their catalog. The next year, HK added the SR9TC to their catalog and imported 100 guns. They were marked ""TC"" in Virginia as were the SR9T’s. In 1989 the BATF had not determined what was considered acceptable as to what grips were fitted to the rifles by H&K USA the new rules were not set to be ""in-force"" until November 1990. For years, it was acceptable to reconfigure standard SR9 rifles to a T or TC configuration. T and TC rifles were probably not imported in that configuration and that is why the receivers are hand stamped and not finished. The stamping was done at H&K USA.

We believe that this indeed a fine example of a SR9TC; although there is no further documentation with the rifle.  This gun is in like new condition and does not appear to have been fired since leaving H&K.  You will not find a cleaner example from the SR9 TC series of rifles.  There have not been any imported since 1998.
This gun is also for sale in the store.  Please contact us for more information.

Serial number of 5834111 which is documented in Bruce Canfield’s excellent book title “The M1 Garand Rifle” as a National Match Rifle alo3ng with 1979 club gun document showing it on loan from the DCM. This one ended up being sold to the WEAN Gun Club in October of 1982. This is an all correct Type II national match with the following features:

2-52 SA marked barrel that is also T proofed (for targeted), NM marked twice and star marked. ME a of 1+ with TE of 1.5 with beautiful shiny bore.

NM marked series 77 SA marked Op Rod

Correct BME NM marked windage knob with hooded aperture sight marked NM/2 on sight baseand correct marked NM marked front sight marked .062

65 SA series bolt

Gas cylinder has small NM mark on bottom

mixed trigger group including 55 SA series hammer and unmarked safety. Floor of trigger guard is numbered and matches rifle

Glass bedded stock with proper P proof and Springfield DoD stamp and this is also numbered to the gun. The stock has very few minor bumps and looks to have been lighted sanded and possibly coated with a light oil...more than likely done by the gun club or new owner after released from the DCM. Like every NM I’ve handled the stock has zero wiggle in the handguards and fits very tight to the receiver.

This is an excellent example of a documented Type II National Match rifle specific to the 1962 Springfield Armory specs. Considered some of the finest and most accurate government arsenal competition quality M1’s rifles every made as each part was hand selected for fit and each barrel tested for accuracy. After discontinuing sales in 1973 many of these were taken apart when on loan to Greece so there are not many originals left. If you want the pinnacle of M1 garand manufacture the National Match is the rifle for you. Offered with NO RESERVE!"

This add is a little different than most, but here’s the story:   My church is in the process of building a new building and we’re doing it debt free.  Anyway it is coming close to being at a standstill because of lack of funds and I want to raise a large amount of money in order to help with this project.  I am hoping to ”trade up” until I reach around $300,000.00.  I know that sounds crazy but I've heard of it being done and I thought it would be worth a try.  So with that, here’s what I am starting the trading game with:
I have a generation 4 Glock 17 that, as far as I know, has never been shot.  I think it was fixed up for shooting competitions because it has a Travis Haley Skimmer trigger on it.  That trigger alone sells for $160.  It comes with the original trigger, three 17 round mags, four snap on back grip pieces, and the original hard case.  The original owner, who I bought it from, did some modifying to front grip.  I think he did this to make it feel more like a 1911.  I am wanting to trade up to something of greater value.  That’s the only way I’d let this one go.  I will only trade to someone who can legally own and responsibly use it.  If you would like some more info you can contact me at REDACTED.  Thanks and have a great day!"

The M&P 45 is an adjustable ergonomic polymer gun that is more comfortable to many than the Glock or XD. I won't debate merits vs de-merits, so if you like this type and feel, this is a good one.

Took this on a trade, and decided I shoot my 1911s in that caliber, so it doesn't get used. No factory barrel, but the replacement Storm Lake is nicer, more expensive, and allows screw-on compensators or a suppressor if you are NFA inclined. The sights are extremely bright. I believe S&W uses Metrolights which appear brighter than my brand new Trijicon H3's. Excellent for a sight picture in the dark.

I'm interested in selling outright, trading even swap, partial trade - up or down. If you have something interesting I'll hear you out.

I'm expecting a used gun price. This weapon goes for $600 @ Bud's when in stock, the factory barrel sells on eBay for around $50, but I'll assume it's a $100 loss. The mags run about $50 each (x3), and the Storm Lake barrel is around $200.

600+200+150=950... - 100 = 850 retail. Times 70% value for being used... comes to $600. So I'll assume $600 is around fair. I'll entertain offers of up or down - just don't tell me your trade is ""worth _____"" if you can't actually sell it for that. You be reasonable, I'll be reasonable."

The forged lower is built with our 6 position Mil-spec size buffer tube and stock, Standard PSA lower parts kit with ALG Defense ACT trigger group, A2 pistol grip and aluminum trigger guard.   It comes with one 30 Round D&H Magazine.

Barrel:  16"" chrome-lined mil-spec chrome moly vanadium barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   M4 style profile is phosphate coated to mil-specs, and is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability.   Barrel is finished off with a standard carbine hand guard, pinned f-marked front sight post, and A2 flash hider. Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail. Bolt: Bolt is made of Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, and MPI. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside, chrome lined inside.

Lower:  These forged lowers are quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and are marked ""MULTI"" for caliber.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.

Standard carbine buffer is Black anodized and has the PSA logo on the face.   The ALG Defense ALG Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.

Also, if youre interested and if the deal is right, I have the lee reloading kit for 7.62x25 that I wont need after I sell the gun.

The price is set high cause I hate to see the gun go. If you have ANY offer let me know and I'll consider it.

I also have two other guns that i can use to bargain with if I need to, so let me know what you got.

Contact me on here or text/call me at REDACTED if you have any questions."

Gun is obviously used, but shoots great. I have had this gun for over 10 years, carried it some but mainly been a night stand gun. The sights are Novack (I believe) night sights, but they are dead. This gun is extremely accurate. Included in this auction is 7 HK factory hi-cap mags, 100 factory loaded lead heads, and the box. It is currently set up as a variant 3 (right hand decock only, no safety), however if you want I can switch it back to variant 1 (right hand safety/decock), your choice. I am not really looking for trades, but will consider offers however the trade will have to be $800+ and I am not paying anything. I will meet north to Wapakoneta and south to Piqua. My break down is this: the gun and 3 mags $600,  4 extra mags at $40 each $160,  and the 100 rounds at $30. My cash price is $750 firm, and that is firm. All laws/rules apply, CCP holders and LE have first priority, you will sign a bill of sale, I will give you a receipt."

The SAM7K PISTOL

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Having a money crisis this month with taxes and I am willing to take a loss on it if it sells before the 1st of May.

This gun is amazing. The fit and finish is excellent and the design is pure Beretta awesomeness. It came in an expensive plastic case with padding and the gun's logo on both sides. Beretta quality is second to none, I trust my life on a 92A1 every time I carry it. 

 It comes with everything shown in the pictures. 20 round magazine, lock, case and I didn't even take any tags off of it. Included is 1100 rounds of Federal .22LR. I understand .22LR is impossible to find right now so it made sense to include a significant amount of ammo from my supply so that you can enjoy this gun. My two remaining .22LR guns don't see much action anymore anyways. Price is very firm at $400 and I will not sell the ammo without the gun.  Private sale FTF only no tax and no shipping/paperwork. It has NOT been fired it is brand new.

 I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one. I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying. Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five. If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

The frame and slide are sound and decided to put a few bucks in it and glad I did . It has turned out to be an excellent shooter . Any one who has ever had a GOOD one (Just like Cars or anything else , you get good ones and you get bad ones ) of these they don't deserve the bad rap they get . This piece still has many many years of life left , and any thing that might go wrong can be repaired using Wison or Colt parts .  Contrary to believe the parts will fit . It just takes some fitting by a compedent individual . And some parts are still availible thru Numrich Gun Parts .

I'm the second owner of this upper. first owner built, test fired 30 rounds and sold to me. I've put only a few boxes of subs thru it. I'll say 100 rounds, but its less than that for sure.
