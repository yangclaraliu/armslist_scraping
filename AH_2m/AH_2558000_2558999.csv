There is a way to flag a post as overpriced. I assume once a certain threshold is met then the post is removed and the seller is notified.

105,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2558105,For Sale:  Would like to find someone who reloads 7.7 Jap ammo!,"Bellingham, Washington, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Saturday, January 18, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 80 rounds of 7.7 Jap ammunition made by Privi Partisan but distributed by Graf & Sons. For those that know about it, there is a universal recall of this ammo from Graf & Sons over issues of inconsistent ignition with these rounds. They did not directly say so but from reading other forums online, I think that the powder that was used to fill these cartridges were damp at their facility causing powder clumping and squibs upon firing. Some Arisaka shooters were even saying that the projectile was getting stuck in the barrel because of the bad powder that failed to burn.

I'm eligible to recieve a refund if I return all my ammo (80 rounds) but as you know, 7.7 Jap ammo is not easy to acquire and Graf had stated that they were unable to just swap my bad ammo for good because they halted production indefinitely. My casings, bullets and primers are good...I figure I could pay to have them all reloaded with good powder.

I will pay accordingly and I live in Bellingham.

The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648-50 ACOG® reticle features a red chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the .50BMG round out to 1800 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG® line, the new ACOG® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 500 feet.

DESCRIPTION:
Federal's Premium Law Enforcement HST line of JHP duty ammunition offers massive expansion! This duty load has a pre-skived bullet tip which causes the bullet to expand into large petals that cause a large permanent wound cavity. The unique design of this bullet actually forces the lead petals during expansion to protect the copper petals behind them. This results in increased weight retention allowing it to still achieve deep penetration through a variety of barriers prescribed by the FBI test protocols."

I like to build them as a hobby, and I can get you that beautiful custom look you've been wanting for your mantelpiece. I build a variety of old styles, anything from a Tennessee Fowler, Hawkens, Trade Guns, Muskets, Kentucky and Pennsylvania rifles, to ornate wall hangers with complete inlay and custom looks and designs. I'm cheap not because I turn shoddy craftsmanship, but because its a hobby I love doing.
I also do trades so if you got a gun or two you'd be willing to trade, haggle with me, lets see if we can't make a deal.
 I also can give you the most affordable deal ($600-$800 range) on the market for one of these guns. Like I said; it's a hobby I love doing.

I've built for high end knife dealers and a custom Jezail Arabic rifle for the film Beyond the Mask, coming out in Spring 2014 (pictured below in the films poster).

I also make all my own patch knives, powder horns, and possibles bags BY HAND to sweeten a deal in some cases. 

Email me, or call me up at 81O-922-545O, I'd be happy to meet you for a cup of coffee and talk guns. Perhaps we can get you some concept art drawn up. If I don't answer, leave me a message and I promise I will get back with you.

From NC Gunowners' Review:
...This past weekend, I took it to the range with a person who is really averse to recoil. She and I had a blast shooting 45 Colt out of the Circuit Judge. She wasn't so happy with the 410. It was noticeably more recoil, and noise.

The Circuit Judge was extremely accurate. I wouldn't say this was anywhere near minute of angle accurate, but I did shoot two 5 round groups at 25 yards where all 5 holes touched, standing, with stock sights and two eyes that aren't nearly as good as they once were. The 45 colt makes a big hole in a target, so they were probably 1 1/2 inch groups. This isn't military-sniper accurate, but considering the enormous jump the lead has to make before arriving at the barrel, see pic I was thrilled at the results. It has excellent sights, (see pic) and a high comb that meets the cheek perfectly. Those combined with the generous recoil pad make it a real joy to shoot, and amazingly accurate, for a short barreled revolver-based carbine. I think it is very well made. the quality of the stock, forearm, and sights is really great. I think those things are much higher quality than what I paid for. 

From the American Rifleman 5/22/2012  By B. Gil Horman (RSS):
Taurus International has been enjoying robust sales of its multi-caliber revolvers, including the .45 Colt/.410 Judge and the 992 Tracker .22 LR/.22 Mag. with interchangeable cylinders. Working in conjunction with its sister company, Rossi Firearms, the two Brazilian gunmakers have combined these popular Taurus revolver actions with Rossi’s shoulder stocks and rifle-length barrels to produce the Rossi Circuit Judge. This revival of the old revolver carbine provides an unusual twist in that these guns can chamber more than one caliber of ammunition. 
Once revolvers arrived on the shooting scene, revolver-action rifles were not far behind. 
The first repeating rifle adopted by the U.S. military for combat was the blackpowder Colt 1855. Available in both rifle and carbine configurations, this revolving long gun exhibited two problems that have been resolved in their modern Rossi counterparts. First, the paper cartridges used to load blackpowder into the 1855 could tear and leak into the mechanism of the carbine. This loose powder could ignite when the gun was fired causing all of the chambers of the gun to go off at once. This event, known as a chainfire, caused the gun to blow apart. Modern smokeless powder pistol cartridges and shot shells eliminate this issue.

The second problem with early revolving carbines was the hot gas escaping sideways from the gap between the cylinder and the barrel. This is not much of a concern when firing a revolving handgun because both hands are behind the cylinder gap. Placing a support hand under the barrel of a revolving carbine, as you would with other long guns, resulted in nasty burns to the hand or arm of the shooter. The Rossi Circuit Judge design eliminates this problem with the installation of gas-deflector shields on the frame near the cylinder gap as well as a wedge-shaped flair to the forearm between the cylinder and where the shooter’s hand rests. These enhancements successfully work to protect the shooter.
Circuit Judge Features
Both the .45 Colt/.410 and .22 LR/.22 Mag. configurations share several features in common. The barrels are 18.5-inches long and topped with adjustable fiber-optic sights, and Weaver sight rails are installed to allow the use of optics. The safety features include a transfer-bar safety and a Taurus security key lock located in the hammer. The cylinders swing out to the left side of the gun like most modern double-action revolvers. The external hammer can be cocked for single-action firing or the trigger can be pulled to fire in double-action mode.
These two revolving-action guns differ from each other in interesting ways. The .45-caliber model fires pistol cartridges and .410 shot shells from a single cylinder. The stocks are hardwood with an unusual, but comfortable, pistol grip on the shoulder stock. The barrel is threaded to accept a toothed choke, called a straight-rifled choke by the manufacturer, for use with.410 shells. A smooth-bore thread protector sleeve is included for use when firing .45 Colt cartridges. Think of the straight-rifled choke as a full choke for use only with .410 shells and the thread protector-sleeve as a cylinder bore choke that can be safely used with .45 Colt or .410 loads, and all will go well.
The .22-caliber Circuit Judge tested for this review is called the Tuffy model because of its lightweight, weather-resistant synthetic stock. The shoulder stock contains a small removable panel in the butt pad that reveals a storage compartment for nine-rounds of spare ammunition. Either .22 Long Rifle or .22 Mag. can be stored in this space and a clear plastic window on the left side of the stock shows how many rounds are present.
This .22 rifle uses interchangeable cylinders to alternate between .22 Long Rifle and .22 Mag. cartridges. The synthetic forearm contains a release lever that allows it to slide forward on the barrel. With the forearm in the forward position, the cylinder is opened and a button on the right of the frame is pressed and held, allowing the cylinder and yoke to be removed from the frame. No tools are required. Just reverse the process to install the alternate cylinder and the gun is ready to fire.
Informal Shooting & Function Testing 
The informal testing for the Circuit Judge combo guns produced a lot of noise, gun smoke and perforated targets. This particular gun set called for a good deal more shooting than the average review. Having two guns to work with automatically doubles the round count. But one gun can fire four varieties of .22 Rimfire ammunition, including .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, and .22 Mag. The other one fires .45 Colt loads as well as 2 1/2- and 3-inch .410 shells of the birdshot, buckshot and slug variety.
The guns proved to be light and handy while firing standing shots. The fiber-optic sights were bright and easy to see. The triggers of both samples used in this review were smooth in double-action mode with a crisp, short let off in single-action mode. For those shooters who are familiar with double-action revolvers, firing a long gun with a double-action trigger feels great and it’s not a challenge to shoot accurately. However, it may take some getting used to for those who cut their teeth on bolt-, lever- or semi-automatic rifles. For new shooters, firing the Circuit Judge with the double-action trigger may prove more intuitive than learning to cycle the slide of a pump-action shotgun or the bolt of a bolt-action rifle. 
Both guns were fed from all of the varieties of ammunition I had on hand. The .22 Long Rifle cylinder was charged with .22 Shorts, inexpensive bulk-box rounds, .22 shot shells and premium hollow points, and a wide variety of bullet weights and brands were tested via the .22 Mag. cylinder. The .45 Colt/.410 tasted everything from low-recoil .45 Colt Cowboy loads up to potent standard-pressure self-defense and hunting loads. It should be noted that this gun is not rated for +P, +P+ or ""Magnum"" .45 Colt ammunition. The .410 shells ranged from light target-grade birdshot loads up to the hard hitting 3-inch Winchester PDX1 round that launches 410-grains of mixed defense discs and BB shot pellets. In short, there were no malfunctions, jams, failures to fire or ejection issues. The Rossi Circuit Judge guns proved to be reliable with a wide range of rounds....
The shot patterns produced by 2 1/2- and 3-inch .410 shells were checked from a self-defense distance of 7 yards using 12x18-inch Birchwood Casey Shoot N-C targets. The straight-rifled choke is designed to stop the spin of the shot wad produced by the barrel's rifling and to compress the shot load like a full choke would. With this choke installed, bird shot

Final Thoughts
It’s unusual to find long guns capable of chambering multiple calibers because of the challenges involved in making their actions mechanically reliable with a wide variety of ammunition. Although a revolving action in a long gun does have its limitations, reliability isn’t one of them. The Circuit Judge chambered for .45 Colt or .410 shot shells will comfortably fill any role appropriate for a .410 shotgun and it produces solid accuracy with .45 Colt loads for hunting medium-sized game at short ranges...  ...The Rossi Circuit Judge revolver-action carbines certainly do offer a unique shooting experience.

I completely understand this is obviously no Colt, Springfield, or Kimber, and naturally for that reason I do not expect to get $700 for it. HOWEVER, this pistol is reliable, accurate, and has great slide to frame, and barrel to slide fitment. There is no more play in this pistol than any of the other high end 1911.**
Now, as for the pistol, it has roughly 400 rounds down the tube and I've run about 4 different types of ammo with no FTF' s or FTE's, but the slide has slight wear from holster in and cycling. It has the black finish with gold/silver inlays. This model had 2 - dot Heine Novak style sights. Other features include skeltonized adjustable trigger, skeleton hammer, ambidextrous thumb safety, high rise beavertail, flat MSH that has 30-lpi checkering, same goes for the front checkering and u del the trigger gaurd. It also utilizes forward cooking serrations, full length guide rod, and a flared ejection port.
This pistol doesn't have the original case, but it does have just a universal case. Came with two Taurus mags, but I have two others totalling 3 8 Rd mags and one flush 7 Rd mag. Anything else you want to know, just ask!"

This gun comes straight from CZ Custom shop. Angus Hobdell himself has a hand in upgrading everything that comes out of there and he personally carries this exact model CZ. This gun is incredible and I hate to get rid of it, BUT it is a carry gun and I do not carry it. I prefer pocket pistols.
So with that said, I would like to trade this for another CZ Custom shop pistol perhaps? Something full sized for the range like a Shadow Custom? Or a combination of pistols? Going to be picky, so please don't offer junk.

Only 50 rounds have been fired, no malfunctions of any kind. Wouldn't be selling, as its probably one of the best in its class, but I'm thinning the herd. No wear marks or blemishes of any kind. Pistol is tennifer treated, so corrosion is not an issue. 

On the pistol is a Streamlight TLR-3 with box, paperwork and mounting hardware, and spare batteries. Its a must have for home defense, and its lightweight polymer body keeps the setup svelt. 115 lumens, ambi controls, and compact.

Also included is 200 rounds of fmj bullets and 25 rounds of Hornady FTX 115 HD ammo. With the price and availability of 9mm still kind of wonky, I figured I'd throw some in.

I know what my items are worth, so lowball offers will not be answered. 

Gun has factory box and manual. I will not separate items, so do not ask. All listed items will be sold together. Buyer must fill out bill of sale, have valid ID in hand. Local pickup within 10 miles, cash only. Text REDACTED for questions, do NOT email as I have limited email access and will not respond.

Great gun, but it's more of a collectors item in this condition and I don't want to carry this thing and constantly stress about marking it up. Extremely accurate and very little recoil.

Comes with a case, factory 10 round stainless mag, and 4 15 round mil spec mags. Can include ammo if traded for a different caliber handgun.

Century once again offers you rare examples of Sino-Soviet cooperation from a bygone era! The Type 53 is a copy of the famous Russian M44 carbine, and like its predecessor is chambered in 7.62x54R. Century Arms was able to locate a cache of these carbines where they have been conserved for decades just waiting to be re-issued. Needless to say, these won't be around forever. If you are a collector of Mosin Nagants, this is a fantastic opportunity to add a hard to find carbine to your collection."

I'm selling it because I have too many 9mm's and I don't have a purpose for keeping this gun. It shoots great. Comes with two mags. I have a third mag that has never been used for $40 extra if you want it. All mags have 16 rd capacity.

Prefer face to face. If out of state, please keep in mind your local laws, the cost your ffl will charge, and the cost of my ffl (last I checked it was $35 for mine). So, cost will be the cost of the gun plus my ffl's fee.

The rifle is very nice. It has a nice piece of wood, engraved receiver, floorplate and scope rings. It has been hunted with, so it has the normal handling marks and the here and there scratches. It is topped with an older (good and tough as nails) Weaver 2-7 scope. I put 6 rounds through it the weekend after purchase and shot two groups of 3 that both measured in right at 1 inch. 

You are welcome to make offers of gun related trades and you can make a cash offer if you'd like to purchase instead of trade. I can add or accept cash to make up trade differences. I don't need money, so please don't lowball me. I can be an asshole, too. :)

The bronze colored factory grease is visible in some pics. It will accept the Glock slides from the Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 series of the 19, 23, 32 models without any modifications. This is a good base for setting up a receiver with custom parts for a lighter trigger and/or extended parts for a competitive gun for IPSC, steel matches, etc. and being able to easily switch back to your stock lower/receiver for home defense or duty use. This is also great for creating a dedicated .22 rim fire with an Advantage Arms or other brand upper kit( one listed on my other auctions). Lone Wolf Distributors and others make custom complete upper slide assemblies if your budget allows. This Gen 3 frame has the rail for a light/laser system. I will add an ejector for a .40/357 if you want a dedicated 23/32 pistol. These are a serialized part and the frame is considered a firearm so they have to be shipped to a FFL for transfer. Be sure you can receive this to your state before bidding. Shipping and insurance is actual cost to the buyer by USPS to your FFL. NO frame sales to California unless you are a FFL.-Please check my other auctions for more Glock slides, receivers and firearms.
