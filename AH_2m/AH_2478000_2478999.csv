I am seeing a few postings with SBR AR uppers meaning under 16"", I then click your other items for sale and you have a standard AR complete rifle for sale.

Did you know that if you own an AR with a barrel 16"" or longer and have the SBR upper in you possession that you are in violation of the NFA and could suffer serious legal consequences unless you possess a federal tax stamp for the SBR.  If you do not own an AR lower and own that SBR upper you are ok, but the day you acquire the lower without the stamp you are violating federal laws.

Reason being is that if you own both it takes no effort to switch out the uppers and then have an unlicensed SBR.

Believe it or not some federal agents aren't out to get everyone and I hope you all read this posting and then read the laws."

It is 100% factory new. It consists of a New Frontier forged aluminum upper with a 16"" Blackened SS 3 Groove Polygonal M4 Profile Match 1:8 twist barrel (Black Hole Weaponry) with a Yankee Hill Machine Black Diamond specter quad rail and a YHM compensator/flash hider. The lower is a Del-Ton forged aluminum receiver with all Mil-Spec parts and a Slide Fire SSAR-15 stock installed. The Slide Fire stock is what makes this rifle SO FUN to shoot! By following the simple Slide Fire directions and using the installed fore grip to apply light forward pressure, you can empty a 30 round magazine in 10 seconds or less. It is as close to full auto as you can get without being an NFA firearm. Shipping is $25 on this item anywhere in the continental US.

Got this rifle mainly to SBR, however work in the otilfield keeps me away from home a lot, so I can just never get around to it.  

Arsenal did announce that that their SLR-106 rifles are discontinued, so if you want one that is mint, now is the time before they are gone!! Price will obviously go up on the SLR-106 line of rifles, and the price for Circle10 mags with it!!  Anyway, text for more pictures!!

It has the box, paperwork, manuals, etc, it was sold new in. It sold new in Marlow, OK 1970 for 69$ from the old Otasco store. I used it several years ago for my CCL with no problems. I sold it a year or two ago to a local person who contacted me a few weeks later saying it wouldn't fire. I gave his money back and had the gun looked at and the sear was bent. So I had that replaced about a year ago by a gunsmith and have fired one clip through it since. This is a super nice, clean 22 and can be used or would be a great collector gun with the box, paperwork, etc. $350 *** This is a Stoeger Luger, Stoeger was not a choice of manufacturers so I had to choose American derringers."

It is the perfect load for shooters and hunters looking for a great round for a day at the range or an afternoon chasing small game and varmints. One of the great features of this ammunition is the clean-burning powder. This powder provides optimum velocity while maintaining consistent chamber pressures while keeping the firearm clean from powder residue helping to ensure the rifle will function in even the harshest conditions. The copper plated hollow point bullet offers reliable feeding and great penetration. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

Inside the Stoeger Model 2000 semi-auto shotgun is the Inertia Driven operating system, the heart of the world's most prestigious and reliable autoloaders. The Inertia Driven system has only three moving parts in the bolt, the inertia spring, the bolt body, and the rotating locking head, for more reliable operation. The operating system is mostly contained in the receiver, giving the Model 2000 a trimmer forend with better balance. The Stoeger Model 2000 fires everything from 1-1/8 ounce field and target loads to the heaviest 3"" waterfowl loads without adjustments. Plus, with no propellant gas venting into the operating system, the Model 2000 stays cleaner. The bolt assembly includes an inertia spring and a rotating locking head and a cavity is designed into the butt stock of the Model 2000 to allow installation of an optional, mercury-filled recoil reducer. The Defense version of the 2000 features a matte black synthetic stock with a pistol grip and a blade front sight.

First, the control buttons are placed on the side of the sight, allowing you to more naturally make adjustments while keeping your rifle shouldered. The side control buttons also make using the sight easier when combined with magnifiers or other accessories.

Secondly, a portion of the front of the base of the EOTech 517 sits 7 millimeters higher, permitting you to attach the sight over the handguard of M4 and AR15/M16 fifles. (See photo)

I am selling two 2006 Honda Recon TRX250TM's with approximately 10-15 hours on them, I have clear titles in hand, the VIN numbers are only 28 numbers apart.

 To get any closer to NEW than this you would actually have to buy a new one.

 These ATV's were purchased new in 2006 at the same time and were trail ridden twice and the rest of the hours were put on them in the yard, I have just done a full service on both of them which includes Valve adjustment, oil change, check and adjust brakes, I also removed and cleaned the carburetors out and also installed brand new Xtreme AGM Batteries in them and the tires are like new.

 These ATV's run perfect and everything works as it should, To get any closer to a NEW one than this you would actually have to buy a new one.

 I am asking $2200.00 each or best ""Reasonable"" offer

 I can be reached thru Armslist E-mail thru this listing or by Text REDACTED If no answer please leave a message and I'll call you right back.

 For more info or Pics please call or text anytime REDACTED

All the markings are clear and crisp so no signs of replating. The mechanics are perfect with the timing being perfect and lock up very tight. Very nice specimin and hard to up grade.

Top of slide was not polished to reduce glare. Makes this one of  a kind. Has been flawless for 5-600rounds of factory FMJ & hollow points.

Would prefer to trade for something not as collectable that I can take to the range without worrying about a scratch or two. No rush to trade, just seeing if there is anything cool out there. Willing to do 2 lesser guns, or a rifle with an optic or something like that. Can also add ammo or mags for the right deal. I would say the trade price is around 1700 from what I have seen online, but I'm negotiable. Keep in mind though that 2013 blue book puts this gun at 2,050 for NIB, and 1,800 for excellent."
