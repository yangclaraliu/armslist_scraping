The shotgun has seen a lot of field use, the right side of the buttstock has lots of scratches and service marks, the right side of the receiver has spots of freckling, and the rest of the gun has service marks. The bore is crisp, trigger pull is smooth, overall condition is about 75-80%. Not a mint shotgun by any means, but this old workhorse still has Winchester quality, and for a 20 gauge model 12, it’s a heck of a good buy!

Never fired.

Includes a 12 hour concealed carry course for one person in plain city. To book, visit http://www.concealandcarryohio.com/upcoming-classes/. This is an $85 value.

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel-Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military.

The P-11 is, of course, double action only. It has a hammer, but the hammer never stands. Herein lies its safety feature: in addition to the firing pin block safety that prevents firing if the pistol is dropped, the only way the pistol will fire is by a stiff deliberate pull of the trigger, long travel double action pull with pressure of 8 to 10 pounds.  

This one comes with its original Italian-made Mec-Gar factory issue 10-shot magazine."

This .22 target pistol was made in Belgium and sold in England.  It has British proof marking.

I'm not sure of its age, but I won an inter-club championship with it c 1985.  It's still as accurate as it ever was.  I've put single action, but it's semi-auto of course. 

It comes with a standard grip, plus Left and right-handed target grips and two clips.  One clip was braised and polished c 1983.

I have for sale a Custom Remington 700 Short Action in .260 Remington built by Dave Sams of Sams Custom Gunworks, and former master gunsmith for the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit. The rifle features a blueprinted/trued older A-prefix Remington 700 short action with 8-40 scope base screw holes and Sako style extractor installed in bolt, Shilen Select Match 8-twist 22” #7 contour barrel with 5/8-24 threading for suppressor/muzzle device and a knurled thread protector, Timney trigger set at a very crisp 2#, PTG steel BDL type bottom metal, Holland .250 recoil lug, Manners T5-A stock with GAP molded camo, Weaver Steel 2-piece scope bases countersunk and reamed for tapered 8-40 screws, TPS Low TSR-W 30mm Steel Rings, and a Nightforce 5.5-20x50mm #C202 scope. Action is pillar bedded in a steel/epoxy mix (AMU Mix). This solid, good looking, extremely well-built rifle is amazingly accurate with various loads and very comfortable to shoot prone, benched, or offhand. It has a documented 120 rouds through it which includes a proper break-in sequence. For the sake of showing the value of this package, the start price does not even cover the cost of major materials/components used, as you see listed. My buy now price is what I have invested in it start to finish MINUS $1350. Recoil lug looks stainless but is not. The rifle was finished in a stainless bluing/blackening salt bath and the recoil lug would not turn black. Why am I selling it? Short Answer - Taxes.

This is a super handy & lightweight little carbine that has never hiccuped in the ~1500 rounds I've fired it since new. As you can see in pics has been painted with od green and khaki from the rustoleum camouflage line. The paint looks great but does have some minor wear (mostly on the left side from riding against my body while slung). Note that the upper & lower receivers have a bit of oil on them slightly distorting the finish in pics (the finish is perfect).

I will also throw in a Blue Force VCAS adjustable sling in green and a VTAC rail mounted sling mount at full asking price. I am willing to ship to your FFL or meet FTF in Northern VA.

-- Taurus model 85. I'm interested in both the ultralight and the standard. I might also be interested in the Taurus model 850. I'm willing to pay a reasonable price, but I can pick one up brand new in town for $299, so for me a reasonable price is going to be $250 or below, depending on what shape the gun is in.

--  Ammo deals in the following calibers: 7.62x39, 9mm, .38 spl, .380. I'm interested in all types of ammo, including: steel cased, hollow points, FMJ, ect. The only thing I don't want is mil-surp ammo of any kind. Once again, I'm very willing to pay a reasonable price, but I will not pay more than I can buy it brand new for.

-- A deal on a .380 concealed carry pistol. I'm not in need of one so I'd only be interested if you have one at a nice price for whatever reason. Not looking for a free gun, just a fair deal. I like the Taurus TCP and I also like the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec .380 model. 

Please email me if you have any of the following and we can talk about a price that is fair for us both."

It is pre XTR with non checkered stock.  The book says add 25% to rifles in this category.  Add another $100 for WMR.  Don't know much about it.  Bought it at an estate sale a while back.  Fired it a few times.  Dead on!..  does have a few very minor issues, so I wouldn't consider it a collectable.  No rear sight because of the scope (does have the dovetail wedge), the mag tube plug end is broken off but it still works fine.  you wouldn't even notice if I didn't mention it.  Minor rub (perhaps mild touchup size of a dime) from where it rested on safe rack.  Stock looks way to good to be original, but it is very nicely done if it was refinished.  No doubt the blue (other than the spot on the barrel) is totally original.   I am making this out to be worse than it is.  I would consider it 95% the way she is, other than what I noted.

Broad heads, all weather target, and drop away rest: 75

A Beretta Tomcat .32 Inox (wide slide) in matte stainless finish with 3 7rd mags. Just for those who don't know these Tomcats were having problems with the slide cracking when using +p ammo in standard Tomcat's so Beretta came out with the Inox or wide slide version that solved the problem.

My gun is like new with maybe 400rds downrange & no wear or marks at all. A standard Tomcat retailed for 380.00 + tax with 1 mag when you could still buy them in stores so if your going to offer 200.00 don't waste your time.

 Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN using their proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, and Mp and HP tested. The upper is and is finished off with an 11"" PSA SQR free-float quad rail, low profile gas block, and A2 flash hider.

A Glock 20 10mm factory barrel actually will function in a G21/G21SF slide and maintain good accuracy. This has been clearly proven in live-fire testing, the results of which are available in multiple cases, for example, Post #79 of the Glock Talk thread titled ""Glock 21 conversion to Glock 20?"" posted in the General Glocking Forum (Update: the thread has been retired). The O.D. of a G21 and G20 barrel are identical and the barrel lugs are compatible. The same holds true for an aftermarket G20 replacement barrel in the G21 slide (aftermarket G20 barrels from Bar-Sto, KKM Precision, StormLake, Lone Wolf, EFK Fire Dragon and others). While a G20 barrel is a good fit in the critical dimensions, the 10mm barrel chamber hood is narrower than the 45ACP barrel hood by slightly more than .050 inch. The dimensions of a 45-10mm conversion barrel are identical to a G20 10mm factory or aftermarket replacement barrel except that the barrel hood of the conversion barrel is made .050"" wider to better fit the 45ACP pistol breechface."

These were made in kodensha japan in the factory where winchester 101's were made. Incredible shotgun. Could only find one for sale online right now (at 700 and is not all original; the one I own is all original) Nikkos don't pop up often for sale. 

The second Nikko is the N.T.S. (Nikko trap shotgun). 29"" rib vent barrels both full choke. This gun is absolutely incredible. Tiger stiped stock and forearm, engraving on absolutely very portion and jeweling on internals to include extractors. Although the 512 was made where the Winchester 101's were this is essentially is a 101 with better wood and parts. Looking online there isn't another one for sale period. This is truely a collector piece and quite rare. 

Neither gun has import marks making them early models. 512 is from early 70's and N.T.S. Most likely from early 60's from research but it's tough as the Nikko company did not keep the same records other companies and the factory was demolished in the early 80's.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"
