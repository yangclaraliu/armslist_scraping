It is a Les Baer UTC .45 ACP. Ordered from Les Baer without the forward slide serrations and so marked on the box. Comes with original box, papers, lock,  and three factory magazines. Only one of the magazines has been used. The other two are still in the paper. Also comes with the infamous Baer bag-o'-oil. 2012 production gun, according to the previous owner. Round count around 600 according to the previous owner. Trigger set at a super crisp 4 pounds by the factory. It is the tightest fitting 1911 I've ever owned, including Wilsons and Nighthawks. I really regret I can't keep it. 

Has a bit of wear from use and handling as shown in the pics. The heaviest is on the lower right slide from action cycling. Still a beautiful gun, but if you insist on a pristine gun, this is not the one for you. If you want a Baer you can use guilt free that is still beautiful and priced several hundred less than a new one, this is the gun for you.

Price is $1600 FIRM for a face to face deal in Hickory, NC. If I have to drive to meet you somewhere else, the price will be higher.  I will ship it for actual shipping cost, which will probably be around $60 fully insured from my FFL to yours.

Bike runs and rides great and is very quick. Has ProTaper yz-lo handle bars and a FMF graphics kit. Has some wear from boots on the crank case and frame (should be expected from a 10 year old bike) and also has a small tear on the seat around the size of a dime. Bike also has a kickstand which was added by the previous owner and can easily be removed. I'm looking to sell/trade because I now own a car and can not haul it anywhere to ride.

I got a lot of helpful recommendations off here and I appreciate that, but they were for gunsmiths 45min to an hour away. Sorry.

Anyway, I am looking for a gunsmith or machine shop to make a custom bolt handle for my old 22 rifle. The rifle has a straight pull-back style bolt handle (basically a straight metal rod) that is too small for me to really get my hands on. It's the first picture below. It's maybe an inch and a half long at most.

I am looking to have a custom one turned on a lathe from something as simple as a metal rod (could even be a plain bolt from a hardware store), and then have it brought to a curve at the end like an AK47 (second picture) or M1 Garand (third picture), so it looks like a sideways trigger. I could do this on my own, but I would prefer a gunsmith or machine shop mill it perfectly for piece of mind. Seeing as how you're not working on the receiver of the firearm, this is legal for a machine shop to do. Respond to the ad if interested in helping me out on this. Thanks!"

I am the original owner. I purchased it new in May of 2012 and it has sat in my safe unfired, unloaded, etc. ever since. I have not put a magazine in it at all. I cycled the action exactly 3 times. My experience from handling a number of SR1911s since their introduction is that the guns shipped out after August or so of last year do not have quite as tight a fit of the frame to the slide as the earlier guns like this one. A friend of mine who has close ties with Ruger told me, when I related that observation, that Ruger got complaints about the guns being too tight and loosened the tolerances a bit so the guns didn't have to be broken in out of the box (i.e., people were getting a better gun, but since it took a bit of breaking in with some of them to feed 100%, they complained and Ruger gave them a bit of a lesser gun to satisfy the complaints). Take the story for what you paid for it, but this gun does have a better fit than ones I have handled since late last summer.

I figure if I haven't shot it at this point, I can live without it. It comes exactly as it came from the dealer, with all the papers, mags, etc. a new one came with back then. $650 firm face to face in Hickory, NC.

SN dates production at 1906. All matching numbers. Very nice condition gun for its age - well above what you usually see on a 1st Generation gun. Retains much original blue and still has a good bit of color case (the color case is more vibrant in hand than it shows up in the pictures). Mechanically excellent with perfect timing (bolt properly drops into the leade of the cylinder notch on every chamber). Excellent lock-up with just a bit of sideplay and just a touch of endshake. EXCELLENT shooter. Shot under 2"" groups at 25 yards for me with a .454"" sized Keith bullet at about 800 fps. A previous owner filed the front sight a bit to regulate to a load. Shot close enough to point of aim for me with my load to not worry about it, though it was a couple inches high due to the sight filing. Not a big deal, as I usually sight a revolver a bit high at 25 yards, anyway. The metal does have some scattered freckling, dings, and a couple small spots of really light pitting, but it is still in exceptional condition for its age. I really hate to sell this one, but I have other needs that need to be met. For sure, I highly doubt you will find another in this condition, configuration, and caliber for this price. $2400 firm face to face in Hickory, NC. Not interested in trades unless heavily enough weighted in my favor to make it worth the time and effort of selling the trade goods. The only reason I am selling this is to raise cash for a family need, otherwise I'd be keeping it.

I have had it this way for 2 years and not a bit of rust. I keep it well oiled with Winchester spray oil. Also I have shot this colt a few times and it really is pretty accurate for a 101 year old gun at 15-25 yards. The original clip in it works but has trouble feeding due to an old spring.

Built in 2011 by Kelbly's Rifles in North Lawrence, OH.  They are known for building the most sought after bench rest rifles in the world.   http://www.kelbly.com.   Though this is a more ""tactical"" long range rifle, it still has every bit of bench rest precision as many of their other builds.  It was designed to shoot 12"" x 12"" steel out to 1200 yards very well.  I have held 2 or 3 foot groups at a mile with light to moderate wind.  Rifle has been mostly shot at Thunder Valley Precision in Coshocton, OH.  TVP is the home of some of the most challenging steel, long range courses in the country and owned by Tom Sarver, 1000 yard bench rest world record holder.  My partner and I placed 3rd in their 2012 spring team sniper match out of 20 teams.  Here is the link to a video of one of our rounds.  I am shooting the rifle for sale on the right, engaging various sized steel (no larger than 12"") to about 800 yards.

I am taking the time to be this specific because I want everyone to know that this is is not your granddad's hunting rifle.  Although, it is very capable of shooting deer, groundhogs and various other critters to 1000 yards or farther.  Yes, this is an expensive gun and I have spent hundreds of hours perfecting the hand loads for this rifle, tuning the rifle, shooting the rifle and recording shot data across several hundred rounds.  I simply don't have the type of place I'm used to to shoot this rifle since I moved to Missouri and I would like to ""downsize"" somewhat.  The price is relatively firm…and is justifiable.  I am open to partial trades for a nice higher end hunting/sporting rifle in the $700-1000 range.  i.e. Weatherbys,   higher end Remington 700s and Winchester 70's, Kimbers, etc.  So here is the detailed parts list and what all comes with the rifle:

Action: Remington 700 SA, Cerakote OD green
Bolt: Remington 700 w/ oversized knob
Barrel:  26"" Krieger light varmint contour 1:8 twist, threaded 5/8-24 w/ Vias 360 deg ported muzzle break, Cerakote OD green
Trigger:  Jewel HVR w/ top safety set at 1#
Bottom Metal:  Hooper Ordnance, detachable mag accepts Accuracy International and clone type 5 or 10 round mags.
Stock:  McMillan A5, 75% OD green 25% Black w/ aftermarket adjustable cheekpiece.
Scope Base:  EGW picatinny style one piece with 20 moa cant.  
Weight:  approx. 17#

***NIGHTFORCE SCOPE AND RINGS and BIPOD PICTURED, NOT INCLUDED!!!***

Also come with 50 of my handloads  and 100 rounds of once fired Lapua 260 brass.
This rifle propels a 140 gr Berger VLD @ app. 2810 fps.  Will consistently shoot 1/4 moa groups @ 100 yards.  I will also throw in my impact data book with records and clean sheets for thunder valley precision if you want them and I will provide my specific load data for this gun.  You CANNOT shoot store-bought 260 like Remington core-lokt or the like through this gun, it will not perform.  I will only sell face to face near the St Louis, MO area.  CASH only!!!!  Serious inquires by email only please.  After further discussion with seriously interested parties, I am willing to meet at a local outdoor range for you to test fire a few rounds to determine if it suited for your use case.  This is actually a good price point for someone to have a very capable long range rifle who is interested in getting into that type of shooting.  I outshoot guys with $5K plus rigs all the time.   Also keep in mind, the rifle is only as good as the glass on top of it.  In order to make this gun perform at its best, you'll need to put at a minimum another grand into a good optic for it.  Like Nightforce, Leupold Mark 4/6, Schmidt & Bender, Vortex, Premier, US Optics.  Thanks and please watch the youtube video and check out Kelbly's rifles and Thunder Valley Precision's websites."

It has only had 38 rounds through it (10 slugs, 25 field loads, and 3 00 buck to be exact) and only shows nominal wear from dry cycling the action. I'll be throwing in 10 rounds of Remington Slugger 2/3"" 1-ounce load, Rem buckshot (12 rounds) and any cleaning supplies for it i have in the way of bore brushes and mops. 

It wears the outstanding Bushnell TRS 25 micro red dot sight. These are rated to .375 H&H Magnum, and thus far its been very accurate. It has been sighted to shoot slugs, grouping 3 MOA with Sluggers, and I've taken a deer with it opening weekend of this year!!! POA of buckshot is nearly identical out to 20+ yards. The red dot is under warranty, has no parallax or eye relief, and is in my opinion to be the best at its price point, better I believe than Eotech. It sits locked to a Weaver brand base made specifically for the Protector and isn't easy to acquire.

Since the Protector is a Rem 870 clone, all accessories other than barrels made for 870s will fit it. That said, this gun also wears its stock fore end, but has had its stock replaced with a Blackhawk NRS pistol grip stock, and wears a milspec sling rated to 800 lbs. I have the Black Hawk fore end that came with the new stock, I just preferred the grip on the one that came on the gun. I have paper work and packages for all accessories, and any hardware they came with, including the original stock.

My price is firm as is my trade. Alot of time and money went into turning this from a budget shotty into a feasible weapon for any and all situations, even hunting! That said, its a fair price for what it is, and its going to stay that way. Offers will be considered, obviously in trades only.
Email me for pictures, but please leave a number.
Local pickup only. Thanks for looking."

I thought we would just fire it at the range once in awhile but we have too many 9mm so we are thinning out the safe. 

Included in this package is the following:

1 Like New Taurus PT-709 Thin in the original plastic case w/ matching serial numbers
1 Original Manual + Warranty Card
3 - 7+1 Taurus Brand Magazines (1 is still sealed in the original packaging)
2 Pierce Grip ""Grip Extensions""

1 Blackhawk! Belt Holster (Size 8) Fits the PT-709 perfect.
1 Adjustable Shoulder Holster that holds Taurus PT-709 and 2 additional magazines

The gun is in great shape inside and out. Yes, you might be able to find them online for $330 to $380 before taxes, FFL fees and shipping.  Even Buds charges $372 plus taxes and FFL fees. And all of these are with 1 magazine. I am offering 3. Magazines for this gun are hard to find except on eBay and can go anywhere from $45 to $60 plus shipping.  If you do the math, you will see that this is a fair price.

It is truly in mint condition. I added a rubber sleep on the grip, makes it a tad more comfortable. It has less than 100 rounds through it, if that many.

I have the original box, case, all contents, the two mags it came with (17 round), etc. See photos.

You get a brand new PX4 Storm at a price lower than anything you'd find on the Internet from Bud's etc.

You avoid taxes and FFL fees and get it for a less than I paid for it locally and less than you can find it on the Internet, new, etc. Good deal. Don't miss it.

I also have five twenty round extended mags which I will sell separately for $40 each. That's $5 less than the lowest price I could find on the web.

911,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2359911,For Sale:  2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport 4x4!,"Winnsboro, Columbia, South Carolina","$ 3,500","Listed On: Thursday, November 21, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Offering my Jeep Cherokee for sale for $3500 or best reasonable offer. I needed some $ recently, so I sold my truck and bought the Jeep. I've always loved the look and feel of these older model Cherokees, so that's why I bought it instead of another truck. I also thought, at the time, that I didn't use the truck bed much so I really didn't need a truck. That thought pushed me to get the Jeep also. Since then, I've noticed all these times I've needed a truck bed... needing to haul ladders, lumber, an ATV, a grill, etc. That's why the Jeep is for sale now. I really wish I could keep it, but I have to face the fact that I need another truck.

On to the specifics of the Jeep:

The great:
+ It's a Jeep.
+ It's a 2001 (the last year they were made like this).
+ It's 4 wheel drive, and is a freaking beast. This thing is an interstate legal tractor.
+ 146,500 miles on the motor, so it's only nearing its half-way point.
+ It's an automatic.
+ Everything electric works perfectly (that means a lot on one of these).
+ I just had a brand new radiator installed (old one had a needle-point hole in it).
+ It's got almost new tires on it. No need to worry about those.
+ The insurance cost on this thing is cheap (surprised me a little)!

The not so great, but not big issues either:
+ It has a small rust spot on each side. Both on the rocker panels. VIN check shows it was once in WV, which means salty roads. The underside is clean.
+ There is a crack in the right front fender (photo included to show that).
+ The headliner is beginning to sag.

I know these photos aren't the best, I took them the night I bought the Jeep. Sorry about that. If you're interested it it, call/text me and let's talk.

Today, I shot 100 rds. of .45 ACP FMJ Feds through my new ULTRA CDP II I trad WOW!! what a handgun with no malfuntions. I am extremely pleased with this weapon. I shot the bullseye out of the paper; much more accurate than the Colt Defender I used to own. I don't have my CCW renewed yet but wore it concealed around the house the first day I got it and it proved light and quite comfortable with the melt Kimber did as a standard feature. The Colt Defender runs around $1150 now days and this gun at 1,100 has so many more features.   CALL 317-757-5684"
