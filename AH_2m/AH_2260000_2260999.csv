This versatile, gas-operated 3 1/2"" chamber shoots all 1 1/8 oz. and larger field loads up to 3 1/2"" magnums.  It has an Aluminum alloy receiver and semi-humpback design, 26"" ventilated ribbed barrel with 3 invector-plus choke tubes, magazine cut-off and speed loading. Several Browning autoloading shotguns utilize Browning’s exclusive Magazine Cut-Off, allowing the shooter to retain shells in the magazine and eject a shell from the chamber without cycling a shell from the magazine.  This feature is invaluable whether you find yourself in a duck blind transitioning from duck loads to geese loads, or if you just want to safely remove a round from the chamber without the risk of chambering another round.  This gun has some light normal wear and comes with the manufacturers box.  I also have a floating waterproof browning camo case and browning sling I will include for an additional $60.  This gun shoots great and is perfect for the avid hunter.  I'm only selling because I'm upgrading one last time.  Please no low ball offers.  Thanks Gary 314-504-6nine9eight."

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.

6.  ONE YEAR FACTORY DIRECT WARRANTY
Warranty covers any defects in materials or workmanship. (Excluding S&H Charges).

-------------------------------
COMPATIBILITY OF OUR GLOCK CONVERSION KITS
Our Glock Conversion Kits are made to work on FACTORY STOCK Glock frames.
Note:  Aftermarket parts such as trigger bars and connectors, especially the Ghost Connector, can adversely affect the function and reliability of your conversion kit."

 I'm the only owner of this one. In 1991 there were only two 9mm carbines widely commercialy available, and even those were fairly scarce. I managed to find both in about two months time. I bought this Marlin, spent a range day with it. It fed all types of 9mm ammo, out of several boxes and proved to be quite acurate and stone reliable. The total round count would be
 between 75-125 rounds. I cleaned it, put it in a safe, and made plans to trick it out. A short time later I stumbled onto the other carbine of the day, and it shared controls with my taget rifle. In all honesty this Marlin has been well maintained but has not been shooting since.

The Camp 9 has a 16 1/2 micro groove barrel (12 groove), open sights and a high visibility orange front sight post with cutaway hood. Steel receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope. Overall length is 35 1/2 inches, and it weighs 6 3/4 lbs. WHile a note on the manuel states' Now available with 4rd hunting magazine it did not come with one. has a detachable 12 shot magazine. The carbine is compatible with Smith & Wesson 59 -5906 series handgun magazines.

This carbine is in near perfect condition. There is a very small light spot on the edge of the stock just above the trigger that came with it new. It may have rubbed something or the finish may be thin, there is no damage to the wood. Beyond that the metal and wood are flawless. Bore is mirror bright with sharp riflings. Thers is It is ""as new"" and includes, an additional 15 round magazine, and two megar 20rd magazines, and one Safariland Mag Loader,the factory manuel and it does come with the factory box, although the carbine was stored in a safe and the box was cramed in closet so the box has seen better days.
 The prices on these rifles range from ok for fairly rough ones, to ridiculous for nice ones. I'm asking $550.00 and I dont think you will find one in this shape within 200.00 of the price. Thanks for looking. Available in the SW  MS. area, Pike, Lincoln, Walthall counties.
Very few trades I would consider on this one, if any."

I have an almost new Polish Tantal Ak74, and shes beautiful, maybe 500 rounds through her, and cleaned every trip shooting, and cleaned to prevent the corrosive ammo from rusting the barrel or any part of the rifles internals. The rifle came to me brand new, and was stock, all upgrades have been done by me. She has a midwest industries rail, with primary arms microdot, also has the US PALMS picatinny rail cover, that allows the micro dot to cowittness to the iron sights. Also has 6 mags 4 are 30 rounds and 2 are 40 rd mags ( 5 mags including the 40 round mags are PROMAG and work flawlessly no modification or shaving needed. 1 is a metal mag. ) Has the standard folding stock I have taken soft foam and wrapped it around the stock, then wrapped that with 550 Pararchute Chord and finally Gorilla Glue Camo Duct Tape to make a better position for my cheek and a forward grip to top it off. I am ordering 1080 rounds on the first of November may also get an Ar style buttstock as that is what Im used to using. Currently I have like 150 give or take rounds. This rifle works flawlessly and has had no hiccups only shows a few scratches but other than that its a brand new gun, its just barley been broken in. Will answer any questions, thanks for looking! I also have all original parts."

I'm asking 1250 for everything.
Cash only, please-no trades.

These pistols will chamber and fire ANY .45 ACP ammo, from widemouthed hollowpoints, to +P+ hardcast reloads, to dirty steel cased stuff, to powderpuff wadcutters . . . even primed cases.  These guns run forever, thousands of rounds with no jams even if left uncleaned, no breakage after 20,000+ rounds.  These are built on the same frame as the 1006 10mm, which has twice the power of 45 so you will not break this.  The 4506 is widely considered to be the best of the 3rd Generation S&W automatics.  Very soft shooting, with light recoil and outstanding accuracy.  Full sized (5"" barrel) stainless steel pistol with blued Novak sights, trigger, and hammer (not MIM).  DA/SA with decocker.  8+1 capacity.  Single stack is good for shooters with smaller hands.

This was my Dad's gun, purchased new (not a police trade in), and was kept in his nightstand for 20 years.  Excellent condition with only a few faint handling marks.  Very low round count, under 500 rounds of brass cased ball.  Only modification was the sights were touched up with a bit of Hi-Viz paint, but that is easily removed with a little acetone if you don't like it.  Same style of pistol Vic Mackey used in ""The Shield.""

Smith & Wesson 4506-1 comes with 2 factory mags, a nice gun case, a 50 rd box of new Winchester Ranger T-series Law Enforcement +P ammo, and a 25 rd box of Remington Golden Saber +P ammo.  The ammo alone is worth over a hundred bucks, and I'm throwing it in for free as I have no other guns in this caliber.  Do not have the original box or manual, but the instructions are available online as a pdf and detailed field strip videos can be found on youtube.  If you want rubber or wood grips, Hogue makes them for the 4506.  Leather holsters for the SIG P220 or Beretta 92 will usually fit a 4506/1006 well.

Pistol, extra mag, 75 rds of premium defense ammo, and a gun case.

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip (Not included for CO, NY, CA, NJ, HA sales). The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.
Includes only 2-10 rd magazines.

I'm by no means an expert on these, but I believe it was sold to the Turks as the rear sights are written in Farsi. I have no way of properly judging the barrel, but it is nice and shiney with strong rifling. I'd gladly answer any questions you may have to the best of my ability. The only issues that I can see are the missing cleaning rod and a crack on the handguard (please see the pics). The barrel is also import marked. I'm asking $225 obo. I'd also entertain a trade for a low number, non sporterized, 1903 Springfield or Rock Island. I also have roughly 200 rounds of 8 mm Iranian surplus ammo that I'd include for another $50.

The rifle is in the original condition as it was recovered and taken home after the war. Rifle is chambered in the 8mm Mauser caliber. It has the Hungarian army shield stamp and the 43M marked on the receiver. Im not a history expert but what i do know is that these were made in Hungary prior to german occupation for their troops. Once Germany captured Hungary, the made the factory switch the rifle to 8mm and start using various Mauser parts on it such as the mag plate and stripper clips etc. at which time it got the 43M stamp. The action is very similar and very smooth as a Mauser but slightly different.  Most of these guns were stamped with nazi eagles etc. but some like this one was not and this makes it slightly more rare. Anyway, down to the nitty-gritty. Rifle action, bolt and mag plate, etc are all in really good shape for their age, only minor wear from use. The barrel and receiver are in good shape too but do show signs of blue wearing and minor cosmetic flaws such as tiny scratches or dings etc. but for being over 60 years old its in great shape. Id say blueing is about 80% or so, but im not appraising expert, thats just my opinion. The stock is in bad shape...its warped from age, and its missing the top handguard piece that mauser type rifles are known for. All metal is there such as sling swivels, butt plate and screws, screws etc. Screw heads are worn though, and bayonet mount is missing. Otherwise its a solid piece that does shoot and operate well. It could be restored with the addition of a new stock or used as a parts rifle as it is intact parts wise. Its a real piece of WW2 history that isnt very common from what i have seen/read. I just have no real use or desire for it and would like to sell/trade it to someone who does. Includes a box and a half of 8mm ammo. More pics available upon request. Contact me with any questions or offers........

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.  Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.  Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.  The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.  To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

The carbine has rarely been shot, with less than 50 rounds. The pistol has less than 300 rounds, which is nothing for these Beretta's. One of the nicest shooting .22lr's pistols out there. Perfect for plinking, small game hunting, even home defense with the right ammo. Has been 100% reliable with almost every ammo. 
I have another Neos so am selling this one. The carbine kit is very difficult to find and the pistols are becoming harder to get as well.

DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
TriStar's new TEC 12 Pump/Auto Home Defense 12ga Shotgun is nothing short of amazing.  This shotgun is designed to utilize two actions on the same frame.  The TEC 12 is capable of operating in PUMP mode and in Semi-Auto mode by just the turn of a dial.  The 3"" Chambered TEC 12 uses an inertia rotary bolt for smooth action response (in semi-auto).  The TEC 12 is finished in matte black and features a picatinny rail mounted on the receiver, ghost ring sight and raised front bridge sight with a fiber optic bead, black synthetic stock with rubber fixed pistol grip, plus 1 set of military sling swivels and one set of swivel studs installed.  The TEC 12 also has an external ported cylinder choke and is backed by TriStar's 5 year warranty.

I bought the conversion kit and two mags for $235 in OD Green about half a year ago but no longer shoot .22lr. It's a great way to practice with the PF-9 with little recoil (Which it has a lot with 9mm) and as accurate as you would normally be with a 9mm. I've put good ammo such as CCI stingers and cheap bulk like federal and the conversion kit eats it up both like a pro. I'm not in a hurry to sell so I'm not going to move too much on the price. It's 55 bucks cheaper than buying new (for cosmetic damages) and I'm willing to drive down to Seattle or up to Marysville to meet with a buyer.

Product Information, Features, and Specifications:

The PF-9 retains the best features from Kel Tec's P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about
function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged
Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a
thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the
shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a
similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for
faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package
of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2)
magazines and a holster.

Overall, due to patina I'd call it ""Very Good"" condition.  Comes with a brand new 50 round box of Remington PNL ammo and a lefty IWB holster that a right handed person can wear SOB or OWB.  The ammo was $33 plus tax, holster is an Uncle Mikes worth about $15.  This revolver was manufactured prior to 1963 and is C&R eligible due to being 50+ years old.

Buy it now!! Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three- tritium night sights. With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components. The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.
