There were only 16000 or so made in 1971 and when they do pop up they are usually in pretty rough condition. I really like this gun but it needs to belong to a collector who will appreciate more than I. It shoots great and is very accurate. Really fun to shoot. There are a few minor dings in the stock, as expected with the rifles age, and a small area of the bluing is scratched near the tip of the barrel where it looks like someone used too coarse steel wool to try to clean it. This will not show up in the photos and is nearly unnoticeable. Really nice grain pattern is present in the stock. Rifle, to the best of my knowledge, is not refinished and is in its original condition. This rifle will shoot 22LR 22L and 22S. I have more photos available upon request."

I purchased this rifle about 5 months ago and have shot exactly 63 rounds thru it. I bought the rifle to shoot varmint in my backyard, but have since moved and no longer have a need for it. This thing is an absolute tack driver, easily punches dime sized groupings at 100 yards. The .17 round has an extremely flat trajectory, excellent for small targets. The Marlin XT-17v has a 22"" heavy (bull) barrel, pro fire adjustable trigger, and walnut finished hardwood stock. Here is a link to this exact rifle at Gander Mountain, where I purchased it: 
 http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?i=GM447613#reviewsInfo

 Here is a breakdown of everything included in this package:

 - Marlin XT-17v rifle 
 - additional 7 round magazine (2 total magazines)
 - Simmons 3-9x32 scope, with scope rings, mounted and zeroed for 100 yards. Includes lens covers for the scope as well.
 - BlackHawk fully adjustable pivoting bipod 
 - 1187 rounds of premium grade .17 ammo, broken into the following packs of 50 rounds(2x CCI TNT 17 gr Hollow Point) (2x Federal Premium 17 gr Polymer tipped) ( 2 x Hornady 20 gr XTP Hollow Point) (17 x Hornady 17 gr V-Max Polymer tipped) (1x Federal Spitfire 17 gr Polymer tipped Hyper Velocity) NOTE: 1 box of the Hornady V-Max only has 37 rounds in it. I shot 1 box of 50 and 13 from this box to make the 63 total rounds fired from this rifle.

Price for the entire package is $550 cash or $600 trade. There is over $700 in rifle, accessories, and ammo included that has hardly been used at all. For sale/trade as a package only, will not separate.

Instead of chambering a 308-sized action in 223(like remington/savage), CZ scaled this mini-mauser action down to the size of the 223 cartridge, making for a lighter, stiffer action, and shorter bolt-travel. Feeds from detachable 5rd single-stack magazines. I'm the original owner, rifle is a safequeen with 200rds down the barrel. This model is no longer available from CZ.

Scope is a Zeiss HD5 3-15x42. Made in Germany. Some of the best glass money can buy. Has side focus, and lockable windage and elevation turrets with zero-stop. Bought it this year, mounted it, sighted it in, and put it back in the safe. Scope is mint condition and comes with lens cover, box, and manual.

Below is the write up from LaRue:

LaRue Tactical OBR 5.56 Overview:
Building off the success of our highly-accurate and reliable OBR 7.62, we set out to apply the same proven design features into a 5.56 rifle. The result is a lightweight, and reliable, tack driver that remains cool…even after high-rates of fire. The barrel and barrel nut does not touch the handguard at any point, so there is very little heat-transfer to your support hand. Like its 7.62mm sibling, both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet 7075-T6, for the optimum fit and consistency...translating into maximum accuracy. Even though this is a complete rifle, the upper will fit to any Mil-Spec AR15/M16 type lower.

 The continuous upper-rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations and provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night-vision combinations. The 10 MOA cant gives users an added advantage when using magnified optics at longer distances. A step-down at the rear of the receiver creates zero MOA for use of BUIS’s at shorter distances.

 Each rifle ships with three, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail sections that they can be configured anywhere along the entire length of the handguard (via threaded steel inserts), for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped lights, lasers, bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc.

Barrels:
 The barrels are Stainless Steel in 12”, 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. They are Wylde chambered, and feature polygonal rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The 12” model have carbine-length gas systems, the 16” and 18” models have a mid-length, and the 20” has a rifle-length. All gas blocks will feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch.

Internals:
 The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are surface-ground flat for zero gas leakage. The trigger group is the same excellent Geissele SSA Combat Triggers we use in the OBR 7.62.The SSA provides an average 4.5lb pull weight.(2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage).

Furniture:
The 12”, 16”, and 18"" models come with a 6-position Magpul CTR and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The 20” Model Comes with an A2 Stock, in black and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip."

One is built on a 1939 CZ 98 BRNO and the other on a Swedish 96. Both are chambered in 7 X 57mm. and stocked in Curly Maple and glass bedded

Both have New Chrome Moly 21"" barrels and have been proof fired (empty brass from proof firing included). They both have a Bold Premium Rifle Trigger with adjustable sear engagement screw and overtravel stop screw, Timney Buehler-Style Low-Swing Safety's, custom quick release hinged floor plates and Pachmayr Sure Grip Rifle Recoil Pads'

The bolts are jeweled and the slings are padded Rustic Maple leather and have Uncle Mike's Pushbutton detachable Swivels.

Both come in a Flambeau Outdoors Safeshot Oversized Double Gun Case.

There are NO Scopes with these rifles because what I like in optics is not necessarily what you like. I would put a Leopold VX-2 1-4x20mm on the 96 and a VX-2 2-7x33 on the 98, but that is my choice. I know most people like a 3-9 power. The Scope rings are the rare 'bottom screw' Redfield's which are not manufactured any more.

I will ship to a Licensed FLL only or guns may be picked up. Shipping will be my exact cost.

Will consider trades for semi-auto pistols (9mm or .40SW) or rifles. Serious consider a trade for an ar-15 type

This is for trade consideration only as I'm not interested in selling it outright, rather trade only. I really like it, however I have other similar pistols and would entertain trading it for a different, quality handgun chambered in a common caliber. Feel free to send me an email with a phone number and I'll respond promptly. If I'm not interested, I'm happy to say ""no thanks"". I just thought I'd throw it up here and see if anything pops up that I don't know I ""need"".

Selling my Colt AR-15 A2 Government Carbine Pre Ban, Manufacture date of February 1993 (confirmed by Colt) in good condition, serial # GC0092xx. It does have some wear, but nothing major for a 20 year old rifle. I've currently got a picatinny hand guard installed and aftermarket hand grip, however it comes with the original hand guards and hand grips. This rifle also comes with 1 30rd P-MAG magazine and 1x original 30rd metal magazine as well as a few rail covers for the picatinny hand guard. A Pelican 1700 case comes with the rifle, but you will need to get a piece of replacement foam to cut to your preference. Please review your local and state laws before bidding.

Night movement is the best choice for evasive movement, but it is generally discouraged because of difficulty navigating in the dark. The ENVIS is the survival tool of choice, designed specifically to overcome obstacles and hazards when moving at night and successfully evade hostile territory. The ENVIS is USAF approved for flight survival vests. It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device. It attaches to the objective lens threads of most cameras for temporary nighttime applications. The removable objective lens can be replaced with any C-Mount Type lens for increased range and magnification.

It's a fake with and EOTech battery box. Don't be fooled!!!!!
http://www.armslist.com/posts/2239509/clarksville-optics-for-sale--l3-eotech-

First off EOTech does not make a model that has a green reticle. 
If the center ""NV"" button changes the reticle color, it's a fake. If the optics look like clear window glass, it's fake. If you can look inside the glass and see an LED, it's a fake. The reticle, on a real one, should seem a little fuzzy not crisp. If it feels cheap and not well made, likely a fake. If if has flip up lens covers that are cheesy and fall off easily, it's likely a fake. Lack of EOTech manufacturing and serial number sticker means it's likely a fake. Beware, people are swapping battery boxes with real EOTechs and putting them on fake ones as well as the EOTechs factory stickers. If the deal seams too good to be true, it's likely a fake."

•Ambidextrous synthetic stock
•Sling mounts
•2-stage adjustable trigger

If you shoot a lightweight pellet so its velocity exceeds the speed of sound, it could result in your pellet breaking the sound barrier and the gun being louder than expected! The speed of sound depends on humidity, temperature and altitude. Generally speaking, it's between 1,060 fps and 1,115 fps.
Here are the benefits of the Nitro Piston:
•Smoother cocking
•Smoother shooting

Looking to sell or trade a French 1935A chambered in 7.65 French long. It was made in the S.A.C.M plant in France, and from the information I've gathered online, it was probably made in 1946 sometime shortly after WW2. It has a parkerized finish (it was never coated with the bake on enamel that the earlier ones had, as far as I can tell). It is in excellent condition, with some light wear on the edges. There are no import markings on it, so I'm assuming it was brought back from across the pond. 

I traded for this a while ago and it really doesn't have a place in my collection. I planned on getting some ammo and shooting it, but I never got around to it as it's not the easiest stuff to find. 

Asking $350, but feel free to make a reasonable offer. I'm not in a big hurry to sell it though, so keep that in mind. The only trades I'd be interested in are a used (but decent) AR optic, or some .45ACP + cash. Face to face in the Wichita area only, no shipping. If interested you can send me an email through here, or you can text me at REDACTED. Thanks for looking"

AR-10, AR, LARUE, LARUE TACTICAL","Texas, Texas, United States","$ 2,800","Listed On: Saturday, October 19, 2013",Rifles,Larue Tactical                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The PredatOBR 7.62 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 7.62 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the supplied Roll-Bag and Tool Box. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original. PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/11.25 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods. The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor. The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system. Specifications: Caliber: 7.62 x 51 mm NATO Barrel Lengths: 14.5”,16.1”and 18” Rifling Twist Rate: 1/11.25 Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx) Gas System: Direct Impingement with LaRue PST™ port selector Accessories: 2ea, 20-Round LaRue Magazines 3ea 3” Rail Sections Operators Manual Carrying Case “Toolbox” Roll-Up Cloth Case Barrel Wrench Suppressor Compatibility: LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire. About the “Black Gold” Trigger: We are very proud to announce that we’ve selected the American Trigger Corporation AR Gold trigger to be installed in LaRue PredatOBRs going forward. These are a single stage trigger with take-up and a super short reset, similar in feel to a best-grade 1911 trigger, providing the optimum trigger action for a wide variety of shooting styles and disciplines. AR Gold Triggers have been used by some of the best competition shooters in the world for the last few years and dominate the top of the 3 Gun competition world. We have been testing and evaluating these triggers for well over a year, to ensure that they're up to our standard of quality. Our evaluation has shown the AR Gold to be magnificent and we're proud to include them as part of our new product line. One thing that is unusual about these triggers installed in our LaRue PredatOBRs, is they are treated with an IonBond black instead of American Trigger’s normal IonBond Gold. This is a custom color that is only available on LaRue Tactical rifles. These triggers will be standard in the LaRue PredatOBR in both 5.56 and 7.62 caliber."
