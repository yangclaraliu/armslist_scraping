Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace CorporationÂ© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty.

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll.

 One PASGT (Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops) Vest. Medium in very good lightly used shape with the data card in the back it comes with the Chocolate chip and 3 color desert and covers. 50.00  

 One Canadian Military PASGT equivalent, it is medium and looks to be in new condition from the looks of it. 50.00 

 One Improved Outer Tactical Vest with hard armor E-SAPI plates. 700.00 Or Best Reasonable Offer or trade.

 The list of components:

 Soft armor panel inserts
 Four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates)
 Collar
 Deltoid and Auxiliary protector system (DAPs)
 The groin protector is not included

 This is a small vest with the expansion system built in it fits my 210 pound frame easily. 
 A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment.[5] The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to a casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor.

 The IOTV takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. It has a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. A back pad in the lower back area of the vest is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. The back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates E-SAPI plates will provide protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation."

This thing is an absolute tack driver and is an easy 1/2 MOA rifle.

The Optic was $750 new, and the rifle is $700 alone, so let's not gouge our fellow gun enthusiasts and call it an even $1000.

Shoot me a message here if you are interested.

I will also include 2 boxes of 168gr Federal Gold Medal Match FMJBT with the sale.

I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

Up for sale/trade is the TASERÂ® X12 which utilizes Radialâ¢ Ammunition Key technology (patent pending) to prevent the system from deploying lethal 12-gauge rounds in order to remove the possibility of end users accidentally firing a lethal round in a less-lethal system during high stress situations. No other system on the market today prevents the operator from inadvertently deploying a lethal round. In addition, it incorporates a uniquely designed twist, rifled barrel that optimizes the performance of the XREP, ensuring that an optimum spin rate is imparted upon the projectile as it exits the barrel to ensure the greatest distance, stabilization, and accuracy possible. Advanced Features -Dedicated less-lethal platform -TASERÂ®-Yellowâ¢ Colloration -Optimized for use with the TASERÂ® XREP RL -Radialâ¢ Ammunition Key technology -Based on Mossberg's model 500 pump-action 12-gauge shotgun -Picatinny rail forearm. This weapon is no longer in production and is not being sold in the United States. Grab a piece of history while you can. Disclaimer: Ammunition for the Taser X12 is not in production. This gun is discontinued and would be a perfect collectors item. If you can find cartridges for this gun it will fire.

I see these wasrs in the local gun stores and pawn shops for around $700, sometimes even less! I bought a used wasr with 2 mags and 200 rounds of ammo for $500.... These rifles are not worth 900! don't pay crazy prices and they are bound to come down to MARKET VALUE! Price Gouging NEEDS to STOP!. This applies to all guns and ammo. The supply is there, stop buying guns and ammo for awhile and the prices will come back down. This is getting out of control. Plinking and hunting is supposed to be a fun sport. These days you have to empty your bank account just to have a nice day at the range! That's no fun!. lets put an end to price gouging!."

This butt stock allows your AK-47 to fire full auto. There is a switch on it that goes from Semi, to full auto. It's made in America and its absolutely Legal, because technically, the trigger is being pulled a thousand times a minute even though it doesn't feel like it. It's ATF approved and is very accurate. And no, it doesn't cause wear and tire on your fire pin. I paid $375 dollars for it, 45 dollars was shipping and handling and 30 dollars was sales tax. It's yours for $275 dollars or best offer, and I even bought extra screws for it incase you lose one. It's only been used once, and is still in the box it came in. Why am I selling it? Because of all AK-47's in the world, I happen to buy the one with an underfold stock that is welded on my AK, so it doesnt work for mine. If your AK-47 has a detachable butt stock, like 99 percent of them do, then it's going to work for it just fine no matter what brand it is. I used it on my nephews AK-47 with a 75 round drum and a couple 40 round mags, and it fired beautifully without a single jam. You can use your AK-47 as a machine gun or Squad Automatic Weapon if shit hits the fan with that butt stock and lay down some good suppresive fire. Get it while it's still legal. Because the government is trying to ban them. Call or text REDACTED."

The round count is unknown but looks as if the previous owner used it with a can primarily, the barrel was sent to the FFL/gunsmith ""High mountain hunting"" for the barrel to be shortened and the AAC blackout 3pronged flash hider to be pinned to make a total barrel OAL of 16"". There is no flaking or any sign of unprofessional work done to the inside of the barrel, however it looks like there is light handeling marks on the end of the barrel and carbon build up on the flash hider. The upper reciever has some(4-5) light scratches on it, most likely from handling and poor storage by the previous owner. 

The rifle includes standard for end railed enhanced forend with the side rails modified with rubber KAC rail cover and the bottom rail slotted in the forward section for a KAC rail cover. X2 FDE pmags are included as well as the enhanced folding stock and a magpul single point QD sling. There is some light dark scrub marks on the pistol grip most likely from sweaty hands with carbon on them.

Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

This rifle is brand new, still in the box, and is the Ruger 10/22 ATI version.  None of the components on this have been used at all, everything is brand new including the Bushnell 3-9x40 scope, sling, bi-pod, etc.  

This is the cadillac version of the 10/22 with the stainless steel threaded barrel, factory flash suppressor, 6-position collapsible stock, etc.  It's pretty decked out but just not for me, I'm more interested in a 10/22 with a bull barrel, action job and Hogue stock, etc.  I have enough AR's as it is and want a break from the tactical look cause I don't get in gunfights too often here in downtown Portland.  Side note - I also have the premium factory Ruger scope rings for this rifle, those alone will run you about $80 or so.  

So, let me know if you're interested.  Hindsight is always 20/20, of course, but if I could take back my purchase I would have just bought a bone stock 10/22 and invested the extra money in the barrel and stock that I want, already have a brand new Leupold VX II to mount on it, just seems stupid to let all this go to waste if I'm just going to replace all the furniture.  This is a very nice rifle, don't get me wrong, just going for a different look so I don't get laughed at this hunting season when we're out plinking in downtime.

I personally love the rifle and would keep it if I didn't need the money right now. From the bench at 100yrds this rifle is definitely capable of 1"" or smaller groups. 

*I'm the first owner, it has never been abused, is in great shape.

*Has been kept in dehumidified cabinet.

*Pretty but not flashy wood stock with factory Iron Sights.

*Also it is just in time for TN deer season, and the TN Youth Hunts Oct. 26-27

*.243 is a great all-around round for deer, varmints, and carries a lot of power without a huge kick. 

Rifle along with original box. 

""The first time you carry it in the field, youâll understand why itâs considered one of the finest dense-cover rifles in America. Lightning-fast in close quarters and superbly accurate for the long shot, the compact, short-action Model Sevenâ¢ has been a knock-down.""

It's throat gauge is less than one and the rifling is excellent, which means it's rarely been used. The stock has virtually no dings and matches the receiver. This is definitely a collectible model, although it shoots beautifully if you are so inclined (as I hope you are). The pictures do not do this rifle justice.

It is complete, in the original box, with instructions and leather lens cover. The sight is activated by ambient light; you get a large outer ring and inner dot that is projected onto the front lens. Even on a heavy overcast day, this sight works perfectly! 

The operating principle for this sight was taken directly from World War ll. Allied aircraft had similar sights that worked in the same way and were used with great success, with the reticle at the focus of a collimating lens that produces a virtual image of the reticle. The image is reflected off of an angled beam splitter so that the user (looking through the beam splitter will see the image at the focus of the collimating optics superimposed in the sight's field of view in focus at ranges up to infinity with near zero parallax. The inner dot represents 12 inches at 50 yards, while the outer ring is positioned so that the ring itself is always 24 inches from the inner dot.

The nightmare edition is very hard to find. Plus I bought a second magazine that goes with it.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. This is the most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line.

This gun has been to the range only one time. I have shot total of 140 rounds through it. I used 4 different kinds of ammo and it ran flawlessly. 

I am selling this to buy another gun. With the extra magazine , I have over $800 invested. I'm Asking $595 or trade for a Kel-Tec PMR-30 only. Must be willing to sign a purchase agreement. Call or text 419 357 one two two seven. I'm in Mount Washington, Ky."

Under NO circumstances shall the consignee discard the pallet or packaging material until the safe has been determined to be in good working condition and/or all claim issues have been resolved.

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."

WARRANTY INFORMATION
â¢	Lifetime Fire Guarantee (manufacturer warranty) 
Hollon Safe backs all our fireproof safes with a lifetime warranty against fire. We will gladly replace and Hollon Fireproof Safe that has been damaged in a fire with the same or a comparable model to include all freight costs to the original address of purchase. Customers will be required to supply all requested documents to an authorized Hollon Safe representative prior to replacement.
â¢	Limited Warranty (manufacturer warranty) 
Hollon Safe warranties all parts and labor, including all Hollon digital components, on all safes purchased for period of 90 days from date of purchase against manufacture defects. We provide a 2 year warranty on all replacement parts. Extended warranty includes Hollon digital components. Other brand digital components, electronic keypads, will only be warranted for a period of 90 days from date of purchase. Only digital components that are factory installed or installed by a Hollon Safe technician prior to shipment will be covered under this 90 day warranty. Hollon Safe will not warranty any digital component installed on safes that are installed within a floor. This warranty does not cover any damages caused by mishandling, neglect, water, tampering, improper installation, removal and/or reinstallation of the safe. Hollon Safe must be notified within a period of seven days of the receipt of any safe damaged during shipping in order to uphold the warranty and/or damage claims. Warranties on damage claims will only be accepted if the customer has properly executed the outlined Damage and Delivery Policy and Procedures. Re-setting of any combination on a Group II dial lock must performed by a qualified locksmith otherwise the warranty will become void. 

This warranty is valid for the original customer of purchase and is non-transferable. At no time will the warranty cover more than the original purchase price of the safe. At no time will Hollon Safe become liable for the cost of installation and/or removal of a Hollon Safe or any contents or valuables that may be stored in any Hollon Safe. Hollon Safe's sole discretion under this warranty, is at Hollon Safe's own option and own expense. Hollon Safes will repair the defective safe or part, will deliver to the customer the same or comparable safe or part for replacement of the defective part, or if neither of the two previous options is reasonably available, Hollon Safe may, at its own discretion, refund to the customer the original purchase price paid for the defective safe. All safes or parts that are replaced or refunded will become the sole property of Hollon Safe. An authorized Hollon Safe representative must approve all claims against Hollon Safe. All repairs must be approved by a Hollon Safe Representative before any warranty repairs can be completed. If a warranty repair is completed prior to obtaining an approval and a work order number from Hollon Safe, Hollon Safe reserves the right to refuse payment to the service provider or reimbursement to the customer for any unauthorized repairs
â¢	Inspection for Damage Process
All LTL freight deliveries MUST be inspected for damage at the time of delivery. The banding will need to be cut and the box taken off the safe in order for proper inspection. The safe itself should be inspected for any signs of damage to include indentions and friction marks. Any signs of damage MUST be noted on the delivery receipt for any attempt of a discount or refused for a replacement and you MUST notify us within 24 hours. Please note that the driver cannot leave until the delivery receipt is signed for. If you are uncertain of the proper procedures please contact Hollon Safe immediately. Again, Do NOT sign for the shipment until you have thoroughly inspected for any damage. Hollon Safe is not responsible for shipments that are not signed for as damaged upon arrival. Occasionally there may be damage that is not apparent upon receipt of a shipment. Some freight carriers allow up to 15 days from receipt of shipment to accept claims of concealed damage, others do not. After the allowable time of concealed damage claims has passed, Hollon Safe Company cannot assist with freight claims. For this type of damage, a replacement safe is not an option. Any discount will be given once the claim has been approved. 

All freight shipped via Hollon Safe is shipped in an upright position, banded down to a wooden pallet. Any signs of damage, freight not being delivered upright position are justified reasons for the customer to require further inspection of the actual freight itself. If the damage is minimal and acceptable to the consignee, they will be required to make note of the damage on the delivery receipt at time of delivery prior to signing the delivery receipt. Under NO circumstances shall the consignee discard the pallet or packaging material until the safe has been determined to be in good working condition and/or all claim issues have been resolved. When the delivery receipt is signed by the consignee in good condition. Failure to follow the procedures above will remove all liability of damage from Hollon Safe and require the consignee to file any claims against the carrier themselves..
