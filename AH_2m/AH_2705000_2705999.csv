The A3 is a higher quality rifle than the GI model(which is very common at the moment) in that it has HK hand guards, a beautiful black powder coat finish, a picatinny rail welded to the upper receiver and its tolerances are tighter, resulting in greater accuracy. The EOTech is night vision compatible and takes AA batteries. This is a great setup for someone looking for a little more power than the AR platform. The rifles comes with a case and four mags. I'm only selling this as I have to make room for a new toy. I would consider selling the EOTech separately and vice versa. I'm pricing this as a package but feel free to make an offer on either."

The Tanfoglio Witness pistol is one of the most versatile designs in the industry today. Witness pistols are produced in Italy, in the heart of the famous ""Valley of the Gun."" Over twenty years of experience is molded into each and every Tanfoglio product. Witness pistols are produced on state of the art machinery, providing each owner with quality craftsmanship and classic styling. 

The Witness pistol incorporates several unique design features that have produced a truly outstanding weapons platform. From the second you grab hold of a Tanfoglio, you'll notice the superior ergonomics and feel the Witness pistol has become famous for. The ergonomic grip allows the pistol to be grasped in such a way that it points more naturally. The ""slide in frame"" design produces a lower profile pistol, which places the sights closer to the axis of the pistol's bore, further enhancing accuracy. The more natural a pistol feels and points, the better you will shoot. 

You can easily convert your Witness steel or polymer frame pistol to shoot .22 LR, 9x 19mm, 10 mm, .38 Super, .40 S&W, or .45 ACP. No matter what your need, one gun can do it all. No other platform gives you the choices, versatility, and value found in the Tanfoglio Witness. Whether you're a competitive shooter, firearms enthusiast, or armed professional, the Witness product line can fill all your needs. Quality, value, comfort, accuracy and dependability. EAA Witness...No Limit ! European American Armory is proud to be the exclusive importer of Tanfoglio products in the USA.

They finished it with 8 coats of hand rubbed oil finish and then sent it to Colt Firearms where a Lady who is one of there top Master Engravers did the awesome Flure De Lure wrap around checkering with Thumb Strap. Ive shot this rifle out to 600 yards at the range and it runs circles around my friends 338 Lapua.

The M95 was the service weapon used by the Austro-Hungarians during WW1, and most M95s were then sold to Bulgaria in the 1930s and used by the Bulgarian Army during WW2.  It uses a unique straight pull action, which I found is faster and smoother than a traditional bolt action.

The first carbine is an original M95 'Stutzen' carbine, produced in 1915 in Budapest, Hungary.  All numbers match.  It comes with the original stock, but it has a small crack behind the tang, which should be repairable.  It is currently residing in a second, mismatched stock for shooting purposes.  It includes an original Bulgarian sling.

The second carbine is a M95/30 carbine, produced in 1916 in Steyr, Austria. It was originally a M95 long rifle that was later modified to carbine length by the Bulgarian Army in the 1930s.  It retains the original long rifle rear sight.  All numbers match, including the stock (though the stock and receiver were renumbered to match by the Bulgarians).

Interestingly, the markings show that this Austrian-made M95 was not used by the Austro-Hungarian Imperial Army like most M95s. Instead, it was used by the Hungarian Honvédség, which was the Hungarian territorial army. Both Austria and Hungary had home defense armies, independent of the joint Imperial Army.

Both carbines are S-marked for 8x56R ammo.  Both were refurbished by the Bulgarians after WW2, and are in very good condition with no mechanical issues.  Both have very good but somewhat frosty bores with prominent rifling.


Also included in the package are 445 rounds of 8x56R FMJ ammo, 29 enbloc clips, and 10 once-fired brass cases:
130 rounds of Austrian Nazi-headstamped ammo on clips and in the original boxes
10 rounds of Austrian Nazi-headstamped ammo on clips (no boxes)
100 rounds of loose Austrian Nazi-headstamped ammo
110 rounds of loose Bulgarian ammo
90 rounds of boxed Prvi Partizan 208 gr. FMJ (Reloadable!  Boxer primed and brass cased.)
10 once-fired Prvi brass cases
5 rounds of Prvi Partisan FMJ on a clip
(Ammo can not included).


For the entire package of two carbines and all the ammo and clips, I'm asking $850 OBO.  I'd prefer not to split up the package at this time, but I'd consider it for the right deal.  The carbines must ship to a 01 or 03 FFL if going to an out-of-state buyer, and the buyer is responsible for all shipping costs.  Face-to-face deals will require a copy of your AR DL or AR CHL, since I have to log these out of my C&R Bound Book.

Cash only for a face-to-face deal in Northwest Arkansas.  If shipping, I'll accept payment by USPS Money Order or certified bank check only.

I'm also interested in trading for one or more of the items listed below, +/- cash as needed.

Let me know if you have any questions, or would like photos of anything else in particular.  Feel free to email me through the Armslist contact form, or text me at four 7 nine - two 8 three - three 7 7 nine."

In one of the pictures you will see rosewood grips on the gun, and I do have them and will include them for an additional $40.
    The gun is in overall good condition, with just a bit of holster wear around the muzzle. I had this gun proffesionally cerakoted when it.was new. The gunsmith dissasembled the gun and cerakoted the frame, cylinder and barrel but left the hammer, shell ejector and a couple other frame parts stainless. The end result is a beautiful custom Ruger.  $300 is what I will take foot it and please don't ask me what my bottom price is, I repeat $300 is what I will take for it.
Please call or text if you are interested. I don't have ammo to include but.do have a few factory rounds you can fire thru it at my range. REDACTED"

Full D knuckle-duster guard. Leather sheath. Measures 13 3/8"" overall with a 8 3/4"" blade. 

The grip scales are celluloid, which dates the knife to pre-1920 or earlier, the style is of other fighting knives of the WW1 period, and the blade is etched with a reference to Pancho Villa: ""...mí no me asusta un león, mucho menos si es panzó"" or ""I'm not scared of a lion, much less if he's pot-bellied."" Pancho Villa was known as the Lion of the North and also was made fun of as a chubby man with a potbelly.

The Pershing expedition created a business boom in Mexico and this was most likely a souvenir sold to one of the US troops.

The other side of the blade is engraved with a running lion. There are 2 or 3 small chips on both sides of the grips. The blade is tarnished with some light rusting as shown, but ought to clean up nicely.

Message regarding: FS/FT Gen 3 Glock 29. 10mm with a ton extras

Realistically how much do u want cause your asking more than a gun shop wants brand new please be reasonable and I'm a serious person of interest

REMEMBER: Avoid scams by dealing locally and NEVER send money to sellers without using a trusted escrow service. ""


Glock 29 with 2 10 round mags is $575

Glock 20 mags ""15"" Rounders are $30 each 4 total is $120

Glock 29 mags 10 rounder are $30 each 3 extra is $90

Night sights $100 + install. Pistol comes with 2 sets of night sights one of them installed. $200 well say they were installed for free.

Critical def. 100 rounds 5 box's $25 a box. $125

PMC 200gr fmj 50 round box $32

Ghost 3.5lb rocket dissconnector with armors plate $30

Blackhawk Sepra $45

Blackhawk dual mag holster $27

2 dual mag paddle holsters $20 each $40 total. 
So total for the package before any tax or shipping is. $1284.  So that's $584 cheaper then new before any tax.  So if you buy the extras that's pretty much getting the Glock 29 for Free. This is the best glock deal on armslist. Others do not come close to the extras or price."

Actually for no less than what Bass Pro Shops is going to charge you while they more than likely have a guy with no experience running your knife through an electric or pull-through sharpener removing unnecessary amounts of metal and drastically reducing the life span of your blade. I can provide you a better looking edge, sharper than you can imagine (hair whittling to be exact--I can provide pictures of some split hairs if you'd like), that is longer lasting while saving blade life and not affecting the steel's heat treat. I do not and will never use a grinder on your knives as I treat your knives as I do my own. I use a combination of diamonds and Japanese water stones to achieve my laser sharp edges. 

If you value your good knives and want to take care of them, don't give them to a guy with a belt sander at the gun show or local shop. I've seen too many $300+ knives ruined by people who use power equipment and don't know what they're doing. I'm an engineer in my day job so naturally I'm OCD about things...and knife edges are one of them, so perfection is what I strive for.

**Rates as of January 2015**
Rates have been simplified to make it much easier on everyone and fairly reflect time and effort involved for each type knife as all are carefully hand sharpened to precise angles.

All folding knives and hunting or tactical fixed blades will be sharpened to a scalpel sharp, mirror polished 30,000 grit edge. (Can vary on case by case basis) 

All kitchen knives will be sharpened to a razor sharp 1,000 grit edge better suited for general food preparation. (I will do 30k grit by request only as some chefs prefer a finer edge) 

Single blade folding knives and fixed blades up to 5"" - $20
Single blade folding knives and fixed blades over 5"" - $30

Kitchen knives - $2 per inch 
(30k edge for chef's knives by request only - $4 per inch)

Blade shapes such as tanto or double bevel - $10 adder

Items I do not sharpen include hair shears, chisels, and woodworking tools. I will sharpen regular scissors, and I can sharpen serrated edges no problem.  

Rates can vary on a case by case basis if it's a knife that's just really odd or unusual or one that's really messed up.

If you're interested, or would like more details, feel free to contact me for email/cell info. On most days I'm in the Inverness and Vestavia areas so we can make arrangements on the pickup and drop-offs of your knives. Don't settle with dull knives...a dull knife is an unsafe knife! 

All sharpenings are guaranteed to be the sharpest edge you've ever experienced or your money back.

Feel free to request videos of the level of sharpness I can achieve including whittling hairs and other sharpness tests. For many more pictures of my work, search for Professional Knife Sharpening on Birmingham Craigslist.
