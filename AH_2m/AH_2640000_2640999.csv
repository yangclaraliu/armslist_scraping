Sightmark® Pistol Laser Boresights provide the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in pistols specific to the bore sight’s caliber. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the pistol is aiming; it’s easy to sight in your firearm or scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the firearm being sighted to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any pistol. The bore sights are easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is available in the most common calibers for use with the most popular pistols.

Blue one is pretty much complete. 45k on the motor,I crank and let it run often, axles with detroit lockers front and rear, 5 speed tranny etc. Hit in side at a redlight, not fixable but a great truck when it was hit.

The reason I am selling it is that I ended up getting a 16"" barrel and this forearm is too long. This is my first build and I guess you live and learn...

It is absolutely new and contains all parts and original instructions.  There are no scratches or blemishes of any type. Fits on standard barrel nut. Only ship to US locations.

Product Information: SKU:  STRX-AL1-15BT-01 

Shop more Troy products  The Troy Industries AR-15 Alpha Battle Rail is a modular, free floating handguard that incorporates light weight, strength, simplicity and versatility into a slim, aesthetically pleasing package. Building off of the legendary TRX Extreme design, the Alpha Rail maintains the distinctive look and feel of the original, but utilizes a vastly improved low profile locking mechanism for installation onto the host rifle. The new locking system makes use of the factory barrel nut, meaning its removal is no longer necessary. 

 The Alpha Rail is constructed of 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum that is finished with a mil-spec hard coat anodizing for durability. With a full length top rail and the ability to accept modular rail sections along the handguard's circumference, the Alpha Rail is highly configurable by the end user and able to accommodate any number of tactical accessories with ease. Each handguard comes complete with 3 detachable rail sections and all of the necessary hardware. Made in the USA.

Also have a Grendel P-30 that I bought new back in the day.
It is a 22 magnum pistol, it looks like an early KelTec because that's where KelTec came from. Like an early pmr30 PMR-30
She holds 30 rounds and I have 2 magazines which is a lot of fire power for your pocket, purse or backpack. Also comes with belt holster, just over 100 RDS of ammo, owners manual and a hard case.
Would like to trade it up or down for a decent 1911 so I'm in the $500 range.
There are a couple more out there listed in other states for $575 & $725

Lastly, I have a Ruger 10/22 rifle that came new with an adjustable Tapco stock, tactical style. Has a scope/picittiny rail but I am keeping my Aim point sight. I can include a scope, but I don't have any mounts right now. Several magazines.
Oil filter and adapter is (SOLD/Gone)  for catching oily barrel patches and solvent.   
$350 trade????

There are some scratches on the barrel from my duck boat and a few marks in the camo dip.  Seriously a great gun and if you aren't gonna take it out and use it every chance you get like I have then keep looking.  Also comes with a kicks high flyer choke that I only put about two boxes of steel through it after I put it on.  Interested in trades but would like a cash offer.

The Desert Eagle is precision machined to strict military standards from high quality steel. The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy. The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear and enhances the obturation between the bullet and the bore, thus increasing accuracy. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position,permitting rapid change of magazine and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing. 

The 7/8"" dovetail rib on the barrel has cross slots to accommodate scope rings.

I bought this brand new pistol new two years ago from a local gunshop, fired one box of ammo thru it when I got it home for a function check, all functions perfect and it is very accurate, then I cleaned it and put it on a carpeted shelf in my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched since until just now when I took it out to take these pictures. Comes with custom exotic wood grips and three 10 rd factory magazines. Also comes with factory box, original grips, keys for the internal lock, and owner's manual.  Has a conventional safety that also functions as a hammer drop lever, and it has a built in rail for mounting light and/or laser. I am soon to retire and I have too many like new guns that I never use to take into retirement with me, this is one of them. This pistol is MSP approved for sale/ownership in Maryland. Must go thru an FFL for transfer, buyer pays FFL and MSP fees, must go thru a mutually agreeable gunshop located from Annapolis south to anywhere in Southern Maryland to transfer and I will not transfer at a MSP barracks as I have found them to be rude and unpleasant to deal with. Payment to be made to me in full in cash when we meet at the gunshop for you and I to do the MSP transfer paperwork; my part of the transaction is complete at that point and you pick up the pistol from that gunshop when your MSP approval comes in. You must have a MSP HQL license to buy a handgun in MD now.  Not interested in trades of any sort or counter offers, I am not desperate to sell. Pictures show 2 magazines but there are four 10 rd magazines included in this deal. I can send you more pictures upon request. thanks for looking, pls email with any questions. I have plenty of .38 Super if you need some to go with it, $20 per 50 rd box of Winchester white box 130 gr +P FMJ.

Rifle 7.62mm 2A/2A1 (also known as the Ishapore 2A/2A1) is a 7.62mm NATO (7.62×51mm) calibre bolt-action rifle adopted as a reserve arm by the Indian Armed Forces in 1963. The design of the rifle - initially the Rifle 7.62mm 2A - began at the Ishapore Rifle Factory of the Ordnance Factories Board in India.

The Ishapore 2A and 2A1 rifles are often incorrectly described as "".308 conversions"". In fact, the 2A/2A1 rifles are not conversions of .303 calibre SMLE Mk III* rifles: they were designed and built right from the outset to fire 7.62mm NATO ammunition.

I also have 300 rounds of .40 S&W Winchester hollow point ammo that I can work into the deal.  Everything in the picture is yours for $400 or $350.00 without the light.  Buy the gun and you can have the ammo for $145 (probably would cost 190-210 in the store).  This is less than .50/round for hollow points.  You absolutely will not be disappointed with the pistol!! S&W put a lot of value into these guns.   I'll meet you at the range if you want to shoot it (you pay for the range and ammo-no reloads).  You will love this gun!  A great gun and 300 self defense rounds for 545.00.  Ammo will only be sold separately if the gun buyer doesn't choose to buy it."

The Python is a 6 inch and is early 70's with original grip serial starts with a V and has 6 digits....at some point it has been re-finished and looks very good.  I have shot it once and it was wonderful but it is too long for me.  

The King Cobra is newer and is a 4 inch.  This one has holster wear at the end of the barrel on both sides.  I had originally paid $850 for it with the thought of using it for my woods-gun but even with the holster wear, it is still too nice for me.  So I bought a cheap .357 that I do not mind dropping in the mud or whatever might come up.

I am pricing the two together at a steal price in the hopes of not having to drive very far.  The first $1,800 cash gets them both.  I am in Vancouver, WA but am open to driving as far as Kelso as I do get up that way frequently.  Must be able to legally own firearms.  I need to see a WDL and do a bill of sale just for my own records.  A CPL would be nice.

Made in Belgium. The best.
This is a fine weapon that I bought new in 1994, that I have rarely shot, maybe a box or two in 20 years and the gun looks the part. The finish is spectacular as are the original Pachmayr grips that Browning sent on the gun from the factory. This is a low production gun, rarely seen anymore, and the only one I have like it. You may not ever see another like it.
I have been a lifelong shooter/collector/hobbyist and this one is a nice one.
I have the original case it came in and I have the original Browning manual in the plastic sleeve it came packed in, along with 2 mags too. This is a time capsule Browning High Power for the shooter that loves Browning guns and you aren't likely to see a chance to buy another soon.
Not at all a must sell gun, Im happy to keep it in the safe unless I get a Browning fan to adopt it, or trade me something I'm equally attracted to. I can trade up or down, guns and cash either way. Try me if you have a trade to offer and we can see how it goes, no low end guns unless you understand they are low end guns, and priced appropriately.
You can reach me at REDACTED. Text anytime, no calls after 9 pm please.

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

Questions? Shoot me a message.  Cash FTF in Fridley or Burnsville.

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only, shipping additional.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.

ALL firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP regardless of firearm type.  Overkill yes, but that's how I roll these days.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Cheers,
