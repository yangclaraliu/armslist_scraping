Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

Ahw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, my friends are in New York so it's a tough one at 52 years as y'all know! Well, this is just about my favorite. I actually tested it by shooting it, but you can see it was just when I got it in 2009 and it's basically NIB. This is factory engraved with carved Pearl grips, and the factory ones are with it too. Nickel plated and in .45 colt there's not a mark on it and it was factory engraved 'B'. I will also include a custom Meineke Alligator holster for those of you would want to carry it... there's really nothing better too! I will also include the Ivory grips fitted by Jerry Meacham to her also! I'm just a collector so it's Cashiers check, money order and please ask any questions you'd like. I try to honestly work with collectors that have 100% review as I am honest myself and even though this does cost some money, you're also not going to find another unless the dealer wants much more for the same thing! The trigger has been tuned too, and it's been sitting in my safe for this day when I certainly never thought I'd be selling my collection, but I guess life is like that, and you never know.... The buyer pays for shipping, and incidentally it's not going to be 20.00 in the mail either. This will go out overnight by UPS to your dealer insured and guaranteed! Neither of us will take the chance of destruction or misplacing... not for this! Thanks, and good luck!"

Ahw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, my friends are in New York so it's a tough one at 52 years as y'all know! Well, this is just about my favorite. I actually tested it by shooting it, but you can see it was just when I got it in 2009 and it's basically NIB. This is factory engraved with carved Pearl grips, and the factory ones are with it too. Nickel plated and in .45 colt there's not a mark on it and it was factory engraved 'B'. I will also include a custom Meineke Alligator holster for those of you would want to carry it... there's really nothing better too! I will also include the Ivory grips fitted by Jerry Meacham to her also! I'm just a collector so it's Cashiers check, money order and please ask any questions you'd like. I try to honestly work with collectors that have 100% review as I am honest myself and even though this does cost some money, you're also not going to find another unless the dealer wants much more for the same thing! The trigger has been tuned too, and it's been sitting in my safe for this day when I certainly never thought I'd be selling my collection, but I guess life is like that, and you never know.... The buyer pays for shipping, and incidentally it's not going to be 20.00 in the mail either. This will go out overnight by UPS to your dealer insured and guaranteed! Neither of us will take the chance of destruction or misplacing... not for this! Thanks, and good luck!"

The real beauty of this system is that 1 remote works all 3 lighting banks. And since there's 3 remotes, you can put them in various places.

I've got 3 of the light systems in the link above.  These are radio frequency controlled, so the on/off remote can be put anywhere, it doesn't have to point at the lighting fixture to control it. You can actually have it anywhere in the safe or even in the room it's in. I had the remote in the door hanger.

The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test.

Swing the cam levers out to 90 degrees and pull the barrel and gas tube free of the receiver. Change the bolt or simply have a new carrier/bolt set up ready, install and done. Can be achieved in seconds. 
The truly unique part of the MGI Hydra is the lower receiver. The problem with multi cal AR15s always revolves around the magazine well. 7.62x39 ar15 magazines are renowned for their unreliability, Pistol calibers for their finicky magazine blocks, and limitations of calibers by the size of the mag well. MGI fixed that in this design. The magazine well slide into and locks on machined rails in the receiver. Yes...the magazine well is removable. The magazine wells take the ammunition's native magazine. The 7.62x39 takes AK mags, 9mm takes glock mags with no block needed. Everything from .22lr to .50 beouwulf is already available. Conversion Kits can be ordered directly from MGI and come with magazine well barrel and bolt specific to the caliber and the mag well specific to magazine used. They are also the only ones offering a .308/762x51 conversion in an AR15 (not AR10 frame) by using their mag well and magazine.....why have to carry several rifles or have to keep several on hand. One AR can do it all. Saves space and carry loads.

Product Description

Combine the appeal of the traditional lever action rifle, add the quality and handling of a Browning, mix in a little bit of rimfire fun and the result is the Browning BL-22. With a forged steel receiver, short throw lever and crisp trigger, it is always ready to take on a walk in the woods, knock over a few tin cans or even put some dinner on the table. Unlike many 22s, the quality of a BL-22 is evident from first glance, with beautiful fit and finish and accuracy to match. A BL-22 is certainly a rimfire rifle meant to be used and enjoyed now and for generations to come. Blued barrel on a walnut stock.

I have for sale a custom AR-15 upper receiver I built in 2010. It is piston operated, built extremely durable and will shoot in any conditions you can throw at it! It shoots at 1-2 MOA at 100 meters, although with match ammo I have shot sub MOA. The barrel is 13.7"" with a permanent attached flash. Below is the parts list, thanks for looking.

Barrel is Wylde chambered, so there will be no issue with running .223 Remington or NATO 5.56 mm. The upper receiver also has M4 feed ramps. I built this upper for heavy abuse in sandy environments. I am looking for $1250 with the folding sights. I also have the EoTech XPS holographic red dot sight. It is the military version with night vision settings, and has been upgraded with a GG&G AccuCam Lever. I am looking for $550 which is an awesome deal! If you buy the upper and the EoTech I will take $1700, that is $100 off! This build will mate up to any AR lower receiver, and it saves you the headache of finding, purchasing and shipping all the parts. Also the gunsmithing prices. When the barrel was resized, the gas ports have to be custom tuned to operate the firearm properly. Everything has been done and ready to go shoot. It has about 750 rounds through it, plenty of life left in this upper. Also including a surefire tactical light with pressure switch and inferred cover for night vision use , all for an extra $150. $1850 total for a ready to rock upper receiver!"

Product Description

Light, slender, and quick-pointing never described a semi-auto better than the Benelli Montefeltro. The Inertia Driven system allows the Montefeltro's fore-end to be slim and graceful, while the anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the added advantage of a semi-auto and the feel of a classic game gun.

The GLOCK 22 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this model of perfection that the majority of law enforcement across the country put their trust in every day. The Modular Back Strap design of the G22 Gen4 lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G22 Gen4 .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

Product Description

The Ruger M77 Hawkeye rifles are the latest iteration of one of America's classic modern firearms. Placing special emphasis on features shooters want, like the crisp LC6 trigger and contoured and checkered stock, Ruger Hawkeye rifles deliver a level of performance and value. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye rifles are available in blued & walnut or synthetic & stainless configurations, and are chambered in a wide variety of popular cartridges, including the .375 Ruger. In addition, these bolt-action rifles contain all the value-added characteristics of yesterday's Ruger rifles, including a positive floor plate latch, integral scope mounts, a three-position safety, and a hammer-forged barrel.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

718,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2619718,For Sale:  Regent 1911 .45 ACP 1911A1 G.I. Government type,"NW Reno, Reno, Nevada",$ 400,"Listed On: Monday, January 27, 2014",Handguns,Interstate Arms                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Here we are looking at a variation of the 1911A1 design called the Regent R100. The R100 is built in Turkey  by a company called TISAS, and imported into the US by Interstate Arms . The Turks build some good guns, and this Regent looks pretty much likea GI 45 ACP 1911A1, with a couple of exceptions.

The Regent has a firing pin safety (like the Colt MKIV/series 80) that is activated by the trigger.  Unless the trigger is held to the rear, the firing pin cannot contact the primer of the cartridge,even if dropped. The entire pistol, with the exception of the grips, is made of steel. The grips are brown GI style plastic. The exterior of the pistol is finished in a matte black, with the exception of the stainless steel barrel, which is left in its natural color.
The high-quality, stainless steel, hammer-forged, 5-inch barrel has been throated, apparently by hand with a polishing tool, as some minor toolmarks are in evidence. It exhibits the correct amount of setback from the frame's feed ramp. The feed ramp exhibits no visible toolmarks. The barrel hood has the proper tolerances with the slide required of a service sidearm. The barrel bushing can be removed and installed by hand. Thus, an M1911 bushing wrench is neither supplied nor required. 

The pistol's internal components are also of high quality and are without visible burrs or machining marks. Almost all aftermarket components and accessories can be installed on the Regent R100. Thus, starting with the basic pistol, you bring it up to your own customized specifications that do not require gunsmithing. 

The Regent R100 is a good, affordable, well-built 1911 style pistol. 
It is built of steel, easy to shoot, and easy to shoot well.

No box or papers, just the pistol and two (2) 7 round magazines. This one only has about 4 magazines shot through it since new.

It is a red dot sight with no magnification that is a compact/mini optic designed for rifles, shotguns and/or handguns.  I have mounted it to my AR15 and my Desert Eagle and it functions perfectly.  It will mount to any weapon with a M1913/Weaver style mount or rail system.  Power is 1x with a 4 MOA reticle, uses a 3203 battery found at pretty much any Wal-Mart, Best Buy and many more.

Optic is used but in almost new condition.  The box has more wear and tear than the optic.  On a 1-10 scale (10 being best) it would be a nine in my opinion.

Will ship at your expense but would prefer face to face meeting in the Bloomington, IN area.  Feel free to email, will send more photos as needed.  I wanted to post a picture here of the optic on a weapon but Craigslist told me that was a big no no and blocked it.
