From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.

What sets it apart from the 92FS is: 

A. Distinctive military style markings: on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.
B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.
C. “Dot-and-Post” sight system: clones that of the M9.

It was made using a 20"" barreled 597 to make the firearms overall length meet the federal guidelines 26"" minimum OVERALL rimfire rifle length there by also surpassing the guideline for 16"" minimum rimfire barrel length. There is no optic included so you would need to supply your own reflex sight red dot scope what ever you prefer. This was a brand new rifle that was bought to put into this stock I also have a original stock that can go with it if you would like. The clear 30rd mag has been used the black one is new. This is a very fun unique well functioning firearm that is a very close replica to the real FN p90 dimensions weight firing characteristics all similar yet fires the much less expensive .22lr.

create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he

Only about 1,850 of the SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. and that includes military/police and civilian use. Now about 89 these were changed to a fixed stock version with a smaller 6 round mag vs the pre 89 which were 8 round and collapsible stock. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market it has been featured in films, several video games and of course TV shows. The coolest feature is the ability to switch from pump to semi automatic. Now as far as military or police applications this allows lower impact rounds such as tear gas bean bags or rubber bullets which generally do not create enough gas pressure to cycle a round allowing the user the ability to manually extract and reload. But in civilian sector especially home defense mode this gun can be stored without a round in the chamber and as you are aware there isn't a criminal anywhere on earth that doesn't know the very distinct sound of a pump shotgun loading a round...... can you say pucker effect. The coolest thing is that once you pump it once it can instantly be in semi auto so if you miss your target on the first shot the criminal may stick his stupid head up thinking you forgot to pump the shotgun to reload, bang he's dead. This has only been fired 20-25 times it has been in climate controlled storage in a gun safe since mid 80's this is the roughest toughest shotgun anywhere."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

If you know a knife collector, the classic Living History Series would make an excellent, much appreciated gift. This unique Limited Edition series features handles made from trees taken from historic grounds.

The handle of the Alamo Living History Knife is made from a large limb of a live oak that grows on the Alamo grounds.


The Browning Alamo Knife model 002
Model 002 by Browning: Gen. D. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's men outnumbered Col. William Travis' troops 6,000 to 200. Before noon on March 6th, 1836, Travis, Jim Bowie, David Crockett and the remaining defenders fell, making the ultimate sacrifice for their families and the future of the Republic of Texas. Alamo Knife model 002 Living History Series by Browning. The Alamo Bowie celebrates the Alamo, Travis and Jim Bowie. The hand-turned handle is taken from a large limb of a live oak that grows on the Alamo grounds. The familiar blade is 14"" long and is crafted from high-carbon steel, hand-forged over a 10-day period. Hand forging adds strength to the knife and was a common manufacturing practice during that time period, although it is rarely practiced today. The blade is engraved on both sides with historical tributes to the men who fought and died at the Alamo. On each side is a single gold star for the fabled Lone Star of Texas. The blade is engraved with William Travis' poignant words ""Give me help, oh my country"" and has a certificate of authenticity.

Only 1,836 will be made, representing the year of the Battle of the Alamo.
Overall Length: 15""
Blade Length: 10""
Blade Steel: 420 HC
Bolster: Brass 	Blade Engraving: ""Give Me Help, Oh My Country""

Before making this knife, designer Jerry Fisk visited the Alamo. He wanted to get a first hand feel for the history of the place and the rare live oak wood that would be part of his creation. With each carving he said, It was an unbelievable feeling to be able to touch and feel the history in his hands. The Alamo knife defines both his passion for history and a turning point in the American Story. The wood used in the handle of the Alamo knife was a large limb on a live oak tree that grows on the grounds of the Alamo. In the years following the Battle of the Alamo, the Daughters of the Republic of Texas planted several live oaks at the shrine to refurbish the battle stricken historic site. Only the wood of a dead limb was used, as the live oak continues to stand in silent testimony to the courage and bravery of every man who fought in the Battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836. In 2003, American Forests in conjunction with the Alamo site harvested wood from a dead limb for use in this project. The live oak continues to stand at the Alamo in observance of lives lost in prolific times.

In 1822, Stephen Austin led the first American settlers to Mexican Texas. The settlers had little in common with the Mexicans language, religion, or customs and they lived in fear of one culture dominating the other. By Fall 1835, Austin wrote, War is our only resource, referring to the new dictatorship of General Lopez de Santa Anna and his brother-in-law, General Perfecto de Cos. A confrontation was inevitable when garrison forces left less than a hundred men to protect San Antonio against Mexican cavalry. Those who came to protect the town were legendary Jim Bowie with nineteen men; Col. William Travis with twenty five men; and frontiersmen Davy Crockett and twelve Tennesseans. In total, 180 men entrenched at The Alamo, a mission established in 1718, and faced 5,000 of Santa Anna's troops. From February 24 until March 6, 1836, The Alamo was under siege and attack, ending with the Texans firing one remaining cannon and wiped out in hand-to-hand combat.

I shall never surrender or retreat. Then, I call on you in the name of Liberty, of patriotism, and everything dear to the American character, to come to our aid with all dispatch. VICTORY OR DEATH, said William Barrett Travis as he desperately called for reinforcements to protect the fortified mission, just days before the arrival of General D. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna's Mexican forces on February 23, 1836. The Alamo, originally named the Mission San Antonio de Valero, was established in 1718 as a Spanish mission intended to teach native Indians about the Christian faith. In 1836, Lt. Col. William Travis and James Bowie shared command of the army of Texas volunteers, as they occupied the Alamo in a desperate attempt to stop enemy forces from advancing into Anglo settlements.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety.
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Comes complete and as new with case, allen wrench, and paperwork.

The Lyman Deluxe 3-Die Rifle Sets most unique feature is a Carbide Sizing Button Assembly that is super hard and slick, eliminating the need for inside the neck case lube and prevents case stretching resulting in reduced case trimming. Another feature of the Lyman Carbide Sizing Button Assembly is the button can be adjusted so the user can maximize the leverage available at different positions in the operation of the press lever. The Carbide Sizing Button is used in the loaders choice of a Full Length Sizing Die and a Neck Sizing Die included in the 3 Die set along with a Bullet Seating Die.

Technical Information

Material: Steel

Die Types Included:
Full Length Sizing Die this die sizes case back to factory dimensions.
Neck Sizing Die this die only sizes the neck of the case leaving the case the exact size of the chamber it was fired in. This also will not over-work the brass and results in longer case life.
Bullet Seating Die (with roll crimp)

Accessories:
Plastic Storage Case

Leather Bianchi inside the belt holster Two magazines, One original and one Pro mag, Original Box and manual and key lock. as well as included trigger lock. In close to new condition Less than 100 rounds fired. 7 rounds plus 1in the chamber capacity The Thunder 380 has a light aluminum alloy frame that reduces weight for easier carry, yet the pistol still retains enough mass (weight) to help tame recoil. Due to the small frame, the pistol is very well suited for all sizes of hands small to large. I personally have large hands and the gun is very comfortable to hold. My daughter has small hands and she holds it very comfortably as well. The magazines, however are designed with an extra section of grip, so that all fingers of the firing hand are accommodated. The blowback, fixed-barrel design theoretically aids accuracy, and it appears that the vast majority of Thunder 380 users report favorably on that issue. The nearly straight-in alignment of the chamber and the topmost cartridge in the magazine seems to be responsible for the pistol's reliable chambering and cycling. The frame features a long rearward tang over the grips, which effectively protects the shooter's thumb web from hammer-bite or slide-bite. There are several safety features built into the Thunder 380: a slide mounted manual safety and decocker that blocks the hammer, a magazine disconnect safety that prevents firing if a magazine is not inserted, a long double-action (DA) first trigger pull, an inertial firing pin, and (in some models) an integral key-operated trigger lock. Some versions also feature an automatic firing pin block. The pistol has a rear sight windage adjustment. The Value of the extras alone are close to $200.00 so at this price this gun is a steal!"

I have a barely used Eastwood Heavy Duty parts Tumbler. It is in excellent condition, but a little dusty. It has both sanding and polishing media for small parts and has 2 12"" bowls to keep the types of media separate. This works excellent at getting rust and surface discoloration out of the smallest crevasses. This Tumblers model number is 13384. I used this for a motorcycle restoration and didn't use it for more than and hr or 2.

This is more of a feeler ad to see what offers I might be interested in. I have a 1999 Honda CR250r that I am interested in selling/trading. I'm mainly looking to get rid of it because I have no way of transporting the bike any longer. The bike has sat in my garage for over a year and I feel that it is time for it to go to someone else who can actually enjoy it. The bike is bone stock with the exception of the handle bars being replaced a while back. I'm pretty firm on the price of the bike, but am open to offers and trades.

PROS: 
Mechanically sound
Runs great
Absolutely no issues with the bike
Comes with both Rear Paddle & nobby tires
Comes with Jack stand 
Comes with Triangle bike stand
Comes with 2 gas cans. One has gas in it.


CONS: 
Plastic is slightly rough on one side.
Fatty pipe has a small dent, but does not affect the bike in any way.
I no longer have the title for the bike. I went to register the title into my name with the DMV and because the bike was previously registered in another state, they required me to take the bike down to the DMV to have them inspect the VIN. Because I have had no way to transport the bike, I was unable to comnplete this and they are still holding the title at this time."

The Warthog is the original super-compact .45 pistol with truly awesome firepower. The pistol's compact frame makes it easy to carry into any situation, yet the small size won't mean a sacrifice in stopping power. The contoured grip and beavertail grip safety give you control over the pistol, without having to risk hammer bite. The Warthog's hammer and trigger are skeletonized for added speed while single-action pistol features fixed 3-dot sights and two 10-round magazines.

The Liberty Tree Knife
Model 001 by Browning: In the pre-Revolutionary times, Great Britain sought to prevent colonial rebellion by forbidding colonists to meet privately. To be found meeting in secret was punishable by death. In response, each of the thirteen colonies selected a special tree, called a liberty tree, and designated it as their secret meeting place. Under the haven of Liberty Trees, leading colonists devised plans of rebellion against British control.

The last liberty tree 	The wood handle of the Liberty Tree knife is carved from the last surviving Liberty Tree. This 400-year old tulip poplar stood on the grounds of St. Johns College in Annapolis, Maryland. Having outlived its species by 100 years, the tree witnessed the most significant moments leading to the development of the United States. The 9"" blade of this special knife is hand-forged steel with brass bolsters and two brass stars set in the 5"" long handle. It is engraved with ""The Unanimous Declaration of the Thirteen United States of America,"" and has a certificate of authenticity. Only 1,776 to honor the year of America's declaration of liberty will be produced.

Browning’s Living History knives received the Shooting Industry’s Knife of the Year award.
Overall Length: 14""
Blade Length: 9""
Steel: 420 HC
Bolster: Brass 	Engraving: ""The Unanimous Declaration Of The Thirteen United States of America""

If you were given a chunk of America's past, a piece so rare its likes will never be seen again, and you wanted to make a lasting memorial that paid homage to the past, was beautiful and reverent, you would make the Liberty Tree Knife. The nation's last remaining Liberty Tree, a towering tulip poplar, stood in Annapolis , Maryland on the grounds of St. John's College. The tree was about 400 years old, had withstood time, lightning strikes, bug infestations and student pranks, but disease and old age, combined with Hurricane Floyd in 1999, finally took its toll. The tulip poplar was 100 years older than a typical tree of this kind is expected to live. A Maryland landscaper salvaged the wood and sought organizations who would utilize it with reverence. In 2001, The Providence Forum, a Philadelphia based non-profit educational organization, purchased the remaining Liberty Tree wood and began a preservation and educational program through the development of gifts honoring American history and American heroes. World renowned artisan, Eugene Landon, was commissioned to craft a series of historic items to be presented to American citizens and organizations that best represent duty to country and honor to God. The Providence Forum incorporated the Liberty Tree wood into Liberty Tree Bible Boxes that were presented to President George W. Bush, President James Earl Carter, and the United States Naval Academy . A large piece was chosen to make the yoke for the Spirit of Liberty Bell, a full-sized traveling replica of the historic Liberty Bell, cast to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the original Bell, which had been commissioned in 1751 to celebrate religious liberty in America . A substantial portion of the remaining Liberty Tree wood was given to American Forests to be used in products like the Liberty Tree Knife."

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

Crazy Horse Knife Living model 005 History Series by Browning
Model 005 by Browning: ""Tashunka Witko,"" Oglala Lakota Sioux Warrior. Crazy Horse was born around 1845 on the Republican River that traces the Nebraska-Kansas border. He was raised with tribal traditions of generosity, courage and self-denial. He ordered the attack on Lt. Col. George A. Custer's Seventh Cavalry and never surrendered the lands claimed by his people. When asked where were his lands, he replied, ""My lands are where my dead lie buried.""
Crazy Horse Knife Living model 005 History Series by Browning 	The Crazy Horse knife sports a handle made of wood from a grove of aspen trees, which grew on the sacred Pine Ridge Reservation land in southern Nebraska. The Aspen is revered by the Sioux Nation as the ""Tree of Life."" The 4 1/2"" x 1 1/2"" blade is made from knapped obsidian, a hard volcanic glass. Its color is variegated rust black and is affixed to the hilt with leather strips. Horsehair tassels dangle from brass cones, threaded with bone beads lashed to the leather binding. Four brass tacks represent the four seasons. The fringed buckskin sheath is brain-tanned, hand-made and beaded with a familiar Sioux pattern.

A certificate of authenticity is included. 1,847 knives commemorating the year Crazy Horse was born will be produced.
Overall Length: 12""
Blade Length: 4 1/2""
Blade: Obsidian
Bolster: 4 Brass Point 	Handle Source : Aspen- revered by the Sioux Nation as the ""Tree of Life.""

In answer to the white man's questions Where are your lands now, Crazy Horse? Your people have gone back to the reservation. Where are your lands you fought for? Crazy Horse sat on his pony and said nothing. He raised his arm up and pointed out and said My lands are where my dead lie buried. These words capture the spirit of Crazy Horse and were an inspiration for the design of the Crazy Horse Living History knife. The Crazy Horse Living History knife is bladed with knapped obsidian, a volcanic rock that forms when silica sand is intensely heated, a kind of unrefined glass that ancient cultures used for weaponry. The Lakota Sioux did not know metal until they met French fur trappers.

The core of Knowing where you come from and where you are going entwines with the concept of the tree of life. No other piece of history embodies this more than the sacred white aspen wood used in the Crazy Horse Knife. Known in Native American cultures as the Tree of Life, the white aspen grows freely in the mountains above 2,000 feet, ensuring their continuing abundance and freedom as it also ensures their continuance as People. Due to its white wood color, the white aspen are considered to be holy, and the trees also symbolize purity.

Russell Means, an Oglala Lakota, served as the first national director of the American Indian Movement (AIM) and became one of the organization's best-known spokespeople. Means was one of the Indian activists who, in 1969, occupied San Francisco's Alcatraz Island in a landmark AIM-led protest that lasted 19 months; in 1973, he helped lead the AIM takeover of Wounded Knee. Both events brought worldwide attention to the injustices and privation faced by American Indians past and present. As an actor, Means has appeared in such films as The Last of the Mohicans (1992) and Natural Born Killers (1994) and provided the voice of Powhatan in 1995's Pocahontas. Means graciously located and provided sacred aspen wood for the Crazy Horse knife as well as this story.

Tashunke witko , or Crazy Horse, was born around 1845 along the Rapid Creek near the Black Hills of South Dakota. During his boyhood, the Lakota Sioux had little contact with whites other than the occasional trader or soldier, and Crazy Horse was raised with tribal traditions of generosity, courage and self-denial. His father was neither a chief nor a tribal leader, but Crazy Horse won tribal leadership through his acts. His dreams became prophesy. Crazy Horse said he would never be hurt in battle, then demonstrated his belief in that vision by riding back and forth in front of enemies without being hit by a single bullet. At Little Big Horn, he rode to within 50 yards of enemy breastworks before calling his men to attack. His fearlessness made his men feel they were invincible, and they won a victorious battle against Custer's Seventh Calvary. But the White Man would not leave the West and Crazy Horse would never surrender the lands claimed by his people. When asked where his lands were located, he replied, My lands are where my dead lie buried."

Manufacture description follows:

The semi-auto hunting rifles VEPR SUPER are designed for medium-sized and big games. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (from -50 F up to +120 F). 

VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market 

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices and either a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver or fixing bases for a top scope mount.

VEPR SUPER comes with a fluted barrel for reducing the rifle weight and improving cooling ability.

All VEPR SUPER rifles go through a robust quality control and inspection and each new rifle has its own quality control acceptance certification from the factory, included in the manual.

MOLOT Factory produces VEPR SUPER (SUPER VEPR) rifles in the following configurations: 
VEPR SUPER 223 Rem, VEPR SUPER 308 Win

Because of this, the M3X is built to go as deep as 66ft. and still remain waterproof.
The M3X utilizes a Xenon bulb that delivers a peak output of 125+ lumens and is protected by the Shock Suppression System which is designed to handle the heavy recoil demands of today’s tactical loads. Powered by two (2) 3V 123 lithium batteries (included), the M3X has a run time of one (1) hour.

Insight Tech-Gear offers two options for mounting the M3X to your firearm. The patented 1913 Slide-Lock system allows for instant tool-free mounting and removal by simply sliding the unit onto the rail and locking it into place with the spring-loaded latchbar. 

The Rail-Grabber mount fits most rail configurations whether for a rifle, shotgun or a pistol. The Rail-Grabber interface utilizes a screw-adjustable locking plate that can be tightened to insure a rock solid fit. The Rail-Grabber mount is particularly recommended for heavy recoiling firearms.

For mounting the an M3X on shotguns not equipped with a rail, Insight Tech-Gear offers an optional Shotgun Adapter mounting bracket that attaches to the extended tube."

cerakote can be applied to multiple surfaces, steel, aluminum, polymer as well as many others!
The parts are degreased, soaked in an Acetone bath (polymer and plastics are wiped down), baked in an oven to leach out any oils and grease then sand blasted using 100 grit Aluminum Oxide. After that they are ready to be Cerakoted and oven cured.
Cerakote offers superior durability, corrosion, hardness, flexibility, chemical resistance and abrasion resistance over other name brand firearm coatings.
Numerous colors are available, check out http://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/ for more information.
I can do frames, slides, trigger groups, hammers, magazines you name it. If it can be disassembled it can be Cerakoted! 
I can also Cerakote wood as well as polymer based frames and grips such as Glock, M&P and Heckler & Koch.
I can disassemble most firearms but I recommend disassembly by the customer. i do charge a small fee for assembly/disassembly. I can remove/install sights as well but I am not responsible for any damage to stubborn sights.
