170,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2385170,For Trade:  PolyTechnologies Bakelite Sidefolder AK-47,"South, Wichita, Kansas",Offer,"Listed On: Thursday, November 28, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"I posted this the other day, and got ALOT of offers....from people out of state. Let me be clear by saying, I am not interested in shipping.

Now, as for the rifle:
It is honestly, the most accurate, well fitted AK-47 I have ever had the honor to own (and I've owned a few). It's definitely a ""Safe Queen"". It gets a good cleaning and oiling at least once a week to keep the rifles beautiful blueing at 100%, and to wart of any rust that thinks of touching it. She is definitely a Gem with some great, and unique, parts. Including: a heat treated hammer, spring-loaded firing pin, a hidden cleaning kit in its folding stock, and a curved magazine release (no more sore thumbs!).

This is a factory 416 build, made in 1987 (yes, Pre-Ban). From what I've read, only 400 were imported into the US, making her a very rare animal. This model was made specifically for the American market, and soon after the ban took effect, PolyTechnologies closed its doors indefinitely.

I have all the original accessories: 3 magazines, sling, oil bottle, owners manual, and even the box. Though the box is tattered, it remains in one piece. 

This is a collector rifle, but is more than capable of being an every day shooter. Total, she has had 120rds down the pipe since her manufacturing.

Everything on the rifle is in fantastic shape. No scratches, blemishes, cracks, or marks anywhere (aside from the removing and reinstalling of the receiver cover).

I've narrowed my search to what I want to trade for:

Bushmaster ACR or, 
FNH SCAR 16s/17s. 

Not vastly interested in anything else, but feel free to offer up. Not very interested in the AR platform, but may be interested in a billet build.

I also have a good amount of magazines and ammo available (only if the PolyTech is traded), so let's make a deal!

The only model on Gunbroker I found was $2,350 cash, WITHOUT the original box, magazines, oil bottle and literature, and those weigh heavily on a collector piece's value. The rifle was also in rough shape (comparatively).

 That said, I feel $2,450 in trade is more than fair.

My wife and I have moved to a farm and we dont/cant travel anymore. Soooo Just in time for Christmas.My wife and I are selling or bartering our Sheraton timeshare in Orlando Florida.This timeshare is fully PAID for. The most recent annual assessment will be fully paid It is an every other year (odd year) unit in the Vistanna Fountains two section of the Vistanna Resort.It is a 1200 sq ft 2 bedroom unit. I am posting the price of a  current Sheraton  (taken from a recent e-mail which I can forward you) similar unit. As you will see a unit like this sells for $14,985. We are selling or trading ours for $2500 OBO plus normal closing costs.Trade items would include things like long guns (especially AR's) excalibur cross bow, quality semi auto pistols(with box and papers preferred) , quality gun safe, whole home generator etc. Or a combination of cash and these items.Just let me know what you have. Life on a working homestead farm just doesnt allow us to use a timeshare anymore.Again this is a PAID FOR unit. As a timeshare owner you can trade and upgrade into timeshare rentals all over the country. 

No high pressure pitch- No financing costs- Save thousands and invest in future vacations for your family by swapping some safe queens

From Sheraton e-mail where I requested current pricing:

""Biennial (Every Other Even Year)

Unit Size 2-Bedroom Villa........
Annual HOA (Maintenance & Taxes) Fee $378.00.......
. 
Purchase Price Closing Costs (Admin. Fee) Total Purchase Price
$14.290.00 $695.00 $14,985.00""

This is a savings of over $11,400 over buying from Sheraton and no financing costs. Annual fee on our timeshare was a bit higher than quoted above (this year)

My wife and I have moved to a farm and we dont/cant travel anymore. Soooo Just in time for Christmas.My wife and I are selling or bartering our Sheraton timeshare in Orlando Florida.This timeshare is fully PAID for. The most recent annual assessment will be fully paid It is an every other year (odd year) unit in the Vistanna Fountains two section of the Vistanna Resort.It is a 1200 sq ft 2 bedroom unit. I am posting the price of a current Sheraton (taken from a recent e-mail which I can forward you) similar unit. As you will see a unit like this sells for $14,985. We are selling or trading ours for $2500 OBO plus normal closing costs.Trade items would include things like long guns (especially AR's) excalibur cross bow, quality semi auto pistols(with box and papers preferred) , quality gun safe, whole home generator etc. Or a combination of cash and these items.Just let me know what you have. Life on a working homestead farm just doesnt allow us to use a timeshare anymore.Again this is a PAID FOR unit. As a timeshare owner you can trade and upgrade into timeshare rentals all over the country. 

No high pressure pitch- No financing costs- Save thousands and invest in future vacations for your family by swapping some safe queens

From Sheraton e-mail where I requested current pricing:

""Biennial (Every Other Even Year)
Phase Cascades 
Unit Size 2-Bedroom Villa........
Annual HOA (Maintenance & Taxes) Fee $378.00.......
. 
Purchase Price Closing Costs (Admin. Fee) Total Purchase Price
$14.290.00 $695.00 $14,985.00""

This is a savings of over $11,400 over buying from Sheraton and no financing costs. Annual fee on our timeshare was a bit higher than quoted above (this year)

Its a great bow, I have just decided to go completely traditional, as I just simply enjoy it more and I find myself shooting my compound seldom if ever. In great condition, normal ware from the field. Never dry fired.

 Price for the bare bow $475...I realize the going rate is $450 in the classifieds section. However, I have a unused ""winner's choice"" spare string that is useless to me without the bow, so I do not want to break them up. So $475TYD for a bow and 2 strings. I would include mods for 28 and 30 inch draw.

I also have a HHA single pin adjustable sight, peep sight, limb saver limb dampeners, generic quiver, a Scott wildcat quick release, and used whisker biscuit rest, 9 Easton axis 340 arrows 29 1/8 inches long, and night hawk archery portable bow press that could come with the bow if desired for additional cost...

 If you are interested in a trade, or to augment the price with a trade here are a list of things I would be interested in... if you feel said item exceeds value of bow I would be willing pay extra cost.

They're both packaged in their original packaging. I bought the AK-74 last year from a black Friday special and hardly use it. It only has some signs of wear on the stock. I will include additional magazines and will throw in a battery. The rifle can be modified to allow multiple attachments. The stock is changeable, but that requires a re-wire of the gun if you intend on changing the stock and use the gun for your airsoft needs. I purchased the AK from Windhorse airsoft.

The M92FS includes a barrel extension you can attach or remove on the pistol. It also has a full auto and semi auto function. You just need a small screwdriver to attach the extension. Contrary to the AK-74, the KG93 (M9 replica) is a gas blowback. Green gas is used for the pistol to fire bb's

Please read carefully that I will not be held liable if you brandish these in public and cause panic. These are airsoft replicas and they have their orange tips required by law. These guns cannot be modified to fire live ammo. Please be aware of the laws and regulations regarding airsoft as they can be mistaken as real guns by either LEO's or people in public.

I will not sell these to anyone under the age of 18, please bring a ID upon meetup. My meet up location is at the Chinatown district located on Spring Mountain b/t Valley View and South Decatur. My specific location in that area is the large statue in the center of the shopping plaza, it's close to the Chinatown mall. I will not accept trades or price haggles.

Comes with Leupold Alumina Scope Covers ($80.00) for both the objective and eyepiece as well as Leupold IMS 2 Mount ($90.00) that literally drops in on any piactinny rail. Adjust your field of view and your good to go.  Again, this comes with $175.00 of additional accessories for the price of this glass retail and also I'll throw in a Leupold scope sock and Leupold lens cleaner for free. Over $800.00 in goodies for one of the best optics on the market."

What we are trying to do is change the new ccw law so we as law abiding citizens can feel free and safe from crime by carrying our firearms in our public parks and on public transportation (cta, pace and metra) and not fall as prey to criminals, if we can get this on the ballot we can vote for it and cut the elected officials (who have 24 hour a day tax payer paid bodyguards)  out of the mix and let the people decide. 

Now as the law stands if you were carrying a legally owned firearm and fought back against a attacker with said firearm you could face criminal charges due to the restrictions on carrying a firearm in public parks and public transit all because the state believes it has the exclusive right to tell you where and when you can and can not defend yourself.

This is one of the original Seattle, Washington guns -- mfg in 1976 or 77, one of the first 1000 Detonics pistols built. I purchased this from the original owner in Seattle.

The gun has a later style blued slide, barrel, and hammer, as well as the later factory checkered wood grips. The original owner explained that the gun originally shot low and left, so after fiddling with it for several years he eventually took it back to Detonics (Smith Tower location) in the 1980s and had them fix it. The result was the gun's current configuration. It still has the original rubber-backed mainspring housing.

Gun is in excellent condition with just the slightest bit of finish wear on the corners. Overall 90+% condition, this gun has been a safe queen with both the previous owner and me. Gun functions perfectly and shoots accurately.

Comes with one original 6-round Detonics magazine, a Bianchi #7L (right-handed) holster, and original Detonics soft case/rug.

$800. Prefer FTF in Enid area, but willing to drive 45 mins (halfway to Tulsa/OKC/Wichita) to meet for FTF.

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style"

BARRETT M107A1 .50BMG 29"" BLACK 14085 10RD
A whole new legend.
It may be related to the Model 82A1/M107, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Chambered in a 5.45x39, the best thing I like about the 74s are the accessibility and AFFORDABILITY of the ammo! I got this ammo for only 4 dollars per box of 30 rounds! This is the second AK74 I have, and if I didn't have a mini14 I had to pay off of layaway I definitely wouldn't be selling it. Think 5.56 with MORE knockdown power, a larger projectile, and MORE accessibility (5.45s are never sold out) with LESS COST!
Best thing about this gun (other than being brand new) is that its a direct import, meaning it still has the selector lever on opposite side of upper receiver to change to fully automatic. All that's required is a class 3 license and one simple shear pin and its fully operational. Upgraded with a Hogue pistol grip and vintage Polish sling, also new/never used.

Buy the rifle alone for 650 - buy the entire package deal for 800: this includes the rifle, sling, 8 new mags, and 700 rounds of unopened, boxed ammo. You won't find a better deal.

Spend 800+ on an AR15 that's probably on the cheap end or spend 800 dollars for a Russian made AK direct-import that comes with 700 rounds and enough mags to hold 230 rounds at one time!"

The rifle does have one issue, being the dumbass that I am, I took it upon myself to try to take off the front sight and put a flash suppressor in its place.  I found out that the sight is pressed on and not threaded.  Soooo, I took out my little dremel and started to cut away.  Well my eyes are not what they use to be and before I knew it, I had cut down to the inner barrel, lol.
For some reason people have this conception that the rifle does not function. The rifle functions 100%, it is not cosmetically pleasing to the eyes. Also, people seem to have a hard time reading the part ""FOR TRADE"" !
I have since purchased a new rifle, so this one is up for trade.

The rifle has two options for repair: 1) send it to Kel Tec for a new barrel ($125)  2) take it to a machinist and have the part cut off and threaded."
