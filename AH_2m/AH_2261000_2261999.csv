It was hand assembled and finely tuned at S&W's Performance Center.  The trigger is unbelievable!  It comes from the factory with all shown which includes the beautiful Rosewood grips, S&W recoil absorbing rubber grips, tuned porting at the end of the 3"" barrel, manual, lock keys, spent cartridge sealed in envelope and it's own special aluminum case that has dual combination locks!!

I have never fired this pistol or cleaned it.  I was told it has not been fired other than at the factory, and it looks every bit the part.  If you want the very best S&W has to offer in a .44 Magnum, this is your pistol!  How many other S&W pistols have you seen that come from the factory with their own locking aluminum case with S&W's logo made into the case?  It didn't pick up well in the pics from my cell phone, but there are marks from where the cylinder has been turned.  Other than that...well, you can see a good picture into the barrel.

I've started to sell this several times and then changed my mind after looking at it.  However, the fact is that I'm never going to shoot this masterpiece.  The new Performance Center revolvers can't hold a candle to this one and they come in the regular old plastic case.  This pistol is rather rare; especially in this condition.  Sale only to someone with cash, proper ID and I strongly prefer a carry permit.  There again, this isn't the type of pistol someone buys to go out on a shooting spree with.  Any questions, just ask."

FLIR’s Scout handheld Thermal Imaging cameras give hikers, hunters, and outdoorsmen of all stripes the ability to see clearly in total darkness, providing a wealth of valuable information during any nighttime excursion.
Scout, powered by the same advanced technology used by military and law enforcement, is the first personal thermal imaging camera affordable enough to give every outdoorsman the unsurpassed practical advantages of full-resolution thermal imaging night vision. Scout makes images from heat, not light, a feat impossible for the naked eye or even image intensified (I2) night vision devices, which means you can see clearly even without any visible light at all. People, animals, and objects all make their own heat and their own contrast, and are clearly seen by the Scout in even the most adverse conditions.
Scout enables the outdoorsman to:
• See animals and difficult terrain in reduced visibility and total darkness
• See through smoke, dust, and light fog
• See camouflage and foliage in any lighting conditions
• See more – and see farther – than with low-light night vision goggles
If you really love the great outdoors, why limit your world to only the daylight hours? Scout thermal imagers allow you to experience nature in vivid detail 24/7.

I bought three of these and really only needed two of them. I previously sold one here, and I have one that has been assembled but is still unused. I have the original packaging and included paperwork.

These are spring-loaded reactive targets, rated from 9mm all the way to 30.06. The actual target portion is 18"" tall, and about 1/4"" thick. VERY sturdy, they weigh about 25 pounds. I've put several hundred rounds into one, including 9mm, .40, .45, .223 and 7.62x54 and aside from the chipping paint there are only minimal signs of wear. A quick blast with a rattle can of orange after a shooting session and it's ready to go for the next time.

These also come with three ground spikes to secure them in place. If for some reason the target ever wears out, you can easily replace it with another piece of steel. I'm thinking of having some custom shapes made for mine, maybe a tombstone or a more traditional body shape.

I'm really only looking to sell this one to help justify my almost inevitable purchase at the gun show this weekend. I'll be heading out there most likely on Sunday morning, but if you're interested I can get there on Saturday with enough notice."

I dont mean to be a jerk, but these stamps were used to rip people off a few years back unfortunately the elderly was the ones who got screwed.  The gold leaf layer on these is a molecule thick, meaning it would take well over a thousand to make a gram.  Each may be a gram, but the stamp underneath is the weight, not the gold leaf.  They cannot be melted to make gold, it is so thin it will burn away.  This is the same type of gold leaf used in drinks, and on cakes.  You can get a good sized sheet of it for under $25.

It is current issue by the USMC. While not providing any more protection than the RBA system, it is more lightweight and versatile. Groin and neck protection is integrated into a system of interchangeable panels instead of the aging ""diaper"" used with previous armor. The Interceptor armor is also compatible with the Molle gear system, but the system is rapidly declining in popularity among troops and turning more to the Interceptor. Addition of the SAPI plates brings the level IIIA basic interceptor armor up to a solid level III protection. Plates are 7.62mm resistant and up.

For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer. The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil. Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern. If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed."

Not sure everything about this gun as there were many variations; so the pictures will speak for themselves. On the right side of the receiver is dated 1881, it was converted to .303 British in 1899 as shown on the left side of the receiver. I was told by a local gun shop the bore is rough, but they say it's shootable. The gun is missing the metal buttstock pad, the round ensignia that goes on the right side of the buttstock, and the flip-up part of the rear sight. The gun seems to be in unrefinished condition.

It has the standard iron sights and sight globe effective for 0-2000 meters, but the farthest I was able to put a round on target (limited only to my eyesight) was 425 yards.  It is a smooth cycling and has operated flawlessly for me.  I have only shot roughly 75-100 rounds through this rifle.  It has a 4+1 round drop bottom built in magazine and also the original removable bayonet that doubles as a flat head screwdriver that was used to field strip and clean the rifle on the battlefield! It is a very simply rifle with minimal parts (only 5 not counting bolt disassembly).  Ammo is easy to find and very cheap making this a fantastic rifle for your collection.  I love this rifle, however I need to free up some space as I am getting into cowboy action shooting.  I am including 100 rounds with the purchase of this rifle!

It has the super solid ACE Ltd. folding mechanism that won't break when dropped like the factory version. It will not slam shut during recoil like the factory stock. I also upgraded to a milspec buffer tube and milspec stock. You can get a better looking stock to add but I prefer the durability of milspec. Tube, folder, and stock was 200+ install. 

I upgraded the rail system to a the elite milspec Samson MFG Star 556S Tactical Accessory Rail System. Light, strong, durable, holds a zero for an optic or laser. Continuous top rail, solid mounting, 6061 T-6 Mil Spec black hard coat anodized, two piece rail. It also runs along the top to mount an optic with more stability. This rail cost me $310.00.

I have an upgraded Swiss milspec comfort combat rear grip. 

It has the stronger milspec Griffen upgraded charging handle that is canted so that you don't cut yourself on your optics. 

This has the expensive factory front and rear Sig Diopler sighting system. 

This rifle has the awesome surefire flash hider to be used with a 556 suppressor. The barrel was checked to be concentric. This cost over 150.00

Comes with the above plus Sig factory case, factory rail, and rail covers.

This rifle is a Class 3 NFA weapon and must be transferred as such. Make sure this is legal in your area and google the NFA transfer process. 

The item is still available if the listing is up. I can ship this to an NFA FFL near you. Please let me know what state you're in when you contact me. Thank you for taking the time to view my listing."

 The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system.
