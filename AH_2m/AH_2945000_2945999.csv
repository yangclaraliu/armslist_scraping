The Crimson Trace Lightguard™ for GLOCK features a highly compact and slim design specifically for ease of holstering. Its 100 lumen tactical white light seamlessly attaches to your defensive pistol, much like Crimson Trace’s Laserguard®.
Compatible with LG-617 & LG-619 laser sights, Lightguard also uses the same instinctive activation that Crimson Trace laser sights are famous for. Lightguard removes the need for a flashlight separate from the pistol – giving you a free hand. Both of these low-light tools can be operated separately or simultaneously with a single hand.

-other parts - I'm pretty sure I've got most of the other small parts, save the recoil spring and magazine spring. If you need something, let me know and I'll look closer.

Everything except the trigger group is in pretty good condition overall, no rust, scratches, or finish wear. The trigger group has some pretty big dings in the paint. If you want anything, make an offer. I'd sell it all together or split up, and I can ship, if you'd like. 

If you want more information or better pictures, just ask."

The gun also has a lock that locks the firing pin with a special key in case you are worried about children. There's a thumb switch safety and a loaded chamber indicator.

This rifle is a 1990 Remington 700 BDL Deluxe Varmint Special chambered in 7mm-08 Remington, if you do research or know the Varmint Specials and know BDL's you'll know Remington NEVER offered a BDL in 7mm-08 in regular production. This is a rare rifle, and would be the CROWN JEWEL in a BDL Varmint Special Collection, as it is not listed in the ads for the BDL Varmint Specials. I've only seen ONE other BDL Varmint Special on a Facebook group and that guy has owned it since new in 1990. This rifle has Ebony Forend Cap, Pistol Grip Cap, Butt Pad Spacer. Tasco 6-24x40mm Scope with Adjustable Paralax and Easy Adjustable Elevation knob, it was mounted on the rifle when I bought it, I have boresighted it. Action is SMOOTH, still has LOTS of Jewelling left on the bolt, rifle doesn't appear to have been used much, there is a ding on the left side of the stock, was in there when I bought it, doesn't hurt it that much in my eyes, nor does it decrease value I've been told.

I've already been offered $750 for this rifle by a gentleman out of state, NOT looking to break even so soon, I've owned this since March but don't collect these rifles as I don't have a safe, so it just sits when it could be in a collection.

With that said, $850 is somewhat firm, won't go below $800.

Glock 23, 23C, 30, 30SF, 35, 36, would like Gen 4, + $300 cash, don't try and haggle me, I know what Glock's go for..

A serious collector would understand these pattens better than myself and I do have a book explaining these dates and what they mean. The rifle is in perfect working order and was fired just a week ago.. A bit of a bruiser I might add. I've added a slip on recoil pad.

458,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2945458,For Sale:  Forster co-ax reloading press 435$ shipped,"S.E., South Dakota, United States",$ 435,"Listed On: Friday, May 30, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Forster co-ax b3 reloading press is considered to be the best single stage press on the market today. This press is brand new in the box, the only reason I opened it was to take pictures of exactly what you will be receiving and to verify its contents.

This press has a yoke shaped operating lever which gives you 3 times the mechanical force and it gives you equal operation and both sides of the press with 2 guiding rods.

1 of the unique features of the Forster is the case holder jaws which open at the bottom of the stroke at which time you insert the shell and as you raise it the jaws grab the shell and center it to the case die (which also floats) correctly every time.

Another great feature is how the dies simply slide into place, no more screwing your dies in and out of your press. All you do is slide the die into place, screw it into the correct position on the lock ring and you're done! So between the jaw holders and the floating die the case will center itself every time!

Rcbs, Hornady, Redding and even the o ring style lee lock rings work with this press. I don't know if other style lock rings will work.

The decapping system is great because the spent primers fall through a tube into a cup at the bottom of the press, no more priming compounds all over the press!

The press has it's own priming system which can't over seat the primer.

I've reloaded for years and this is the best single stage press I've ever had. 

Included is the Forster press, 2 cross bolt lock rings, handle for the press, small and large primer seater, primer catch tube and cup, and ""S"" shell holder jaws which were installed at the factory with the large ends aligned. The small end will hold a .343 to .422 rim and the large will hold a .468 to .562 rim. And various Allen wrenches.

I have used forsters ultra micrometer dies and I know the redding competition dies will clear the yoke. The smallest caliber I've loaded on the Forster is .223 and the largest is .284 in 7mm ultra mag.

If you have any questions feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer."

This gun is an exceptional shooter and is dead on balls accurate.  It is a quality made firearm.  I am selling only because I am wanting to get an AR 10.  Just got this gun in Feb 2014 only has 120 rounds through it.  AK reliability in a super accurate gun pounding out .308's rather than 7.62x39mm.

Browning's pistol designs, the 1911 and GP35 or Hi-Power. 
Offered here for sale (not trade) is a fine example of a post war Hi-Power. This is a well maintained, fully functioning, original pistol with only one part replaced. Conservatively, about 90% + condition. This comes with one original, aluminum follower 13 round magazine. This has not been refinished or monkeyed with and has an intact magazine disconnector. It's been kept in a silicone gun sock when not in use and always cleaned and oiled after use. For me, it's functioned without flaws since the internal extractor (similar to a 1911) has been carefully tuned and replaced. Original extractor is included with the sale. Pistols of this age and quality are quite scarce and sought after by those who really like this pistol. As this is a tad below true ""collector quality"", yet in outstanding condition for it's age, you can still shoot it! Okay, here's what you really want to know: Price is $750 (reduced from $800), FIRM. NO-TRADES. Must have OHIO driver's licence, be willing to meet in Columbus or FFL to FFL transfer with you paying the shipping. You must be eligible to purchase a firearm and be willing to sign a bill of sale for my records. As always, you should have this pistol checked for safety by a qualified gunsmith before firing, however it's been flawless for me and I can offer no warranty, nor be held responsible should something go wrong. I'm not in the firearms business, just a shooter as I imagine you are as well. Please contact me if you're serious and I can try to answer any questions or arrange to meet up. Low ball offers/trade offers will be ignored, so please don't bother.
