All in presentation boxes never fired. The pictures do not do justice to the firearms, they are in perfect condition.

I will consider reasonable offers but no low balling as I do not have to sell. You will not find a grouping like these.

If memory serves correct, this is the first authorized special edition that S&W Model 29 ever made. I think that applies to the Beretta 92 also.

I will not break up the set unless you make some ridiculous offer for one that will really just knock me out of my socks.  These handguns are worth more as a group than as individuals.

I am willing to drive as far as Greensboro/Ashevillle to facilitate sale.  If purchase can be arranged for this week, I am going to Wilmington area Friday and can tote them down there or anywhere along the way if sale is confirmed.

Buyer must either have permits or CCW.

Thanks

Additional photos can be arranged."

Here we have an interesting Colt Bisley in .38 WCF. This revolver came out of a private collection that was assembled in the 1950’s and early 1960’s and then placed in storage. We have requested and paid for a letter from Colt which we will forward to the winner of this auction. However, we have been told by Colt that it may be 6 months before the letter arrives. Based on our research, the serial number (327072, 327082) would indicate a manufacture date of approx. 1913-1914. One of the reasons we requested a Colt letter is to understand the two serial numbers on this Bisley, which I have shown in the pictures. The numbers are 327072 and 327082. We cannot explain this and suspect it was something that occurred at the factory, due to the fact that the numbers are separated by only 10................ There is much good, honest wear on this Bisley but there is very little play in the action. The lock-up is very tight. I have tried to provide pictures of the various marks on the frame and cylinder. These are deeper than scratches, but they are uniform and appear to be only cosmetic in nature............ There is a chip out of one of the grip panels and interestingly, while taking pictures of that area, I happened to notice four notches that look like they were filed into the frame of this gun. I have no idea of the meaning behind these notches, but wanted to point them out................ If you plan to shoot this Bisley, I would recommend it be inspected by a professional Gunsmith................ We have established a low opening price for this Bisley and believe the market will dictate a considerably higher value........... Standard Terms and Conditions 1.	This firearm is part of a private collection. I am not a business and do not have a FFL. 2.	Final shipping charges will be calculated after the end of the auction and will be determined by shipping method, packaging and insurance costs."

There is a chip out of one of the grip panels and interestingly, while taking pictures of that area, I happened to notice four notches that look like they were filed into the frame of this gun. I have no idea of the meaning behind these notches, but wanted to point them out................ If you plan to shoot this Bisley, I would recommend it be inspected by a professional Gunsmith................ We have established a low opening price for this Bisley and believe the market will dictate a considerably higher value........"

This gun was the hardest to find gun I have ever purchased. Took me a few months to locate a shop that could finally get it. They had to special order this since it's in Titanium Gold. This will be a very valuable gun for collectors since it's so hard to find and this was one of the last DEP made in Israel because they moved their production to the US. It will only appreciate in value

Originally had the wooden stock, which I replaced with the Tapco USA assembly. The description of the Tapco SKS assembly is as follows:
Item Description
Antiques are made to be hung up on the wall or shoved into a display case, not to be taken out to the range and used on a daily basis. It’s time to bring your antique SKS into the modern day with the INTRAFUSE SKS Stock System. This system gives you a 6 position adjustable T6 stock, so it will accommodate any sized shooter, a SAW Style Pistol Grip for greater comfort and control, and an upper handguard rail for adding accessories. Our stock system works on most SKS models and is made of the highest strength composite. So, if you’re ready to leave your original wooden stock in a museum somewhere and transform your SKS into a 21st century tactical firearm, purchase the INTRAFUSE SKS Stock System today. Counts as 3 U.S. 922r Compliant Parts.

Also has built in strap mount clips and a 30-round clip. I have also attached a bi-pod mount, flash suppressor, added a scope mount, and a scope. The rifle has been digitally sighted in, and shoots perfectly. The drag-bag, made by the company Galati and over 60 bullets with clips, will be added into the deal. This is really a superb rifle. I have put a lot of time and care into getting all the attachments and making this rifle even better.
 Thanks for looking and God bless!"

This is in stock on a Form 3 in Oklahoma and ready to be transferred tax free to your local Class III SOT dealer. That transfer takes weeks, not months and then you're ready to fill out your paperwork.

This is a Class III NFA item and as such follows all NFA guidelines.

ISSC M22 .22 CALIBER PISTOL

The ISSC M22 brings you handling and performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.

The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights.

Heritage Rough Rider RR22MB6 Single Action 22LR / 22 Mag Combination Revolver, Blue Finish, With Wood Grips. 

 BRAND: Heritage Arms

 Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

 The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

 Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

frame and the most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line. The
cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy
in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine
release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety
makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Item 90021 comes

Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.  The Saiga-12 is manufactured by the arms division of Izhmash, in Russia. It is imported into the US by Wolf Performance Arms.

The Saiga-12 IZSL- 433 is a 030-type semi-automatic shotgun based on the famous design of standard Saiga IZ-109. The shotgun is equipped with a magazine guide (magwell) and an automatic last round bolt hold open device in order to help facilitate easy reloads and insertion of the magazine. It also has a self regulating gas system, which allows greater flexibility in the type of ammo used. The top cover features a Picatinny rail on top allowing various optical devices to be attached to aid in target aquisition. The top cover is also hinged to the rear sight block in order to provide the top-mounted Picatinny rail with the ability to hold zero. An adjustable rear notched sight and front sight post are also standard on the shotgun to assist in accurate firing when no optical device is affixed.

The man behind transforming the Kalashnikov AK-47 into a shotgun was not Mikhail Kalashnikov, but another famous Russian designer, Gennady Nikolayevich Nikonov. These shotguns are developed on the base of the Kalashnikov assault rifle and overenginnered for reliability. Made with a minimal amount of moving parts and simple operating procedures, the design succeeds in providing an easy to use, highly reliable shooting platform. The Saiga-12 is designed for high reliability in harsh environments. The magazines can be filled with a mixture of 2 ¾” and 3” shells allowing for a variety of ammunition to be used. The removable magazine allows for quick reloads in situations when it’s required, like competitive shooting or a crisis situation. Saiga-12 is therefore great for tactical and home defense. All Saiga-12 shotguns have a threaded barrel so you can add various chokes or muzzle brakes.

The Ruger Single Six is a single action rimfire revolver produced by Sturm, Ruger. The Single Six was first released in June 1953.[5]

The Single Six is currently produced as the New Model Single Six. The term ""New Model"" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single Six, though this will lower the value for those in pristine, collectable condition.[6]"

This is a semi-auto short barrel rifle that is available to the public. It is a class 3 item so you will have to pay the $200.00 ATF tax stamp.

We also have silencers for .22LR that start at $145.00, silencers for AR-15's/5.56 calibers that start at $425.00, and 7.62mm silencers that start at $499.00.  We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up. Our prices are typically below MSRP and we have silencers that can fit anyone's budget. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. If you chain of command allows it you can take these on deployments since we know that only the ""cool guys"" get them issued. You never know this could be the piece of equipment that helps save your life or someone else. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I sale all major brands of silencers so if you have a special request just ask. It is now legal to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $4500.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am an experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED.

452,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2083452,"For Sale:  Tactical Short Barrel Lower Recoil Low Flash 357 Magnum Ammo - 140 gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (1,150fps/M.E. 411 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Friday, September 6, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=106

Typical full power 357 magnum loads offer several tactical problems for use in self defense and duty applications, especially when used in the shorter/lighter revolvers that are typical of concealed, defensive and duty carry. First, the muzzle flash can be blinding, especially from short barrels. Second, felt recoil can be a life-threatening drawback if fast follow-up shots are required. Third, the level of report can be deafening and cause permanent hearing loss, especially if fired indoors.

All three Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel loads address the above problems and make the 357 magnum ideal for concealed, defensive and duty carry in smaller revolvers.

Muzzle flash: These exciting new 357 magnum loads utilize a flash suppressed powder that will not blind you, should you need to drop the hammer in a low light situation. It is estimated that over 90% of all defensive civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light-that is when the criminal element is at work. Wouldn't it be horrible if you fired at an assailant, in the dark, to protect your family, only to find that you missed the bad guy and you are now blind due to your own muzzle flash? This is a scenario that has happened many times in the real world with the 357 magnum. Through the use of our non-canister, flash suppressed powder, the tactical problem of blinding muzzle flash is now greatly reduced with Buffalo Bore's new Tactical Short Barrel loads! 

Recoil: Felt recoil is exacerbated by the use of shorter barreled, smaller framed, lighter weight 357 revolvers, typically used for concealed and duty carry. The new Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel 357 loads are not the normal full power ""barn burner"", 357 magnum loads we make and as such, felt recoil is substantially reduced, although they remain very powerful. Hence, deadly, and faster follow-up shots are more possible. 

Your ears: Most folks don't think of the level of ""report"" as being a problem during a life threatening/defensive shooting and that may be correct for the actual moment of conflict. However, to lose some of your hearing for the rest of your life, following the shooting incident, is unnecessary and undesirable. Full power 357 magnum ammunition is deafening, even more so when fired from short barrels and even worse if you are required to shoot from an enclosed area such as a vehicle or indoors. Buffalo Bore's Tactical Short Barrel 357 magnum loads are not as hard on your hearing as full power ammunition. Although the use of hearing protection is still desirable, if possible, when using this ammo. 

For those who wish to carry a 357 magnum revolver for potential ""conflict resolution"", these new Buffalo Bore loads put an end to the ""tactical"" draw backs associated with our regular 357 magnum ammo. These loads are great for use in longer barreled firearms too.

Special Information Note: The below velocities were obtained from my personal, real world, factory stock, over the counter, (NOT TEST BARRELS) 357 magnum, revolvers. Also, note that the 6 inch Python, is considerably slower than the 4 inch S&W. This has nothing to do with barrel length. It is most likely a combination of differences in chamber/throat dimensions, barrel -cylinder gap, barrel internals, and forcing cone dimensions in the Python, versus the S&W. If the Python and the S&W had the same dimensions in their chamber/throats, barrel cylinder gap and forcing cone, the longer barreled Python would give much faster speeds. We have found that all of our Python test revolvers are much slower than our late model S&W revolvers of equal or even shorter barrel length.

We could have reduced the recoil, flash and blast even more by ""watering down"" these loads further than we did, but then you wouldn't have a real 357 magnum in your hands. So we looked for and found a balance between very powerful, fight stopping ammo that recoils and flashes much less than ours and some other makers, full power 357 loads. If we were to ""water down"" this ""Tactical Short Barrel"" 357 ammo any more, we would simply not manufacture it and suggest that you use our 38 SPL+P ammunition.

None of these loads caused crimp/bullet jump (in five shots) in my 12 OZ. Scandium S&W Model 340, but they did generate considerable felt recoil.

Item 19F/20-140gr. (jacketed hollow cavity) @ 1,150 fps from a 2.5 inch barreled S&W mod. 66. Designed to mushroom and penetrate deeply-roughly 12 to 14 inches in human tissue. 

S&W mod. 340PD 1-7/8 inch barrel -1,088 fps (368 ft. lbs.)
S&W mod. 66 2.5 inch barrel -1,156 fps (415 ft. lbs.)

S&W Mt. Gun 4 inch barrel -1,321 fps (542 ft. lbs.)
Colt Python 6 inch barrel -1,286 fps (514 ft. lbs.)

WARNING-shooting this ammo out of revolvers weighing less than 16 OZ produces tremendous felt recoil. We recommend our +P 38 SPL ammo for revolvers that weigh less than 16 OZ., if you are recoil sensitive."

SKS GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 7.62x39mm round, designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin sistemy Simonova, 1945 (Russian: ???????????? ??????? ??????? ????????, 1945; Self-loading Carbine of (the) Simonov system, 1945), or SKS 45. In the early 1950s, the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front-line service and replaced it with the AK-47; however, the SKS remained in second-line service for decades. It is still used as a ceremonial arm today. The SKS was widely exported, and was also produced by some former Eastern Bloc nations as well as China, where it was designated the ""Type 56"", East Germany as the Karabiner S and in North Korea as the ""Type 63"". The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries, including the United States and Canada. It was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 round, which was also used later in the AK-47.

The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

This is not a new rifle; it is used and in good shape, and has the older anodized receiver (not the cheaper painted receiver like later models).  I am not the original owner, round count is unknown.  A few minor dings on the stock, and I'd say the metal finish is 90% or better.  It shoots the way you'd expect a 10/22 to shoot--that is, perfectly reliably.

Bought it as a project rifle, never got around to it.  Bought another 10/22 that fit what I was going to build this one into, so this one can go.

Only thing not done to this saiga is they did not install side folder adapter plate or the bulky charging handle. The side folding adapter plate is a simple add on that can be purchased for 50 dollars and installed in minutes by nearly anyone. I do not desire a side folder therefore I struck that option. This gun was fully stripped, sandblasted and cerakoted. CERAKOTE is the absolute toughest gun finish on the planet to date. Barrel was shortened from 20 inches to 18 rethreaded and crowned. Bolt was polish and gas rod was upgrade. A MD Arms adjustable gas plug and puck was installed and gas vent was ported. A full length Chaos hinged rail was installed as well as a Red jacket solid forged aluminum stock. The barrel shroud works as a muzzle brake and helps slightly with flash.

Comes with 2 brand new 10 round mags.

2500 cash

 If you think this is expensive, look on gunbroker at the IZ 109's that that have been converted and don't have half the work this has into them for the same price or more."

They have 8/32 of tread remaining and have never been patched or plugged, but one has a small nail in it which I never noticed until I took them off.  I have left the nail in place for the buyer to decide how they want to fix it.  It is a small nail, and almost right down the middle, so it is no problem fixing the tire.

Many vendors only have this stuff on backorder at best, and it's been a hassle to find it available when you want it, or even to find it at all.  So I have been gradually accumulating it over time, but I am now selling off one my  32's, so I'm looking to sell off 770 rounds and keep the rest for myself.  So for sale here is 770 rounds total, split amongst 14 boxes of Federal 85 grain Personal Defense Hollowpoints (20 rounds per box), 9 boxes of Black Hills 85 grain Hollowpoints  (50 rounds per box) , and 2 boxes of Federal 95 grain SWC (semi wadcutter) (20 rounds per box).  All the ammo is factory brand new, highest quality 32 H&R magnum currently in production. Someone may buy the whole bunch at once, or you may purchase a few boxes at a time, it's totally your choice.  I am willing to sell these slightly below cost.  I think the last time I was able to purchase these,  I paid the equivalent of around 90 cents per round for the Federals, and about 74 cents a round for the Black Hills.  I would discount to something below that.  Shipping is by ground transportation, also at cost.  I'm not looking to profit at all on the 32 H&R shortage, just looking to unload some of these since I am selling one my 32's and don't need to hold onto so many rounds."

*Update 10/17* Since it is getting colder out and I can transition over to my larger ""cold carry"" I am a bit more motivated to sell this. I dropped the price down to 400 for everything but the crossbreed holster. I can throw the holster in for an agreed amount otherwise I will just put it up on eBay after the gun sells since they seem to be going for $50-75 used on there. Also I uploaded another picture showing everything included but I forgot to put the second mag in the picture.

I'm simply looking to upgrade to a larger caliber for my light clothing EDC. This was manufactured post recall, I purchased it towards the beginning of 2012. Since this has been my summer EDC, I have put a few hundred rounds through it. It does have typical carry wear from the leather holster and Kydex. I make hybrid holsters so if the single clip Crossbreed doesn't suit your needs we can work something out.

I can meet within reasonable distance, I live in Racine Wisconsin (53402) and work in Muskego Wisconsin (53150) to give an idea. I can also ship insured to a FFL. Local sales must provide state issued identification, and there will be a bill of sale. Contact at ""two six two four nine seven zero three nine eight"" or ""apex on you at gmail dot com"".

If you are/were a Marine and miss your M9, you've just hit the jackpot. Chrome-lined barrel, takes 8 + 1, has a great weight for a full-size but is short enough to conceal on a big person. The barrel actually rotates during fire to reduce recoil, and it's noticeable - this fires like a 9mm but has the obvious stopping power that I personally favor in a .45.

550 OBO gets you the gorgeous lady, her case, 2 magazines, original warranty, and a wee bottle of CLP to keep her lubed up. Don't miss out - only selling because I need the money; it's killing me to pass her off."
