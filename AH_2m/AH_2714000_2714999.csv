The .38 Special ONLY shoots .38 Special Cartridges. I haven't checked the date on the .357 Magnum yet but I know it's somewhere similar in age to the .38 Special that is a 1946 Model. The guns are both in great shape and in 100% Original Condition, the Bluing on both of them is in great shape and they only have minor scratches from being handled over the years. Neither one has ever been used much, they show no mechanical wear and function perfectly just like new guns. They both have 4"" Barrels and hold 6 Rounds Each, both are Single Action and Dual Action Revolvers which means you can manually cock the hammer before shooting or you can just pull the trigger as nornal with the hammer down. The .357 Magnum has taller sights and a larger frame and grips compared to the .38 Special which has a noticably smaller frame- that is the best way to tell the difference between them in the Pictures, I'll put a Picture of the .357 Magnum on the Top Picture and the .38 Special below it. You can really tell the size difference between the two when looking at the rear of the guns where the grips and rear frame are. I will sell then together or separately, it makes no difference to me, both are top quality guns and both have 4"" Barrels also. I have an idea of how much money I will sell themfor but I'm open to offers. PLEASE USE THE CONTACT SELLER LINK TO EMAIL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS,.CONCERNS, OR TO MAKE A.SERIOUS OFFER.

The M1919 Browning is a .30 caliber medium machine gun that was widely used during the 20th century. It was used as a light infantry, coaxial, mounted, aircraft, and anti-aircraft machine gun by the U.S. and many other countries, especially during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Although it began to be superseded by newer designs in the later half of the century (such as by the M60 machine gun), it remained in use in many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and elsewhere for much longer. It is very similar in design to the larger .50 caliber (12.7mm) M2 Machine Gun, which is also a Browning-designed weapon and is still in NATO service. Many M1919s were rechambered for the new 7.62Ã—51mm NATO round and served into the 1990s, as well as up to the present day in some countries. The United States Navy also converted many to 7.62mm NATO, and designated them Mk 21 Mod 0; they were commonly used on river craft in the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam. The M1919 was an air-cooled development of the standard US machine gun of World War I, the Browning M1917, as designed by John M. Browning"

This anodized jig is mounted into a chop saw is sold together. You can accurately, rapidly and consistently rough cut your cases to within a few thousands of an inch of final size. 20 rounds a minute is about average for a person just starting to use this jig with some people getting 30 rounds a minute. The interesting thing about the jig is the case is accurately located and locked into the jig for cutting. Once you chop it you press the next case in from the left and the cut case AUTOMATICALLY ejects out the right side. Keep your left hand on fresh brass and your right on the saw handle. Put a bucket below it to catch all those cases spitting out!

I am looking to trade for a new/used S&W M&P 15 sport (ar-15) or other entry level Ar-15's. I have a lot here so if you want to work something out just send me a text at REDACTED. 

This is one of the more suped up versions of the tactical 870 and it shoots very well. I have kept this gun very well maintained. It is well broken in but would never guess that I even shot it after you cleaned it. I also have added some female Velcro to the side of the gun to accept the Esstac shotshell cards. In my opinion they are the best shell delivery system on the market.

I also have with it assorted tactical shotgun gear (molle compatible) and various ammunition.

I have:

The TAG shotshell carrier for tac vest, this holds 21 rounds

3 Esstac Velcro Shotshell cards. The female Velcro on the gun accepts them well.

35ct. Remington Slugger slugs

65ct. #8 target loads

60ct. Remington 00 Buckshot

28 homemade snap caps (empty .12ga shells crimped into the shell for reload practice)

Hardcase and a softcase. 

(also the GG&G lefty sling mount is for lefties, so I can take it off for you if you want)

This is a great deal if you are looking to get rid of one of your carbines and get into tactical shotgunning. I have gone through many shell delivery systems for the plate carrier, and these ones work the best, I highly recommend them."

Blazer” you my friend, should keep looking. If you are looking for a short
description of to the beast before you, I can offer you two words “MEAT &
POTATOES”. This is the All American chariot of the free world.

You are not dealing with any ordinary, cookie cutter Blazer son. This thing
was forged from a single block of all American carbon Steel. 
From this day forward your life will never be the same. Winch yourself off
that couch and see if you can handle this Chevy.

So if you are looking for a rice burning hatch back, a solar powered liberal
mobile, or even a Hyundai crossover keep on looking my friend this thing is
a piece of red white and blue Americana Machinery.

This baby’s pulse is pumping carnal uncensored raw fuel through her
straight six nuclear power plant. And rest assured this is no metro feminine
automatic. . .you command her to obey, with your calloused hand planted
firmly on the shifter. And she will obey, the first time, every time. If you
can’t handle your stick shifter, or reach the clutch pedal, you better not
ferry skip over here wanting to test drive her.  

It has the hook ups for A/C but are you kidding me….Really! If you want to blow the sweat
off your brow, you do it the old fashioned way: doors off, top off. “What
if it rains?”. . .You whiney bitch! I told you to stop reading. . . Any man
who drives this beast doesn’t give a damn about rain. Not even skin melting
acid rain, Cause he’s already dripping wet in blood, sweat, dip spit, and
fish guts.

If you are looking for the kind of 4x4 that has to be pansy parked in the
garage, so that “it doesn’t get wet if you leave the top off” Then you should plant
your Obama sticker on something else. Cause this thing has
steel floors to let the blood drain out from the
buffalo you just killed, with your bare hands. Because you are William
Wallace from Braveheart and when you get home you can leave your “sissy
sponge glove car wash kit” in the pink bucket it came in. Go ahead and
spark up your 6000 psi heated pressure washer on the dually trailer in your
man cave, cause you are Tim “the tool man” Taylor and you can pressure wash your truck
on the inside. Tons of room inside in case
that buffalo comes back to life while you’re doing 80 over some mountain
pass or flooded river.

If you’re thinking about Mexican chrome bumpers for her, think again. The
bumpers come hand forged in a blacksmith shop in Onsow County over
a wood burnin fire, out of 4 inch well casing, and railroad tracks and then
I bolt’em to the damn chassis. That way if you get deployed you can piggy
back this war wagon on a 7 ton and chain her down tight from the
four corners, so you don’t lose her when your convoy gets hit by a taliband
roadside suicide bomber.

And forget about putting one of those “It’s a 4x4 Thing. . .You wouldn’t
understand” stickers on this machine cause when you’re spotted in this
American Classic there will be no questions, no further explanation
required, people will understand and get out of your way. . …real quick.

If you think you’re ready to park this panty hauler on your tract of land.
If you buy this Blazer you better go get your old lady ready for some damn
changes around your lair, cause this shit will be happening. What will be
Happening? Glad you asked….

This Blazer has carried me through miles of Jacksonville twice as
gruesome as the second half of the movie “300″. . ..And just like a trusty
steed this juggernaut has never left me stranded.  

But if you think you’re going to get to whip this mule you better pony fifteen Hundred Dollars. . .American Cash."

 Im not by ANY means desperate to move this, so if i dont get the right offer, or get lowball offers, they will be ignored. Not trying to be a jerk, but im not trading a $300 + gun brand new for a $150 scope, a $200 flashlight, or set of used tires. Lets be reasonable please"

The AR-332 is designed for reliability under harsh use, with hand-fitted internals and exacting tolerances. The Burris Forever Warranty protects you and your optic from anything you can throw at it. The Burris AR-332 is perfect for quick shooting at point-blank to intermediate ranges. 3X magnification plus the Ballistic CQ reticle provide for instinctive target acquisition. The black reticle is etched directly onto the prism with red and green light illumination available with the turn of a dial. Reticle dots correspond to bullet drop from 5.56 or 7.62 rounds, however this tough optic is built to handle much heavier recoil if needed.
