I traded for this pistol the other day with the intent for it to be a .380 conceal/carry for my wife. She decided she wanted something else so it goes back out for sale or trade.

This is one sweet conceal/carry pistol and it is small enough for a waist band holster or backup ballistic vest holster now problem. It is in very nice condition and it doesn't even look like it has even been shot very much at all. It comes in the original case with two Walther magazines, manual, warrant card, factory test fire casing (dated 4/2013), take down key.

You can see by the Cabela's website that MSRP on this gun is $429.

I want $299 cash FINAL REDUCTION OR I KEEP IT, which is more than a hundred bucks off of a new one, so this is a great deal on a like new in the box gun.

I will trade for the following:

1. Compact 9mm such as a Nano, LC9 or other comparably priced pistol in that $425-$450 MSRP range.

2. I would consider lower priced 9mm compact pistols like in the Kel-Tec PF9 vein, but you will need to come up with two of them to meet my MSRP trade value. OR add $200 cash to the deal on your end.

3. I am also interested in a complete pistol or carbine AR upper (no beat up junk). No polymers either.

4. 20 gauge Upland shotguns (worth $450 or better); pumps, autos or O/U all are good but no generic brands, no Stoegers, etc.)

5. Entry level complete AR carbine or pistol.

6. Entry level complete AK rifle or pistol; no PAPs, stock Saigas or AMDs please; nothing that doesn't take universal AK parts.

I live in South Hill Puyallup and work in Renton. These are my two meet locations."

This boat and trailer are in EXCELLENT condition and ready to put onto the water. No scratches, dents and no leaks! It is very well made and has a riveted hull. The EZLoader trailer has all been professionally wired and the tires have but one season on them, so you have absolutely no worries about unexpected problems there. The seats are in great shape with no rips or tears. The only reason I am selling is that I have a disability and my health condition has gotten to the point I question being able to handle it all by myself right now. Ideally it is a 2 man boat but one man can handle it all by himself. I regret having to sell it. This is an Ideal boat/trailer setup for a one man operation. All the equipment is in excellent working condition and most of it brand new. I have fished with it on large reservoirs’ with no problems at all and would make a great set up for a man that wants to hit multiple smaller lakes and ponds.I had planned to do some duck hunting with it, but now that is out of the question. The 12volt deep cycle Everstart Battery is “Brand New” and has never been used. The 45 lb thrust Motor Guide Trolling Motor is like new and a perfect match for this size of watercraft. It will support a small (5-10hp) gas motor as well. It is ready to launch. Fishing, Duck hunting or whatever, all you have to do is hook up to it and you’re ready to go!

Like most 500’s, this Gun hasn’t been shot much and all mechanics work like new.
If you haven’t shot a 500 before it’s like having an M80 go off 3’ from your face while a bull kicks your hand into your wrist.  After a few adrenaline rush shots you’ll know why 20 rounds last a long time.
I checked it off my bucket list and it’s time to move on.

I will only sell to NH resident with current CCP or FFL of your choice.

Please, I'm not interested in trades, no room in safe and need to start selling.

I bought it about a year ago locally brand new and have only shot it once. I put exactly 50 rounds through it and it fired flawlessly with no complications. Since then, it has been kept clean and oiled and in a gun safe. As the CCW permits get closer to a reality, I've decided I want something different. This think is in perfect condition and is perfect for carry conceal. Let me know if you have any other questions. Specs for the gun are below. It comes with the carry case and everything still in the box, exactly the way I got it from the manufacturer. The trigger lock has never even been opened.  Retail for this (and what I paid) is $333 before tax. ALSO including a brand new never used EXTRA MAGAZINE for it. I paid $24.99 just for that.

TAVOR Assault Rifles
Due to the dynamic changes in the modern battlefield, the threats of global terrorism and the demands of ever-changing combat situations, there was a need for a new versatile, innovative and technologically advanced weapon.

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a  last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

I have up for sale or trade an old Czech CZ70 (vz-70, vz70) 32 auto pistol. These are the models that were used by the czech police. I took it in on a trade took it to the range and put one mag through it. It functioned fine for those rounds and could mainly use a good cleaning as I havent been able to do it yet. (was just at the range a few hours ago). I am only putting it up for trade because 32 isnt a caliber I reload for or have much of a use for. This is in decent shape for being as old as it is, but it does have definite signs of use and wear, but nothing too extreme for its age.This would be a fantastic carry gun because of its size and it has very low recoil. Also, I have seen that even academy stocks the defense rounds for it so ammo wouldnt be terrible to find like it is with a lot of the smaller calibers. This will also come with two extra mags for the right trade or cash offer (making the total 3 mags). Please feel free to message me on here, or shoot me a TEXT ONLY at REDACTED and I can answer any and all questions that way. This will be sold as is with no returns just because of the nature of it so please ask any questions now and I will be happy to answer them the best I can. I can also message pictures if you would like. I also have a cz50 for sale or trade as well, so feel free to make an offer on the pair if you would like."

It is a roller-delayed blowback design, from the time when H&K was actually trying to be innovative with their designs. The magazine alone sells for $90, and the bolt and carrier are each sell for over $100 each. That is over $300 in parts if I were to just part it out, and that is not even including the slide, frame, or all the parts therein. These pistols sell for crazy money on GB. I am listing this up for $400obo. I will entertain trades but no guarantees. I am partial to older military guns, and if a cool trade is offered up, I could throw in cash if need be.

603,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2309603,For Sale:  Czech CZ-50 Pistol,"Norman, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 300,"Listed On: Thursday, November 7, 2013",Handguns,no type,32 ACP,no type,no type,"Hey everyone, 
I have up for sale or trade an old Czech CZ50 (vz50, vz-50) 32 auto pistol. These are the models that were used by the czech police. I took it in on a trade took it to the range and put one mag through it. It functioned fine for those rounds. I am only putting it up for trade because 32 isnt a caliber I reload for or have much of a use for. This is in decent shape for being as old as it is, but it does have definite signs of use and wear, but nothing too unexpected for being this old. This also could use a good cleaning, as I have not had a chance to do it because I just had it out shooting a few hours ago. This would be a fantastic carry gun because of its size and it has very low recoil. Also, I have seen that even academy stocks the defense rounds for it so ammo wouldnt be terrible to find like it is with a lot of the smaller calibers. This will also come with two extra mags for the right trade or cash offer (making the total 3 mags). Please feel free to message me on here, or shoot me a TEXT ONLY at REDACTED and I can answer any and all questions that way. This will be sold as is with no returns just because of the nature of it so please ask any questions now and I will be happy to answer them the best I can. I can also message pictures if you would like. I also have a cz70 for sale as well, so feel free to make an offer on the pair if you would like."

All USGI. Some New Old Stock, (NOS), still new in the wrapper. Only repro item is a M1903 sight hood. Some Smith Corona parts, as evidenced by markings, and lack of markings. No wood, receivers, barrels or triggerguards, but lots of the rest.  Can help you finish out many M1903A3s. Found it as a horde of parts several years ago at a small show in the UP of Michigan. You just don't find large lots of original USGI parts for US martial firearms like this anymore. I am only wanting about a third of the retail cost of these, as some of the bands may require refinishing, and some of the screw heads, etc.,  are not pristine.None of the screw threads are buggered.  Many of the screws and other bits are near NOS, though. I can provide more pictures.

I've seen recent completed auctions for these go for around $700 so I was asking $700 but I lowered it to $600. 

As far as I know, this build was never completed and there are new parts. But there are some parts that are obviously used so I have to classify this sell as a used gun. I will only sell to an Indiana resident and it would be nice to see a LTCH but not required. I like to verify I'm selling to a legitimate person but I don't document anything unless you want me to. If you want a bill of sale, I can do that. I'm flexible.

When checking the original configurations of the Colt Match Target™ M4 Carbines, I found they were originally produced to be 49 state legal and had a blind pinned stock. Basically, the stock looked like it was collapsible but wasn't. I also didn't find any with 2 stage triggers in original configuration. Two changes that would've probably been done to an original to make it a good match grade shooter lower has already been completed. They were also shipped out with 10 round magazines to make their 49 state legal market. I don't have anything but 30 round mags I can throw in for the right deal.

If you want a good head start on a nice Colt build, this lower is perfect. The only things I would change on the lower is the standard grip, trigger guard and stock. I'd probably go with an Ergo or something more comfortable for me and a SOPMOD style stock. That's just personal preference for me, but for you, this is a good starting platform with a name brand Colt lower.

I am negotiable and have ammo, mags, and other accessories we can work out a deal for the interested party. Let me know if you're interested and we can try to make something happen."

He had them on his wall for decoration, but I don't know where he got them. It is a matched 6X6 set of elk antlers. Show pleasing age, but obviously didn't sit in the elements all that long, as they aren't weathered - just some scattered age cracks from hanging indoors. A couple of the tine tips are broomed/chipped off (showed one), but the aging on it shows it was done long ago - possibly even when the animal was alive. I have used them for photo props and had intended to hang them in a man cave someday, but we are doing some reorganizing and I really don't have the room to store them indefinitely. They measure 42"" from base to the farthest tine - that is measuring straight, not following the curve of the antlers and not measuring from the brow tines. They are well matched and very nice.

So, time for them to have a new home. Put them in your man cave. Cut them up for grips. Cut them up for chew toys (there is a big market for that, especially on ebay, and I could get a lot more for them selling them that way than what I am asking if you come pick them up and haul them off). $150 firm picked up in Hickory, NC. This is well below market value for them. Not really interested in trades, but you could pass something by me if you like.

913,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2309913,For Sale:  Oak deer rattler calls for use or resale,"Hickory, Hickory / Lenoir, North Carolina",$ 4,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 11, 2014",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"A friend of mine used to manage a vocational training shop who would contract manufacturing out to interested parties. A local man designed these oak deer rattlers and had them make up a pallet of them. He died before paying and they sat on a pallet gathering dust. My friend wanted to clear some space, so I bought 10 of them to try and sell before buying the whole pallet, never got around to it, then he found another job and I don't know what happened to the rest. At any rate, the man who designed them had an instructional video of him using the rattler that he showed my friend and it worked very well - he called a lot of deer in with them and hunted with them himself. You rattle with it, beat and paw the ground with it, etc. Of course, the video was with the man and I never got a copy.

So, as I clean things out, I found my box of these. They are new in the box. They come in a plain white box and are very well made. The handle is about 13.5"" long, to give you an idea of scale. Production cost on them was $10 or $12 each and the man sold them for $25 or $30 (he started making them himself, then went full production when they caught on around here). I'd like to sell the whole lot of 10 for $35, picked up in Hickory, NC. Price is firm. Not terribly interested in trades, but you can try me. Maybe we can find something I need and you don't.
