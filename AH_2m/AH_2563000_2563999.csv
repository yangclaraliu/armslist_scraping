Newer model P229 magazines can also be used for an even greater round count. Featuring a lightweight alloy frame, the P224 will be available in a number of configurations. .357SIG Traditional SRT triggers, Full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights allow the P224 to deliver pinpoint accuracy, which can be a challenge in most subcompacts. New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same. The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns. The SIG Anti-Snag (SAS) model features a de-horned slide and frame, and the new ergonomically enhanced one-piece grip. SIGLITE Night Sights will be standard in the Nitron® coated slide. The short-reset trigger (SRT) will be available in the DA/SA version.

All powders are fresh stock, purchased by me in factory sealed cases of ten 1# cans of the same lot. Because I buy retail from distributors at shows all over the midwest and east coast - prices vary depending on what I paid for the cases I currently have. I charge a markup of $3-$4 per pound profit over what I paid. 

If you're interested in pricing on a particular powder- please let me know ASAP. I won't be bringing a large stock of extra items with me besides pre-orders, but will be bringing a few cases. If you are interested in purchasing a larger amount, I can bring you factory sealed cases if I hear from you by tomorrow. Most powders are around $35/can. A couple are a little higher and a couple are a little lower - but all are in that ""ballpark"". All the powders I currently have in stock are 1# cans. 

You can contact me by email. You can also text or call me at REDACTED if interested in placing an order to pickup from me face to face while I'm in the Horseshoe Bay area this weekend. Cash only, please."

(this one was the 399 one made) Has small circular saftey F - S ring - only needs to be turned appx: 15 degrees to go from Safe to Fire.
The word Stinger is not on it. Only 22 LR & the above. Only whats underlined is on the item. 
In 2002 the gun was resurrected and built by the Stinger Manufacturing Company in Michigan. That company appears to have went belly-up in 2004.
Two are for sale on GunBroker.com - one is asking $499.99, the other $665.00. Now that is what they are asking, not what they will necessarily get. Used

Firearm: Stinger Pen Pistol

Barrel Length: 2 in  Overal length is 5, 1/2""
Finish: Stainless  Diameter 1/2""
Grips/Stock: Stainless
Overall Condition: 98% with Instruction manual. Everything works !!!
This highly collectable and rare little pistol looks like an ordinary writing pen, but 
a simple maneuver, it changes into a ready to fire single shot pistol.  This gun allows its carrier to carry completely incognito, as anyone would assume it's just a pen.  No Class 3/NFA paperwork on this one, since it doesn't fire until you transform it, but it is a VERY simple process to do so.  These are very rare, so don't miss your opportunity! The gun has no signs of wear. See random YouTube of one !"

***DISCALIMER*** Unless you have a valid NC concealed carry permit, All handgun transfers in North Carolina, whether through a dealer or via private sale, or presented as a gift, require that the intended recipient of the handgun obtain a Pistol Purchase Permit from his/her local Sheriff.  You must go to your Sheriff, apply for a Pistol Purchase Permit (one per handgun you wish to purchase), and pay a $5 fee.  When you take possession of the handgun you must present the Permit to the seller, who is required to retain it forever.  If a Pistol Purchase Permit is not presented, both the buyer and the seller can be convicted of a Class I Misdemeanor."

The G17 RTF2 is the second pistol that GLOCK, Inc. has released with the new rough textured frame and slide serration pattern. The newly designed frame incorporates more than 4,000 raised pyramids on the front, rear and sides of the polymer receiver and has a newly designed crescent shaped serration pattern located at the rear of the slide. The RTF2 ""with gills"" was discontinued because of the added time it took for Glock to machine the curve in the gills. More time = less guns off the assembly line = discontinued and collectable."

The function of the gun is flawless.  The finish on the gun is an 8/10.  Make no mistake, this was not and is not a parade rifle, but it also wasn't run over by a tank or attacked by a tiger.  Its just a great gun with some small areas where the finish is starting to wear.

Photograph Restoration: 
- Basic Restoration - $20 (up to 2 hours work time) The basic restoration will cover most of your needs unless your photograph is especially rough or if it needs to be absolutely perfect for an enlargement. The end product is a high resolution digital file that will be yours to do with as you please, or for an additional cost I would be happy to make you professional quality prints with quality calibrated equipment. (very noticable difference as compared to any local one hour printing service, and I have many high quality printing options to choose from)

Scanning Services:
- Turn your paper photographs into digital photographs, and use them on the computer or store them away for safe keeping. 

- Helpful Tip - Storing a copy of your digital photographs in a bank lock box is a great way to ensure that your precious memories are never lost in a fire/flood/or natural disaster. 

- Basic Photo Scanning - only 25¢ and $5 minimum. Includes scanning your photographs into high resolution digital files (600dpi) without modifications.

The latest addition has been a matched set of extended slide release along with extended thumb safety. Much easier to handle with one hand if the need arises. All original parts have been kept so she can be put back to her original state in a matter of minutes. The only thing that needs attention is one of the grip screw escutcheons is stripped. Just found it the other day when I was cleaning it. No big deal at all. Find replacements all over EBay for $30.00 for a set of (4). Just don't have the time and you don't notice it anyway. I love this fine handgun but unfortunately other, more important things have arisen so I am forced to sell. Will include (4) Magazines and a padded case with the sale. All you will need is ammo and a place to shoot. Buyer will be responsible for all transfer and shipping expenses. I will gladly take the gun to a local FFL to have it properly packaged, shipped, transferred, etc.. or of course, Local meeting will work as well. You will not be disappointed with this gun.

I am relisting this revolver and if it doesn't sell in a week I'm taking it off armslist. There's been a lot of interest but I want to do the sale locally so we both know that the deal is legit.
I also have spent many hours photographing and speaking with interested local parties only to have them come up with an excuse at the last moment. Aside from dealing with the scammers, being too nice and accommodating hasn't gotten my revolver sold so here's the deal.
If you want the meanest cap and ball ever made with a couple very small scratches but a great bore, no rust, greased and strong nipples, in excellent shooting condition, which I have cared deeply for over the years, for $275 instead of $440, the gun's yours.
I'm selling the gun because I need to put the money towards tools for my business so I really need to get it sold and done with. 
I have 40 more pictures in high def and can send them all if you want. I completely understand wanting to inspect the gun before you buy it and I'd be happy to do whatever I can to give you an a thorough email inspection beforehand. It's a great gun and I'm an honest guy and I expect the same from the buyer.

All other parts were thoroughly cleaned of the cosmoline and treated with Frog Lube.  they are all accounted for in the one pic.  

Included is:
-All original Norinco SKS parts
-Tapco Olive Drab stock with rail on top and bottom
-1 Tapco 20 round magazine
-1 Promag 30 round magazine
-200 rounds of ammo

Must have an NC DL and sign a bill of sale.

Thank you."

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel.

 PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward.

I love the looks of it and it is a beast.   I have numerous shotguns and rifles and for me there is no practical reason to keep it…other than to deplete my 12g a ammo.  I have put probably about 200 shells through this monster and it has performed amazingly.

Here is the D.C. Engineering Dragonov Style Norinco SKS in like new condition. This company DC Engineering is worth taking a look at. They supply after market parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detriot magazine is hand welded in two seperate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragonov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragonov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in dissassembly with their Dragonov stock repacement. Their current SKS offering is $875.00. The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering offers an adapter to use AK47 mags. $575.00

I thought I was going to carry it more, but I just always reach for my sig when I walk out of the house. So I am looking to get something more fun:

I am really looking for a trade. I would be interested in any revolver. Preferably 3"" barrel or longer, but the right snubbie could persuade me. Would prefer a .357.

Would consider any 1911 (.45) or .40 semi.

Would also trade for a .357/.38 lever action.

I am not in a big hurry to get rid of it and won't be offended by any offers, worst I can say is no right? 

If the trade offers dry up, I am willing to sell for cash. $375 initially. 

I will not trade or sell without seeing a valid NC CCW or PPP with matching NCDL. I am in the triad area, but would be willing to meet half way for folks further out. I will also be attending the GSO gun show in Feb, so if you are in town for that we could work something out."
