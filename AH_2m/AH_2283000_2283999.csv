There are a few markings but they aren't as defined as the markings on the gun itself. The bayonet mount serial number doesn't match the serial numbers inside the gun. So it was probably added from another rifle somewhere along the line. 

- comes with dust cover. Doesn't have markings on it though. Not sure if it's original, late run, or a reproduction. 

- comes with a gun strap that is obviously not from WWII. 


Really a nice rifle. Would be happy to email more pictures of everything. Not sure what to ask price wise but feel free to offer. I'm open to trades and have a few boxes of 7.7 ammo that can be added for the right price/deal. This ammo isn't made any longer and runs up in the 80-125$ range per box when you can find it. 2 companies made it and I believe I have the better quality ammo of the two."

Statistically - 99% of attacks on individuals happen at a distance of 3 feet.

Do you practice blocking, moving off the ‘X’, drawing from concealment, point shooting, working through malfunctions, let alone fighting to get to your sidearm - all simultaneously… or do your training drills consist of shooting a non-reactive target at a fixed distance? If you fall into the second category – you’re not alone; most shooters in Florida who are licensed to carry concealed never practice advanced tactics, let alone drills which prepare them for a telephone booth sized fight for their life!

This one-on-one course deals with what happens in real-time at “bad breath distances” when an encounter transitions from conversation to your adversary striking you with the clear intent of taking you to the ground and having their way with you.

It is as much a thinking course as it is a shooting skills course taught by an instructor who was a Special Forces soldier for 8 years and a high risk bodyguard in 13 countries for more than 20 years.

Being one-on-one allows the instructor to cater the course to your specific daily activities: sitting behind a desk, working from a vehicle, a mother with small children, etc. - instead of a cookie-cutter curriculum. We maximize your time with us so you get the most increase in your skills possible.

This course is taught only during the week as public ranges are swamped to capacity during weekend hours and the advanced drills you will be practicing are not permitted without an instructor. The course locations are restricted to West Palm Beach & Fort Lauderdale/Pembroke.

Cost for this dynamic course is $250. (plus range fee) for 3 hours of immersion-style one-on-one training.

Course requirements: Concealed weapon permit, pistol(semi-auto or revolver), concealment holster (if you purse carry the instructor will provide several purses for you to shoot through), 2 working magazines or speed loaders and a holster/pouch for same, 150 rounds of ball ammunition, eye & ear protection.

Why would someone pay $900 for a .22? 
Simple. When you consider all of the possible rifles for survival purposes, defense and enjoyment the .22 makes sense. Ammunition is light and relatively affordable, accuracy and sheer number of semi auto firepower (forget what the world might tell you about stopping power i.e. witness the .223 round). If properly built the Ruger 10 22 can be everything you need.

This rifle is stamped Arsenal Las Vegas Nevada USA, is in pristine condition and currently owned by a gunsmith.

This Arsenal Pre-Ban SAM7A1R 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.

From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.

The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7A1R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, 2 30 round magazines, sling, and cleaning kit.

FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. AK scope rail. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines.

Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Made in Germany. 

USP Compact 45 Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life. 
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes. 
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish. 
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves. 
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel. 
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories. 
Ambidextrous magazine release lever. 
Extended slide release. 
Patented Lock-Out Safety device.

Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation. We have added an EOTech XPS2-Z Zombie Stopper holographic sight, Troy industries flip up front and rear Iron Sights, Custom internal light/laser combo, and a tactical choke tube. We did some minor gunsmithing work for the light/laser install and have test fired 20 rounds to test function."

Czech mfr for WWII Germany in 1945. Significant in that these were originally made for Nazi world domination and the suppression/extinction of the Jews. Post WWII, many went to the Jews for their protection and later to Israel to take on the Arabs surrounding the newly formed nation. Israel rebarreled their K98's to the more readily available 7.62 Nato and used them until sometime around 1973. So, a weapon originally manufactured to harm the Jewish people was used to later protect them!

I purchased this shotgun about a year and a half ago. It comes with a 28"" ported field barrel, and a 24"" rifled slug barrel with an adjustable rear sight. Also the shotgun is drilled and tapped for a scope mount. I have only put 100 rounds of birdshot through the field barrel, and 5 slugs through the slug barrel. It has no wear on the outside, as I never hunted or tracked through the woods with it. Only did some target shooting to test it out.  It's been stored in a case, inside my safe for the past year. The gun functions perfectly, and was cleaned after use. Face to face, cash transaction only. Retails for $400, and I'm looking to get $300 due to the very small amount of use on it, and overall great condition of the gun."

LOTS OF EXTRAS!,"North of Green Bay (Pulaski), Green Bay, Wisconsin","$ 1,199","Listed On: Thursday, October 31, 2013",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a Mathews Helim bow. I bought it brand new from the factory for $995 1 year ago. I was never a Mathews fan, but this bow draws back very smoothly, is fast, and is very accurate, so I bought it. It has a 29 inch draw length and is capable of going up to 70lbs. I have it set for 65 pounds right now. If you have a different draw length, any Mathews dealer will adjust the draw for you free of charge.

I didn’t skip any corners when I put accessories on the bow. It is equipped with a HHA adjustable pin sight ($150) All the yardage makers are right on up to 60 yards (furthest I ever shot) The sight pin is 0.010” it was the finest sight they had, so you will have no problem shooting at long distances. It has a Quality Archery Designs HDX drop away rest ($130) It comes with 6 carbon express maxima arrows ($80) that are camouflage, and 3 rage broad heads (2 blade version $40) It also comes with a hard case ($40) a TruFire 4 finger relase ($100) a Primos bow sling ($30) a block target ($80) and a black hole target. 

I have a lot of money stuck into this setup, I realize that this is a year old and its is used, but I can honestly say its been shot very little. I dialed it in right away last year and didn’t use it. This year I shot it 2 arrows at 20 yards and 2 arrows at 40 yards, and it was right on. This thing is so accurate I robin hooded an arrow at 40 yards. I cannot shoot more than 2 times at 1 target. I went out and shot 3 deer this year with it (all pass throughs and did not run far) I’m selling it because I’m moving to California for awhile and wont be using it for a few years.

Any questions, or if you would like to see this amazing bow, feel free to call or text Mike at REDACTED. I work 6am till 3pm usually, so if I don't answer your call or text right away, I will get back to you. Thank you for looking!"

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

Polished Stainless CZ-75B with 2 POUND TRIGGER PULL! Single Action Only trigger.
OK, I am going DEEP into the safe for this one. This is a 2010 CZ 75B 9mm with the Polished Stainless slide and frame. Beautiful pistol. This has the Beavertail frame rather than the standard frame. Has the full Trigger job, Cajun Gunworks Competition Hammer and sear and Flat SAO Trigger with adjustable Pre and Over-travel. Think 9mm 1911 with a crazy light trigger. This is NOT a carry piece. The sights are the LPA Adjustable rear and the CZ Custom Fiber Optic front, installed by CZ Custom in Mesa, Arizona. This one has a CGW floating trigger pin and lighter trigger return spring and an 11.5# mainspring. I also installed a CGW hardened tool steel firing pin retaining pin and removed the firing pin block. The interior trigger parts have all been polished.
This includes:
Four 16 round magazines - two with polished stainless base plates and one 17 round magazine. Excellent VG Grips,
The original factory box and cover, manual, target, warranty card, CZ mag loader, and cleaning tools. AND A range bag that holds 7 mags.
Condition is excellent. Round count under 500. It's almost too nice to shoot but it is LAZER accurate. Seriously, I have let other guys try it and they are dead on from the first shot.
OK, The price on this one is $999. I have just shy of $1200 invested. Will shoot as well as a Shadow SAO and looks better! Will consider some trade on higher end firearms.

 I recently purchased the bike from the second owner. He indicated that the clutch cable was replaced during his last trip. I suspect that it will need adjustment as there is a lag in engagement and it has the noticeable first generation clunk when shifting gears. I have read that this is typical of the 1999 to 2001 V92C bikes prior to the Freedom motors and transmissions. I had planned to work on the Victory over the winter but a lack of funds prevents my doing so. Please check out the videos and pictures of the bike. This is # 372 of a total 1500 produced and has a handlebar mount tag denoting the production number.
