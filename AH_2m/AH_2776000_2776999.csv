This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I have a Mosin Nagant that I really don't know the origins of. I've been told that it is a Finnish rework. Someone else thinks that it is not a Finnish rework but is a Spanish Civil War Nagant. 

I'm no expert but here is what I know. I can find no matching numbers on this rifle. The cocking knob is from one of the earliest models as it is serialized which is very uncommon. The receiver is an Izhevsk with date 1937r and the arrow in a triangle (post 1928). There also appears to be a spot on the receiver just above the date near the barrel where something has been scrubbed off. The bolt has the bow and arrow symbol which is izhevsk post 1928. The stock has Tula star markings on the metal pieces that retain the barrel or handguard bands. I have done nothing to this rifle since I bought it except run a cleaning cloth down the bore a few times which has very crisp and clean rifling. I tried to get a picture but was unable to get it to focus well enough to see any of the rifling. This rifle has all the wear and patina that one would expect to see from a WWII rifle that hasn't been refurbished. It is in nice original condition with no import marks and will look great in anyone's collection! If you have any questions feel free to email me."

Trust me when I say you dont need to spend hunderds of dollars on some expensive trigger group like Geissele, Timmney, Chip McCormick, JP, ETC. These are a waste of time and money. This kit can easily be installed in under an hour and is adjustable.  Perfect for 3 gun, predator/coyote hunting, target practicing, or even just plinking.

No person I've ever talked to said they liked their stock AR trigger. In fact the extra long pull and gritty feel left them afraid of their $1500 investment, not knowing when their trigger was going to break. 

I'm selling the kit for $60, it comes with explicit instructions,  tools and all the hardware to complete this modification. All you need is a drill and a screwdriver.  Please note some of the modifications require greater skill and a few extra tools.

I will install this kit and offer a trigger pull pound guarantee. Install is $120 and includes the kit and you keep the tools!

This modification requires a stock un modified single stage trigger group.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place.

https://www.narescue.com/portal.aspx?CN=AA580649A981

North American Rescue pays attention. We listen. We learn. We act. We develop products like the Warrior Aid and Litter Kit™ (WALK®), our innovative and reliable response to requests from Warfighters and Tactical Healthcare Professionals to re-think the purpose of vehicle life-saving kits and re-engineer them to decrease preventable death. 

Success is confirmed. The US Army selected the WALK® as its official vehicle life-saving kit. 

How did we do it? 

First, we gathered as much information as possible to correctly define the requirement. From numerous observations and after-action reviews compiled from operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, we learned that a new focus was needed for vehicle first-aid kits. From Warfighters and Tactical Healthcare Professionals, we learned that the focus ought to be decreasing preventable combat death at the point of wounding. 

With the task defined, we developed the product. The Warrior Aid & Litter Kit™ (WALK®) allows first-aid treatment and immediate evacuation of one patient in a non-traditional vehicle, plus it allows multiple other trauma patients to be treated until additional transport arrives. That’s successful engineering. 

Our engineers took the state-of-the-art Talon® 90C (a quad-fold rigid litter with retractable handle system) and designed a package that holds not only the litter, but also a streamlined pocket-system containing self- and buddy-aid medical supplies. The WALK® gives true definition to the term “aid and litter” kit. The WALK® also contains our Hypothermia Prevention & Management Kit (HPMK™) to help stabilize patients during transport. 

Light and compact, the WALK® reduces cubic weight and, thereby, evacuation time. 

The WALK® interfaces with any standard or non-standard casualty evacuation asset and is ideal as part of the pre-positioning of medical supplies or cache for disaster response. The WALK® has adjustable shoulder straps for occasions when the kit is used to provide treatment and evacuation on target. Bags may also be purchased separately. 

The WALK® is the new vehicle life-saving kit for the Department of Defense. 

North American Rescue is customer-centric. We don’t develop solutions to impose on demands. We develop solutions to meet demands."

Ai also built a custom all steel free float chasis system and gave the stock 8 coats of hand rubbed oil finish.

I'm looking to buy a Romanian WASR-10 AKM variant rifle. I'm well aware of the potential problems with these guns (canted front sights/gas port/rear sight blocks, mag wobble, etc.) Which is why I'm weary of rolling the dice and buying the gun from an on-line vendor. 

Rifle doesn't have to be new, but well taken care of. Rifle must be straight with no cants, with little/no mag wobble, and must have the bayonet lug intact. I am not looking to purchase extras, just the rifle. I have cash in hand, and I'm willing to sign a bill of sale. 

Send me a text at (six-zero-eight) 5-one-eight-7-one-seven-2 if you have something along these lines. I know how much these rifles go for, so please, don't pretend I was born yesterday with ridiculous overpriced offers.

remington Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC Blackout, this rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price. At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design, ensuring uniformity, strength, and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16.5"" inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed. The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue OverMolded, Ghillie Green, pillar-bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar-bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington's X-Mark Pro externally-adjustable trigger, designed to break-like-glass and set at 3.5 pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical accuracy.

This stock is Kevlar reinforced polymer and allows for use if detachable magazines rather than the normal top loading 5 round magazine.  This makes the gun much more enjoyable to shoot since you can just throw in a mag like any other gun rather than fighting with stripper clips or having the interrupter jam the rounds.  The gun will include both a 10 and 5 round magazine.  This stock also allows for length of pull and cheek weld height via dials on the stock.  All these features make this the nicest Mosin stock I have seen.  The stock also has a relief cut for the addition of a Timney trigger.

Ever wonder what you'd do if a psycho with a knife charged at you? Or how you'd really handle a multiple adversary situation?

FIND OUT FOR CERTAIN IN OUR INTERACTIVE GUNFIGHTING TRAINING!!

Force on Force is the future of personal combat training. This course is Pure CQB Gunfighting Skills, and will connect what you do on the range with what you must do on the street to win a fight.

Typical marksmanship-based gun training leaves many questions unanswered. There is a great deal that you still don't know about street combat if all you've done is shoot paper targets on a shooting range. Even the many ""shoothouse"" exercises at many gun schools are still woefully inadequate in preparing you for a street confrontation. But in this class, the training is pure street reality featuring high intensity, short duration combat at close range against live human beings with modern force on force technology. It is specifically designed for the private citizen and focuses on civilian street situations. Learn to defend against a single adversary bent on cutting you with a training knife, as well as against multiple adversaries suddenly drawing guns and firing at you. Learn what it takes to overcome home invaders, takeover robbers, hostage takers and active shooters! In today's environment, everyone has a need to know.

The training is open to ALL civilian students AT ANY SKILL LEVEL, and is the sort of class you can attend over and over again to maintain your edge!! Fight-focused NOT Gun-focused!

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol. This XD-S
model comes with a durable rugged case and two  magazines--one
flush-fitting stainless steel 7-round magazine and one full-size Mag
X-tension 9-round magazine.

Piston driven upper, Ultra Lite 14.5"" barrel (pinned to 16"" with brake) is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.With the combination of the .625"" ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution rail, and the new ultra lite .625"" gas block, we have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own."

Every BOB should have one for the long trek to BOL, should you encounter any zombies along the way, or should you get shot down or standed in the backcountry and need to fend off some giant grays, or you possibly need to re-enact From Russia With Love or Goldfinger!  The barrel detaches from the receiver and the basic unit fits in the buttstock which FLOATS!!!   The scope and rings have to be removed to do so but the barrel will still fit in the stock.   I have taken this on a few walkabouts so there is the usual wear marks,  this is hardly a pristine finish rifle.

This is an older model than the current US Survival,  this model is has the solid metal barrel, whereas the new models are partially polymer.  This particular receiver has been dovetailed to accept scope rings and a scope as seen.    I can throw in the scope rings if you wish but I would like to keep my scope,  I do have another bushnell 3x9 scope if you wish.    

Includes the 2 original 7 round magazines, and 1 extra 15 round extra long Colorado compliant magazine.  

I can throw in a 50 round box of .22LR if you wish, ONLY with the rifle. 

I am really looking to trade for another rimfire,   I am especially looking for a CZ .17HMR I would trade straight across.   I would consider another brand .17HMR,  a Takedown ruger 10/22,  or 10/22Magnum, or Ruger American.

This new “Heavy” 44 SPL load is designed for use in all 44 SPL handguns and rifles, except Charter Arms Bull Dog. Likewise, it is safe for use in all 44 magnum chambered firearms. This Barnes X type bullet will expand on flesh and bone and penetrate more deeply than most expanding lead core bullets of the same weight. Expect roughly 16 to 18 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

We’ve utilized a flash retardant powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire should he need to “drop the hammer” in low light. Since nearly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US occur in low light, when the criminal element is active, low flash powders can give an enormous tactical advantage to the user.

As always, Buffalo Bore uses real, over-the-counter firearms to determine our published, real-world velocities. We prefer not to follow the industry wide, duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory test barrels to generate exaggerated velocities that the ammo user will seldom, if ever see. With Buffalo Bore you will know what velocity your ammunition is generating in the real world, where it matters.

NEVER FIRED!!

This upper will mount on any standard AR-15 Lower and uses the same magazines as a .223/5.56mm rifle. What this means is that if you have an .223/5.56mm AR, you can pull the two takedown pins, snap on the .300 upper and end up with everything the AR is known for - an accurate, reliable, lightweight assault weapon, but with a much heavier payload (115gr) and the stopping power that goes with it. Excellent for medium to heavy game (large deer, elk, wild boar). I built one using the same upper and it's a 1 MOA rifle that my 10 year old shoots with ease. He's GOOD too!

I shot maybe 150 rounds in my gun with this in it, which according to Lenny Magill
is a good thing (the more you use it, the more it gets worked in and the trigger pull
feels better - he says this in the installation videos he provides on GlockStore and on
YouTube.

**I'm also selling the GlockStore competition spring kit (the extra weight trigger spring is not included in this spring kit). 
So, it comes with: 
a reduced power firing pin safety spring, 
3 firing pin springs. 2lb, 4lb, and 6lb firing pin spring. 

I will sell all together for $25 or the trigger connector for $20 & springs for $5. The trigger connector goes for $25 new, and the competition spring kit goes for $12 new (plus shipping), so you would be spending $37 + shipping to order these from GlockStore.

Lightning-fast in close quarters and superbly accurate for the long shot, the compact, short-action Model Seven™ has been a knock-down, drag-out leader in the woods since it was introduced in 1983. Its receiver and action design are based on the Model 700™ and deliver the highest level of out-of-the-box accuracy, strength and reliability in a platform that’s 2 3/8"" shorter overall and weighs just 6 1/2 lbs. (standard calibers). When you match this handy design with some of the hardest-hitting calibers known to big game – the short action magnum cartridges – you need a longer barrel. Thus, Model Seven rifles in these chamberings have a 22"" magnum contour barrel.

A dream to handle, our compact Model Seven™ Predator is officially every predator and varmint’s worst nightmare. The new Model Seven Predator weighs in at 7 lbs. and is decked from butt to bore in Mossy Oak® Brush® camo to surpass your needs for mobility and concealment. Much like our legendary Model 700™ action, the Model Seven platform will amaze you with its accuracy right out of the box.

The Predator’s fluted, magnum-contour 22"" barrel promotes awesome long-shot repeatability and cools quickly when the action heats up.
Key Features:

    Full coverage in Mossy Oak® Brush® camo
    Fluted – Magnum contour 22"" barrel
    Same style synthetic stock as Model Seven™ XCR
    X-Mark Pro® Trigger for superior shooting time after time

As you can see in the pictures, someone took the rifle and made it more of a sportster edition and took the military straps/gold medallion and hand grooves out of the stock and replaced them with wood. However, it's still a very unique weapon and fires incredibly tight groups. Would be great for a collector or someone looking for a deer rifle for their kid. (The barrel is short and easily managable.) According to what I can find on the internet these weapons are somewhat rare to find. However, since it's not in it's original condition I am only asking $200 for it."

Comment on this rifle:
Whippet was a trade name used on firearms made for Hibbard, 
Spencer, Bartlett and Company of Chicago, IL and made by J. Stevens Arms Company.

I believe the rifle pictured is a variant of the Stevens Model 15 made between 1937 and 1948. There are no records existing that will give a more exact date, but, I would speculate that it was made in the period 1937-1942."
