Para Ordnance P14 Hi Cap Model PRX1445CB. This is one of the Military Deployment Models that Para put out for the military. This specific model is for PRT KHOST, (Provincial Reconstruction Team KHOST, for the area in Afghanistan)

This model has the emblems of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and a US Navy emblem as well as a another skull emblem on the right side. I was in the military  It comes with 4 (14 round) magazines, the pistol and the box. These are very hard to find and you only see them on occasion on GB or anywhere else for that matter, 

The pistol has a stainless steel match barrel and the frame and slide are also stainless steel with a cerakote type tan finish on it. The sights are 3 dot, tritium, the front sight is newer, I had it replaced from Para recently. The pistol shoots well, I am only selling cause I have some other things to fund right now. It has a rail and is a great home defense/tactical pistol, you get a lot of firepower, nice action, very crisp trigger, and dual safeties on it."

•This is no stripped-down basic pistol.

The feed ramp is polished, and the barrel is throated to feed hollowpoint ammunition.

Appears to be a 24"" octagon barrel. The serial number is 325,xxx making it from 1890 I believe. I will describe it to the best of my ability. Please email for more photos. I have a bunch.

The gun would range from good to very good based on antique gun guidelines. The stock and fore grip are nice with some little dents, scratches, etc…but nothing excessive. There is a very small hairline crack but very minor. I’m having a hard time getting a good photo of it so keep checking back. Finding these with the stock in this condition is not an easy task. The bore appears fine but it’s hard for me to see. There is wear to the rifling and maybe a bit of pitting but nothing extreme. The gun itself has normal loss of some bluing and there is wear, nicks and some minor pitting but everything appears to be in nice working order. Everything appears to be original and the stock has not been refinished nor has the gun been reblued The only item I see that is not correct is the front site blade. The blade has been replaced with what looks like a piece of bone. The screws all look original with very little wear on them. This gun is just shy of 125 years old and has been used but it is a beautiful gun with a load of history and a little TLC will take it another 125 years.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to ask and I’ll reply promptly. I want to make sure that the new owner of this is happy as it’s quite a treasure. 

No shipping required for local. Shipping will be $35 to the US 48 ONLY and will INCLUDE insurance. This item must be shipped to an FFL or C&R. Please make sure it’s legal for you to own this.

The principal designer was George Kelgren, formerly of the the Intratec and Grendel firearms companies. The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[1] Due to the PLR’s relatively short barrel, the 5.56 cartridge’s velocity is considerably reduced compared to its velocity from a longer barrel. The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system similar to that of the M-1 Garand, M-14, and AK-47.[1] This system requires less maintenance than the direct gas impingement system of the AR-15 platform. The PLR-16’s frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights.[1] Kel-Tec produces an optional polymer forend with a Picatinny rail for mounting flashlights or laser sights.This gun has it all! >>>  INCLUDES - LARGE RED DOT (8 BRIGHTNESS SETTINGS) SIGHT FOR QUICK ACQUISITION - 150 LUMEN PUSH BUTTON TACH LIGHT - GREEN PUSH BUTTON LASER (5mW) - SQUID FOREARM WITH RAIL - SLANT FOREGRIP (VERTICLE NOT LEGAL ON A PISTOL) - (1) 30 ROUND METAL MAG - (1) SUREFIRE 60 ROUND DOUBLE STACK METAL MAGAZINE - SOFT CASE W/ 4 MAG POUCHES - CENTER CARRY SLING - DOOR KNOCKER FLASH HIDER"

Anyway, I have never shot the darn thing.  Been in my gun safe for the past 20 plus years.  I don't think it is brand new but hard to tell.  If it is used it is in great condition.  From my research, it appears they go for around $750 new so I'm guessing this is worth around $700.  I also have 2 mags that came with it.  I would like to trade (with or without cash added from either party) or I guess sell it outright for $700.  The 308 is too big of a round for me.  I would look at all trades though.....wish list:  357, lever action stuff, Beretta Storm CX4, 44's or whatever. I don't want any guns that need work though.  That is not something I'm good at.  I just like to collect and go out and shoot once in awhile.  I will be going to the Hara arena show this weekend (not sure if Sat or Sun) so if you are there maybe we could trade there!"

Simply put, the Caldwell AR Mag Charger revolutionizes the way ammo is handled and loaded into AR-15 magazines. It is designed to accept 50 loaded rounds directly from any common 50 round ammo manufacturer box or from aftermarket 50 round plastic storage boxes. Simply align bullet tips and dump a box of ammo into the Mag Charger. The ammo is automatically aligned without touching a single round. Once filled with ammo, insert any AR magazine into the Mag Charger just as you would into a rifle. Then actuate the plunger back and forth loading 5 rounds per stroke as the spring loaded ammo carrier automatically advances aligning the next five rounds until magazine is fully loaded. The entire process of filling the Mag Charger with ammo and loading all 50 rounds into two magazines takes less than 15 seconds! An Ammo Transfer Tray is included to invert ammo that is positioned in boxes with the bullet tips oriented down or to stage bulk ammo for dumping into Mag Charger. Highly durable Polycarbonate construction, compatible with .223, 5.56 and .204 ammo. Patent Pending.

Scope is new and isn't fine tuned yet ( zeroed enough last minute for deer season). This is a great rifle.  You could not buy a used 110fp and set it up the same for this price.  Does have some minor wear on barrel, reciever, and bolt,  but the bore is flawless it has been used not tucked in a safe.  Im not a dealer (if you are wondering because of the pics) buts its also for sale at LGS.  $775 prefer to sell but similar value rifle or handgun trades considerered.

I have never taken this near a body of water or planned too, the mariner coating made it a little more valuable. This Mossberg action is the one the Army decided to go with and is very reliable because it will not jam if the action is ""short-stroked"".(unlike the Rem870, which will jam). I purchased it used and put a few boxes through it, then in the safe it sat. Need more room in the safe and cash to spend on another toy. 

Comes with a sling/bandolier, shell holder(holds six on the side of the action), an adjustable rear ghost sight and Hi-viz front sight. No gun smithing or tinkering has been performed, it is 100% functional like it was out of the box).

The parts were done correctly and it is a really nice piece. It was for my girl but she doesn't shoot .40cal really. (I am just selling the Caliber Exchange Kit, not selling the Fire Control Module). So it will include the (3) Sig Pink Magazines, which are the factory Sig Sauer .357/.40 mags, the slide (which has contrast sights NOT night sights) and barrel/spring assembly and the break down lever. I am keeping the Fire Control Module because i have many other caliber exchange kits. with it installed, this gun fires flawlessly, and the cerakote does not take away from Sig's reliability at all. Also, the case is not included because that fire control module in the pictures matches the serial # on the case.
