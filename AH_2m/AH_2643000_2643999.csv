I purchase this along with a PT145 to see which one I preferred for carry and they are a very close match. Law enforcement is transitioning to the 40 cal so the ammo should be available even in tight markets.  But I have much more of the 45 ammo so this one is for sale. I do not have an exact round count but it was only a few magazines through it at the range to test. I have had it for a while but it just sits in the safe it so it is time for it to go. My PT145 has several hundred rounds through it flawlessly so I expect this to be the same, Taurus got these right!

Ambidextrous. That is how many shooters describe the BPS. And it is true. But the advantages are more than just being a great shotgun for the left- OR right-handed shooter. The bottom ejection design and full, two-sided steel receiver combine for a level of durability and strength that is not common among pump action shotguns today. The design is totally balanced, with matching dual steel slide action bars -- one on each side -- that balance forces for very smooth pumping. Top tang safety is functional convenience to the max. The receiver forms a ""roof"" over the action-- there is no opening on either side for an ejection port, so a drenching rain won't drip into the action. When you shoot bottom ejection makes sure there are no empties flying to the side, across your line of sight,  to distract your aim. Those that shoot a BPS are a unique bunch . . . a bit more serious about their hunting guns than most? Yes!

Bottom Ejection and Loading
Bottom ejection throws empty shells straight down, out of the line of sight, and makes the BPS the ultimate pump for right- or left-handed shooters. Bottom loading provides operating convenience.

Reliable Pump-Action
The proven pump-action design of the BPS is sound and reliable. All components are durably constructed of solid steel and are housed inside a receiver machined from a solid block of forged steel. Rigid double slide bars are made from heat-treated steel and eliminate twisting and binding for faster, more efficient operation. The result is smooth operation in all conditions and the ability to stay on target while delivering rapid follow-up shots.

There is an extremely small scratch on the back of the handle as shown in the pic. I have done a ton of research of prices and rarity.  This model in its current condition is becoming increasingly harder to find year by year.  Prices are everywhere. Decent condition is around 600 to near mint pieces like mine are selling around 1000 to even 2000!  So I decided on $700 OR BEST OFFER! Plus 250 .22 rounds.

Couple questions that I have answered:
1. it has not been counter bored (as far as I know)
2. it does not need a clip
3. the ammo is out there and available, but not a commonly used round

One more thing: This is a style of firearm by itself, if you are interest in restoring it back to a original military condition you are best to buy the $300 surplus rifles from other dealers. They are not valuable enough for a project like that.

This is a very nice gun that needs to get out and hunt some deer in the future."

Sightmark® Pistol Laser Boresights provide the most convenient and accurate method for sighting in pistols specific to the bore sight’s caliber. Simply chamber the bore sight like a regular bullet and a laser dot will show exactly where the pistol is aiming; it’s easy to sight in your firearm or scope without firing a single shot. Live fire is only needed to fine tune the firearm being sighted to compensate for inconsistencies, such as bullet drop due to distance. Perfect for hunters, competitive shooters and law enforcement, the Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is sure to take the frustration out of sighting in almost any pistol. The bore sights are easy to use and will quickly save both time and money by avoiding prolonged live fire tests at the range; use the extra ammo for honing those shooting skills and for the hunt. A lightweight carrying pouch protects the laser for convenient use in the field. The Sightmark™ Pistol Laser Bore Sight is available in the most common calibers for use with the most popular pistols.

Matte Stainless Steel construction with Sorbathane cushioned red strip grips for recoil reduction. 5 - Shot double locking cylinder due to magnum rounds in this gun.

Also comes with an Uncle Mikes right-hand hip holster P/N # 8118-1, Size 18 that is new in the box and was designed for this gun. This gun is about 9 years old and has been shot very little due to the amount of guns I have in my collection. This gun was bought new from Gander Mountain and has hardly ever been used. I also stopped deer hunting in 2006 - 2007 so this gun was hardly ever fired with less than 60 rounds down the barrel all together. This is a very nice gun that needs to get out and hunt some deer or other large beasts in the future."

I bought the gun in September of 2008; I still have the original receipt. I have been using the gun for home defense and have fired approximately 100 target practice FMJ rounds through it. I have maintained it in excellent condition and it has been cleaned and oiled regularly. I have kept it in a dry- pack sealed case in order to protect it from dust and moisture. 

The gun has a black finish, factory grips, and includes one 15 round magazine.The sights are standard white dot over white square with shoulders. Like all P226's, the gun does not have a safety and is single/double action. No aftermarket modifications have been made to the weapon. It shoots accurately and will provide many years of good use for target practice and home/personal defense. 

I will consider trading the gun for a Sig Sauer sub compact P250 in .45 ACP in good condition. if you a subcompact .45 from another manufacturer and would like to trade, send me a message with details on the gun. 

Thank you."

Ok apparently I need to clarify. This has a 800 dollar BCM upper with a 200 dollar hand guard and a 250 dollar bolt. This is not a POS set up this is a high quality upper. 

Lowest cash offer is 1000 dollars, that is my bottom line I will not sell it for 999."

The Hungarian SA-85Ms (post -ban sporters) were imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's for just a few years. Not too many of them in the U.S. The gun has a Russian buttstock (supposed to be Russian, but looks Romanian, bought it on ebay. I should have known better...lol), and upper handguard, and has an Ironwood Design lower handguard and pistol grip. Lower handguard and pistol grip are more reddish (Russian red) finished than the buttstock and upper handguard. The gun has enough U.S. made parts (trigger and hammer assembly, flash hider, and pistol grip. But I still have the original factory parts which goes with the gun) for the 922r compliance. Sorry about the pictures. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. Must be at least 18 years old, or older (with proper ID) only to buy/trade this gun. Local sale/trade only.

Nothing says love like a deadly weapon. Took it camping a few times and have fired 60 rounds through it. Quality product so as expected it had no issues. 

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20 round. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo.  I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal. Great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22.

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense. 

Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries. The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

Asking $500, we all know it's worth every penny. My wife and I have fallen on hard times and, as much as I don't want to give up the ability to protect my home...the car desperately needs its bald tires replaced ASAP, and I need college books.

They were battle torn when i received them (scratches and carvings in them), but I sanded, stained, and sealed them with a nice Red Oak stain.

The rifle itself will come with a sling, 30 round polymer magazine and a soft gun case!

Must have permit to purchase or permit to carry!

I will NOT ship this item."
