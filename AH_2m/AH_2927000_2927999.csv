Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense

The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Easy to Conceal

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

Personal Protection Made Easy

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.

Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA!"

I've had this rifle appraised and have been told between $1600-1900 since mine is all matching and is also a rifle made in the 5.7 million serial number range (rarer than most Garands) and because of the condition of the entire rifle to include the DAS cartouche on the stock. Every part on this Garand is correct for a Springfield Garand made in 1955. The barrel is dated for 5/55 as is the receiver.

Had it on my S&W, but my new holster doesn't like it, so I figured I might as well sell it since I can live without it. The left side button did break off, however the right side still works just fine, and if it bothers you that much, then you can call up Crimson Trace and tell them to fix it because it's still under warranty. Other than that it's still in pretty good condition and works perfect. They're $170, so given the fact that the left button isn't there I figure $135 should be a fair price.

 Standardized by the DEA, ATF, and FBI SWAT team, the Model 552 holographic weapon sight is the sight of choice for such military units as the Stryker Brigade, 10th Mountain, and 3rd Infantry. The Model 552 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.

The Model 552 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. The battle-proven design can withstand the abuse that any harsh environment, high-powered weapon platform, or military mission can dish out. Other features include a 65 MOA ring reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 30 brightness settings. The Model 552 is compatible with Gen I-IV night vision systems and mounts on 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

The action is smooth as butter, has cycled everything I have tried in it, even when working the lever very slowly. It is incredibly accurate, even with Remington UMC. It also has a kick-killer recoil pad on it, brand new, not so much for the recoil, but for the added stock length. As far as trades, I am looking for a Ruger GP100, a S&W 686 Plus, or a Ruger 77/357, or possibly a S&W CORE in 9mm in the 5"" slide, S&W 627. Depending on the trade, cash can be added on your end or my end. I can also through some ammo on top (.22lr, .357, or others) or cash on top for multiple guns. FTF around the Herdon/Ashburn area. If you have something to offer that's not on the list, feel free to ask, worst I'll say is no unless you're offering me junk. I know what pre-safety 1894's go for and you should as well.

GLOCK introduced the G22 .40 in 1990 and effectively closed the gap between the heavy .45 Auto, and the internationally proven 9x19. GLOCK was the first manufacturer to make this popular and effective round accessible for law enforcement agencies. Today, police agencies across the U.S., and countless others throughout the world, put their trust in this 15-round .40 caliber pistol."

The sight is in great condition, not so much as a scratch or smudge on it. I mounted this sight on my AR and only shot with it a few times. Otherwise it has been sitting in my safe without the batteries in it. 
The picture doesn't accurately depict the clarity of the reticle. The outer circle of the reticle is 65 MOA and the center dot is 1 MOA. This is the non-night vision model that takes AA batteries. AA batteries don't last as long as other offerings but as we all know they are cost-effective and the most readily available battery type.

I'll throw in a couple bulk boxes of batteries also.

I registered this HWS with L3 when I bought it a couple years ago.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.

This company, DC Engineering, is worth taking a look at. They supply after market AK, Ar15, and SKS parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detroit magazine is hand welded in two separate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragunov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragunov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragunov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering also offers a magazine adapter, not included here, to use AK47 mags. $450.00 OBO Cash only at this time.

Amazing carry gun that fits into your pocket and no one could tell. It is a stainless steel gun that holds 5+1.

NRA MODERN GUN CONDITION STANDARDS:

    NEW: Not previously sold at retail, in same condition as current factory production.
    PERFECT: In New condition in every respect.  (Jim's note - in my experience, many collectors & dealers use ""As New"" to describe this condition).
    EXCELLENT: New condition, used but little, no noticeable marring of wood or metal, bluing perfect, (except at muzzle or sharp edges).
    VERY GOOD: In perfect working condition, no appreciable wear on working surfaces, no corrosion or pitting, only minor surface dents or scratches.
    GOOD: In safe working condition, minor wear on working surfaces, no broken parts, no corrosion or pitting that will interfere with proper functioning.
    FAIR: In safe working condition but well worn, perhaps requiring replacement of minor parts or adjustments which should be indicated in advertisement, no rust, but may have corrosion pits which do not render article unsafe or inoperable.

NRA ANTIQUE FIREARM CONDITIONS STANDARDS:

    FACTORY NEW: All original parts; 100% original finish; in perfect condition in every respect, inside and out.
    EXCELLENT: All original parts; over 80% original finish; sharp lettering, numerals and design on metal and wood; unmarred wood; fine bore.
    FINE: All original parts; over 30% original finish; sharp lettering, numerals and design on metal and wood; minor marks in wood; good bore.
    VERY GOOD: All original parts; none to 30% original finish; original metal surfaces smooth with all edges sharp; clear lettering, numerals and design on metal; wood slightly scratched or bruised; bore disregarded for collectors firearms.
    GOOD: Some minor replacement parts; metal smoothly rusted or lightly pitted in places, cleaned or re-blued; principal letters, numerals and design on metal legible; wood refinished, scratched bruised or minor cracks repaired; in good working order.
    FAIR: Some major parts replaced; minor replacement parts may be required; metal rusted, may be lightly pitted all over, vigorously cleaned or re-blued; rounded edges of metal and wood; principal lettering, numerals and design on metal partly obliterated; wood scratched, bruised, cracked or repaired where broken; in fair working order or can be easily repaired and placed in working order.
