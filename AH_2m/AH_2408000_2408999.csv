Our 357 mag. ammo adds more power than ever before to the 357 mag. This ammo is safe to shoot in ANY all steel 357 revolver - this includes J frames. This ammo is no harder on your gun than any other normal 357 ammo. Please don't phone us and ask if this ammo is safe in your gun. It is, providing your gun is in safe condition for use with any normal 357 ammo.

We don't recommend this ammo to be fired in super light alloy revolvers as bullets may jump crimp under recoil, but the ammo itself wont hurt these super light weight revolvers. These revolvers are simply so light that the recoil is severe enough to cause crimp jump.

The below velocities are offered so that you can see what guns/barrel lengths give what velocities with this new 357 mag. ammo. You'll notice that new S&W revolvers with short barrels are often shooting faster than older S&W revolvers with longer barrels. The new S&W revolvers are very good and are made with equipment that makes them more consistent and faster than the S&W revolvers of yesteryear.

Beretta JXF9F21 PX4 Storm 9mm 4"" 17+1 Poly Grip/Frame Black

Beretta's Px4 Storm features an exclusive Beretta-designed locked breech
with a rotating barrel system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise. The
chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of
cleaning, and it also features a deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown to
protect the rifling. The light yet durable frame employs modern
thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer-reinforced
fiberglass and features an integral Picatinny MIL-STD rail.  A reversible magazine
release, and it may be configured with a small, medium, or large backstrap
for individual fit (3 backstraps included). The modular structure,
ergonomics, and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal
firearm for law enforcement use and personal defense.

Beretta JXF9F21 PX4 Storm 9mm 4"" 17+1 Poly Grip/Frame Black

Beretta's Px4 Storm features an exclusive Beretta-designed locked breech
with a rotating barrel system that reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise. The
chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of
cleaning, and it also features a deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown to
protect the rifling. The light yet durable frame employs modern
thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer-reinforced
fiberglass and features an integral Picatinny MIL-STD rail. The Px4 Storm
has an ambidextrous safety/decocking lever and a reversible magazine
release, and it may be configured with a small, medium, or large backstrap
for individual fit (3 backstraps included). The modular structure,
ergonomics, and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal
firearm for law enforcement use and personal defense.

The rifle has a black polymer stock and hand guards on it. The main scratches are up on the front sight post and underneath the dust cover (wear marks) just from installing the cover after cleaning.  There are no large gouges or scratches on the hand guard as you can see or on the main body of the rifle, or rust on the gun.  Hopefully you can see in the pictures too that all the internals are clean and free of rust or heavy wear and tear.  The rifle will happily feed whatever ammunition you put through it (7.62x39), I usually shoot brown bear or silver bear surplus ammo through it and they're extremely accurate, even better with some more expensive loads.  Furthest I've shot with it was 300 yards with the iron sights and was hitting paper with no problem.  Thanks!  Can include a video of the rifle in action through an email as well."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

TAURUS INTERNATIONAL         Judge Tracker w/4"" Barrel  
Taurus 2441041T Judge Trkr Exclusive 410/45LC 4"" 5rd FO Sight Ribber Grip Blued
The Taurus Judge Tracker is capable of chambering both 410 gauge with
2-1/2"" shotshell and the 45 Colt. This combo is ideal for short distances
where most altercations occur and longer distances with the 45 Colt ammo.
Taurus has skillfully tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close
quarters and to guide the 45 caliber bullet to the target. The 4"" barrel
makes this gun a little more rare only available from one distributor.

Oh, BTW this one was sold to me as unfired and remains that way. Matching numbers on the upper and lower. The bolt does appear to be unfired as stated by previous owner. If you see any dark spots on bolt, it's just factory grease still on it.

Ok, the more I see and handle this KG9 the more I want to take it down and keep it.

There were only 3500 of these ever made. Compare that to the 100,000 plus of the MAC open bolts that were produced and you can see how rare these can be at times.

But now my interest has shifted in a different direction. Gun comes with all factory accessories including 2 mags, 3 backstraps, lock and paperwork. This gun has a very low round count and is as new. Would consider seperating the gun and optic.  For just the pistol I would take $550. For the gun with the optic I'm asking $700

All Mossberg 930 Special Purpose shotguns feature a self-regulating gas
system that vents excess gas to aid in recoil reduction and eliminate
stress on critical components. All 930 autoloaders chamber both 2 3/4 inch
and 3-inch 12-gauge shotshells with ease from target loads, to non-toxic
magnum loads, to the latest sabot slug ammo. Magazine capacity is up to 7+1
on models with extended magazine tube, 4+1 on models without. To complete
the package, each Mossberg 930 includes a set of specially designed spacers
for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock,
bringing a custom-feel and fit to every shooter. Safety and safe handling
is of paramount importance in special purpose firearms, and the 930 was
engineered with that in mind. The receiver-mounted safety is convenient for
right or left-handed users; simply push the button forward to take the
weapon off safe. A protruding chrome cocking-indicator button is
strategically placed in the front inner-edge of the trigger guard, making
it easy to see and feel when the weapon is cocked or un-cocked. Unloading
has been made easier too, with the Mossberg EZ-Empty system. By depressing
the bolt release, the carrier can be pushed up and the first shotshell in
the magazine removed. Simply repeat until the magazine is empty. All 930
Special Purpose models feature a drilled and tapped receiver, factory-ready
for Picatinny rail, scope base or optics installation. 930 SPX models
conveniently come with a factory-mounted Picatinny rail and LPA/M16-Style
Ghost Ring combination sight right out of the box. Other sighting options
include a basic front bead, or white-dot front sights.

It is also one of the most reliable and most accurate ones I ever owned as well. I have put 1000 rounds through it over the last 10 years and have never had a failure to feed, fire,  or eject except for two rounds of cheap Russian Tula that also would not feed through a 1911 I owned.

I bought this gun a bit over 10 years ago frkm Ron Peterson Guns. My wife laughed at me and I laughed at myself for buying it. It feels like a Makita drill when you grip it. It is about as heavy. But guess what? It out shot a Kimber and a Springfield that I had at the time. I sold both of those long agk but the Hi Point stayed. 

I am selling it now because I have somehow accumulated 50 handguns over the years and I am out of room. If I buy another gun safe for handguns my wife won't divorce me but she might make me start sleeping with them instead of her.

Hi Points have a LIFETIME warranty that goes with the gun so you are taking no risk here. If anything ever goes wrong with it (unlikely) just send it to them and they will return it fixed, cleaned, and with an extra magazine. In my opinion they have the best customer service and warranty in the gun business.

Thjs kne is typical with colored three dot adjustable sights. The previous owner made a trigger shoe for it which is wider than the stock trigger. I found it comfortable and just left it on. I installed.the skateboard tale on the grips, and this works to keep it from slipping. It onky ever had one magazine, but I figured 10 rounds of .45 ACP hardball is plenty enough for anything I need.

Below are pictures of the gun and of a target I shot last summer with it at 25 yards. I am not a great pistol shot, but that is 10 rounds in the middle and then I went ""around the clock"" with the other four to finish up a box of ammo. Thes have fixed barrels and they are all accurate and tough.

My price of $150 is firm and I know I will regret selling this big old ugly great gun.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number or email, address and we can arrange for you to see it in Santa Fe.

Thanks for reading my long ad. You will like this pistol

 This is a Ruger SR-9 handgun in 9mm caliber.  These guns are well known for being much nicer than the low price being asked for would indicate. The trigger has been upgraded in a recall and the gun is in perfect working order.  I acquired it in a trade and by all accounts from my view it appears to be brand new and never fired.  If it has been fired it hasn't been fired much, at all. For the price, this is the best 9mm out there! It is time proven, reliable and a great shooter by all accounts and reviews.  I can send additional photos at any time if you need more.

Everything listed was purchased new approximately 1 year ago. All items are very slightly used and in excellent condition. I am located in Pittsburgh, PA.

Everything will be sold as a single package for $775. I've included links to most items to show current market value. You're basically getting everything for 65% of current pricing... and probably much further from what I paid during the rush last year.

Century Arms Zastava N-PAP AK-47 Semi Auto Rifle 7.62x39mm 16"" Barrel Stamped Receiver 30 Round Magazine Black Polymer Thumbhole Stock (RI2084-N). Great gun, I've fed a few hundred rounds through it without a single jam or problem. You'll see a photo below of a target grouping I had at 100 yards. This was purchased new and built with all new parts. Seen here (http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/8-CENT-RI2084N)

Texas Weapon Systems Dog Leg Scope Rail-Gen2 / YUGO Model. I had to wait weeks for this thing. The standard dust cover rails are garbage at keeping scopes true. This thing locks in the same way every time. It is a big reason this gun is at all accurate. The scope is also placed at a proper height to get a good cheek weld on the rifle while shooting. The stock dust cover is also included if you wish to sell this part off after purchase! Seen here (http://texasweaponsystems.com/id1.html)

UTG 3-9x32 CQB Bug Buster Rifle Scope w/ RingsSunshade (SCP-M392AOLWQ). I'm not an optics connoisseur, but eye relief seems great and the solid build quality compares to a much more expensive scope. Seen here (http://www.opticsplanet.com/leapers-utg-3-9x32-compact-cqb-bug-buster-rifle-scope-w-rings-sunshade.html)

UTG Golden Image 38mm Red/Green Dot Sight, Integral Weaver Mount (SCP-RD40RGW). I had this installed before the magnified scope. Same solid build quality as the other scope. Both optics come with original packaging if you'd like to sell one or both off after purchase! Seen here (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BQZSZ4/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3C_ST1_dp_2)

UTG Deluxe Covert Homeland Security Gun Case. This case can hold a load of gear and probably two unscoped rifles if you wanted. Tons of pockets/storage, movable velco straps, and VERY comfortable shoulder straps. The padding is ample and will not dig into your shoulders when weighed down. Seen here (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001WJ6P4S/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3C_ST1_dp_1)

Rifle has two steel 30 round magazines that came with it. You will also receive two Tapco 30 round magazines.

740 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition. All but 40 rounds are the WPA pictured, the rest are Silver Bear. This is the only ammo ever shot in the rifle and is non-corrosive."

This is a true WW2 piece. Made in Sept 43. Great condition I have many more pictures if you want to see them. I'm not under the false impression that this is a 100% original rifle. The fore end clamp has the bayonet lug. The safety is  a selector switch. The rifle functions flawlessly. I'm just looking to move into something else. I'm interested in precision shooting rifles - 204, 308, etc. 

*Update* It's time for this thing to move. I received another rifle for Christmas and I am now low on room in the safe. $1550.00 Cash. Trade value is still at the above price. Let me know what you have.

A little bit about Fat Boy Belts

Several years ago I got tired of wearing a belt with a metal buckle that chipped paint on my classic cars, left creases in my expanding beer belly, rusted because us fat boys sweat a little bit more, chipped the finish off of the bedroom floor at night, set off the metal detector at airports, & became entangled in my climbing harness when I was scaling the north slope of Mt. McKinley.

Well I just added that last reason to make you think I was in much better shape than I really am. Makes a great story though. Also I got very annoyed at the belts on the market that were two pieces of thin leather stitched together to make consumers think they were of adequate thickness to be a good belt (hogwash). Because after we pay 25 to 30 bucks for one of these supposedly adequate belts which after being worn for a month or so roll from the strain of us fat boys ever expanding waist lines (& my wife tells me I look like a pot roast with a string tied around it when I take off my shirt on the beach on the Riviera). Well at least I had on bermuda shorts & my ever faithful combat boots on, I wonder what she would say, if I had bought that thong at the duty free shop?

Well none the less, I decided to put my leather expertise to work & design what I believe to be the best belt on the market today. Introducing (drumroll) Fat Boy Belts by Two Fools Leather Goods. These soon to be world famous belts are made from one piece of 10-12, or 14-16 oz. English Harness Leather. This stuff is used for Draft Horse harnesses surely it will hold up to a little strain from my expanding waist line. Over several years of testing & a couple of tweaks to the design on myself & several of my hunting buddies they are the only belt we now wear. Heck, I have even made them for skinny fellers who swear they are the best damn gun belts available. They haven’t chipped paint, left creases, rusted, became entangled in any climbing harness on my recent expeditions, (hey it makes the story flow), or caused any problems at the airport (other than a traffic jam when the nimrod TSA agent makes you remove it & all the other fat boys in line want to know where you found such an innovative, sturdy, & downright smart looking belt).That’s my cue to start handing out cards (which causes even more of a backup).

Try one of my Fat Boy Belts & see for yourself why they are undoubtedly the best belts on the market."

I can send more pictures via text or email.

Everything is in perfect working condition.
It is maintained by my personal friend/mechanic who is (and has been for over 15 years) a certified mechanic for Honda, Kawasaki, Yamaha, Suzuki, Arctic Cat, Polaris and is currently working with the Can Am team building and testing race motors.... meaning he knows what he is doing.

He is the one that installed everything thing so it's all done correctly.

Here is an article about it if you want to check it out on ATV magazine - http://www.atvriders.com/atvmodels/yamaha2007wolverine4504x4atv.html

If you don't know.  This is the Sport / Utility wheeler - has 2 or 4 wheel push button
automatic - so it's easy to drive

It has a strait back axle so you can tow things without sinking suspension like you would on a 4 wheel independent suspension wheeler.

you get the feeling of a sport wheeler, yet it has 4 wheel drive and rack.
Low-maintenance shaft drives
only 732 miles on it
Warn 2500 lb winch - only used for the plow the one time
Aftermarket front bumper - thicker, stronger - i bought it with this bumper so I don't know much about it
Mount for Moose County Plow.... no plow with it since it's my dads plow.  I used it 1 time to plow then went back to snowblower.. my driveway isn't big enough for a plow
extra set of tires - current ones are good, but I bought an extra pair just in case.
Chains for front tires if you wanted for ice fishing or plowing
aftermarket HMF exhaust and re-jetted for new exhaust - stock exhaust comes with it
aftermarket rack on back - comes with stock grab bar as well
Has aftermarket plate to use a hitch / ball for towing
Has windshield - it's scratched but it stops the wind and snow
The box on the rack comes with it.  It's offset so I can fit my rifle scabbard on it for deer hunting, but you can mount it right in the middle if you would like.  Would be a couple of screws to move.

easily fits in any truck.  I have a tacoma and it fits good.  Not as big as the huge utility wheelers so it will fit into a S-10 or ranger easily

With all the extra I know it is worth way more then $4000 but I am willing to let it go for around

It is marked as a factory test fire (from the Kahr website: Q. What does the ""U"" on the trigger guard of my pistol mean? A. If there is a ""U"" engraved on the trigger guard of your pistol, it is a factory refurbished and test fired model (often sold as a ""test fired"" gun). From what I understand, Kahr pulls some assembled pistols off the assembly line, fires them and marks them as a factory test fire. The advantage is the break in process is already started and you get a new condition pistol at a discounted price. 

It is in the factory box just like you would get a new one. There are no scratches or any marks on the pistol other than the barrel hood which indicates it has been fired at the factory.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

This is a great firearm. Comes new unfired from the factory with factory hard case and all factory paper work. Comes with one 30 round magazine. From the factory: The Para Ordnance Tactical Target Upper Assembly features the DIGS (Delayed Impingement Gas System) which makes it the Smallest, Big Rifle in the World. PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner. The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System™ (MIS™) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The Rapid Deployment Stock™ (RDS™) reduces the overall length of the Tactical Target Rifle by almost 10-inches when the stock is folded. The unique 5-position sliding stock means that whether you are 5-foot 4"" or 6-foot 4"" the Tactical Target Rifle will fit you.Caliber: 5.56 Nato Barrel: 16.5 inches Chrome Lined Twist: 1 in 9 inches Action: Semi-automatic Receiver: Flat topped with full length Picatinny Rail Magazines: 1 - 30-round Overall Length: Stock Open and Fully Extended - 36 inches Stock Open and telescoped in - 33 inches Stock Folded - 26.25 inches Weight: 7.6 pounds Additional Features: Field strips with no tools, Multiple sling mount points.

X-15 The most compact and versatile 50 round magazine ever produced for the AR-15 in 5.56x45/.223 and 300 AAC Blackout full length.

Built entirely of aluminum, there are zero plastic parts. The fully enclosed magazine will operate in the most demanding of operations. The compact design is based on X-Products proven coil magazine technology, which allows side by side staging of ammo in a single stack. The streamlined design allows for no separation of ammunition during function and prevents malfunction. Based on X-Products patent pending design that allows for unlimited spring loads for high rate of fire weapons, it will easily operate up to 1100 rounds per minute.

The profile is shorter than a standard 30 round magazine and 4-5 inches shorter than a surefire quad stack magazine. User friendly ergonomics and the ability to use your sling makes this the choice magazine for 3 gun competitors. Coated in Cerakote for friction reduction and proven reliability without using lubrication, and given a liftime warranty.

Manufactured in the USA, fit’s most M16/AR-15 rifles, Bushmaster ACR, SCAR 16 and Stanang Rifles with improved M4 feed ramps.

Says it is available for $565, plus any shipping and FFL fees. (most likely close to an additional $50-70), that is not the price Buds has. You are required to log into an account with them, and get the quote via e-mail. Checking today, it has it at $611. Feel free to double check me.
Next lowest price on the list charges more on shipping. Then the price just goes up. 
At a larger store that deals in used firearms, I've seen them going for $715. Used. 

I feel my price is fair, especially with the CO legal extra magazines, and if you're only buying my firearm, I'll split what you'd owe for a background check. I have used someone in the Springs who charges $20. That's the lowest I've seen, and compared to the $50+ in the Denver area, it's a steal."

The cold hammer-forged barrel has a polygonal profile while the slide is made from a solid bar of nitro-carburized steel. Following recent trends in modern pistol design, the P2000 makes extensive use of impact-resistant polymers to reduce weight and production costs.
As with other recent Heckler & Koch pistol designs, the P2000 is modular to suit individual needs. For instance, the grip is modular with exchangeable backstraps, allowing the user to customize the pistol's grip size and feel. There is a universal accessory rail built into the dust cover in front of the trigger guard that allows for the use of tactical lights, laser pointers and other accessories. This is in contrast with the USP series which uses a proprietary H&K mounting rail that limits the types of accessories that could be used with the pistol.
The P2000 is a hammer-fired pistol with an exposed spurred hammer; a bobbed hammer is optional. It has an ambidextrous slide lock and a fully ambidextrous magazine release installed in the trigger guard.V3: SA/DA trigger with a decocking lever mounted at the posterior of the slide to the left of the spurred hammer.

This is a later model made in Czech Republic.  These later models have a tighter choke (full?) Which helps greatly with shot patterns compared to early models.  It is also drilled and tapped for the scope mount.  Holds 9 rounds of .22 Hornet and 4 shells of .410 in the butt stock.  Includes an extra takedown pin in the unfortunate event you lose the original.

The finish is rough, with some surface rust.  The worst of it is on the right side of the buttstock, which I have included a pic of.  Hopefully the pics are a good representation.  Both bores however are clean and near perfect.  I got this on a trade and I think the previous owner kept it in the trunk (not great for moisture) but shot it very little.  

Will include a box of 25 Hornady .22 Hornet varmint rounds and a box of 25 .410 birdshot.

Face to face PDX Metro area only to Oregon resident with verified ID, prefer CHL.  Let me translate: I will not ship anywhere so don't ask, and will not sell directly to out of state residents.  Yes, Vancouver WA counts as out of state and is still illegal.  If you want to come to me and do the transfer through my local FFL, I'm cool with that for Washington residents.

No haggling.  This is priced very fair and accounts for the exterior finish condition. If you disagree, do a quick search on here, GunBroker, etc. for a cheaper one and buy that one.  Last, please have cash money in hand before contacting me.  If you will have the money by Friday, next Tuesday, etc., contact me after that happens.  Feel free to ask any further questions about the gun that I may not have covered.

This gun started life as a Ruger 10-22, 22lr rifle which in it's own right is a great gun, accurate, dependable and long lasting.  This one has been treated to a full tactical upgrade using the Full Archangel brand upgrade kit.  This includes the full stock replacement, with folding buttstock and tactical carry handle.  It has rails on the bottom, top and sides to mount any number of additional toys you may have.  It also includes the optional 30 round magazine which completed the large bore tactical look.  I have a scope mounted on it now but it is not part of the rifle as priced.  We certainly can work it into the deal but it would be at a bit more cash from you.   I have pics of it with a scope and without if you want to see them.  In any case you are bidding on a very nice shooting, very reliable and super cool looking tactical rifle that is cheap to shoot.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

It's dusty and could use a good cleaning/oiling because I haven't fired it in about 3 months.

Total of 103 rounds of ammo

This thing LOVES the military .30 cal rounds and is a CANNON with them!

Current MSRP on the rifle is $373.00 according to the Remington website today. I know some dealers are selling them cheaper on holiday specials but the value is at least $325 not counting the 103 rounds of ammo! So, I will put the total value around $400 OBO.

Gun is in excellent shape and has been a flawless performer. Always cared for responsibly. This is one of the most reliable weapons I have ever owned. I honestly have never experienced a malfunction with it and it has chewed up whatever ammo I fed it. I would be willing to trade for a DA revolver in .357 mag with at least a 4"" barrel (preferably a Ruger GP100, or a s&w full underlug model such as the 686). Depending on the trade I can throw some cash in to sweeten the deal.
