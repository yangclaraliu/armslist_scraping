From the Leica Website:
Ultravid 42 HD

The 42 HD models are almost as compact and handy as the 32 mm models and have almost the same light-gathering properties as the larger 50 mm lens diameter models. The molded thumb rests on the back ensure that these handy all-rounders can be held steadily without any risk of slipping. The large central focusing wheel offers the additional advantages of comfortable and ergonomic handling. Despite their compact size, they possess outstanding reserves of light-gathering performance for viewing under adverse lighting conditions."

I purchased it new, and have only fired 80 rounds through it. I have sanded and refinished the wood. The pics arent very good, but the wood is actually refinished a red mahogony. The front sights, rear sights, and gas block are all straight. Of the 80 rounds i fired, there were no malfunctions of any kind. There is very little mag wobble with steel mags, and polymer mags lock up snug. I have also installed a Wolff ""plus-power"" recoil spring, which helps with recoil, and makes the action much smoother.  Included with the rifle is a sling, one 30-round mag, and the cleaning kit is in the butstock. I am not looking for any trades at this time. I also feel that the $425 asking price is fair, so no low-ball offers will be accepted. The only reason i am wanting to sell it is to help fund the purchase of a new AK that i currently have on layaway. I am wanting to do a FTF transaction in or near Frankfort, and dont want to ship at this time. The best way to reach me, is to text me at REDACTED.

69,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2642069,For Sale:  Smith& Wesson .38 Safety Haammerless,"Santa Fe, NM, New Mexico, United States",$ 300,"Listed On: Sunday, February 2, 2014",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,38 S&W                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Also known as the ""Lemon Squeezer"". This handgun is in NRA Excellent condition (80% original finish or greater) and has a pretty uncommon combination of being a .38 S&W with 4 inch barrel. Most of these were only .32s, and most had a shorter 3 inch barrel. Not exactly a rare combination, but you certainly don't see them like this very often. Its original Gutta Perchas grips are perfect with no chips or cracks. It was made in the 1930s, so it has S&W's Pre-War quality and you can tell it when you look at it. Although this is in collectible condition, this would still make a viable  handgun for self defense. It is DA only, has a grip safety, and is small enough and safe enough to slip into a jacket pocket.  There is no hammer to snag and the grip safety renders it perfectly safe in a pocket, unlike most modern firearms. It can even be fired from INSIDE a pocket! (But don't do that...) The topbreak design ejects all five rounds instantly when it is opened. Sounds like Smith or Ruger should be making one just like it today. But they don't.

That said, this isn't a Glock and has its limitations. The rear sight is small and if you want to use it you will definitely have to get used to that. The front sight is quite visible however, and it points instinctively. All this talk about shooting is kind of misses the point of the gun though. These are very collectible and would be considered to be a good investment in this condition. If you have read this far, you probably already know that. The .38 S&W round was the British WWII service round, and it proved to be a good manstopper for them They kept it in service for well over 50 years and in some country it is still being used today.

By now, most of these Safety Hammerless revolvers are rusty, pitted, or have been refinished. This one is all original with just a superb bore and is and tight as the day it was made when Franklin Roosevelt was president. Pretty cool considering it was actually designed before Teddy Roosevelt was President! These guns were hand fitted and finished, and S&W stopped making them after WWII because it was just too expensive to make. When you hold it in your hand you will see that.

I am on the low end of the scale for one of these in this condition. I see them on Gunbroker going for more with pits or refinished or mismatched. Check them out and compare. I did before I wrote this so I already know what you are going to see there, lol. This one is a nice revolver, and I think you would be proud to own it.

It is classified as a C&R by the ATF, so if you live too far away I can ship it to an FFL03 address. Just contact me and we can make arrangements. Shipping would run about $35.

I can be reached via email through Armslist. I used to put my phone number and email address in these ads but I was bombarded by Nigerian princes who wanted to make me rich. If you are a Nigerian prince, don't bother unless you can buy the gun face to face and are legal to do so in the US. (Unlikely, huh?)

So thanks for reading my long winded ad. When you see this S&W you will not be disappointed.

I write very detailed descriptions about my guns so I apologize for the essay, but the more I put here the less questions I have to respond to.  :)

-----------
General:

This is a like-new and completely stock Smith and Wesson M&P15 Sport AR-15 rifle chambered in .223/5.56 NATO.  It comes with the Magpul flip-up backup sights, CA compliant bullet button, 10 rd mag, and safety lock.  Other than some minor marks it’s cosmetically and functionally perfect.  It has been sighted for 25 yds and is dead-on accurate.  Here's the exact product page for detailed specs:  

http://www.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product4_750001_750051_786006_-1_757785_757784_757784_ProductDisplayErrorView_Y

I've only put about 500 rounds through it and have always cleaned it after each shooting session.  Again the gun is completely stock and is exactly like the one in picture #1.  I don’t have pictures of the exact gun because it’s currently disassembled for deep cleaning and in case the buyer wanted some of the aftermarket parts installed (see below). 

----------
Price and Parts:

The asking price is $650, and although you could find a new one for about that price you won’t have to pay for tax or FFL transfer fees for one that’s practically new and can be inspected in-person before agreeing to buy.  I also have a lot of aftermarket parts that I bought for it and can sell to you for cheap.  They are:

Magpul CTR Stock (black): $40
Magpul MOE Handguard w/ MOE rail sections (black, see picture #2): $20
Magpul MOE+ Grip (black): $15
Magpul Angled Fore Grip v2 (black): $20
Magpul Rail Vertical Grip (black): $15
Midwest Industries: Gen2 Two Piece Drop-In Handguard (see picture #3): $70
BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle Mod 3: $30
Aimpoint P.R.O. Red Dot Sight (will come pre-sighted): $300

These are all extremely popular AR-15 upgrades and most people use some combination of them. They are all like-new and I’m selling them at a big discount (check prices online to compare).  These prices are for the GUN BUYER ONLY so please don’t ask to buy them separately.  Total asking price = $650 plus whatever extras you would like.

----------
Why I’m Selling:

I decided to build a high-end AR for myself.  It’s not going to be a cheap endeavor though and I’ll be using the money from the sale to fund my project.  Owning one AR rifle is good enough for me.

----------
Transferring and Legal stuff:

I only do in-person selling at a public FFL business near my home in Chino, CA.  I prefer doing transfers at the Turner’s Outdoorsman in Chino Hills, but I’m willing to meet you within 10 miles of Chino as long as it’s at a FFL business that I can look up.  

Again, this AR comes with the CA bullet button installed as well as a 10 rd mag.  However there are a few other details I’ll discuss in-person with the buyer pertaining to these things…but I will say that I'm an advocate for fair gun rights and freedom.

----------
Payment and Trades:

Payment is CASH ONLY.  The buyer will have a chance to inspect the gun before agreeing to buy it, and buyer is responsible for paying the standard PPT and DROS fees to the store.

----------
Contact:

If you've made it this far, are still interested in this rifle, and can agree to my terms above then please send me a message with…

1. Your name and phone number
2. Best time to call you
3. List of any extras you’d like to buy

I’ll call you at a convenient time and we can discuss details then.  I've sold a number of guns in the past and consider myself an honest person.  But I’m also aware of all the scams that take place on this website and my terms are in place to protect myself and potential buyers.

My name is An and please let me know if you have any questions.  I might not be able to respond right away because of my schedule (I'm a medical student) but I'll be sure to respond ASAP."

Unfortunately no box or papers so I purchased a nice gun pouch for it and it is shown in a couple pictures. I don't believe I would sell the item if it had the original box and papers. The revolver has a whisper of a turn line and you have to look very close to see it. The grips are near perfect and the medallions are beautiful gold but my photos make them look silver. I use an FFL to do my shipping and receiving and the Buyer is responsible to know your State and local laws. Don't bid on the revolver if not legal where you live. It Will Not Ship. Shipping, Full Insurance and Signature Confirmation plus the FFL fee is approx. 75.00 and I split that with the buyer so the winner will pay 37.50 for his part of the costs. Shipping is also FFL to FFL only Money Order., Postal MO. Shipping is USPS Priority Express and I always keep the buyer informed of payment received, item shipped and tracking info.

M&M inc M10 ak47-I bought this after researching the best ak for the price, these guys are great as far as reliability, the reviews seem to reflect that, however the finish on them is subpar. I only shot 1 magazine (30 rounds) through the rifle, cleaned before and after (was pretty dirty when I first got it). I bought for $749 but they seem to sell for around $700 on gunbroker.

1000-7.62x39 FMJ Golden Tiger 124gr:Supposed to be some of the highest quality ak47 ammo out there, I grabbed it for $259.30 when it was on sale.

970-7.62x39 russian surplus ammo:Bought for $233.09, the one mag I shot went great

5x romanian surplus ak47 steel  mags:Total $73.68, I love the feel of the steel mags vs any crappy tapco polymers, they're great and much more reliable. I also have the tapco mag that came with the ak when I purchased it.

So, in all I have about $1315 invested in the gun and accessories and while the gun is obviously now used and somewhat depreciates in value, the ammo and mags aren't worth any less. I'd prefer to trade for something I'd like but I may take cash offers, thanks and feel free to contact me with any questions.

I'm willing to take a decent loss on it, was kind of an impulse purchase that i regret now I don't really have any need of 2 ak's..."

I purchased from a good home. I don't know how to use the JVC Movie Camera, so selling or trading at an offer it would be hard to refuse.

The batteries need charging and I don't know how to do that.  However, the previous owner had taken some great movies with it.  That is all I know about the JVC Video Camera.

NOTE: JUST THE VOYAGER BAG ALONE IS WORTH JUST 1 BOX OF AMMO! 

It would make a great range/pistol bag, when you are not using the camera.

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model Smith & Wesson500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

Bought new on a whim, but eventually bought what I preferred, a Marlin with a wood stock. Price is FIRM. Retail is around $220.
Remington's description:
The Model 597™ is easily the most advanced autoloading rimfire rifle ever built, and the most technologically advanced breakthrough in autoloading rimfire rifle technology in 35 years. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.
Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

Key Features:
Bolt-guidance system features twin, tool-steel guide rails
Sear and hammer are Teflon®/nickel-plated for crisp, smooth trigger pull
Non-glare matte finish
Adjustable big game iron sights
Patented drop-out staggered-stack, detachable, 10-shot metal box magazine
Last-shot ""hold open"" bolt for added safety
Unique attachment system rigidly joins barrel to receiver for perfect alignment and enhanced accuracy

some review on it:
The SL8-1 is basically a civilian version of the G36, but with several notable departures. First, in order to meet import regulation the SL8-1 is equipped with a unique thumbhole stock. The stock is finished in a light gray color, and features an adjustable cheek piece and buttstock. The stock is very radical in appearance, and has been greeted favorably by many shooters. An adjustment tool is included with each rifle. Second, the barrel on the SL8-1 is a heavy contour 1x7 twist barrel. The barrel floats from the receiver on out through the removable forend. The barrel appears to be chrome lined, and this is a welcome feature to most of us. Third, the SL8-1 uses a unique magazine common to no other rifle. The magazine will accept up to 10 rounds of .223 Rem. (5.56mm NATO) ammunition. The magazine is a single stack design, and is constructed of a translucent material. The magazine is a little hard to load, until the user becomes familiar with the proper procedure. Unfortunately, no high capacity magazines are available for the SL8-1, and G36 magazines will not work in the SL8-1. Lastly, the SL8-1 uses a sight rail that extends the entire sight radius. The rail is equipped with iron sights that are simple in design, but are not user friendly in their adjustment. The sight rail has numerous positions available for the installation of optical sights and other devices. H&K has several different modular sighting systems available as accessories, but none were available for review at this time. The most notable is a dual optical system with a 3.5X scope and a red dot sight, and the Universal Tactical Light of USP pistol fame is also available for attachment to the SL8-1."

For an additional $25 I have a high quality Galati Gear bag that will hold 6 Glock mags or, if you have an AR pistol, 3 30 round AR mags. Galati Gear is a great tactical gear manufacturer right here in Missouri, so you're even buying a local product. Call or text Joe @ REDACTED. Here's some more info on the Sub 2000. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

some review on it:
The SL8-1 is basically a civilian version of the G36, but with several notable departures. First, in order to meet import regulation the SL8-1 is equipped with a unique thumbhole stock. The stock is finished in a light gray color, and features an adjustable cheek piece and buttstock. The stock is very radical in appearance, and has been greeted favorably by many shooters. An adjustment tool is included with each rifle. Second, the barrel on the SL8-1 is a heavy contour 1x7 twist barrel. The barrel floats from the receiver on out through the removable forend. The barrel appears to be chrome lined, and this is a welcome feature to most of us. Third, the SL8-1 uses a unique magazine common to no other rifle. The magazine will accept up to 10 rounds of .223 Rem. (5.56mm NATO) ammunition. The magazine is a single stack design, and is constructed of a translucent material. The magazine is a little hard to load, until the user becomes familiar with the proper procedure. Unfortunately, no high capacity magazines are available for the SL8-1, and G36 magazines will not work in the SL8-1. Lastly, the SL8-1 uses a sight rail that extends the entire sight radius. The rail is equipped with iron sights that are simple in design, but are not user friendly in their adjustment. The sight rail has numerous positions available for the installation of optical sights and other devices. H&K has several different modular sighting systems available as accessories, but none were available for review at this time. The most notable is a dual optical system with a 3.5X scope and a red dot sight, and the Universal Tactical Light of USP pistol fame is also available for attachment to the SL8-1.

I have 50 Rounds of 158gr JHP's, 26 Rounds of 158gr Soft Points, 15 Rounds of 125gr JHP, and 45 Rounds of .38 Spl 130gr FMJ I can include for the right deal. Kinda hard to find the .357 Magnum ammo locally, that's 136 rounds.

Not gonna add cash on my end for a 1911, if I had cash I wouldn't be selling this revolver or trading it for a 1911..

Also includes a UTG 7"" bipod. I will include all parts to swap the rifle back into a USGI stock, which includes the parts to unitize the gas system.
