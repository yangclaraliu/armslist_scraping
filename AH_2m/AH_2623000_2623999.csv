I am a student at MSU Denver and am currently taking a class called Animal Behavior, or Ethology. My lab group has been tasked with designing an experiment concerning the behavior of animals, conducting said experiment, and then writing a scientific article about it. We chose to write about coyotes, specifically their behavior in regards to their proximity to urban development.
We are planning on setting up a game call in several places close to well populated areas (Aurora, Lakewood, Golden, etc) and then recording the response time of the coyotes to this call  Then, we will conduct the same experiment in areas much more remote (Pawnee, Commanche, etc), and compare the data. What do you think, will the city coyotes be less timid and respond quicker out of curiosity, or will the wild coyotes with far less scavenging options than their city-dwelling kin come running to the sound of a free meal? We aim to find out!
So if you have any decent game cameras or remote-operated coyote calls that you won't be using between now and May, let me know, I would love to work out a rental arrangement and put some cash in your hand!

Just testing the waters for sale or trade. This is a classic Chinese AK variant with long 20"" heavy barrel. I've owned this rifle for years and I truly love it. Its thick receiver and heavy barrel make for a very accurate AK/RPK. Also, this rifle has its original bipod which is a nice accessory and can be removed by simply punching out the pin that clamps it to the barrel. The finish is a good blue with a nice sort of patina, but no rust. This rifle has been well maintained and upgraded with a Tapco trigger group. The rifle sports an AK-74 type muzzle brake. It does have some knicks in the wood furniture but nothing serious. Its wearing Chinese wood handguards, Hungarian pistol grip, and I think a Romanian RPK stock. This is one of the most accurate AKs out there, the barrel is also chrome-lined for increased durability. I will include one Chinese 30 round AK mag. You just can't find these things anymore, they're extremely rare now. Even more so an NHM-91 with its bipod. Especially the RPK style rifles.

4 x PMR-30 magazines (2 in the box plus 2 additional)

The PMR-30 is used, and has been through a fluff-and-buff, now it runs like a top.  I've had no issue firing any kind of ammo out of it.  I would estimate the round count somewhere around 2000.  I am missing the fiber optic on the front sight, this is a $10 part from Kel-Tec, I had been firing it without it with no issues.

I ordered the replacement parts from Kel-Tec a while back, never used them, I just figured I would like to have a few on hand.  Included in the bag is a replacement feed ramp, a spring/guide rod assembly, magazine follower, and a buffer.

I am possibly looking for trades against this price, some items I am interested in are:

EOTech sights

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols.

Runs on a lithium battery and has 13 different illumination settings. 10 daylight and 3 night vision settings. 
The most impassive feature of the the scope is the light sensing technology that changes your illumination based on the target and not the light around the scope.

I am a retired Millwright who has taken up gunsmithing and restoration work. I am furthering my hobby and I want to amass a collection of old gun frames, stocks, grips, triggers, barrels, cylinders, side plates, springs, pins, levers, safety's, and whatever else I can come up with so I can start an online website and database and help supply all my gun loving brothers in arms with parts for their own repairs. 

Sometimes parts are either hard to come by or are just to darn expensive to buy new from Brownell's, MidwayUSA, or Numrich, so just like a car bone yard I want to recycle the old part and put them to good use. I have a few parts already so if you need something let me know, if I do not have it I know of several other people around the country that are doing the same thing. I can locate parts for you that you may otherwise not find online

So, if you have any gun parts (newer or older) or if you have any broken dilapidated pistols, rifles, and shotguns that are just sitting around collecting dust in your closet or gun safe let me know and I will make you a fair offer.

This is model has the thumbscrew mount for maximum stability. The battery life on this is a phenomenal 3 years for a single AA battery. Instead of needing to stock specialty batteries (like a CR123) for your optic, you can get your power supply at the local gas station. The solar cell built in allows you to further lengthen the battery life. 
Amazing optical clarity, combined with a massive field of view and the elimination of the ""tube effect"" you get from looking through Aimpoint red dots. This has the typical Trijicon rugged construction. It's practically bombproof. This particular sight has been carefully painted a dark OD Green to better blend with your camo rifle/carbine. This comes with the original hard case, manual and lens pen. 
For an optic that has a MSRP of $1,350, this is a bargain."

I'm aware that most of these models are worth more then 950 even when they're used, but that's my budget. I'm not interested in the GI or Milspec models. I would prefer to do FTF near Savannah, but I would be willing to meet halfway within the state of Georgia.  I may do out of state if the deal is right and seller is willing to do an FFL to FFL transfer.  I'm not interested Colt, Kimber, or Sig Sauer, etc.  Only other brands I would be interested in would be STI and Smith and Wesson (Pro Series).  If you're not sure let me know what you have, worst I'll say is no.

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:
Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
