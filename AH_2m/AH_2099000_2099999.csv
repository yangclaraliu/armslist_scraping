Please include a phone number if you are seriously interested.

Super easy drop in upgrade for your AR15 to make it a softer shooter while eliminating wear and tear on components at the same time, all specs and benefits are listed below. It cost me right at $50 to get it with the shipping charges. I will sell it for $50 cash if anyone wants it. The price is FIRM! I am willing to ship if you pay costs, but I do not have nor will I get paypal.  **If interested and serious please include a phone number to contact you on in your reply, thanks**

From Spikes website:

Introduction
Looking for a heavy buffer to replace your standard carbine buffer? Well, we came up with something that offers the HIGHEST performance at a reasonable price. The ST-T2 buffer is one of the softest shooting, smoothest, and quietest buffers on the market; not to mention it looks awesome! It doesn't have any weights to move around or fluids to leak out like some other buffers, so it's 100% maintenance free! 

The ST-T2 buffer weighs in at 115g/4.05oz. (Depending on the density and size of the HDTP, the weight can vary slightly) and the body is CNC machined from solid billet Aluminum bar stock for strength and durability. To finish it all off, it's Anodized matte black and laser engraved with our Logo. 

So you're probably wondering what's inside of this thing to make this thing so great and different? 

Each ST-T2 buffer is filled with HDTP which is short for ""High Density Tungsten Powder"" and topped off with a Mil-Spec bumper. Because of this, there aren’t any reciprocating weights inside to make a lot of noise and it also makes for a very smooth cycling rifle. The ST-T2 eliminates the chance of bolt bounce, helps with muzzle rise when firing in full-auto, and cuts down on felt recoil. As you can tell, it's a HUGE upgrade from a Standard Carbine buffer! It's designed for .223/5.56 but it works in all Calibers! 

Get one for your AR-15 today and feel the difference! 
NOTE: Actual weight can vary between 4.0oz and 4.2oz.

For AR-15 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Rapid Transition Sights provide the quickest possible transition between long and close range target acquisition, greatly increasing weapon efficiency and effectiveness. These sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions.

It is good to go TODAY for your flat top AR-15.  Just attach it with the two mounting screws, boresight it, and zero it.

This item was briefly mounted on a .204 Ruger Varmint AR-15, and only used a handful of times on the range.  The entire setup is in perfect AS NEW condition, with the original box, paperwork, and factory original bikini scope covers (not pictured).  The scope has a trueplex reticle.

Out of 315 reviews on Midwayusa.com, this scope scores 4.7 out of 5 stars.

My pricing basically knocks 10% off of the lowest advertised price of this setup.  AND, there's no shipping or sales tax for the local buyer.  So you'll save on the order of 18%.  And you can have it now!  I'd be willing to break up this setup, but I'd really rather sell it complete as pictured, and described.  Thanks for looking!

As always, no snarky emails, please.  If you're a genuinely interested buyer, I'm happy to answer questions, etc.  But if you're just a loser with nothing better to do than hassle or insult strangers by email, just move on, please.

This call has the RED reed in it and the plastic mouthpiece. Very few scratches on this call; not used much.  No Box.


Ken Martin – Olive Branch, Illinois

Back in the 1930s, when quality goose calls were relatively hard to come by, Ken Martin began whittling away in southern Illinois. Having grown up in Canada goose country, Martin knew what geese sounded like, and his calls rang true. They were, and still are, coveted by both hunters and collectors.

Martin did not begin crafting goose and duck calls on a full-time basis until around 1960. Before making the jump, he toiled as a farmer, welder and boilermaker, and also worked on steamboats. Residences included Lemont, Illinois, and both Salmon and Idaho Falls, Idaho.

While most of his calls were made of walnut, Martin also used other types of wood, and was known to enjoy working with diamondwood, a laminate. His calls were often stamped with the name of the town in which he made them.

Martin's Horseshoe Lake Model goose call has been copied, in one way or another, by any number of call makers nationwide—the most sincere form of flattery."

$1300 firm no low balls,The time has come for me to sell this, although I don't want to...my wife is pregnant and we our expecting our 1st baby in the next 2 months. This is an amazing rifle, imported directly from Romania still used in today's war zones. The farthest I have shot the rifle is 600 yards and I was hitting about 6"" groups, amazingly accurate gun and scope. The rifle is capable of shooting up to 1000+ meters and scope makes it easy to adjust to whatever range you desire. I have never has a single issue with the rifle, no rust or corrosion I clean it extremely well right after I shoot it. Package comes with Rifle-Case-3 mags-220 rounds,

My history and use with this gun is a short one. I bought it June of this year, shot only 50 rounds of brass cased, factory ammo through it. Accurate little gun. Surprisingly little recoil, I know it's a 9mm but I figured with the size and lightweight of this gun would make the kick abit more that a full sized. It did not.  

 Beyond the 50 rd test firing the gun has been kept clean and oiled inside a safe. So it is in great condition with almost zero use.   It comes with the factory 7rd magazine that  has two different switchable base plates, one extended (seen in photos) and one flat.  The hand gun has the most safety features out of any gun I have ever used which gives greater confidence for a first gun to someone new to firearms to reduce chance of accidents opposed to a model like a Glock, though only you can ultimately make sure any firearm is safe through caution.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3""

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place.

They carry a lifetime warranty with the Hi-Point company ..that is located in OHIO. They will honor the warranty regardless of whether you are the original owner or not, forever. No receipt required, send it to them, they fix it and send it back with any new applicable upgrades and a free magazine. The gun looks perfect and functions perfect."

Comes with very good quality CenterPoint 3x-9x (shotgun-approved) scope. Scope has the coveted angled cut that looks excellent on every gun. Scope has Illuminated crosshairs (reticle) red or green, with multiple levels of brightness/intensity. Very good quality optics. Shotgun Holds 5 with 1 in the hole. It chambers 3"" shells and anything smaller. It is the accuchoke system which means they are interchangable chokes..you can screw any choke into the end of the barrel that you like. Right now it is dressed with a Modified (the do-all) choke. This choke will shoot rifled slugs, accurately, to 120 yards...and will keep a shot pattern tight. The barrel is a smoothbore, clean as new 22"". As with all Mossbergs, you can swap the barrel to another with the turn of a thumbscrew...no tools required. It is beautiful. It is a 20 gauge so it doesn't kick as hard as a 12g, but still has the power to put down Turkey, deer and intruders equally well. I used to carry a 12g, the 20g has become my shotgun of choice. PRICE IS: $250.00 without the scope. $270.00 (which is $20.00 more) and I'll throw in 100 rounds of 20ga ammo.  $340.00 you get the shotgun, the scope and the ammo."

I am selling my Mossberg 715T 22 Longrifle, its in great condition. I had it for about one year now, took it to the crystal mountain shooting range like 2 times. Its a great assault rifle, semi-automatic, includes the original iron sights, a red dot sight, and a 25 round clip. Great for target shooting, since the ammunition is cheap, and it has a low recoil.  Im thinking to trade it for something new, and maybe sell it depending on the offer. So if you are interested, or have any question please call me at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED"

Please don't email me to ask if I still have it, or if I will take less, or without including a phone number. Just read the ad. If it is still listed for sale, then it is still up for sale. The price is $300 FIRM if cash, or possible trade. Only trades I am looking for are listed below, but you can hit me up with any offers. Realistic offers only please. If you do not have exactly what I want then it would have to be a great deal for me to trade, since it is not something I am looking for. These are similar to a Keltec 9mm, only with better reviews.  All the reviews I have read online from actual owners state that they absolutely love this gun, it is ultra tough, and they carry it with no hesitation. Check for yourself. Below are some LINKS to a complete review of this gun and its features and accuracy by Guns&Ammo and a video review on youtube. Sccy Industries even makes their own mags in house (MOST firearms manufactures do not do this) to ensure the quality and reliability of them. It is not a striker fired pistol, this has a real hammer internally. The gun is like new, less than 50 rounds through it, and comes in factory box with (2) 10 round mags and lock. Also have the pinky grip extension for it if that fits your hand better. It has a stainless steel barrel, a stainless steel slide with black nitride finish, and only weighs 15 ounces. Great choice for a small easy to conceal weapon that you can count on, with plenty of capacity in a real caliber, for an inexpensive price. You must be a Tn resident and legal to own a handgun to buy. If interested and serious include a phone number in your reply. ONLY replies that include a phone number to call or text you on will be responded to.

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery.

The MK22 Sport Rifle is available both in pre-ban and post-ban formats carrying either 10 shot or 22 shot magazines depending on jurisdiction. This is the first rifle to enter the U.S. market which combines the handling and reliability of a military style design, while also presenting the shooter with all the elements of a modern sporting rifle platform. The MK22 feels like a centerfire weapon even though it is chambered in the economical 22 Long Rifle. The rifle comes standard with front and rear folding sights, along with picatinny style rail mounts.

U.S. Survival .22 - A compact and lightweight model that proves ideal for a variety of shooting scenarios, including its original purpose as a survival rifle for pilots.

Barrel and receiver are coated in Teflon® for weather resistance. Grooved receiver rib for scope installation.
