Looking to fund some other hobbies at the moment.  I picked this up in a trade last year, and it's just too pretty for me to shoot, so guess what?  It's got to move out of the drawer and into the hands of somebody that'll appreciate it more than me.  Great condition.  I'm the 3rd owner as far as I know, previous owner did not shoot it much and said he had acquired it from an old neighbor that was a cop and had it in a safe most of its life.  The trigger and hammer must've been finished at some point, as I don't believe they ever came like that from factory.  Previous owner was not under impression this was ever refinished based on original owner.  The grips are Targets, assumedly off of a later model based on what others said here.  They look great with the piece, and have only the small crack where shown.  Timing is good.  Only minimal rotational play in cylinder as I've found on all my S&Ws.  Probably the sweetest trigger of any of my handguns.  4 K46 *** serial.

$550 FTF in IL.  FOID Required.  Beautiful piece that belongs in someone's collection that isn't afraid to breathe on it.  PM me with any questions."

I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60), and a box of 50rds FMJ ammo along with the gun. I like the gun, but it is too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice.

 Colorado Recalls 2 Anti-Gun State Lawmakers 



2 State Senate President

                                      S E NT P A C K IN G

 For the first time in the history of the state of Colorado, a recall election was held, and TWO anti-gun state senators were successfully recalled.

 Both Democrats and Republicans, as well Independent voters turned out in numbers similar to the last presidential elections. Both Democratic state senators will be replaced by Republicans.

 The recall effort began in earnest after several anti-gun bills were passed without listening to input from pro-second amendment groups within the state.

 Michael Bloomberg's group, 'Mayors Against Illegal Guns' spent several hundreds of thousand of dollars in an attempt to save Morse and Giron from a successful recall.   they failed."

I ended up tearing the entire thing down and giving it a thorough scrubbing and cleaning and checked the headspacing. Cleaned out the charging tube, cleared the flutes, and completely cleaned the bolt and carrier set. 

Bolt hasn't been ground or filed, nor has the carrier. It currently has +4 rollers installed, but comes with the originals as well, which would likely help in it's ability to lock and unlock the rollers. 

Flutes are all clean and neat, but the gun needs to be broken in and could probably use a new recoil spring. The gun needs full NATO powered rounds to fully function correctly. I'd keep it, but my collection is getting excessive and I should finish my FAL first. 

CETME rifle and 13 mags come with it.

From what I've been told S&W should take care of it free of charge but since the Oct. 1st deadline I have been trying to change around my collection and get it the way I want it. Thus I have no reason for one .380 that sits in the safe more than it is used.
Upon cleaning I noticed the ""hammer strut"" has a chip out of it. The gun was fired in this state BUT I can't stress enough it should be corrected before firing again. I believe it came from factory with the flawed hammer strut.

Alright, the gun is a very good condition stainless Walther PPK made under license by S&W. It is chambered in .380 and comes with original registration card and box.
I'm asking $500 as it's in good shape, the fix should be free or very cheap.
I will ship from an FFL to an FFL.

                This is a handbuilt AK-74 from an all matching Bulgarian Parts Kit on a McKay Enterprises (NoDak Spud) receiver. http://www.mckay-ent.com/parts/akms-receiver.html
Barrel is U.S. Made by Montana Rifleman (now owned by Remington Arms Co., AKA Freedom Group) in 5.45 spec. EXTREMELY accurate compared to your average AK.
Hogue Mono Grip installed.Refinished with a solvent resistant Ceramic based paint.Comes with original sling, 4 pocket magazine carrying pouch, Oil can, cleaning kit and BAYONET!
Comes with one 30 round ProMag magazine (as shown in photos).
The gun handles flawlessly as all new builds go to the range for testing and 30 rounds are put through them before shipping.

In 1974 The Russian Army replaced the 7.62x39 with this caliber. The round is lighter to carry and has less recoil than a 7.62x39 but it has a high velocity. There is an abundance of cheap surplus ammo in this caliber. Since there is less recoil it's easier to stay on target with a follow up shot as there is less muzzle jump. This rifle can fire in quick succession due to the energy that escapes from the barrel bore to the gas cylinder.
Fires as fast as you can pull the trigger.

Glashaus Warranty
                Here at Glashaus Firearms we stand behind our work. However, a builder’s warranty is only good if the customer takes advantage of it…
 To ensure that less scrupulous individuals do not use our commitment to Quality work to take advantage of us, some guidelines have been established.
 1. If you have a problem with a Glashaus Firearms built weapon. Notify us as soon as the problem manifests itself. We’ll probably ask the usual round of questions. The warranty period is 30 days. Waiting months or years to bring up a problem, or bringing it up on a public Internet forum as a smear will negate your warranty.
 2. ANY home gunsmithing, modification, grinding, filing, drilling, hammering etc… negates your warranty.
 3. Glashaus Firearms will not offer, nor reimburse customers; either initial or subsequent buyers of Glashaus Firearms built weapons, for their shipping TO Glashaus Firearms for work to be completed. Glashaus Firearms will, however, pay for return shipping once warranty work is done.
 4. If Glashaus Firearms offers to repair a weapon that we’ve worked on, and advises customer to send it back, and customer does not, but rather sends weapon to ANOTHER smith/builder for his critique or evaluation. Please do not insult us by expecting us to pay for it.
Glashaus Firearms does not assume any liability for typographical errors and incorrect pricing. We reserve the right to cancel any orders due to the errors listed above.

CZ 91152 CZ-75 SP-01 9mm 4.7"" 19+1 w/Rail Rubber Grip Black Finish

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72  bbl) from CZ to
feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the
NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913
accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion
resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the
family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. The SP-01 utilizes
an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing
for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key
areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by
the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous
models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The
SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ
75  SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on
terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling
characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of
sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit
include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place
respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy.

He gave it to me in 1972 and I used it for deer and wild pig.  Very accurate and reliable semi-auto.  It is the early .25 caliber which is rare as they went to .30 cal soon after they started production.  The rifle is fully operational and I even have 1/2 box of ammo that I'll throw in.  Not in show condition as it rattled around in a buckboard and shows its history.  But it has been well taken care of and will add character to your collection.  Or you can get a feel for what it was like to hunt with one of the old 'spring-poles' back in the day.  They were called that due to the fact that it basically has two barrels.  The interior barrel slides back as part of the ejection process when the gun is fired.  A fun gun to shoot and has a lot of history.  Several of the posse that got Bonnie and Clyde were carrying Model 8's.  Several old Remington hunting posters feature it as well.  A real piece of history at a good price.

This is no .223 bb gun this is .308 stopping power. Doubles the effective range of the AR-15 and has the knockdown when it gets there. The C.E.T.M.E. MODEL-C battle rifle was the predecessor to the H&K-G3 and most parts are interchangeable. Pretty bad ass when Heckler & Koch makes a clone of your gun.

From Ruger:

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

Scope has Illuminated crosshairs (reticle) red or green, with multiple levels of brightness/intensity. Very good quality optics, CenterPoint. Shotgun Holds 5 with 1 in the hole. It chambers 3"" shells and anything smaller. It is the accuchoke system which means they are interchangable chokes..you can screw any choke, into the end of the barrel, that you like. Right now it is dressed with a Modified (the do-all) choke. This choke will shoot rifled slugs, accurately, to 120 yards...and will keep a shot pattern tight. The barrel is a smoothbore, clean as new 22"". As with all Mossbergs, you can change the barrel with the turn of a thumbscrew...no tools required. It is beautiful. It is a 20 gauge so it doesn't kick as hard as a 12g, but still has the power to put down deer and intruders equally well. I used to carry a 12g, the 20g has become my shotgun of choice.
