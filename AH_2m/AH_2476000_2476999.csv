The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

This revolver is better than new. It has only had 25 rounds put through it. I upgraded the grips to the large size since the ones that came on it were too small. That cost $100. But it made  it shoot much  better. If you want the stopping power of the .357 without the recoil this is for you. Serious inquiries only please.  Contact me day or night. I am a reasonable man so feel free to make an offer."

The new 22PLY has been redesigned with sleek new lines and a polymer frame—weighing in at a mere 10.8 ounces. Both feature a blowback action and tip-up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round. If light and fast are your priorities, the 22PLY is the pistol for you. Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. Selling price is $235.00/Chillicothe, Ohio."

I am also including 80 rounds of Hornady 30 gr. V-Max ammunition.  I can also include an ankle holster that fits this revolver very nicely if that will close the deal.  

I have only shot 20 rounds through this revolver and I like it, but need the the money more right now.  I like it enough that if times get better, I can see myself buying another just like this in the future.

NAA Black Widow  Mini-Revolvers evolved from their popular .22 Magnum frame series and include the time tested design characteristics that are incorporated in all NAA Mini-Revolvers. The result is enhanced stability and accuracy for the shooter.

The Black Widow has a Heavy Vent Barrel, a Bull Cylinder, Oversized Black Rubber Grips and comes with  fixed Low Profile Sights, by Millet.

No trades unless you have a Ruger American Rifle in .30-06 or a Remington 700 in .30-06 that you will give in an even trade.  Like I said, I need the money more right now.

Be Legal, Have ID, Have Cash, and be willing to sign Bill of Sale. Thanks."

""Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's."""

""OVERVIEW:
“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

KEY FEATURES:
Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
Sling swivel studs included
26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.)

It is a 6 dollar part from ruger if it bothers you.

This gun was my EDC until I bought a shield. Since I dont carry it, it needs a new home so I can get more toys.  The Sr series pistols have one of the best out of the box triggers. It is crisp, reset is short, with a pull of around 5.5 lbs. No grit, no mushiness, just bang.

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols.

This is a great package for a new gun to CCW or IDPA/IPSC competition.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

The gun's condition is about 90%. There is minor holster wear and a couple of small dings. There is no rust at all, and it is kept extremely clean and always fired well lubed with Slide Glide. 

I also am including 9 magazines! Each magazine is a 12rd magazine, and each magazine has BRAND NEW Wolff extra strength springs in them. With these springs the mags are like new!

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! High Noon offers an option that is on this holster called ""lining"", and it is basically a synthetic lining that is super slick and reduces holster wear. It also has water repellant properties.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster . It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

Finally, I will include two boxes of Federal self defense JHP ammunition just to sweeten the deal.

I was originally asking $1,100 for this package - but I want to get this thing sold. I am now only asking $975! With my asking price this low, I am firm on the price."
