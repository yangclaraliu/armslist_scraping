Some say, that someone screwed up big time with the approval, as Hungary was not on the short list of importers.

To make a long story short, these small batch of Hungarian FEG AKMs are said to be one of the best and most accurate AKs ever imported into the country. Only 4,000 underfolder and 3,000 stock Aks were ever imported in 1986, that's it!

I own two so I am putting one up for grabs. This one is in great shape with only two mags through it as I was told. The handguard has the nics on each side due to the underfolder edges touching when folded and some handling marks from it's 26 years. 

There was a lot more to Pre-ban Kassnar FeGs (Femaru Fegyvar es Gepgyar in Budapest). The SA-85M AKM is a civilian copy of their AK63 AKM machine gun. 

It's great to have a nice AK that you don't have worry about the stupid communist 922r section.

these are NOT $100 guns. have not been for several years now. those who say they are, are either not keeping up with prices or are thinking of the t53 which is a 5 rd bolt action firing the 7.62x54r (performs between a .308 and a .30-06) THIS gun is normally a 10 round (mine is 20 due to tapco mag) semi-auto firing the same round as an AK. if you can find one in good working condition for $100 show me proof with the statement please and i will adjust price accordingly (by the way guns on bidding sites that do not yet have bids will not be considered since they get bid to over $300 very quickly), otherwise if you think that i am ""out of my mind"" and asking ""3 times more than its value"" (hence the $100 figure i put in the description) then feel free to move along and try to find your $100 sks. good luck. they don't exist.

The CZ 75B has nice rubber grips and the factory plastic grips. Two MEC-GAR 17 round mags, one 15 round mag and one 10 round mag. The factory case, manual and lock are included.

The Kadet has the .22 slide stop, four 10 round mags and a mag loader. The factory case, manual and cleaning rod are included.  

The 9mm fires all factory ammo. Never had a hiccup. Very low recoil and accurate. When you want to shoot .22 LR, you just remove the 9mm mag, slide stop and slide, put on the .22 slide, slide stop and .22 mag and you are ready to go. Very easy conversion.

The Kadet likes 36 grain copper washed ammo. CCI or Federal are good choices.

All serial numbers match on the 75B and the Kadet. I'd say that the 75B is in very good to near excellent condition and the Kadet would be too, except for some slight screw marring on the target sights. Not terrible, just not pristine.

Both are trouble free and fun to shoot. The CZ has a comfortable grip. This has the thumb safety, and is not the decocker model.

I'd be happy to keep them or I'd be happy to trade them for a new Gen4 Glock 17 or 19 and $50.

I prefer trading face to face and maybe meeting at a firing range so you can test out the 75B & Kadet and I can test out the Glock. I have a valid MN permit to purchase & MN driver's license.

Sure as autumn arrives, the Model 870™ Wingmaster® rises to meet another day in the upland fields and woods of America. The Model 870 is so smooth and reliable that today – nearly 60 years after its introduction – it’s still the standard by which all pump shotguns are measured. With a receiver machined from a solid billet of steel, it is the model of enduring strength. True to its original design, the pump glides with silky surety on two twin action bars for the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. These characteristics, along with its flawless balance and natural pointing qualities have made the Model 870 the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – of any action type, from any manufacturer. As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon. It has a custom-quality finish and handsome American walnut woodwork. The receiver and barrel are richly blued and highly polished for classic appeal. 
Key Features:
Remarkable reliability and durability
The smoothest pump action shotgun on the market

Armslist moderators, I really hope you can make an article like this a sticky that appears at the top of every section.

1) Listing does not specify a city, only state.  Not a guarantee of a scam ad, but I find that these tend to be scams much more than listings in a specific city/region.  Most real sellers want you to know what region they're in so they can avoid wasting time talking to people who are too far away.

2) Identical listing appears in multiple states, pretending to be located in each state.  Hint: you can click ""Listings by this user"" and see how many different states they're trying to sell in, if they've used the same account for each one.  

3) Price is way under what it should be.  $800 Colt Pythons, etc.  Too good to be true, usually is.

4) Search on other gun selling web sites for the same model, and you find identical pictures from a listing there.  Very suspicious if the seller on on the other site isn't in the same state.  This one I consider a dead giveaway.  Scammers will steal good photos from other listings and around the internet.  Real Sellers:  when you take photographs, be smart and include something in the photo that makes it harder for someone else to rip it off, like the phone number or email address that you are using for your listing, the date, city/location where it's being offered.  

5) You email the seller, and there's something wrong about the way they convey themselves.  The words they use don't sound like the way real people write or talk.  They're supposedly in state, but won't meet you face to face. They say they're in another state than where their ad says they're located, and for some reason aren't willing to wait until they return home to do a FTF deal, or they say they ""just moved"".  They act like you're ready to send them money right now, without any discussion or meeting, etc.  They can't answer basic questions about the gun, like when they acquired it, etc.

If you spot an ad that you think is a scam, flag it!"

Weighing 1 Troy Oz, each, the .45 ACP version of Silver Bullet Bullion won't actually fire in a weapon, but will target your financial goals with devastating power. Pure investment-grade .999-fine silver, available in boxes of 10 or individually. Celebrates the cartridges designed by John Browning in 1904 for use in his Colt semi-automatic .45 pistol. 
Also available are 7.62 NATO Silver Bullet Bullion, weighing 2 Troy Oz, each, and at 2.72” in length every bullet is a near exact, non-firing replica of the round developed in the 1950s accepted as the first standard NATO cartridge (also called a .308). The 7.62 NATO (.308) Silver Bullet Bullion is two troy ounces of solid .999-fine silver, a unique weight that makes it handy for bartering.
The 7.62 NATO round was designed to retain the ballistic performance of its predecessor the .30-06, but with a shorter cartridge length that worked more efficiently in newer, detachable-magazine rifles. It was first used by the US in the M14 infantry rifle and M60 machine gun. Though mostly replaced in modern service, the 7.62 NATO round remains popular for its superior performance in long range applications.

Weighing 1 Troy Oz, each, the .45 ACP version of Silver Bullet Bullion won't actually fire in a weapon, but will target your financial goals with devastating power. Pure investment-grade .999-fine silver, available in boxes of 10 or individually. Celebrates the cartridges designed by John Browning in 1904 for use in his Colt semi-automatic .45 pistol. 
Also available are 7.62 NATO Silver Bullet Bullion, weighing 2 Troy Oz, each, and at 2.72” in length every bullet is a near exact, non-firing replica of the round developed in the 1950s accepted as the first standard NATO cartridge (also called a .308). The 7.62 NATO (.308) Silver Bullet Bullion is two troy ounces of solid .999-fine silver, a unique weight that makes it handy for bartering.
The 7.62 NATO round was designed to retain the ballistic performance of its predecessor the .30-06, but with a shorter cartridge length that worked more efficiently in newer, detachable-magazine rifles. It was first used by the US in the M14 infantry rifle and M60 machine gun. Though mostly replaced in modern service, the 7.62 NATO round remains popular for its superior performance in long range applications.

As the first company to produce commercially available 1911's in stainless steel, Randall Firearms has sealed a spot in history. With a total production of less than 10,000 firearms in it's entire existence, Randall 1911's are some of the most sought after and coveted collectors pieces out there. This particula model is one of the rarest produced by Randall (only 293 ever made). Here's a little bit of history on this particular model: THE CURTIS E. LeMAY 4-STAR PISTOLS In 1984, Randall expanded its line with the introduction of a true compact .45 auto, which was designed by Air Force General Curtis E. LeMay. Among his many accomplishments, LeMay had been responsible for establishing the Air Force’s Marksmanship Training Unit. When LeMay created his pistol design, he intended it to be used by members of the Strategic Air Force Command. The general initially tried to have the diminutive .45 produced by Colt. But, that never occurred. As it happened, Art Hanke, who was the head of manufacturing and engineering for Randall, was a personal friend of General LeMay. It was through this liaison that Randall Firearms Company came to produce the LeMay model line of pistols. The A331, which featured a flat top slide and Millett Low-Profile adjustable rear sight. The top of the slide was milled deeply so the rear sight would sit low enough to preclude its catching on clothing when drawn. There were 293 of this model produced in a serial number range of RF02010C through RF03169C. The first LeMay A331 was made on March 1, 1984, and the last one was completed on October 23rd of that same year. Now that you know that, let me tell you a little bit about this particular firearm. It's 100% factory original and in excellent condition. This handgun is not unfired, but pretty much flawless (as you can see from the pictures). I do not have the box or paperwork, just what you see in the pictures. Don't let this beauty get away. You never know when (or even if) you'll see another."

 for a handgun in .22lr caliber! (Or .22 magnum)
I'm kind of picky about what type but go ahead and shoot! (oop, not the best pun for this place).

The TV is selling for $329.99 at Best Buy right now and with tax that comes out to a little over $350. 
Mine is brand new, I opened it and tried it out without removing any protective stickers or covers. 

I'd kind of rather have a handgun though! My plasma is good enough.
Again, the TV is back in the box packed up just like when I bought it. Literally tried this out once, and the consumer reports reviews were right. It does it's job awesome, a budget no frills TV with an HD display comparable to name brand TV's.

I have a 42"" 720p Plasma, and although old, it's still running great. I jumped on this Insignia for a good price but have decided I'd rather have something else.
I can meet in a public, TV can be fully tested upon request.

I will help the people of NY with either selling their firearms, on consignment, or holding on to your firearms until the law changes and you are allowed to have your firearms back. Receivers will have to be sent to my FFL but newly made unlawful magazines and even ammo (if the EPA outlaws lead for bullets) can be sent to my shop. I have a few good safes and even a couple of old, but dry 'bomb/tornado shelters' for storage. It would be best for your firearms to be shipped and stored in the same box that it arrives in, the better you pack it and make it waterproof/crush proof the better. The climate controlled safes will run  $75/year, max of $150 no matter how long they will be stored. $50/year for storage in the tornado shelters, max $100. If interested email will be the most effective way of contact, telephone numbers will exchange for questions/concerns. Thank you and let's hope all this crazy gun grabbing will be repealed shortly.

When these were first imported into the county they came with the ugly Clinton era thumbhole stock. This particular rifle has been fully converted into a standard AK rifle complete with 2 tangs, polymer pistol grip and stock. Additional upgrades include:
a krebs style safety lever, 
an Ultimak top handguard rail (the best in the business to achieve absolute co-witness)
A threaded muzzle with standard slant break
Tritium (glow in the dark) front sight

The firearm has also been upgraded with enough US parts to make it fully 922-R compliant

These were the last Bulgarian AKs brought into the country already accepting double stack magazines. No additional milling was necessary when they were brought in. Stock Arsenal SLR-95s are rare rifles indeed, but a fully converted one such as this is almost unheard of. Quality at least meets that of the Polytech Legend. The accuracy potential of this fantastic milled receiver ak is astounding.
