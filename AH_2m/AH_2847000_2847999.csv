The people are saying ""NO MORE!"" and the BUMs need to stop whining about it.  BUMs have no right to complain about the people uniting and fighting back against a problem that the BUMs have caused and continue to perpetuate. 

BUMs like to spew economic axioms about capitalism and supply and demand to justify their intentions and actions.  Here's an economic truth for the BUMs:  There is no reward without risk.  You accepted the risk by taking the role of scalper in this situation and you're hoping for a big reward.  You have no right to complain when other variables occur (like the people taking a stand) and mess up your scheme.  You took a risk to get your reward and now it's not working like you planned.

Description
A Modern Twist on TraditionA TaylorMade golf club is one of the most effective items in any golfer‚Äôs arsenal. Offering both high quality and a striking style that will please the most discerning consumers, TaylorMade offers a solid handicap improvement in even the newest golfer. The TaylorMade Burner Plus Iron Set offers no. 3 through no. 9 as well as the pitching wedge, sand wedge, lob wedge, and approach wedge, enabling golfers to make short work of difficult courses.This golf club set offers a variety of beneficial features. The wide, beveled soles of the iron set create a bigger area from which to generate a powerful strike, while the longer-than-average shafts improve a golfer‚Äôs overall posture. A high moment of inertia (MOI) is created by perimeter weighting and that, combined with the deep center of gravity, allows even a novice to hit a golf ball accurately over an increased distance. Furthermore, ball speed and precision are increased by the Inverted Cone technology in the clubface.The TaylorMade Burner Plus Iron Set not only offers all of the above, but also sports a lightweight shaft set and flexible grips to make the golfer‚Äôs game even more productive. Any golfer, young or old can learn to make distance a part of his or her everyday golfing game. Flexible and ProfessionalBuilt for distance, the TaylorMade golf club offers a steel shaft with excellent energy transfer on the clubface. An excellent option for golfers who want to take their game to the next level, the clubs are available in both left- and right-handed designs, and offer a choice of Regular, Uniflex, and Stiff flex shafts depending on the player‚Äôs needs.The Regular flex TaylorMade shaft is well suited to individuals who tend to hit their drivers around 190 yards to 210 yards on the course. Uniflex shafts fall between Regular and Stiff, so they are best used by individuals whose drives range between 210 and 230 yards, whereas Stiff flex shafts are better handled by golfers with drives averaging more than 230 yards. Other factors in choosing flex include swing style and direction. Smooth swingers benefit from softer flexes no matter how quickly they drive, whereas individuals who tend to drive left often find that firmer flex shafts suit them better than softer flex ones.High-Tech DesignGolf has come a long way from its roots in 16th-century Scotland, and so has the equipment. Modern clubs are designed to deliver the utmost precision and to simplify the game for amateurs and experts alike. The Inverted Cone golf club is a worthwhile investment that will stand the test of time and be ready to introduce a new generation to the game of golf.Suitable for novice players who are still learning the finer points of the game and highly experienced professionals alike, the TaylorMade Burner Plus Iron Set has a satisfying sweet spot on every club and a very forgiving nature. Turf drag is no problem here; easier shots mean a much more enjoyable day on the course, as well as a better overall score. Furthermore, vibration and sound are dampened by the vibration-management cavity badge on each of the irons, making the clubs even more effective. The lack of vibration in the clubs will also be appreciated by golfers with bad backs and older individuals who want their drives to remain stable despite the constraints of a more mature body. In fact, golfers often find that the longer length of the shafts mean they hold their spines at a straighter angle, leading to a much more comfortable and productive swing.For golfers looking to improve their game without sacrificing style or compromising on value, the Inverted Cone golf club is an exceptional choice. Casual golfers as well as more dedicated players can improve their trajectory, swing, and strike. The consistently good reviews are a testament to the quality of the set, as well."

Because some Piece of Crap thief broke into my house and stole most of my firearms and safe as well I do not have the Box the firearm came with but I happened to be carrying this KelTec at the time so luckily they didnt get this one.
The only reason I am selling this firearm is because i just bought the Glock 380.
All the Kel Tec 380 P-3 AT listed on Armslist seem to be listed around 250.00 to 300.00 and MSRP is 318.00 on Keltec website so I think a fair price is 225.00 for the Gun, ammo and holster.

There is a very faint wear on the end of the muzzle from a holster and as you can see in one of the photos, there is a very small rub in the finish under the word Diamondback on the barrel. There is nothing egregious about this piece. It's typical Colt incredible. The original walnut grips can be picked up many places online for typically $50-$75 and I do not have the box.

I'd be interested in a trade on a Glock 42 with extra mags and ammo. Lots of different things.

Molded on the inside for extra retention, the top of the holster is also reinforced to allow one handed re-holstering. Inside the waistband (IWB) holsters provide the most comfortable and effective concealed carry method for most people. All parts of the holster and pistol that ride below the top of the pants (or skirt) are hidden, making it less likely that the covering garment will be pulled up and expose the holster. The shirt guard is to keep leather between the slide and your body, and to increase comfort and prevent your shirt from blocking the gun holster. The pants and belt hold the pistol close to the body for a flatter profile. This holster is made to fit belts up to 2‚Äù wide and attaches by a metal spring clip.

This would be a great stock for field or casual use, even tougher than the original because the expert refinishing it put in brass pins as reinforcement of areas - notably in the selector cutout area - where cracks were known to be likely. These pins are hardly visible when the stock is on the rifle. Ask any stock refinisher: Brass pins make the stock stronger than it was, before!"

Open to trades & other unique offers. (Looking for .40 and 7.62x 39 ammo too!) 

I've been making colloidal silver for over 5 years, and only now have begun to start to play with the idea to selling my production. Created in extremely controlled batches limited to 32oz, to be assured of a pure, true substance.

It's not up to me to tell you the extraordinary benefits of Ionic & Colloidal silver, or silver in general, but it is fair for you to know when you seek elsewhere:

It's inadvisable to drink ionic silver (clear solution) because the silver ions attach to the chloride in your stomach and becomes silver chloride, which extremely dilutes the effectiveness of the silver solution. I think this is because of silver chloride has an extraordinarily low solubility in water, and we're practically mostly water. 

So ionic (a charged form of silver) would be effective for the skin, eyes, nose, ears... pretty much anywhere where chloride is not present makes sense. 

Due your due diligence, I make no claims to the effectiveness/ineffectiveness of silver solutions, I just make the absolute best silver solutions I know how to make.

Just pour from the bottle of any colloid, to avoid contamination, don't drink right from the bottle. If your solution is compromised, it will become cloudy, and with colloids will change color(when a colloidal solution is clear, it's practically dead)."

Molded on the inside for extra retention, the top of the holster is also reinforced to allow one handed re-holstering. Inside the waistband (IWB) holsters provide the most comfortable and effective concealed carry method for most people. All parts of the holster and pistol that ride below the top of the pants (or skirt) are hidden, making it less likely that the covering garment will be pulled up and expose the holster. The shirt guard is to keep leather between the slide and your body, and to increase comfort and prevent your shirt from blocking the gun holster. The pants and belt hold the pistol close to the body for a flatter profile. This holster is made to fit belts up to 2‚Äù wide and attaches by a metal spring clip."

Molded on the inside for extra retention, the top of the holster is also reinforced to allow one handed re-holstering. Inside the waistband (IWB) holsters provide the most comfortable and effective concealed carry method for most people. All parts of the holster and pistol that ride below the top of the pants (or skirt) are hidden, making it less likely that the covering garment will be pulled up and expose the holster. The shirt guard is to keep leather between the slide and your body, and to increase comfort and prevent your shirt from blocking the gun holster. The pants and belt hold the pistol close to the body for a flatter profile. This holster is made to fit belts up to 2‚Äù wide and attaches by a metal spring clip."

This Ruger air rifle is a great pellet rifle high velocity with just one pump 1200 FPS. It is a break barrel single Pump. This rifle has a very nice synthetic stock. VERY ACCURATE. ALSO HAS ADJUSTABLE TRIGGER. Comes with scope 4x32 , targets, about 700 pellets and original box. I have high velocity pellets they sound almost like a .22 rifle. They break the Sound barrier so be careful around neighbors with these. They are fun though. I also have one can of assorted ammunition. Some of the pellets where very expensive high quality pellets. The targets are very nice splattering targets they cost me $10 per pack I have one full pack and one opened pack with two targets missing. This rifle has an automatic safety that is very easy to disengage. This is a great rifle to plink with since .22 lr ammo is so hard to to find now.

Today revolvers, pistols and even machine pistols count as handguns. The most powerful handguns are capable of taking down big game. Machine pistols are fully automatic or selective fire, but are unusual especially in the civilian shooter market due to sanctions on select fire or automatic weapons. Handguns are best used for self-defense, either in civilian, military or law enforcement environments, due to the relatively small size and lightweight characteristics that make them easy to carry and maneuver in tight quarters."

The outside could use a new finish but the bore cleaned up very nice. Looking for $150 or best offer. You can email me or text me at REDACTED.
