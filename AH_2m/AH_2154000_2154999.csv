The Frankford Arsenal Quick-N-EZ Case Tumbler is the biggest advancement to happen to case tumbling in years. It is packed with features and upgrades; the unique bowl design increases brass agitation for fast, aggressive cleaning that reduces wear on reloading dies and extends brass life. A clear lid lets the user monitor the tumbling action, while a cord-mounted on/off switch provides safety and convenience. At the center of it all, the powerful motor is solid and reliable; ready to provide years of tough cleaning action.

Reminder: This is the Greek built rifle that are the preferred way to go. They were made on HK equipment by HK trained workers. They are the version that holds the most value in the clone market are in every way identical to an HK91 (other than the butthole stock). The later versions with their aluminum receivers have their own problems, the main one being deformation of the receiver due to the heavy recoil of a full sized cartridge. The nice thing is, with either, Springfield's lifetime warranty follows either rifle type. If your aluminum receiver fails, Springfield will try to repair it (unlikely) so from what I understand they will issue you a new M1A or equivalent amount of credit towards one (I'm not sure which)."

Surefire SFMB-556-1/2-28 Muzzle Brake 5.56MM: $135.00

Caliber 5.56 mm (.223 caliber) 
•Length 2.70 inches 

The advanced SureFire SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake, which fits M4 / M16 weapons and variants with 1/2-28 muzzle threads, greatly reduces both recoil impulse and muzzle rise so that the weapon tracks straight back to keep you on target for faster shot-to-shot recovery. Its patented Impulse Diffusion design minimizes side blast and rear-directed concussion effects. 

The SFMB-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command. 

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SFMB-556-1/2-28 muzzle brake is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning even after extreme use. When used in conjunction with a SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SFMB-556-1/2-28 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. 

 All SureFire SOCOM Series muzzle brakes have blind pilot holes at the 3 and 9 o’clock position to enable fine-tuning of recoil characteristics for individual shooting styles or ammunition characteristics. They also have blind pilot holes at the 6 o’clock position to enable indexing the adapter at bottom dead center, and to pin-and-weld on short-barreled rifles. All that is required is a basic hand drill and appropriate drill bits. 

SureFire muzzle brakes are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment, and each is covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee. 

FITS: M4, M16 and variants wih 1/2-28 muzzle threads 

MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56mm/.223 caliber sound suppressors 

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors and current-model muzzle brake/suppressor adapters and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders. 

Features 
•Offset porting delivers greatly reduced recoil impulse and muzzle rise, so the weapon tracks straight back to keep you on target for faster shot-to-shot recovery 
•Multiple bearing surfaces for superior suppressor alignment

•High-precision single-point cut barrel threads for optimum thread interface 
•Inspected for all critical dimensions including concentricity and alignment

•Black Ionbond DLC coating provides maximum protection against harsh environmental conditions and facilitates cleaning after extreme use 
•Serves as rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series sound suppressors 
•Labyrinth seals prevent carbon buildup on suppressor lock ring indexing system

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Our Assessment: This is a beautiful pistol for its age. The Model 39 is arguably the best of the S&W 9mm’s. Although it only held 8 rounds in the magazine, it was well made and didn’t suffer the feeding and other reliability problems of its successors.

It was originally designed by Sweden and produced as the AG-42 Ljungman for the Swedish Army. The tooling and design were later sold to Egypt, and the Hakim was produced there during the 1950s and early 1960s.

Egypt introduced an adjustable gas operated system, whereas the Ljungman had been non-adjustable. The Hakim system is adjustable by use of a special tool and is a simple, direct impingement type whereby the flow of gas impacts directly on the front face of the bolt carrier, propelling it to the rear, which unlocks and moves the bolt as it does so. The U.S. M16 rifle utilizes a similar system, except the flow of gas into the system in that case is not adjustable and a self-regulating device of the Johnson/Stoner type is built into the bolt carrier assembly. The Hakim features a Tokarev-pattern tipping bolt system as used in the FN-49, SKS and MAS-49 rifles. (The tool used to adjust the gas system is included.)


While the Ag m/42 Ljungman fired the 6.5×55mm cartridge, Egypt owned large stockpiles of 8×57mm ammunition, much of it left behind during World War II. To take advantage of the large stockpile, the Hakim was further re-engineered to accept the larger 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge, which also necessitated the addition of a permanent, non removable muzzle brake to help reduce the concurrent greater recoil.

The result is a very cool semi-auto rifle that shoots a heavy calibre bullet, yet due to the muzzle brake the felt recoil is minimal when compared to say the semi auto Garand m1.

The bore is bright and shiny with good sharp rifling.  The stock is great, with almost none of the battle dings you would expect and the finish is in very good condition as well.  (Most likely this was a rifle captured by the IDF in one of the middle east wars.)

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

This is a Beretta Storm Carbine in 9mm it come with 2 -17 round magazine and plastic case.  
Price does not include the barrel shroud.
Super Nice!!!!

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included)."

This package has been assembled, but never fired. Included in this package are the following items: 
-Remington 700 SS 5R Milspec rifle chambered in .308 
-Leupold Mark IV LR/T 8.5-25x50mm Illuminated MilDot scope 
-Leupold Mark IV scope rings 
-GG&G scope mount 
-Harris BiPod 
-Pelican 1750 rifle case custom cut for the rifle
-Winchester spotting scope
-Cleaning rod

The Remington 700 SS 5R Milspec has been called the most accurate out of the box rifle ever made. These rifles were produced by Remington in limited quantities and only sold through one national distributor. Because of this, they were hard to obtain when still in production and are even more rare now! The 700 SS 5R sports a 24 inch stainless steel barrel with a 11.25 inch twist with a special radius cut in the shoulder between the lands and groves. This rifle is the civilian counterpart to the military M24 sniper rifle.

Leupold Mark IV Long Range/Tactical riflescopes are arguably some of the most dependable, highest performing riflescopes you’ll find anywhere. Their accuracy is proven in the field. Their rugged and absolute waterproof integrity is unquestionable. They are everything a tactical shooter, long-range shooter, target shooter, or hunter could ask for."

This is the Lowest Serial Number I believe I've ever seen, in any collection or otherwise in my 30 + years of my experience at gunshows or anywhere else ! 

The M1924 is properly known as the: "" Sequoia Importing Co."" Model because of a San Francisco Company that ordered 1,000 units in 30-06 caliber. Many went back to Austria and were re-stamped & re-chambered. "" A proper Mannlicher-Schoenauer will have either No caliber marking on the Receiver, as caliber was assigned Via Model only, or that caliber will be engraved upon the receiver ring as the final line description. ............................................. Take NOTE: ......... This M/S Sequoia Serial number 327; is one of the surviving "" One of a thousand."" Yet in actuality it is probably more like: One of 500 "", in ANY condition "". .............................. This is a VERY RARE Find ! .............................................

We call these Tipton 1-piece carbon fiber leaning rods ""deluxe"" because they feature an ergonomically designed handle that spins on two sets of ball bearings - the result is a cleaning rod that smoothly follows the rifling both pushing and pulling, even while under pressure. The ""shank-through"" construction also allows the user to apply ""reasonable"" hammer blows to the end of the cleaning rod to get a tight patch through a bore. These rods are chemical resistant, will not scratch the bore like a steel rod can and will not embed like a coated rod can.

I hate to see it one go but need to free up some funds. What we have here is a 1947 L.C. Smith 16Ga Side by Side. The gun is in beautiful condition. It has a 28"" barrel with 2 3/4"" chamber. The left barrel is full choke and the right side is modified.The bluing is nice, the wood is nice, and the receiver has been professionally nickel plated. I believe the gun has been completely redone professionally at some point in its life, but it looks to have been done right. It is tight and all the serial numbers match. The barrels are both mirror clean and the triggers are smooth. It is a 66 year old gun so its not mint but very beautiful still. I would give it a solid 9 out of 10 on condition for its age. I am selling this one for $800 cash. You would be hard pressed to find another one in this nice of shape for anywhere near this price. Call or text REDACTED if interested. Serious inquiries only please. I am located in Cleveland TN.

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets. 

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets. 

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets. 

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets. 

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."
