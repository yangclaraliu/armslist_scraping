There is a grip made by stark that will cover this if you don't want to fix it. If you would like, I will also throw in the magpul trigger guard. This AR15 is in perfect condition. I've only put 60 rounds through it and it cycled flawlessly. I am anal when it comes to little details like that though so now I am looking to sell it. I still have the original box, parts, and manual that it came with. I will have pictures up shortly but it does have a forward assist and dust cover. If you would like proof that it is brand new, I would be more than happy to provide it. This is a great price for what you are getting. Please email or text me if you are interested. No trades.

This is hard to come by and I do not want to charge an excessive amount as some have done due to the ammo shortage.  I am selling this since I do not now have a 380.  Below is a listing of the ammo I have:

6 boxes @ $22 a box- Sellier & Bellot 380 ACP 92 Grain Full Metal Jacket Box of 50
     This is great practice ammo and some people like to use them for defense because of their penetration ability.

1 box @ $25- Speer Gold Dot 380 ACP 90 Grain Jacketed Hollow Point Box of 20
     This is one of the best defense loads.  It is powerful and the Gold Dot bullet expands dependably with devastating effect.  Please note: This is a full box, but contains only 20 rounds.

1 box @ $30- Fiocchi 380 ACP 90 Grain Jacketed Hollow Point Box of 50
This is high quality ammo which is good for either practice or defense.  However, some shooters have experienced problems with this round which is why I have referenced the article below.  However, most shooters find this to be a very good round.

I am willing to sell separate boxes, but if a buyer wishes to buy all eight boxes, I will reduce the price to $170, saving the buyer $17.  I am willing to ship for the FedEx shipping cost, but would prefer to deliver to the Bakersfield or Kern River Valley areas free of charge.  I will also be travelling north in about a month and can deliver anywhere along I-5 or I-99 between Bakersfield and the SF Bay Area at that time for no charge.  I accept for payment PayPal, money order, certified bank draft or cashier's check.
You may text or call me at REDACTED or email reply is acceptable.

I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

I hand stipple each pistol to custom fit each owners specifications. Lines are very clean and uniformed. Excellent attention to detail with quick turnaround times depending on complexity of project. These are very time consuming when done correctly. The end result serves for better overall handling of the firearm. 

Glock pistols are my main specialty. Packages can include stipple (texturing), trigger guard undercuts, rounding of the trigger guard, removal of finger grooves and slight reduction of pistol grip. Barrel and feed ramp can be polished to a mirror finish as well if that is something you would like.

I offer different textures such as: Waffle, Dotted, Tree-bark and Abstract texturing. They can be aggressive to very subtle. Line patterns are discussed to ensure everything comes out the way you like. 

Similar services can be pricey and often takes a few days to a few weeks depending on the shop to get your firearm back. Stay local and get an even better texturing than some other shops that rush through each project.

Texturing will normally start at 40.00
Trigger guard Under-cuts: 15.00
Reduction or removal of finger grooves: 20.00
Barrel polishing: 5.00

I just bought this last week and it is essentially new, only put 80 rounds through it.  Has great sights, zero recoil and would make a great plinking/recreational gun, home defense gun, and even an interesting hunting carbine, with Kansas' recent change in hunting laws you can even hunt deer with this, power is comparable to a .41 magnum coming out of the 16in barrel.  

Say what you will about the Hi Point handguns but the carbines are almost universally well reviewed and considered to be very reliable.  Will come with its box and all the factory stuff, papers, lock, tools, folding foregrip, and two ten round magazines.

I love it and hate to see it go, but I'm needing something small for summer carry, I love my Beretta 92 but its too big to carry all the time.  I'm wanting to trade for a pocket sized or subcompact handgun, I have a strong preference for .40, but will consider other guns in 9mm, would also consider a .38 special snub revolver.  
I have cash that I can add for the right deal.

It really speaks with authority. Recoil is much lower than expected due to the semi-auto action (softer than that of a 44 revolver); but definitely not a gun for the limp wristed.

Which allows you to mount your scope if you want. The 25"" barrel has a mint bore and wears the original sights. The stock has no modifications to it and is solid with no issues. It  is one of the post world war II models that came with the scope mount and chrome trigger guard and chrome bolt action. It takes .22lr, .22l or .22shorts.
