The GLOCK 36 packs 6 rounds of .45 Caliber AUTO stopping power in a package that fits the hands of most any user. In the SLIMLINEâ¢ design, GLOCK has incorporated the use of a single stack magazine. The G36 measures only 1.13 in. in width which makes controlling recoil very simple. The G36 is easy-to-use, hard to see, and tough to face.

This deal comes with three magazines. Two are the six round single stack mags and one is the extended seven round single stack mag. If you want to turn the 7 round mag back to a six round mag, I have the extension for that too.
Will come with a blackhawk serpa holster and a Bianchi IWB leather holster. This is a great firearm and only has a a couple hundred rounds downrange. The barrel looks new... this Glock is nice. I do have some ammo to add for the right deal...  This firearm has some very slight stipling.

The deal includes three 7-round factory magazines and a pocket holster. The gun comes from the factory with one magazine and extras cost about $22. The holster is valued at about $10 and has only been used to protect the gun in storage. 

All included with the pistol:

1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement extractor (new and unused)
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement extractor leaf spring (new and unused)
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement extractor screw (new and unused)
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement assembly pin (new and unused)
1 extra Kel-Tec factory replacement slide stop spring (new and unused)
Owners manual
Factory original hard case

This pistol cycles reliably with brass cased ammunition. Aluminum cases (such as CCI Blazer) have occasional failures to extract. Some European ammunition with hard primers (Sellier & Bellot, Herters Brass) will have occasional failures to ignite. Standard pressure American made factory loads work just fine. I have not used steel cased or +p ammunition in this pistol and would not recommend doing so.

The slide has been replaced by Kel-Tec. The original developed a hairline crack after about 400 rounds. The gun also has a new firing pin, extractor, and related hardware. The new slide assembly has only seen about 20 rounds.

A few notes on Kel-Tec's design:

Be sure to keep the screw on the extractor spring tight. If the screw loosens, the firing pin becomes loose and can fall out. I lost the first one prior to the slide replacement. I degreased the threads on the screw and the slide and applied some blue thread lock. I did not see any loosening after this operation on the original slide, and I have done the same thing with this slide. Just something to keep an eye on.

Also, make sure the spring that holds the assembly pin in place has enough tension on it. If the spring is not securely holding the assembly pin in place, the slide can shear the head of the pin off. Kel-Tec is pretty good about sending replacements, but it's an annoying feature of their design. 

The gun has been cleaned and maintained properly. It has spent most of its existence in the safe.

Buyer must show a Wisconsin Driver's License and sign a bill of sale. A Wisconsin Concealed Carry License is a plus. I can meet people in the Fennimore or Platteville areas."

It will still accept a standard AR style upper so you can switch to .223, 300 Black or whatever AR caliber you prefer.

Great for shooting clays, home defense, and WOWing everyone at the range! 

Flat Dark Earth Tan (FDE) GWACS Armory one piece Multi Cal Ultra Lightweight Composite lower, built with standard military style sights, removable carry handle, and FDE Tan Magpul rifle length forearm.

Safir Arms flat top railed upper receiver, custom 410 gauge bolt, and smooth bore 410 gauge 18"" threaded barrel. It also includes three 10 round Lancer magazines that have been custom modified for the 410 shell. It has been ""tuned"" and checked out by a leading Gunsmith/Armorer and shoots great! The bolt will still accept the impossible to get Safir 410 magazine. I can make more modified Lancer magazines if you want them at $65 a piece.

Included is a manual and a list of the 410 shells that work best with this setup.

I'm asking $1800 or best offer, local sales prefer but with ship to FFL at your cost.

Handles and shoots like an AR-15, uses standard AR parts, way cooler than a Saiga, and is extremely unique and rare. The semi-auto operation is done through an ingenious hybrid gas piston ring blowback/recoil operated system, that is very reliable and keeps the chamber extremely clean. Only 50 rounds through the rifle for ""tuning"" and testing.

I bought four of these parts kits in a package from the importer and wanted to build them so others could enjoy them as much as I enjoy the two that I'm keeping.

Will trade for USC, SL8-6, ACR, Tavor 18"", SCAR 308, KZ-9mm, FNX-45, P227

PS: I have had a lot of requests to do more conversion's of Safir rifles to use Lancer Magazines. Because of the costs of the custom parts and time involved I will not be doing any more of these conversions until this rifle has sold.

Check out their story on the ammo crises.  The article I just read says Cabelas and other big chains are showing a big decrease in ammo sales, and so their stock value will go down.  He says the only remaining shortage is 22, 22 mag and 9mm.  I was in Walmart yesterday and shelves were the fullest I have seen in more than 2 years, everything but 22 and 22 mag and they had plenty of 9mm.  People have stocked up on all the hunting calibers and pistol calibers.  What that means is when big calibers are no longer being sold,  the 22s and 9mms will be where the manufacturers go to keep up profits.  The bottom line is the 22/22 mag shortage is 3-6 months from being totally over.  Sure  many of us will hoard a few, but sooner or later the mass production will fill every cupboard and they will be on shelves 7 days a week.  Read the article, by summer 22s will be available everyday......FWIW"

The black reticle is etched directly onto the prism with red and green light illumination available with the turn of a dial. Reticle dots correspond to bullet drop from 5.56 or 7.62 rounds, however this tough optic is built to handle much heavier recoil if needed.

The AR-332 is designed for reliability under harsh use, with hand-fitted internals and exacting tolerances. The Burris Forever Warranty protects you and your optic from anything you can throw at it."

A great target pistol in perfect working order and perfect condition.  Runs well on CCI or Winchester white box.
Very accurate, frankly this gun shoots far better than I can.  If you are serious about improving your target skills this is a good choice.

This is an older model Remington 870 Wingmaster 12 Gauge with the 28 1/2 inch barrel.  Shoots all 2 3/4 inch shells.  Comes with a nice RedHead case.  
Since its an older production Wingmaster, this shotgun is exceptionally well put together.  The action is very smoooooothh.  She's a beauty and a joy to shoot, they don't make em quite like this anymore.   Slight wear appropriate for the age of the gun.  Finish is blued steel and hardwood.

I'm really open to any trade ideas, just want to see if anyone else is bored and has something they'd like to trade.  This was made in an era before cheap materials but when there was already good technology, its a wonderful gun.  

If you're interested don't be shy, shoot me an offer and we'll talk, take care.

In near perfect condition, no scratches to exterior, bore perfect. Comes with factory storage case, 1 standard magazine and 2 extended magazines. I've recently stepped up to a Kimber and so this gun is now available to someone new. This is a quality little pistol that will serve you well for years to come. It disassembles exactly like a Glock...in fact, this is almost like the micro that Glock never made.

 Superb accuracy, extremely concealable, and excellent ergonomics make this an excellent choice for a concealed carry even in light summer clothing. Sure, you could conceal a Glock 26 easily in the cooler months, but it becomes much trickier in shorts and a tee shirt. This pistol will give you piece of mind all 4 seasons.

 A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

 A steel trigger (not plastic like so many others) with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

I paid $18 for this but will include for FREE, if you purchase the extra FS mags).  Paid $50 for each but will sell to you for $45 for one or $85 for both.  

(2) I have a CUSTOM, handmade, black leather IWB ambidextrous holster that was made specifically for this handgun.  I paid $47 for the holster and $10 for the special silicone solution they sell to help break in the holster as well as make it draw as smooth as silk!  I will sell both together for $45 extra."

Not your average judge! This a limited edition, only 1000 made. 3"" barrel. Accepts 2.5"" 410 shells or .45 Long Colts. Polished with gold accents. Beautiful gun! 

 I will include holster and belt, and about 100 rounds of 45 colt, and personal defensive rounds.   The gun is in mint like new condition or about 98% The ammo and gear included is well over $200 value. My price is $500. No trades cash only. Original box


The Taurus Judge Magnum is capable of chambering both .410 gauge 2.5"" or 3"" shotshells and 45 Colt ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the 45 Colt ammo. Taurus has finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 caliber bullet to the target.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL âB-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6â drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

Brand new never mounted.  Amber Chevron Reticle (yellow)

""This Trijicon ACOG riflescope offers magnification of 4x with a 32-millimeter objective. The scope is equipped with a day/night dual-illumination Chevron Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) Reticle that provides battery-free operation by illuminating with fiber optics during daylight and a tritium phosphor lamp at night. The ranging reticle is calibrated for 5.56 (0.223 cal) flattop rifles out to 800 meters. The Chevron Reticle is designed to be zeroed using the tip at 100 meters. The width of the Chevron at the base is 5.53 MOA, which is set at 19 at 300 meters, allowing for range estimation for silhouette targets. The scope comes with a Picatinny flat top rail adapter for mounting, a fitted neoprene Scopecoat that protects the scope when it is mounted on the rifle, and a large storage case.
Trijicon ACOG Riflescopes:
Trijicon ACOGs are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. The Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) scopes feature bright daytime reticles that use fiber optics to collect ambient light and automatically adjust the brightness to meet available light conditions. The ACOGs combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. Every feature of each scope's mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions--without failure-prone batteries."""

Overall this is a very nice/clean piece in the beautiful nickel finish. There is a faint drag line on the cylinder, so this one has not been shot much and the wood grips look great, no scratches or wear at all.  Let me know if you need more pics of any area.

$900 cash.  I prefer cash, but I know it's tight for folks, so I will consider trades around the asking price.  I also have a nice Trooper MK III blue 4"" in the original box, I would sell both for $1,700 if someone is interested.

The Trooper's have steadily increased in value over the past couple of years, I've seen them sell from as low as the $600's and into the thousands, depending on the finish, condition, if the box & ppwk are included etc., so really all over the place as far as value goes.  I'm in no hurry to get rid of this one as it will only increase in value.  If you are looking for an investment piece, this is a sure thing and shooting it will not decrease the value, so you can enjoy it too.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics etc., so I know the deal. 

I'm not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifier (not Eotech) in the 5x-6x power range.  I am trying to finish off several rifle projects if someone has multiples.
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool. 
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
FN SCAR 16 maybe 17
Daewoo K2
FAL 308/7.62
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal.  
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily. 
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal 
Beretta 92FS INOX, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too.
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
1911 pistols 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be perfect for my AR-10
Maybe another Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.  A Savage 12 BVSS .308 would be nice as part of a deal.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39, .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everthing, but I will consider more ammo, depending on the value you place on it.  

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do drive to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

It fires superbly (Short & Long) and is in immaculate condition. It has all the original bluing and has not been restored in any way, this was Grand Father's rifle and I have no use for it at this time. It has been VERY well maintained and has been in a case or a safe for the majority of its life. VERY minimal pitting and no rust and an extremely smooth action. The wood is all original and in extremely good condition for a rifle that's a few years old, let alone a rifle that's 73 years old. An EXCELLENT addition to any collection or just because. This has can be a hunter, plinker or wall-hanger depending on what you want to do with it. I do not need to sell this, but could use the funds for another items that I'm looking into.

Please ask any questions prior to bidding as all sales re final. I've taken a lot of pics and will send more if requested,
The quality and condition of this rifle warrants a higher decent price as it is one of the best pre ware rifles I've seen âout thereâ. Please feel free to email me with any questions or concerns at REDACTED and I'll do my best to assist you.
Being that is it pre-war, it is more rare and the quality, from what I've seen on GB and ArmsList (not saying theyâre not out there), this is one of the best (if not the best one listed).  Being a take-down, it can be stowed easily and assembled if desired as it goes back together quickly and well. I prefer a face to face sale, but shipping g can be arranged if needed.
