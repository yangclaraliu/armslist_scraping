I have a 1982 Goldwing GL1100 Classic (that means naked). I LOVE this bike, but I am going in a different direction and I'm going to be on the coast soon. I was going to supercharge this bike and run a 1983 final drive unit so I could run it at the strip and have a comfortable ride whenever I wanted to cruise around. 

It's an 82 Goldwing (Naked obviously). Brand new brakes (not even a mile on them), new tires (less than 1500 miles), new valve cover gaskets, new spark plugs, new oil, all lights work, new battery, new speedo cable, comes with one new head gasket (just in case), final drive gasket, timing belts, as many of the new valve cover bolts I can find (bought the last eight in the springs), has full bags (sides, front and small rear for the sissy bar), Harley pipes that have been cored (nice, loud, deep, but won't make you go deaf), highway pegs, shifter seal done with oil, idle adjusted properly for pipes, Road Krome windscreen (AWESOME in the rain, cold, and on long trips). I planned on new grips in the next few months, rebuild and supercharger next year (rebuild would have only been to ensure reliability), custom grips, mirrors and pipes at some point. As you can see, I have a lot of time, thought, money and myself tied up into this bike, I just need to prep for the future and a bike isn't in it for right now. If you're interested, text me at 719-659-626 and then add a four on the end.

It is a 3rd variant model of Browning’s original patent, having a  safety catch with two notches in the slide.  The FN 1905-06 Vest Pocket is the granddaddy of all subsequent 25 ACPs, including those made later by Colt under license called the model 1908.

The 6 digit serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel of this gun all match, beginning with 337xxx.  FN production records are irretrievable, but by one account (Eastman) 100,000 were manufactured the first year.  By July 1913 they had surpassed s/n 451,310.  In late 1913 FN made four VP 25’s with s/n’s in the 456xxx range as presentation pieces for a Jan 1914 banquet.

Interpolating between the known production numbers means this gun was probably made in 1910 or perhaps 1911.

In addition, there is a brown leather holster that fits this gun exactly.  The holster is imprinted on the back with the name and logo of Heiser Denver model 923.  Heiser had begun exporting contract holsters to Europe in the same time period as this gun was manufactured, so it’s highly likely this holster was made in small quantity specifically for the FN 1905-06.  The gun and holster together were brought from Europe to the U.S. after WWII.  They are both in pretty decent shape.  I’ve had the gun & holster for the past 50 years, which is about how long ago the gun was last fired.

Base rifle is a DPMS A-15, but it has tons of upgrades. Rifle has functioned flawlessly and has been well maintained. No hurry to move, just trying to consolidate my firearms. Includes the following items (and their conservative approximate eBay values): 

ON THE RIFLE 

- EOTech 512 ($300)

- Surefire M2 weaponlight w/ LED Conversion Head ($140)

- Rifle length free float tube ($50) with Magpul rail covers ($30) (on the rifle and extras)

If you tally up the extras, we're up over $1000, and that's buying it all used. $525 on the rifle. Just trying to be upfront about my math. 

Willing to negotiate. For example, I would be happy to keep my EoTech and my weapon light and adjust the price accordingly. However, considering that this rifle is a solid performer with good accessories (not NCStar crap), I believe my price is extremely fair.

It is 1 of the best US made clones of the original H&K SP89. It features a 6"" 3-lug, ½x28 RH threaded PDW barrel. I have only put 120rds through it & it functioned flawlessly (perhaps due to the H&K 9mm extractor & spring). It was refinished by On Target Guns LLC in flat black Cerakote. This was completed on 8/23/13. The Trijicon nightsights are pretty dim now, as they're through about half of their lifespan. See the list below for all of the German parts that were installed. The front sling eyelet was removed by Vector Arms when I sent them the gun & the 4-position grip frame to be clipped. This left a hole where the eyelet was installed (I didn't think to ask them to weld it over), but allows using more forends, such as the B&T railed forend, which would not fit with the eyelet installed. The pictured aftermarket MP5-A1 receiver end cap is included, but was split on the top seam when installed on a Vector Arms V93 pistol. It does not have a buffer installed. I'm only including it as I will have no use for it anymore. The receiver extension allows installing an A2 fixed stock, or even an A3 or MP5-F A3 stock, as the receiver does not have the plates welded over the channels on the sides of the receiver. This will require compliance with the NFA.

The Gun:
This is a Mossberg Maverick 88 Special Purpose in a blued finish.  It's the 18.5"" barrel version, holds up to 6 rounds (5+1), and can fire any type of 12 gauge ammo.  The full details can be found here:

I've had this gun for about 4 years as the first owner, and always maintained it well because it's been my primary home defense weapon.  It has only about 200 rounds through it, mostly birdshot.  Other than a few fine scratches, it has no marks, pits, deep scratches, dents, rusting, or any other kind of damage.  The bore is bright and shiny.  It's mechanically perfect and functions just as well as the first day I got it, if not better even.  Overall, I would give its condition a 95%.

As you can see, I run it with a Houge pistol grip.  This makes the shotgun extremely mobile and easy to handle, which is good for a home setting.  However, you can always switch back to the stock if you prefer.  Even with 00 buck, the recoil is very tame with the Hogue grips or the Limbsaver pad.  And although hard to see, I have a Laserlyte Shotgun Tri Rail Mount attached at the end for accessories.  If it's for home defense, a good light is a must (I'll be keeping mine however).

Overall, this is a great entry-level pump action shotgun.  It's accurate, reliable, and has served me well over the years.

--------------------

What's Included (and current prices on Amazon.com):
Hogue Pistol grip ($23)
Original stock with a Limbsaver Recoil Pad ($35)
Uncle Mike's Quick Detachable Swivel Rings ($10)
2-point sling  ($10)
Hoppe's BoreSnake Shotgun Bore Cleaner  ($13; I will wash it before selling it)
Laserlyte Shotgun Tri-Rail Mount  ($25)
Original Mossberg brand gun lock

Total = $116 in accessories

And $25 worth of ammo I'm not factoring into the price to complete the package:

2 Boxes of Royal Buck Low Recoil 00 Buckshot (10 rds total)
1 Box of Fiocchi #6 Shot (25 rds)
1 Box of Federal Truball Rifled HP Slugshot (5 rds; NOT PICTURED but will be included)

From what I see on the Internet (as of 10/3), a new Maverick will run you for about $300 (when including tax and fees), and a used one about $200-250.  When you consider all the accessories I'm including however (most of which are essential), and a 95% condition gun that has not been damaged, modified, or tacti-cooled in any way, then I would have to say this is a very good deal.  Please do the price research to make sure my claims are valid.

------------------------------

Why I'm Selling This Gun:
I recently was able to upgrade to my dream shotgun: a Benelli M4 semi-auto.  I've wanted this gun for many years, and now I finally own one.  I prefer to maintain only one shotgun, and thus selling the old Maverick.  

--------------------

Meeting/Buying Terms:
1. I currently live in Chino, CA and prefer that potential buyers meet me at the Turner's Outdoorsman in Chino Hills.
2. If you're interested in buying, please include in your message a phone number I can reach you at and the best time to call, if any.  I prefer to discuss details over phone rather than e-mail.
3. When we meet, you can fully inspect the firearm.  You won't be obligated to buy until you're satisfied with what you see.
4. I don't mind driving up to 10 miles from Chino to meet you halfway somewhere, as long as it's at a location with a FFL dealer that can do PPTs.
5. The private transfer fee at any FFL dealer is $35 ($10 transfer + $25 DROS) and the buyer will be expected to pay for that to the store as well.
6. Cash is preferred, but I'll also take Paypal if you add $9 for the 3% Paypal fee (that is, if you trust me enough to pay in advance).

--------------------

Final Notes:
1. Considering the deal on this package, the price is FIRM.
2. I'm not taking trade offers at this time.
3. I will ONLY sell to those who are willing to provide me a phone number and be able to meet me LOCALLY, in person, at a business with a FFL dealer.  Therefore, NO SHIPPING.

Please message me if there are any questions or if you're interested in buying (my name is An).  However, I will ignore any that ask to go against my terms.  There are many scammers that prowl this site, and I'm just trying to protect myself as well as the trust people put in me.  Thank you."

Innovative design accepts AR-15 magazines
Fluted 24"" bull barrel and tapered crown
Laminated benchrest-style stock with raised flat comb
Adjustable trigger system for pull as low as 2 lbs.
The Mossberg Varmint-Predator (MVP) rifle features a patent-pending drop-push bolt-action that enables you to use your AR-15 .223/5.56 NATO magazines in a firearm optimized for varmint and predator control. The fluted 24"" button-rifled medium bull barrel has a 1:9 twist rate optimized for .223-caliber accuracy and sports a matte-blued finish. Its 11° tapered crown protects the muzzle from incidental damage. The laminated benchrest-style stock features pillar bedding to enhance accuracy and is ideal for shooting off sandbags or packs. Its ergonomic design has a raised flat comb for sighting ease, palm swell on the forend and checkering on the pistol-style grip and forearm. The Lighting Bolt Action (LBA™) trigger assembly is machined aircraft-grade aluminum and hard-coat anodized to military specifications, preventing corrosion and reducing wear. LBA’s creep-free design ensures a crisp break with each shot and trigger pull can be adjusted down to 2 lbs. using only a standard screwdriver. Ten-round magazine included."

The ammo is about 50 rounds of self-defense hollow point and 2 50 round boxes of FMJ.

If you know anything about these Ruger semi-autos, you know that they are tanks and will last a lifetime. I fired it once at the range. It is accurate and surprisingly low in recoil, thanks in part to how well built and solid the gun is.

 Description: Factory New Kel-Tec PF9 9mm compact semi-auto pistol! 

 The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
 RAJAC FIREARMS POWEL OHIO 614*208*5444

 The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Four 20 round magazines is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.

The .357 sig round is a winner, perfect between the 9mm and the .40 S&W. I am selling this firearm for $485, or best offer - please contact me with any offer that is reasonable. In the past two days, I have replaced the mag release and the slide stop lever, both extended. This weapon also comes with 2 magazines, (1) 10 round and (1) 13 round. 

NOTE: The slide is moderately worn, I am not the original owner of this gun, however it has formerly been an LEO service weapon so the wear will reflect that. The wear does not affect the overall performance of the gun, I have carried this gun for some time. It's one of those that you can carry confidently and not have to worry about dinging up.

Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior pump-gun for the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. ArmorLokt construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can just wipe it down at the end of the day.
Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion. And when it’s time for action, the revolutionary SuperCell recoil pad effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces. Email works but text is best REDACTED

The pin hole in the aluminum receiver WILL ALWAYS ULTIMATELY FAIL allowing the trunnion to come loose in the receiver. There is no question on this it's just a matter of when and there IS NO FIX OTHER THAN TO REPLACE THE RECEIVER. This is a known fatally flawed design. The Aluminum used in the receiver simply does not have the strength needed to prevent deformation of the pin hole during use. These guns have value only for the parts. There is essentially no value as a complete firearm. Anyone is free to research this. This defect is widely known and applies only to Aluminum receiver guns. Don't get scammed out of hundreds of dollars on one of these, the Springfield name on it means NOTHING. It is the worst gun they ever put out. This defect does not apply to the Greek made SARs with stamped steel receivers ONLY to the aluminum receiver guns."

Noveske NSR-11 rail

All parts are brand new, never fired, except for the MUR-1A which is lightly used. There are 2 marks on the MUR near the bolt release from the previous owner using an oversized bolt release. It doesn't bother me since my guns aren't safe queens, but they are easily touched up with Aluminum Black if so desired. The upper was assemble by a highly regarded local gunsmith, barrel was dimpled for the gas block, and everything checked out. All you need is a CH and BCG and you're good to go.

I'm asking $850 shipped, which is far less that the $980 I paid ($300 MUR [well above msrp, but these things are damn hard to find], $300 BCM barrel, $50 gas block & tube, $280 NSR, $10 A2, $40 gunsmithing) for no good reason other than I want to fund another build quickly. 

I would also consider selling just the barrel/gas block/gas tube/A2 for $300, and re-using the rest for my next build.

Between the extra mags ($180 value @ $30 each mag x 6 extras over what comes with them from factory), the laser sand adapters ($80 value @ $20 each piece), and duracoat ($100 value @ $50 each), its a great deal. you figure the guns with 2 mags basic are worth $300 low end estimate (ive seen people ask $375 for it on here), so thats $600 right there. Add in the extras at the $360 value, and youre getting $960 in value for $800."
