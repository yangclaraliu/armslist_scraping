I have several 91/30 Izhevsk round receiver Mosin Nagants that I want to get rid of. First come / first served on getting to hand pick the best from the lot. If you buy a rifle I will throw in a 440 round spam can of silver tip milsurp ammo for $125. I can guarantee you will not find ammo any cheaper than this. Yes, you might find a cheaper Mosin but it is well worth a few extra $$$ to get to hand pick one that you get to see instead of using mail order, paying for shipping, paying an FFL fee, and then finding out it was ran over by a tank in 1945 and is horrible looking. My rifles look great and all are still packet in cosmoline by the Russians who were waiting for WWIII to begin. Ask around, people know I have a quality collection. I will only sell a few rifles so make sure you jump on this. All rifles have matching numbers (including the bayonet !!!), a cleaning kit, and an oil/solvent canteen.

 Stock number #REDACTED72

 This pistol was purchased new and has had very little use. By little use I shot
 ONE round through it. So if you count the test round that makes two. Comes with
 all the factory accessories in the case as the day I bought it. 
 One 11 and one 16 shot magazine, paddle holster, magazine pouch
 two extra back straps, two matching magazine extensions, lock, 
 cleaning brush, test shell casing and manual and warranty card. 

 Selling since I would rather have a 9mm pistol. 

 I wish to sale this within 50 miles face to face of Wake Forest, NC. 
 I will need a photocopy of your drivers license and conceal carry permit 
 or permit to purchase. I will provide a copy of my id's and bill of sale.

The Deluxe kit includes two barrells for the gun (3"" and 5""). I've never used the 5"" so that barrell is in NEW condition. Kit also has two magazines (10 rounds each)--one of which has extended pinky grip. Also includes cleaning rod, some cloth patches, magazine lock, etc. 

**NOTE: if you read online about this gun, people generally love it but are annoyed by a magazine locking mechanism that is designed to be a safety feature but in reality, is so confusing that it makes it less safe. There are various YouTube videos about how to modify the gun to fix this problem. Some involve cutting/removing pieces while others simply involve bending a small piece of metal. I have performed the bending modification on this weapon (I have NOT cut or removed any pieces). It works wonderfully and makes this firearm 1000x easier to use.

Hardly carried.  VERY CONCEALABLE

Very nice little carry weapon.  I have only carried it twice in this new holster and have shot less than a box of 20 through it.  Looks and runs excellent!  I have upgraded the grip by installing a brand new set of Talon Rubberized grips and the N82 Professional IWB holster is less than a week old and have only carried with it twice.  Absolutely the most comfortable IWB holster I have ever worn.  Cant is adjustable and it has a ""locking"" feature that you must give the weapon a slight inward twist to release.  You can't just jerk the thing out like some of the cheaper Kydex IWB holsters you see.  

I'm asking $500 for the entire package or will trade for a 3rd. Generation Glock 23.  I'm looking for a no frills, bone stock Glock.  No night sights, two 13 round mags.  And prefer the ""loaded chamber indicator"" extractor but wouldn't be a deal breaker if it was the old flush type.

Thanks for looking.  Happy Holidays and God Bless you.

PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner. The gases that flow through the tube inside the op-rod are expelled through the Manifold Injector System™ (MIS™) in the bolt carrier making it the cleanest running autoloading rifle in the world. The Rapid Deployment Stock™ (RDS™) reduces the overall length of the Tactical Target Rifle by almost 10-inches when the stock is folded. The unique 5-position sliding stock means that whether you are 5-foot 4"" or 6-foot 4"" the Tactical Target Rifle will fit you.Caliber: 5.56 Nato Barrel: 16.5 inches Chrome Lined Twist: 1 in 9 inches Action: Semi-automatic Receiver: Flat topped with full length Picatinny Rail Magazines: 1 - 30-round Overall Length: Stock Open and Fully Extended - 36 inches Stock Open and telescoped in - 33 inches Stock Folded - 26.25 inches Weight: 7.6 pounds Additional Features: Field strips with no tools, Multiple sling mount points."

This firearm is in nice condition. The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range.

Upper receiver clearly states on the exterior of the magazine-well:

Century Arms Inc
St Albans, VT
R1A1 Sporter 308 Cal
Made in USA

I don’t see IMBEL stamped anywhere on the lower receiver, or anywhere else. There is an “FN” stamped and what looks to be a type of symbol design on the barrel under the forearms but I see no numbers on the barrel. The number on the lower receiver starts with AD and does not match the CA serial number on the upper receiver. For the most part, the rifle is as I purchased it years ago.

The rifle is kept clean and comes with 2x 20-round inch pattern magazines and a shoulder sling. It has a Buffertech recoil buffer also.

This rifle is a good shooter. The gas system of the FAL is fitted with a regulator so it can be easily adjusted for various conditions, or cut off entirely. I usually find having to slightly adjust it for different ammo manufacturers.

Price is already reduced. You got to call me and come take a look.

This one is small enough to fit on pistols, or to use as backup for an ACOG or scope. The other one I have is on an AK-47 and it has held zero for hundreds of rounds. Battery life is also great on this little thing.

I would consider trade for a Lucid HD7 or other quality red dot."

Other info: I purchased the rifle 3 months ago. I'm selling to purchase the Ruger 22LR Tactical Autoloading. I've shot one box of Federal Match Grade ammo through the rifle (325 rounds). The rifle comes with original box, carry case, manual, one ten round mag, Leupold rail installed (I can remove if you want), and one box of Federal Match Grade (325 rounds). Please be advised, while I was installing the scope rail, the screw hole nearest to the barrel, I accidently over tightened, lol. I took the rifle to the gunsmith and he rethreaded, so that screw hole uses one size larger than the other screws, but you can't tell the difference. I just wanted to make the buyer aware. The rifle is like new in box.

The price doesn't include the scope(all installed and sighted in by gunsmith). If you want the scope attached, the Nikon P22 2-7x32 will be $150.00 additional dollars."

The Remington 700 claims to be the most accurate production gun in the world with sub-moa accuracy (less than 1"" at 100 yards) out of the box. The Remington 700 is a tack driver, you will not be disappointed.

This Remington 700:
- Bolt action - chambered in .223 caliber
- Varmint contour 26"" heavy barrel
- X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger 
- Hinged floorplate for quick unloading
- Synthetic black stock
- Original box, manual, lock, etc.

To this I have also added:
- Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40 scope with BDC (Bullet Drop Compensator)
- Hogue overmolded stock with channel pillar bedding in ghillie green
- Harris BRM Series S bipod adjustable between 6""-9""
- Bipod swivel lock
- DNZ 1 piece scope mount
- KRG oversized tactical bolt knob
- Buttstock cartridge holder
- Neoprene scope cover
- Quick detach sling
- Hard carrying case

After adding it all up, I have over $1,200 invested in this set-up. 
I will let go for $1050 for EVERYTHING!!!

I am NOT interested in trades at this time, I am only selling because I am buying a house and need down payment money. I will not separate any of the components - this is being sold as complete package only. Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area and show a valid Ohio driver's license for the sale.  

Thanks for looking!"

It's an amazing job & feels nothing like a standard Glock trigger. Super smooth and crisp with no grittiness or creep. It's unbelievably accurate. Comes with the original trigger hardware and the receipt for $195 & extras from Vanek. Also has a heavy, tungsten guide rod assembly, reducing recoil significantly; original guide rod assembly included as well. It has the ""plug"" installed on the grip for smoother magazine feeds. Comes with a total of 5 17 rd magazines, a 5.11 tactical holster w/paddle & belt attachments, an El Paso Saddlery leather holster & a Fobus 2-mag holster. Also the original box and everything that it came with it from Glock. I've put around 350-400 flawless rounds through it & I never have the time to shoot it anymore so I'm looking for something that I can carry. I have a valid Ohio concealed carry license, FYI. The Glock is kept immaculately clean and shows no wear whatsoever. I'm looking to trade, not pressed to sell, but I suppose $850 could take it. What I'm really looking for is a QUALITY, CONCEALABLE firearm & I'd prefer it come with, at a minimum, a concealment holster & ammo. I have plenty of quality hollow point ammunition to trade for yours, so it'll be fair. I don't want $700. I don't want $800. I'll take a revolver of less value with the extras mentioned so long as there's cash involved to even up the trade. I'm mainly looking for a quality, concealable revolver, like a S&W or a snubby Colt, or something comparable to those items. By ""concealable"" I don't mean a 4"" barrel; 2 1/2 or less for revolvers, please. I'd also be interested in quality, compact/sub-compact 1911's or 9mm pistols with the aforementioned accessories. Maybe you have something of equal value that I'm not even considering, so feel free to offer. If you see the ad, it's still available. If you're considering offering cash in the amount of less than $850, don't waste either of our time."
