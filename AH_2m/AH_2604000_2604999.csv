I took it to the range once with a total round count of 70 rounds through it just to ensure proper feeding. 1 box of Winchester FMJ and 1 box of Speer Gold Dot JHP's. Performed flawlessly! Comes with 450 brand new rounds of Winchester FMJ's. Gun was cleaned at the range by the gunsmith and has not been shot since. I paid $1150.00 plus tax for the firearm in mid January 2014. I will sell it all for $900.00 plus transfer fee at FFL within my general area. I do not ship firearms so please don't ask. Feel free to ask any questions. Thank You"

Please respond with name, email, and phone number or I will not respond!

All NFA laws apply.

The 22Sparrow is the first silencer in the world to offer the patented multi part containment (MPC) technology, which allows the 22sparrow to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use.

Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance.

Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

The Ruger SR9 9mm semi-automatic pistol is perfectly sized to be comfortable and controllable with a slim, ergonomic grip and narrow slide. Featuring a short reach from the backstrap to the trigger, the SR9 creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today. The structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frame and alloy or stainless steel slide combine to create a low-maintenance, rugged and reliable handgun. The SR9 packs all of the features required by today’s most demanding shooters, including modern blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

Very accurate and soft shooting.  A 25 WSSM has the ballistics of a 25-06 in a cartridge that will fit in an AR15- much lighter than a large frame AR10.  Great round for deer hunting, however you will enjoy it more if you are a reloader.  I have dies and brass to go with it."

SIG SAUER INC                Ambidextrous    
Sig Sauer 9389BRGAMBI P938 9mm SAO 3"" Ambi Safety 7+1 FR Mag Rubber Grip Blk
The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 offers the
ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to
the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size
Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet
is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938
easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in
finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO
trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the
1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes.

Make no mistake, the Beretta Xtrema2 set the standard for all autoloaders. Others tried to follow, but the Xtrema2 remains the choice of serious waterfowlers. The truth is that that no other inertia or gas autoloader can match the Xtrema2 for corrosion protection, reliability, recoil reduction, and simplicity of maintenance. In fact, the Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other autoloading shotgun on the planet. It will pound out shot after shot, season after
season—even generation after generation. No wonder that in the relentless pursuit of excellence, our engineers set the benchmark for a “do-it-all” shotgun with the Xtrema2: - Shooting Illustrated’s “shotgun of the year.”"

Slightly used, modified for IDPA ESP Steyr Mannlicher M9A1 9x19mm pistol.  Patented Trapezoid Sights, nine (9) 17-round factory magazines, paperwork.  If you've ever fired a Glock, you'll be impressed at the trigger on this Wilhelm Bubits designed Austrian pistol.  Firing stroke is shorter, trigger reset is shorter, its really got a sweet trigger system.   I am the original owner, have put 740 flawless rounds through this pistol.   The hollows at base of grip were filled in with gray MarineTex to make the grip one continuous contour.   Grip covered in 3M StairTread, I did a fairly crappy job but easy to remove.   BT Big Taco Grip Plug installed.   Blade-Tech RH OWB TekLok Kydex holster, G-Code double mag pouch, MidwayUSA padded pistol case with custom STEYR Logo.   The 7 extra mags cost $225, over $800 invested.  Asking $599 OBO"

The stock is an IWD stock made for the single tang rifle. The trigger group is a G2. The donor parts are from a milled Bulgarian ak 47 kit. This includes the upper and lower handguard, handguard retainer, the pistol grip, the cleaning rod, gas block, front sight post, and muzzle break. Muzzle was threaded to standard 14x1. I test fired about 15rds through the rifle only but no idea on the total round count on the gun but I suspect very low. Barrel is flawless and mirror shinny.. Easy fix if it is crooked but I have not shot this on paper. The donor parts were not refinished so the gun has a BFPU look about it which I really like.

 have a like new kahr cm40 with two extra mags. Two flush fitting 5 round mags and one extended 6 round. It also comes with a very nice (and comfortable) Galco leather strap on ankle holster. This is the smallest 40 on the market and is great for deep concealment. I really like this pistol and don't want to get rid of it. The only trade I would make would be for a full size pistol as I do not carry concealed. I would prefer to stick with .40 or .45, however, I am not opposed to the 9mm either on some guns. This gun has about 150 rounds through it so it is not even out of kahr's ""required"" 200 round break-in phase.

CM40- $450.00
2 mags - $50.00
Galco leather ankle ""glove"" is new for 90.00 on midway.com but I'll only price it at $50.00 even though it is practically new.

This rifle is in excellent condition and would make a nice addition to any firearm collector's arsenal.   This rifle has been in my family for generations and was handed down to me by my late Grandfather.   It has been a safe queen for years.   It was supposedly the first caliber to ever achieve 3000 fps hence the cartridge name.   You can still buy ammo for it online.   I believe Remington and Winchester still manufacture them.   It has also been known that certain collector's of the Savage 99 specifically seek out the ones that actually say ""250-3000 savage"" on the barrel making it more rare as opposed to just ""250 Savage"".   This rifle states ""250-3000 Savage"" on the barrel.  This also comes with an original vintage 4x Weaver Marksman scope.   Also included I have 144 rounds of 250-3000 savage ammo and 103 spent casings for reloading.   I hate to sell this family heirloom but I simply do not have any need for it and I just found out that I am losing my job so I have to do what I have to do.

The Colt Challenger (also known as the Woodsman Sport Model)is part of the Second Series and was made between 1950-1955. All the Woodsman's were manufactured by the American Colt's Manufacturing Company from 1915 to 1977. It was designed by John Moses Browning himself. The frame design changed over time, in three distinct series: series one being 1915–1947, series two 1947–1955, and series three being 1955–1977. The Second Series Sports Woodsmans, the Challenger model, unlike the Woodsman 6 1/2"" barrel model, has a spring catch at the butt and a C suffix to the serial number. The model number of this firearm is 36665C. Looking for following: Glock 26/27 Springfield XDS M&P Shield Kahr CM9 or CM40 Ruger LCR .22LR Just let me know what you got...."

The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies.

Holds 7+1 Rounds.

I love it to death but I have other things on my mind that I want to fund with the sale of this. This barely kicks compared to other shotguns I've played with. It sits always cleaned and lubricated with rem oil after every time I've shot it. Had less than 50 rounds of only 00Buck through it. Shoots straight. No issues. No slugs through it. It was my second of these, there is also a hunting version. Obviously if I didn't like it, I wouldn't have bought another. No wear marks whatsoever that I have found. Practically mint condition. 

Reasons to buy it:
-You have no 12 gauge shotgun.
-You want to add to your collection.
-You are a first time gun buyer/shotgun buyer.
-You want to look like a bad ass at the range and or hunting. 
-You want a shotgun with very few places to rust.
-You want a shorter shotgun.
-You want a great home defense shotgun. 
-You want to be able to mount a flashlight on the end of it. (yes it has a tactical rail at the tip)
-You want to mount a scope or red dot or some variant of an EOtech on it. (it also has a tactical rail on the top for mounting anything you'd like)
-You want to say things like SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND right before you blow the crap out of a target.
-You want girls all over you.
-You want people to ask what it is and where they can get one every time you go to the range.

Reasons you don't want it:
-You are a pansy.
-You like the Spice Girls.
-You idolize Richard Simmons.
-You are Richard Simmons.
-You are too weak to hold just under 7 pounds. 
-You prefer Tab over beer.
-You drive a scooter.

It comes with a shotgun sling that hold 15? rounds I think, and I have a blue maglight and an attachemnt that I will throw in. And I will also add some Federal 00Buck with it somewhere in the neighborhood of 30-50 rounds. 

Read about the model here.
http://www.remington.com/products/firearms/shotguns/model-887/model-887-nitro-mag-tactical.aspx

I am asking $450. I think it is a fair price. Not really looking lower considering that is what it is new without shells and the sling, sling attachments, and the flashlight, and attachment for it. Plus MSRP is $524 and the only one on here that I saw already is more than mine without anything with it.

Features: The AN/TVS-5 Night Vision Sight is a portable, battery operated, electro-optical instrument used for observation and aimed fire of weapons at night. It amplifies reflected light such as moonlight, starlight, and sky glow so that the viewed scene becomes visible to the operator. An eye guard prevents visible and infrared light from being emitted from the eyepiece. The AN/TVS-5 is presently the standard night sight for the M2 .50 Caliber and 40mm MK19 heavy machine guns.

The AN/TVS-5 can be tripod mounted for surveillance, however it is generally used in the Marine Corps as a crew-served weapon night sight. The sight comes furnished with the mounting bracket and reticle for the M2 machine gun. Brackets and reticles for use with other weapons must be separately requisitioned. A carrying bag and battery adapter for low temperature operations may also be requisitioned.

Background: The AN/TVS-5 was designed in the 1970s to provide a night fighting capability with crew-served weapons. It was procured during the 1980s and delivered to the Fleet Marine Forces upon receipt."

Extend the working life of your AK or AK type action i.e Seiga,etc. by using our 2 sided recoil buffer. We've sold thousands of these over the past 7 years with hundreds of return buyers. No special tools are needed to install the Key Hole/Dual Sided buffers. Make sure the firearm is unloaded! Step 1. Remove the receiver dust cover. Step 2. Take the recoil assembly out of the firearm. Step 3. insert the recoil assembly through the buffer. Step 4. Re-install the recoil assembly and Step 5. Replace the dust cover. Done! Less than 60 seconds to protect your investment. These are the only buffers that can be reversed to increase the life span of the buffer. Now you have 4 recoil buffers! Each side should give you protection for 500 to 750 rounds. Look at both photos and see 6 buffers.
