New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

WHAT BUYERS ARE SAYING:

I got a Colt 6724 weekend before last and I got the chance to go out and get it sighted in this weekend.

 WOW....

 Color me impressed.

 I mounted an old Tactical 4.5 X14 scope

It was only 100 yards but I was putting them into the same holes. I thought there was something wrong after I had it zeroed, I moved down the lower right side of the paper, pulled the trigger, aimed at the bullet hole and fired again. No change, fired a 3rd time, no change, fired a 4th time, no change. Well crap, am I missing the paper now completely? So I moved over about an inch and fired again, little bullet hole. So that got my curiosity up, I went down to look at the target and saw the hole had tiny little petals on it. 

 Man this rifle makes me look good. 

 My brother was there at the time, and I said, here take a couple of shots. Next words out of his mouth are ""What model is this again and how much did you pay for it?""

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

The Big Boy incorporates a top brass receiver, 20"" octagonal barrel, American Walnut stock, and 10 round magazine tube. 

 The lever action Henry Big Boy was introduced in 2001 as a .44 Magnum caliber carbine. It was widely acclaimed for its beautiful brass receiver, octagon barrel and smooth action. That year the Big Boy was awarded the Guns and Ammo ""Gun of the Year Award.""

 Select walnut stock, octagon barrel, mirror polished brass receiver, brass ""carbine"" style butt plate and brass forend/barrel band.

 Key features include a round breechblock, rear locking bolt, two piece firing pin, Marlin type ejector, side ejection, and solid top receiver. The mechanics of the lever system are very similar to a Marlin 336, including the lever plunger and trigger lock system that requires that the action be fully closed and locked before the trigger can be pulled.

 The modern Henry action uses a transfer bar located in the hammer face to keep the rifle ""safe."" The transfer bar positively prevents discharge unless the hammer is first fully cocked. That can be accomplished by thumb cocking if the chamber is loaded or working the lever action if it is not.

 The rifle automatically returns to a safe condition after firing or if the hammer is manually lowered. Be sure to remove your finger from the trigger as soon as the hammer is released, so that the gun cannot fire accidentally if your thumb should slip while lowering the hammer.

 Exceptional high grade walnut stock.

 WHAT BUYERS ARE SAYING:

 I got a Colt 6724 weekend before last and I got the chance to go out and get it sighted in this weekend.

 WOW....

 Color me impressed.

 I mounted an old Tactical 4.5 X14 scope

 It was only 100 yards but I was putting them into the same holes. I thought there was something wrong after I had it zeroed, I moved down the lower right side of the paper, pulled the trigger, aimed at the bullet hole and fired again. No change, fired a 3rd time, no change, fired a 4th time, no change. Well crap, am I missing the paper now completely? So I moved over about an inch and fired again, little bullet hole. So that got my curiosity up, I went down to look at the target and saw the hole had tiny little petals on it. 

 Man this rifle makes me look good. 

 My brother was there at the time, and I said, here take a couple of shots. Next words out of his mouth are ""What model is this again and how much did you pay for it?""

 Really looking forward to harvest when all the corn is out of the fields and the crows are down range!!"

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

Have researched this price and for the quality/condition of this shotgun it is at least $150.00 less than can be found anywhere, I have looked at what is at Vances, they are abused and cost $450+ also Cabelas are high $450.00 and also beat up.

339,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2913339,For Trade:  Tactical Collection for Fishing Boat,"cbreck781@yahoo.com, Omaha, Nebraska",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, April 7, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Hello,

I am looking to trade 4 guns and reloading station as a package deal for a nice fishing boat.   I value this package at $5-6 K and I am looking for a 1997-2003 Lund / Crestliner / Alumacraft / Smokercraft 16' Deep V Side Console steering Fishing boat.  I would want at least a 25 HP Motor.  I am not interested in a tiller model.   Other brands could work as well but these are what I am looking for.  Please don't send me junk offers.  

Here is what I am offering.  I just don't shoot these enough and would get more use out of a boat.  The AR's and accessories alone are very high end and custom built.  With the accessories they are worth 2 K each.

1. Custom .223/5.56 AR.  Wilson Combat 16"" Fluted Stainless barrel.  Henderson Defense NiB coated matched upper lower.  NiB BCG. MI Free float tube.  Eotech 512 Holo Sight.  Magpul goodies.  See Pic.  6 magpul PMAGS  about 200 rounds FMJ included.  40 rounds of Hornady Varmint.  (only 200 rounds down the chamber)  Sighted in at 50 yards. $2,000 trade value

2. Custom 6.8 SPC AR.  Wilson Combat 16"" Flute Stainless barrel.  CMT Tactical Brand new Desert Bronze matched billet upper/lower.  Leupold 3x9x40 Sight with Nikon AR 1 piece mount.  Fortis REV free float tube.  Magpul goodies.  See Pic.  Barrett 30 RD Mag.  5 round mag.  About 60 rounds of Federal 115 gr fusion included.  About 40 rounds down the tube.  Basically new.  Turned every head at the range.  Spectacular gun. $2,000 trade value

3. S&W MP Shield 40 cal.  Basically brand new with 20 shots fired.  2 mags.  Original box.  $450 trade value

4. Springfield XDS 45 cal.  Awesome gun.  6 Mags included.  My favorite gun probably seen 250 rounds. $600 trade value

About 100 assorted FMJ and Hollow Point rounds for the handguns

5.  Reloading bench with Lee challenger breach lock Reloader.  H335 powder.  Some bullets to get you started.  223 dies.  Sonic Cleaner.  200 or so Hornady V-Max 55 grain bullets.  Some primers.  Etc.  $500 trade value

This is the full package for someone wanting to get into the shooting sports.  2 great AR's and 2 great handguns.  Everything is basically new.  I bought it all new and have babied them.  Just don't get as much use out of them as I should.   The great thing about guns is they really don't lose their value....boats depreciate more every year.  I'm just ready for a change.

I have included a pic of the AR's.  Send me a pic of your boat and if I am interested I will send you more pics of the collection.

Thanks,

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. A dueling tree is also an excellent training tool that will help sharpen your shooting skills. The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50. You can email through the sight or call or text me @ 931-312-912two


Rimfire trees:
6 paddle = $200
8 paddle = $235
AR500 trees:
4 paddle = $275
6 paddle = $325

For an unbeatable deal, order one 8 paddle rimfire tree and one 6 paddle AR500 tree and get BOTH trees for only $475! You can't even buy 1 commercial AR500 tree for that price! 2 commercial trees like this would be well over $800.00! Who has that kind of money to waste? I know I don't!

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

I purchased this SD9 from a coworker that didn't use it much. He shot just 25 rds. My intention was to start going to IDPA functions with this handgun.

I have put less than 100 rds through it. Price is firm. It's worth every penny.

Restrictions apply in many jurisdictions on higher capacity magazines, so please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for ONE magazine, but buyers can get a better price 3 at a time.	Photos show specimens from a lot of several dozen Czech-made, factory CZ magazines that will fit and work both in the CZ82 Pistol, chambered in 9mm Makarov, and also in the CZ83 chambered in .380 ACP. Manufacturer is Czeska Zbrojovka of the Czech Republic. These were NOT imported, however, by CZ USA. Pistol and ammunition are Not included, of course. Construction is two piece welded steel bodies, with steel floorplate and spring detent, steel spring, and black polymer cartridge follower. Finish is brushed blue. Body back is ported to show every fourth round, as the photos show. Each magazine holds 12 rounds of 9mm Makarov caliber ammunition, or 13 rounds of .380 ACP caliber. These are made for CZ82 and CZ83 pistols, chambered either in .380 ACP or 9x18 Makarov calibers. They will not work in .32 Caliber CZ83 pistols, because the .32 ACP rounds will jump through their lips. Replacement pricing  on new CZ mags from CZ-USA com is in the $60 per vicinity. Our single mag price on ours is $35.00 each, but they’re cheaper 3 at a time. We’re offering them in lots of 3		 at only $26 each. Own 3	for only	$ 78.00.

NO NEW YORK CITY. Our #XM214980,  CZ Factory 8 Shot Magazine for CZ52 Pistols 7.62x25 32 Tokarev Caliber CZ-52 Blue Steel New & Unissued / This listing is for THREE magazines; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. New York City requires written permission from NYPD for magazine shipments. Here are genuine CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, factory magazines for the CZ52 pistols that are abundant throughout the Country and throughout the world. Manufacturer is the CZ parent factory that makes all CZ’s firearms, in Strakonice, Czech Republic. Construction is entirely blue steel, from the bottom of the CZ mfg marked floor plate to the stepped cartridge follower. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of 7.62x25 ammunition, a caliber we know and respect as the 32 Tokarev caliber. These magazines come to us well preserved and packed in grease, all brand new and unissued. Each magazine comes to us wrapped in its individual plastic bag, sealed in lots of 10 and shipped in cases of 250 magazines. These magazines fit only CZ52 Pistols chambered in 7.62x25 caliber. They will not fit the Yugoslavian Zastava M57 Pistols; will not fit the Polish Radom TT-30; will not fit .32 ACP caliber CZ pistols; will not fit the trunk key hole on a 1959 Edsel. They will only fit CZ52 pistols like the one we had last year showing, or partially showing, in some of our photos. All magazines for these fine pistols are in short supply; especially factory CZ mags like these. We only have a small lot of these, fewer than 1000 on hand at press time, and this is a one-time deal. Our friends in New York charge over $50 apiece for these magazines, and they’re sold out. Our Single Magazine price is $39.00. We’re offering these genuine CZ Czech Made CZ52 magazines in 7.62x25 caliber in lots of 3, however, at only $26 each. Own 3		for only $ 78.00.	Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission of the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10. Civilian residents of New York State are legally enjoined from loading more than 7 rounds into any magazine.

Winchester model 290 semi auto 22 rifle (Shoots 22 short,L,LR)
Shoots and cycles as fast as you can pull the trigger without jams. These are known for almost never misfiring or jamming.
Made from 1963 to 1976.
I believe this is an early 60's model> It is unique as it has a rear stock like that on a model 275 22 mag with the Fancy cap on grip area but yet the stock is checkered which is not typical on the rear of the 22 mags. It is a feature they usually quit putting on later models once sales take off, is that the case? I don't know, just a guess after being around guns a lot.

The rifle is of 1892-1895 vintage.  Item G-30269-1

The Winchester Model 1892 was a lever-action repeating rifle designed by John Browning as a smaller, lighter version of his large-frame Model 1886, and which replaced the Model 1873 as the company's lever-action for pistol-caliber rounds such as the .44-40.

When asked by Winchester to design an improved pistol caliber lever action, John Browning said he would have the prototype completed in under a month or it would be free. Within 2 weeks, Browning had a functioning prototype of the 92.[2] Calibers for the rifle vary and some are custom-chambered. The original rounds were the .32-20, .38-40, and .44-40 Winchester centerfire rounds, followed in 1895 by the new .25-20.[3] A few Model 92's chambered for .218 Bee were produced in 1936-38.  Admiral Robert E. Peary carried an 1892 on his trips to the North Pole.,[3] and Secretary of War Patrick Hurley was presented with the one millionth rifle on December 13, 1932.

although the company phased them out by 1945, they are still being made under the Puma label by the Brazilian arms maker, Rossi, by Chiappa Firearms, an Italian factory, and by Browning in Japan. In its modern form, using updated materials and production techniques, the Model 1892's action is strong enough to chamber high pressure handgun rounds, such as .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum, and .454 Casull. Despite being designed for smaller cartridges, the 1892's dual forward locking-block action is actually stronger than Browning's rear-locked Model 1894.
