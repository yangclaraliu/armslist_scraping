The combination of the SRT and the E2 take the old sig system and turn it into a Ferrari.   This gun is a pleasure to shoot and has one of the best DA/SA triggers I've ever used.  

It has 4 18 round mags and and I have more available as well.   It also includes a raven style pancake holster."

This rifle is in Excellent Condition and functions perfectly. I bought it on a whim two years ago and put 200 rds of modern non corrosive ammo thru it when I got it home and I haven't shot it since; I have no use for it, it just sits in my safe. I am selling to finance a new motorcycle, something I might actually use as I never use this rifle. You can read all about this type of rifle online, every review is positive and the gun is a ton of fun to shoot and ammo is cheap and readily available. Comes with the original steel 20 rd magazine and 3 brand new, never used still in the factory wrap high quality Tapco 20 rd magazines. Starting 1 Oct you will not be able to purchase any AK-47 type of rifle like this or any magazine that holds more that 10 rds in the State of Maryland, so if you are thinking about buying this type of rifle, this is a very cool, hard hitting, super reliable, easy to transport AK-47 type rifle that won't be available for much longer at any price, and I am offering it at a very reasonable price. Sale and transfer must be thru the gunshop I use in Brandywine, Precision Ballistics; he does a 8 business day Maryland State Police compliant transfer with a NICS background check; he has a store front operation with regular hours and is good to work with. I will pay for the transfer fee that he charges and the MSP background check fee out of my pocket, no cost to you, and there is no sales tax on this type of sale. If you have ANY kind of criminal record or are prohibited for ANY reason from owning firearms, please do not contact me about this rifle, and I will not do a 'strawman' or any kind of bogus sale; buyer must be legal Maryland resident or active duty military stationed in Maryland on official orders that I will have to see a copy of, along with a letter from your commanding officer attesting to your status. This rifle is clean, looks great, works great, is fun to shoot, and will only go up in value. Not interested in any kind of trade or counter offer; serious buyers only. Thanks for looking, pls email me with any questions."

    Several years ago I got tired of wearing a belt with a metal buckle that chipped paint on my classic cars, left creases in my expanding beer belly, rusted because us fat boys sweat a little bit more, chipped the finish off of the bedroom floor at night, set off the metal detector at airports, & became entangled in my climbing harness when I was scaling the north slope of Mt. McKinley.

    Well I just added that last reason to make you think I was in much better shape than I really am. Makes a great story though. Also I got very annoyed at the belts on the market that were two pieces of thin leather stitched together to make consumers think they were of adequate thickness to be a good belt (hogwash). Because after we pay 25 to 30 bucks for one of these supposedly adequate belts which after being worn for a month or so roll from the strain of us fat boys ever expanding waist lines (& my wife tells me I look like a pot roast with a string tied around it when I take off my shirt on the beach on the Riviera). Well at least I had on bermuda shorts & my ever faithful combat boots on, I wonder what she would say, if I had bought that thong at the duty free shop?

    Well none the less, I decided to put my leather expertise to work & design what I believe to be the best belt on the market today. Introducing (drumroll) Fat Boy Belts by Two Fools Leather Goods. These soon to be world famous belts are made from one piece of 10-12, or 14-16 oz. English Harness Leather. This stuff is used for Draft Horse harnesses surely it will hold up to a little strain from my expanding waist line. Over several years of testing & a couple of tweaks to the design on myself & several of my hunting buddies they are the only belt we now wear. Heck, I have even made them for skinny fellers who swear they are the best damn gun belts available. They haven’t chipped paint, left creases, rusted, became entangled in any climbing harness on my recent expeditions, (hey it makes the story flow), or caused any problems at the airport (other than a traffic jam when the nimrod TSA agent makes you remove it & all the other fat boys in line want to know where you found such an innovative, sturdy, & downright smart looking belt).That’s my cue to start handing out cards (which causes even more of a backup).

    Try one of my Fat Boy Belts & see for yourself why they are undoubtedly the best belts on the market."

3.3 XD-S™ SAFETY RECALL

Issued August 28, 2013
Technical Background          Get Started         Contact Us         Springfield-Armory.com
Springfield Armory® is initiating this voluntary safety recall to upgrade 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols with new components, which eliminate the possibility of a potentially dangerous condition. We want to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date.

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm and .45ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur.

What should you do?
STOP USING YOUR 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP PISTOL AND CAREFULLY UNLOAD IT! 

To begin the upgrade process and for fastest response, click on the Get Started link at the top of the page. On that page enter your serial number and click Next.  If your pistol is subject to this recall, you will need to provide your name, address, phone number, and email address.  The serial number is located on the frame beneath the dust cover (accessory rail).  If you prefer, you may initiate the upgrade process by calling REDACTED.  If you no longer own the 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol, please advise Springfield of the current owner.

XD-S Serial Number

What pistols are involved?
This Safety Recall applies only to:
Springfield 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm pistols - serial numbers between XS900000 and XS938700 
Springfield 3.3 XD-S™ .45ACP pistols - serial numbers between XS500000 and XS686300.

This Safety Recall does not apply to any XD® or XD(M)® pistols.

What will Springfield do?
Springfield will send you a return authorization and mailing label, allowing you to return your 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol to Springfield at no cost to you.  Springfield will upgrade your 3.3 XD-S™ 9mm or .45ACP pistol with the new components, and return it to you.  Springfield will provide tracking numbers so you can monitor the receipt and return of your upgrades.

Questions?
Visit www.springfield-armory.com for further information about this safety recall. You can reach the Springfield Armory Call Center at REDACTED.  Springfield apologizes for this inconvenience, but your safety is our paramount concern.

As you can see every part was selected for its quality. I enjoy building quality AR-15's as a hobby and don't try to make money off of them. I just sell them what I purchased the parts for and don't charge for any labor because I do it as my preferred hobby only (and stress reliever!). I imagine a build like this would run $2k+ if sold in a shop. I'm only asking what I paid parts minus all the shipping from various dealers. You can look up all the parts I've used and price it out yourself if you don't believe me. I built this intending it to be a quality lightweight milspec AR-15. I'm very pleased with it and won't mind keeping it. I just test fired its first shots today (9/2/13) and WOW let me say that I was surprised...this rifle is extremely accurate! I took 12 shots with XM193 military ammo to zero the sights at 25 meters. The photo of the last 3 shots I took to confirm zero is below. That is a very tight zero! I have also decided to add 800 rounds of Tula .223 ammo to the buyer for only $100 extra!! The ammo is only available with the sale of the rifle. I will not sell it seperately. If the buyer is not interested in the ammo I will be happy to shoot it myself haha. I'm sure you could easily sell the ammo for a lot  more if you wanted to make some of your money back. Please note that the ammo does not come in the ammo can. I will put it in a box or container of some sort. Let me know if you have any questions or picture requests. Thank you very much!

As some of you may have read this week, the Executive branch is considering using an executive order to eliminate the ability of Trusts, Corporations and LLCs from owning/ purchasing NFA firearms or making all trustees go through the same process as individuals ( getting prior CLEO approval). Now more then ever is a time to make an appointment or set up a phone consultation to see if a Gun Trust is something that  could benefit you and your family. At our Law office we can customize a Gun Trust to fit your specific needs as well as make sure that you are complying with all local, state and federal laws.

Imported by Action Arms the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. The guns were manufactured and fully assembled in Israel. Action Arms imported them as complete guns. You'll get the highest quality UZI Carbine you can get.

I also have 200 rounds of ammunition that goes with the gun, 100 are steel casing and 100 are current production brass reloadable, which is close to a $100 value.  The gun has all matching serial numbers and is in excellent condition.  The pistol was bought by me years ago in unissued condition and only 16 rounds have been fired through it to date.  

If interested, send me a message through Armslist and I will respond with my phone number.  I was excepting offers and getting some pretty shady low balling so, to bypass all the bs, the absolute lowest price is $300 and that is FIRM so please don't email me asking for a lower price.  I will only meet in the Dothan and surrounding area.

I will also entertain trades for other firearms, especially a lever action 30-30 since I have a youngster that is just getting into hunting.  

Any sale or trade of a firearm by me will require a valid and current Alabama Driver's License and Bill of Sale, absoultely no exceptions unless you are willing to pay an FFL Dealer to transfer it into your name.  I further reserve the right to decline selling it to any individual I feel is not legally authorized to own a handgun."

Comes with these extras:

3 extra factory magazines (5 magazines total)
Extra double mag holster (2 total)
Blackhawk Serpa holster with belt loop and paddle
G-code/Eagle Industries RTI holster (coyote brown). Sorry, does not come with any RTI adapters. 
Has light stiing done to the grip areas. I prefer this much over the factory grip for range shooting, but may not be ideal for IWB carry. If you plan to carry IWB you can lightly sand down the stippling and/or put some rubber grip decals over it. It does feel very solid when firing like it is and doesn't slip at all. 

Has a solid guide rod and Wolff recoil and strikyer springs installed to reduce felt recoil. Shoots as soft as the XD9 my dad has. I also have the factory springs and captive guide rod and will include them. This is one of the best shooting handguns I've ever owned, but I just got an HK and prefer it over the XD. I can't justify having two high dollar  full sized handguns.

Based upon the battle-proven SpecterDR design, the SpecterDR 1.5-6x provides higher magnification to enable greater precision and longer engagement ranges, while at the same time providing exceptional field of view in CQB mode.

The SpecterDR 1.5-6x enjoys ELCAN’s famous crystal-clear optics as well as a generous eye relief, making it the ideal instrument for designated marksman rifles and other long range applications. As with all SpecterDR sights, the magnification and field of view can be changed instantly with the throw of a lever. Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. Because the reticles are etched in glass, they are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP.

The SpecterDR family offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

Up for grabs I have a nice Mosin Nagant M44 and 91/30. Both rifles include the bayonet, cleaning rod, are in good shape, and are excellent shooters. The 91/30 is a 1942 model and the M44 is a 1946 model. Both rifles are numbers matching. I also have a spam can of 7.62x54r as well as a couple of extra boxes of ammo (480 rounds total). The ammo comes in an antique Smith & Wesson anti-riot grenade can. I will separate all three pieces if you are interested in only one. If you are interested please reply to ad or text me at 513-two-five-zero-5561. Cash only and local sales only. Prices are: $150 for the 91/30, $200 for the M44, and $100 for the ammo.

The Ruger Single Six is a single action rimfire revolver produced by Sturm, Ruger. The Single Six was first released in June 1953.[5]

The Single Six is currently produced as the New Model Single Six. The term ""New Model"" simply means that this model includes Ruger's transfer bar mechanism for increased safety, allowing one to carry the revolver safely with all 6 chambers loaded. Prior to 1973, the Single Six was produced without the transfer bar mechanism, making it less safe to carry with all six chambers loaded, and with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. The transfer bar safety allows the weapon to fire only when the trigger has been pulled. Ruger provides the transfer bar safety upgrade free of charge for owners of any old model Single Six, though this will lower the value for those in pristine, collectable condition.[6]"

Eight miles east of Medicine Bow National Forest.  Two hours from north suburbs of Denver.
I have developed 9 lots on over 300 acres. These lots range from 13 acres to 60 acres, and are perfect for those who just want to be left alone.  At this time there is only one occupied residence within 3 miles of the development.

Ideally, my neighbors would be like minded folks who are thinking for when the SHTF and in the meantime, appreciate a weekend get-away to shoot lots of guns and be close to hunting, fishing, skiing and snowmobiling which are 30 minutes or less away.

There is a long distance gun range up to 600 yards (longer if you want it) developed on site, with more to come! Roads built to all lots and power run to some. Prices starting at $1500/acre ... and can be very negotiable to the right buyer (neighbor). I can finance purchases.

I'm preferring to sell to folks outside of Albany County, Wyoming so that all owners have a 'destination visit' to their property. Hopefully, when you or I visit our property, there will not be things happening like a local company picnic at the gun range, or some kids being sent out to the property for the afternoon to ride dirt bikes all over the countryside, etc. etc. such as might be the case with local ownership.

And while there are deals on here still, they are far and few between.  This site used to be the first place I would look for stuff, unfortunately, it is now the last place.

Since the armslist community has give me some great guns at great prices, I have decided to give back. Below is a list of places to buy guns, ammo, parts.  All at the best places I have found online.  Trust me, I buy a lot of stuff and have spent a lot of time looking.  Im sure this will most likely get flagged quickly so make a copy.

Ak-47s - Prices ranging from $449 on Centurys to upper end AK's at $1400

http://www.atlanticfirearms.com/  can be a bit high but they have a big selection and killer deals about once a month

http://www.classicfirearms.com/ - Great descriptions by the owners, personally shoots each batch of guns that come in

http://www.grabagun.com  The best price on guns, can be hard to navigate and find the deals.

http://www.jgsales.com/  Good group of guys, they have really good deals on AKs

http://centerfiresystems.com/  Not a lot of discounts on this site but reasonable prices


AR's

http://palmettostatearmory.com/ - If you can match a lower to an upper, you can build a decent AR from them for about $600  By far the best AR deals on the web.  Guns, Optics and Parts

http://www.grabagun.com They are listed under AKs as well.  

http://www.ironsightsfirearms.com/ - These guys usually have a DPMS on their site for about $600 bucks

http://www.joeboboutfitters.com/ - Lots of AR deals and AR parts.  

http://www.kygunco.com/ These guys have a big selection and good prices.  Be warned, their shipping can take a week or so before it gets out of there.  Not good if you are not patient.


Ammo - The ammo prices on this site are just plain stupid.  Go to a deal site that lists live ammo listing and buy from there.  You can even set alerts.

http://www.gunbot.net/

http://wikiarms.com/

Parts and Deal Sites - If you are looking for BCG's, Parts kits, AR rebuild kits.  I use the following below. Good community and everything is searchable.

http://www.slickguns.com/


FFL Dealers - The place to have your Online guns Shipped to.  I personally use Chris at Inner Chamber Guns, mostly because he is close.  20 bucks and he is flexible when he can meet.  If you are paying more than $20, you are paying too much.
