This is a Springfield SAR-8 sporter made in Greece. This is not to be confused with the newer (and vastly inferior) SAR-8 sold by Springfield with the cast aluminum receiver, this is all steel receiver, and not some parts kit build. These are HK-91 clones made on HK tooling set-up by HK engineers, made by HK trained technicians at Hellenic Arms. These were imported by Springfield as SAR-3 for a while before being caught up in the early assault weapon ban. Springfield slapped a thumb hole stock on them, pinned and welded a non flash suppressor on them and overstamped the SAR-3 with an SAR-8. The quality on these is felt to be second only to HK since everything was set-up by them. Included are 3x 20rd steel magazines, 5x 20 rd aluminum magazines, and the original 5 rd magazine. This rifle does have some small handling marks but I would say it is still in very good condition. It has been kept in a safe and very well taken care of. I'm parting with it because my interests have changed and I need to make room for some other projects. TX drivers license and bill of sale required for transaction, prefer CHL.

Pretty firm on listed prices, I would prefer not to break up same ammo, and I do not have time to drive around delivering a box here and there. Preference will go to those wanting bigger quantities. You will pry have to come to me, I may be able to meet as far as Oly/Lacey area.  Please only contact me if you are a serious buyer, let me know exactly what you want and I can set it aside for a couple days only. If you would like it shipped to you that is fine too, I have no problem providing proof that I am not a 13 year old Nigerian girl. Actual shipping charges apply. I will set the ammo aside for you once you provide proof that check is in the mail. No games or bullshitters please, and I don't care about how much you paid for ammo X number of years ago or how you and your unemployed cousins waddle into walmart in your sweatpants and buy a box of Remington thundercrap every morning for cheap with your quest card. Thanks for looking.

Don't really have a need for it, just bought it because I could, don't really want to sell it but I'd rather have the cash instead at this time to help with moving cost.  I will gladly keep it if it doesn't sell & don't ""need"" the money so I'm firm on the price. If it does sell I will get another one just like it in the future after the move.   If you don't know anything about these scopes just research them online/youtube , they have great reviews and are a awesome advancement in night vision technology. 
   I have it for sale on ebay right now for $850+shipping...  If it sells on there I'll clear a little over $750 after ebay & paypal fees.    I'll sell it for $750 cash local, which is better as you can see it work before buying it. Price is firm. They are still over a grand new right now.

The M1001Military trailer is brand new and never used by the Army. It was found in a Military warehouse in Ga and bought at auction. The price tags are still on it. This one is very rare as the ones with the enclosure seem to get lost. The enclosure is also brand new and had the stickers on it. The trailer body is aircraft aluminum and the frame is built like a miltary trailer should be. It is impressive. It pulls great and has the same ground clearance as the truck.

You must secure a current FFL in your State of residence and in your area for us to ship the firearm to. I will only ship this firearm to an FFL. I will need a legible copy of his FFL with dealer ID, signature and expiration date. If I can't read it or it is not clear and legible I will not ship the firearm. Please have them put the buyer/owners full name, home address, home phone number, and his information on the FFL for our records and so I can match the buyer to the FFL and to the firearm.

I am a Federal Firearm Licensed Dealer. You must abide by all Local, State and Federal Laws and it is YOUR responsibility to know your local laws before buying. Not my responsibility! There will be a 25% re-stocking fee if the firearm cannot be delivered as agreed on any canceled or returned item after payment.  Shipping will be paid to and from by you accepting the firearm and on any return firearm.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out. Your payment, by cash, Personal Check, Certified Check, USPS Money Order, and now we accept Credit Cards as well. I wouldn't recommend cash but if you must send cash, go ahead. Personal Checks must clear my bank and I will not ship until I get confirmation your check has cleared, usually about a 10 day wait after deposit. Certified Check must also clear but usually shorter wait time. USPS Money Order must also clear but usually very fast. All major Credit Cards are accepted, but you must call me to give me your CC information, number, expiration date, CCV and Name on the card. There is a 3% up-fee/surcharge on Credit Cards on the full amount including shipping but as soon as the funds show up in my account I will ship. Usually about 24 hours.

Your payment is due in our hands or account within 7 calendar days after you agree to buy.  NO excuses, NO extensions accepted. Call me or e-mail with your information. If you do not pay within the 7 days as agreed I will re-post this firearm.  Your call or e-mail will not change this. Shipping and handling charges for Longuns, Rifle, Shotgun etc. are $38.00 to the lower 48 States, and Alaska is an extra $10.00.  ., firearm will be shipped UPS Ground with a signature required on all firearms. Insurance and other shippers are optional and may cost extra.

The name of my company is ""Gid-R-Dun Rod and Gun"" and we will Gid-R-Dun!

Please if you cannot or will not pay on time please don't tell me you will.

Also note that we will provide prompt service and ship as soon as the funds confirmation allows us to do so. I will attempt to ship within 2 business days after your payment is confirmed and I have a legal FFL in my hands and I have verified his FFL.

We reserve the right to end this sale early at any time if there are no inquiries or e-mails regarding this sale.  If you want to buy this firearm please let me know ASAP.  The first person to contact me has the first right of refusal.  I will only take this firearm off the site when I have money in hand for the purchase.  Only then will the firearm be taken off our shelf waiting for your payment to clear. This firearm will remain on our ""For Sale"" shelf until that time. Please ask all questions before buying. My name is Brad, REDACTED or e-mail me at REDACTED

I support the NRA and so should you. Membership is $35.00 for one year.  I can sign you up for one year for $25.00 and I'll pay the extra $10.00 for the one-year subscription. We need the NRA more than ever right now so I urge you to join if you are not already a member.

If you don't want to lose your gun rights and you don't want more Government CONTROL, and you want to be able to buy guns and ammunition, and you want your gun stores to stay in business, - JOIN THE NRA!!!  Let's vote them out of there, and ""God Bless America""
If you live in Washington State you will have to pay 8.6% Sales tax, on top of everything else. You can come into my shop and buy direct and save the shipping if you live in Washington State but read everything above.  You will need to fill out a form 4473 and pass a background check if you want to come in and buy direct.

I will not ship anything anymore to CA, MD, Hawaii, DC, NY, NJ, MA, Colorado or Connecticut now, or some cities in Illinois. Not my problem that you live there. If you want this firearm it is your responsibility to know the laws of your area, local, City, State or Federal. If this firearm is illegal for you to own in your area, you will be charged a 25% re-stock fee if your FFL Dealer cannot transfer to you. Not my problem. You will pay shipping to and from.  Thanks for looking!

The most desirable for me is a plain jane luger. Now, I know how much they can go for, I'm not looking for anything extravagant by any means. I just want something that functions and can be worked with. Light pitting, worn off bluing and destroyed grips are fine by me as long as the gun functions and fires safely. Barrel lengths, make, production year don't matter to me here.

I also really like the CZ family of pistols, especially the CZ52 and the CZ75B. I won't shell out a lot of money for a CZ52, but I'd be willing to spend some decent money on a 75B with target sights. I've shot both and like both in their own way.

A Walther P38 is kind of a long term dream because of the price. Elegant and well balanced pistols are top notch and I know beat up ones still sell for a decent price. Let me know what you have, I'm just listing these three as a go to for ideal business. I'm always interested in oddball guns and different and fun things. Depending on the condition of the handgun, is what will ultimately determine what it's worth to me. Trying to keep this at $500 max. Thank you!"

A mil. spec. tactical binocular with reticle, which can be used in conjunction with a variety of mil. dot or other reticles and riflescopes. This is the model used by many law enforcement and special operations units (they discourage us from telling you which ones), so let's just say these binoculars are ideal for many tactical applications under extreme conditions, especially if you're constantly on the move. This 6 x 30 is lightweight, compact, and fits easily in a coat pocket; brilliant optics deliver excellent performance in low light, and at only 18 oz., their nighttime or low light performance is truly impressive. They would be great for military use, survival, hunting, bird watching etc. The 6x30R gives you a wider range of view and better light gathering at night.

The wooden grips add tremendously to its aesthetic appeal and an ambidextrous design is one of many features. 

From the Taurus website, I am pasting the following...

""In 1980, we purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. With the model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.""

The features listed below really do make this a remarkable piece:
  Loaded Chamber Indicator
  3 Position Safety Decocker
  Taurus Security System (TSS)a
  Ambidextrous 3-Position Safety - Features Positive dentents for SAFE, FIRE and DECOCK
  Decocker Lever

I took this in on a trade and am not sure if I want to do the ""AR thing'' anymore.
I'm not desperate to get rid of it, and haven't shot it.
If you look at the specs, they're sub MOA guns due to the Wilson Arms barrel and the 2 stage trigger is great. These have the. 223 Wylde chamber to handle 5.56 and. 223.
It had BUIS..maybe Midwest Industries.
I do not have the original stock or pistol grip.
It does have a short RRA quad rail and Tango Down foregrip.

I do have some magazine repair kits and about 150 rounds available for the right deal.

I can send better pics on request.

It has exactly 300 rounds downrange according to the previous owner and the BCG condition would match that assertion.

It has around 200 rounds fired through it. It runs like a sewing machine with all types of .223 and 5.56. This rifle features a Tapco buttstock and pistol grip, and a Chaos US quad rail up front. It has been properly converted using a Tapco G2 fire control group, and a Tapco pin retainer plate. It also has a bullet guide installed, so it can run the more common Galil magazines. I cannot remember the exact barrel twist because it is in metric, but it comes out to about 1:8.5''. The bbl is chrome lined as well as the gas block. Though this rifle says .223, it is actually chambered for 5.56x45. Due to importation restrictions, the Saiga .223s which are all chambered in 5.56 are marked .223 to pass the restrictions. This rifle comes with a soft carrying case, 2 30 round Saiga .223 mags from SGM and 1 factory 10 round mag. The mags have been modified to work with the bullet guide.

It's been drilled and tapped otherwise it could easily go back to military configuration.

I recently bought this, disassembled and cleaned it, but haven't had a chance to fire it yet. I haven't looked that closely to see if it's numbers matching. It has a correct S.C. barrel dated 6-43 and it's in very good condition. It cleaned well and it's looking pretty nice. A bit more work and it could be excellent.

The Parkerizing is great with only a few marks. It's so nice that it could either be barely used or re-parked. 

It has a Buehler low profile safety to accommodate a scope. The scope, mounts and rings are included. I can't find a name on the scope, but it's period correct. It's a bit rusty and shows evidence of use, but it seems like pretty good glass. 

I'm pretty sure the front sight blade is a replacement. 

The stock is nicely done. All I did was clean it and oil it. However, the buttplate was under a slip on recoil pad for too many years and was very corroded. I cleaned it up, but it's ugly. 

To sweeten the deal, I'll throw in a couple of spare parts ""survival kits"" from e-Sarco.

This upper has the 5r rifling that SW did before they decided to cut costs and stick to standard 1/7. The following is also included: 

1.7 AR15 magazines (One magpul pmag and six GI style magazines)
2.AR15 Armorers Tool
3.Wolff Extra Power Buffer Spring
4.AR Extractor Donut Rings
5.DPMS Field Repair Kit which includes Extractor, Firing Pin and retainer pin, Extraction spring, Hammer and Trigger springs, disconnector and ejector spring.

8.Spare trigger guard
9. Scope riser 
10. NC Star Mark III 2-7-32x Mil Dot Scope
11.One point sling
12.Chest Rig

Some of these items are doubled up so you'll be getting two of each. Basically your getting key components besides a spare bolt/carrier.  The rifle itself has seen 270 rounds through it.  It eats steel and brass like candy. The F93 Stock I like especially as it balances the gun out and is sturdy as heck. The upper lacks a forward assist and dust cover sticking to the traditional design which is still offered on some models like colt.  See reviews on them to get a better picture. 

 Feel free to check prices and especially the reviews, I know truth about guns had a good article on SW M&p 15 sport were they ran complete and just the upper. Its a real workhorse and no feed issues I am getting rid of it to put the revenue towards an engagement ring, not because its a piece of junk. 

Note if you have a range by I would be more then happy to let you test it out. I am not looking for any trades at this time.  I am an IL resident who frequents Wisconsin a lot due to friends and family however I am an IL resident. If from IL you must have a foid card etc. Again I abide by all state and local laws so please do not email me asking otherwise. I have sold on here before.

This is a great package for a new gun to CCW or IDPA/IPSC competition.

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

The gun's condition is about 90%. There is minor holster wear and a couple of small dings. There is no rust at all, and it is kept extremely clean and always fired well lubed with Slide Glide. 

I also am including 9 magazines! Each magazine is a 12rd magazine, and each magazine has BRAND NEW Wolff extra strength springs in them. With these springs the mags are like new!

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! High Noon offers an option that is on this holster called ""lining"", and it is basically a synthetic lining that is super slick and reduces holster wear. It also has water repellant properties.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster . It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

Finally, I will include two boxes of Federal self defense JHP ammunition just to sweeten the deal.

I was originally asking $1,100 for this package - but I want to get this thing sold. I am now only asking $975! With my asking price this low, I am firm on the price."

My Wife just bought them for me 3 days ago, and gave them to me early for Christmas. I had finally got around today to put them on my rifle and just wasn't liking how it looked on my rifle. My rifle is mid range as you can see in the picture, and I just don't have the room on my rails for that much stuff. Even if I was to put just the red dot, I still didn't like the way it looked. So, with my wife's approval without hurting her feelings, she gave me the go ahead to sell them.
I am selling them both for $250 my wife paid $300 for them both, and she bought them off armslist used. So there's no box, manual or anything it originally comes with. They both work flawlessly, but just not for me. You can reach me at REDACTED any time day or night. Best offer gets it, and would like to sell as soon as possible. Thank you for looking and Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.

High Standard 107 Series Model Supermatic Trophy .22 LR target pistol.
HS Cat. #9247 ... Manufactured in 1975 in their Hamden ,Conn. facility in the original ""Hartford Arms and Equipment Company the LAST year they were made.. The last known serial# made was 2,500,810.. THIS one's Serial # 2,500,709...  SO IT DOES NOT HAVE ""MODEL"" or ""107"" STAMPED ON IT,  just  "" MILITARY "".. and it does have the tiny proof mark stamp on the underside of the barrel.  I can provide you with documentation from the factory that we have from High Standard Owners Society on the reason they were stamped this way and the importance..
Dad orderd 3 of these directly from the factory ( consectutive serial numbers ) in late 1974 an was told we would'nt get them untill 1975 and they would be 3 out of the last 100 made,,, WE used 2 of them for small bore pistol matches and this was our 3rd one (this one) that we RARLEY USED, just shoot 10 rounds thru it before every match to make sure it was perfectly sighted in and ready to be used as alternate (backup )...
It has a 5-1/2 inch serrated top heavy bull barrel with target crown  chamberd for 22 Long Rifle,  Match Target adjustable sights, Oversized original checkered grips with right hand thumbrest, front push button takedown to remove barrel for cleaning or instantly swap to a 22 short, Rutledge or any other of the many many barrels High Standard and Custom shops made that you want, Barrel is drilled to accept weights (we never used them) and the original screws are in the holes..
Serrated Gold Adj.Trigger, Gold Safety,  Gold Mag release, Lower front and back of frame grip areas have factory stippling thats not worn at all..
Bore looks like a mirror with clean sharp rifleing.  The blueing is probably Better than Excellent!...I cant find any pitting from any rust..  The only light spots where the blueing is starting to get slightly thin is on the REAR OVER SIZED TARGET SIGHT, and thats just from being in a case soooo many years riding to and from shooting matches.
It does come with the Original 10 round ""green"" follower magazine.
I did take it outside and put a full mag (10 rounds) thru it two times. Its still got its tack driver accuracy and I shot a second mag thru as fast as possible with no malfunctions.

In the last 2 months Ive seen EIGHT Model 107 Supermatic Military Trophy models Sold online.. Some auction some here...  SELLING prices  ( what it atually SOLD for ) I have seen slightly lesser condition but same model go for $450 - $699. ,,MUCH worse condition with a non bull barrel go for $350-$400,,, AND slightly better condition up to NEW OLD STOCK condition go for $600 - $1100 ..

I want at least $450 CASH ( Plenty of meat left on the bone ).. 
Im willing to Listen to partial trade offers BUT not at $400 value..  


They desgined these so well if you didnt hear the sound you would never know you fired it, they sit perfectly in your hand and dosent move when you shoot it.
As fas as how many rounds we put thru it I'm really not sure, I'm guessing close to 150-200,, but less than 260..

I can take more pictures if you would like and send them to your Email or a cell phone.

You MUST have to a State ID with picture, and I will make a ""Bill of sale"" Stating that YOU HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE of ANY reason that you cannot Purchase , Own & Be in possesion of a hand gun as set forth by Federal and Tennessee laws... Basically covers me selling it..

REA delivery people were supposed to be the modern day Ranger saving people’s businesses by their rapid deliveries and would leave this cartridge behind as a momento of their efforts.
