3X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.
The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

Up for your consideration is a very nice Pepsi/Dr. Pepper Pop Machine Gun Safe. Rest assured your guns and ammo sit in your man cave fully secured and hiding in plain sight. 

This safe is custom built, fully carpeted with grey carpet, and has a barrel rack for 14 long guns. Pistol area holds 2 pistols comfortable.

Inside dimensions = 15"" Deep x 27"" Wide x 46.5"" Tall.  
Ammo compartment dimensions = 22"" Deep x 32"" Wide x 13"" Tall. 
Outside dimensions of machine = 24"" Sides x 32"" Wide (front & back) x 64"" Tall


The safe is very well built, incredibly sturdy with lock and key.  It is equipped with two - 5 LED light strips that really light up and show off the quality inside. The outside and inside has been cleaned. I installed a new light to light up the front of the machine. Machine has been lined with carpet. I have built and installed a custom rifle rack that has the capacity of holding 14 long longs and an area that houses 2 pistols. I added compartments on the right side of the rifle rack for more storage. The button labels and labels on the back and sides of the machine are the original ones. The lower level can be used to store ammo. The lower level also can be filled with sand/concrete to add additional weight or the machine can be bolted down to your floor for security. This safe is strictly a theft deterrent. I did not install any fire, or flood proof protection. A lot of time, work and money went into this safe and it is very nice looking. I’m asking 800.00. Email with any questions. Thanks"

We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Comes with the instruction manual, cleaning rod, pistol, and one magazine although additional magazines can be had for cheap on places like gunbroker, ebay (it's under their 10 round limit), etc.

This would be a GREAT concealed carry pistol, particularly useful for smaller/thinner framed men and very popular with females as it's accurate, easy to shoot, uses affordable ammunition, and isn't something that's going to, based on recoil, cause the user to develop a severe flinch reaction.

This particular pistol is in absolutely MINT condition, the bluing is very bright and shiny.

I have a Hogue wraparound rubber grip available for an additional $15 if you're interested.

This is the equivalent of the Bulgarians you'll see listed here from time to time.  It's superior to the Hungarian and Polish Makarovs in that the frame is steel (the Hungarian isn't) and the trigger pull is even, consistent, and doesn't require a lineman's grip strength the way the Polish versions do.

Cash sale, not interested in any trades at this time, face to face.  I live in the northwest Milwaukee 'burbs and I'm willing to drive up to 20 miles to help make this happen.   You're legally old enough and eligible to purchase a handgun in Wisconsin, I'll need a quick glance at your driver's license to confirm age if it's not obvious.

Send me an email, we'll go from there and thanks for looking.  I promise you that you won't be sorry for purchasing this fine example of a useful handgun."

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish.

 This rifle has a low round count less that 200 down range.It was broken in with 20 rounds and cleaned with copper remover after every shot as well as a full lube after every shot. Then shot very little after that. All of the pictured accessories will be included and roughly 140 rounds of .223 ammo. This is a amazing rifle and I have had so much fun with it. I was going to use it to coyote hunt but it is just a toy now so I am making room for a new project. Priced at 1000$"

This is a very well made pistol that is a clone of a Jericho 941 / Baby Eagle compact, which is itself based on the CZ 75 design.  I have fired about 150 rounds though it and it shoots very well.  DA is a little heavy, but the SA is great.  However, I miss having a rail on my pistol, so I am going back to my Beretta 92A1 as a house gun.

The only flaws are:
Two slight indents and finish wear on the front of the trigger guard.  This is from a clamp on rail (I won't ever do that again!).
Don't know if to call it discoloration or just a change in reflectivity, but there is a very slight change in appearance on a couple spots on the grips where the plastic didn't like the gun cleaner I was using.  It is too slight to show up in the pictures.

I have priced this very low to reflect the trigger guard.  Price is firm."

Trades welcome .....Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HK’s line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters—in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted. Features: Tough, light weight, corrosion proof polymer construction Molded-in hard points for mounting accessories Accessory Picatinny rails for easy mounting of optical sights, lights, and aiming devices Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation Easy disassembly for simple cleaning and maintenance Ambidextrous safety/selector lever Open, skeletonized buttstock for better grip Oversized trigger guard for easy operation while wearing gloves Sixteen inch cold-hammer forged target barrel Rubber cheek rest and buttstock recoil pad Polymer 10-round magazine Lifetime warranty Please Note: This description may represent a general group of products.

 (To estimate out the door pricing multiply the cost of the item by 10% and add $10. This will allow you to estimate the cost including tax and tics. For example an item which costs $100 in Tennessee will cost about $110 when tax is added. The State of Tennessee charges each time the TBI is used to run a background check. The background check is mandatory in Tennessee to purchase a firearm from a dealer. So a firearm which costs $100 will cost approximately $120 with tax and tics.)

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M2features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches"

867,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2192867,For Sale/Trade:  Leupold Base and Rings (Remington 700),"Springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 50,"Listed On: Sunday, March 30, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a Leupold one piece base for Remington 700 Long Action rifle. This one piece base is for a right handed rifle and is the most stable base you can get. It has the rear windage adjustment screws to help zero in your scope without maxing out your scopes adjustment. 

The rings are a ""low"" profile. The front ring is a dovetail and the rear has the windage adjustments.  They are for a 1"" tube. 

This scope set up is one of the strongest and most stable systems out there. 

They idiot who had it mounted when I bought the rifle had stripped out one of the base screws so I had to have it drilled out. There is no damage to the base but it is missing a base screw. I know that most gun smiths have extras laying around and they will just grab a new one when you have the scope installed. I would recommend ""The Shooting Den"" for installation. 

I might consider splitting the rings from the base if you need different rings or you want the rings to put on a two piece base.  These pieces are over $40 separate. So by the time you pay tax and all that it runs you $100 just for base and rings. I'll cut that in half with no waiting.

It has been parkarized (all save the mag tube) it has an xpress rear ghost ring, top rail and front sight installed.  The stocks have had the checkering filled in and smothed, then painted with marine paint (black) and resealed.
Twice in the last year the gun has had the ""marlin jam"" happen to it.  Once while shooting .357 and once with 38's.  I have taken it to a gunsmith after the first time and it was determined that it was working fine.  It shot great for awhile after that but after a few months did it again. 

That is too much for me and I no longer want the gun as we cannot seem to get along.  Like I said its not perfect but when it does shoot its a dream.  Perhaps someone with more lever gun know how or paitence than me will find it to be perfect.
All prices and trades are negotiable.

**update**. I have recieved some offered and in considering them I realized that
A.  I don't really want to outright sell it. Don't need the $ so it doesn't really appeal to me
B.  I will only trade it for a 10/22, a smith J Frame, a LCR, lc9. I may consider others but they need to be along those lines. No other 22 rifles though. Would consider and add to my rifle if someone has a 77/357. 
C.  I would really prefer to deal fairly locally and in MN

I think he just like to look at it and clean it. He bought the rifle many years ago and added the scope later. My son know he sighted it in at 200 yards with Remington Core Loft ammo. My son said they built this gun one year and it is the same as a Weatherby and his dad adjusted the trigger to shoot easier but it can be adjusted harder if you want. He also said it was super accurate. We think my husband paid $3,000 for this big scope. 2.5X10x56 Schmidt and Bender. Walnut stock with pad. Case looks new too. (P.S. I have have tons of emails asking if I will sell the gun separate and/or asking if I will sell the scope separate, so I am going to take out 2 separate listings today with each separate, the gun for $500 and the scope for $2000)"
