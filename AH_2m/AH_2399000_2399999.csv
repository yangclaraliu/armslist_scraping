One thing about this 1911, and I have heard about other 1911s, it doesn't like Hollow point. I've only trade it with reload HP, other than that, I've always used FMJ. It seems the HP rounds are just a tad longer, and that does prevent them from chambering properly.

This gun throws lead downrange with no issues and shoots anything you want to put through it. I have shot around 400 rounds through this pistol with no problems. It is accurate and the rifling in the barrel is perfect. The gun has been cleaned thoroughly after each time at the range. This DA / SA pistol trigger, hammer and decocker/thumb safety work perfectly. Great gun to shoot. Will throw in some defensive rounds if price or trade is right. Comes with original case and mag. Reason for selling is that it has become a safe queen.

I had this put together with very fancy wood and a hastings barrel and am forced to part it out to minimize my losses. Great Condition with only one small scratch on the top just in front of the scope base. Let me know if you have any questions thanks. asking 275 or best offer

I have qty 101 30.06 rounds .  My research found these are Austrian surplus manufactured in 1961.  A number of people say these rounds are loaded hot and actually made for machine guns.  I have found far more who say it is specifically for the M1 Garand and I could not find anyone who said they had an issue firing it though the M1.  Since the box says ""GM 1"", it is pretty clear it is indeed for the M1 Garand.  Unfortunately, I do not own an M1 so I cannot speak for this ammos performance from that weapon.  If I had an M1, I probably would not risk using this ammo due to the value of the weapon vs. the small expense of this ammo.

What I can say is I have put at least 100 rounds through my bolt action 30-06 without a single issue so if used in a 30-06 I know you are fine.  They produced a very tight pattern at both 100 and 200 yds.

Beautiful Spiral Fluted 14.7” Barrel (16.1” total with flash hider)

Color: Anodized Black Caliber: 5.56 NATO/.223 Rem.
Here is a Brand New in Box LWRC IC-SPR. Just arrived from the factory. This carbine has longer handrails and a self adjusting piston system. The previous IC had a shorter handguard and a 2-position manually adjusting piston system. Both rifles come with fully ambidextrous lowers and the same barrels. The new IC-SPR has the handguard mounting coupling forged into the upper receiver, whereas the previous SPR had the coupling bolted on.

This rifle has a Beautiful 14.7” Spiral Fluted Barrel. The barrel not only looks good, but the fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel. LWRC’s fluting also relieves the stress caused problems seen in conventional fluting. LWRC rifles and carbines utilize cold hammer forged barrels made of 41V45 steel alloy (per Mil-B-11995E) and treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology. The total barrel length is approx. 16.1” with the permanent A2 Birdcage flash hider.

The barrel has a NICOR treatment which extends barrel life to over 20,000 rounds. It has the LWRC Fire Control Group with the one-piece Fail Zero coated bolt carrier and trigger.

The rifle has a six position adjustable stock, front and rear flip up sights, Magpul MIAD pistol grip and LWRC rail system with full length top rail. The piston system is self-adjusting. Bottom and side rails are included. Also included is one 30 PMag magazine (Gen M2 - 30 round), front sight adjustment tool, and owner’s manual.

All members of the IC family feature the new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left-handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight."

Chambered in the hard-hitting 40 S&W, The FNS™-40 offers the simplicity of double-action striker-fired operation with the additional security of a manual safety.

Three-dot night sights are standard with the innovative Deep-V rear sight notch for faster, more precise sighting. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel with front serrations, while the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps and lanyard eyelets.

I used these gloves once and then washed them and stored them away. They are a size LARGE. The only reason that I am selling them is because I found some other gloves by the same manufacturer that I like better. So these have to go for now. These offer the highest puncture resistance (needle stick) and cut resistance of any glove on the market and are totally machine washable.

Best Needle, Puncture, and Cut Protection for Police Officers

TurtleSkin Search Gloves provide superior protection from sharp threats like needle sticks, puncture, and cuts.

Made with an advanced, patented protective material in the palm of the hand and fingers, these gloves are made for high-risk contact and search situations.

TurtleSkin Search Gloves provide eleven times more protection than typical police gloves against 28-gauge hypodermic syringes — the needles used by many drug addicts.

Rugged TurtleSkin materials provide injury protection on the front of the hand, fingers, and fingertips as well as complete coverage of the index finger, with a soft, comfortable leather backing.

The leather exterior is machine washable.

Best Needle Puncture Protection
The patented TurtleSkin fabric in the palm provides 11 times more protection than ordinary police gloves against 28 gauge hypodermic needles -- the type of needle used by most drug addicts. As thin as 3 sheets of paper, TurtleSkin needle resistant Search Gloves are more comfortable and puncture resistant than thick protective gloves. I paid 86.00 for these when they first came out.

The contour of the rifle is no longer noticeable and therefore the camoflage, perfect! For us humans, the colour strikes the eye, ensuring maximum safety during driven and social hunts.Incorporating innovations that raise the standards for quality and performance, the Blaser rifles mark the beginning of a revolution in bolt-action design. In fact, these rifles represent the first truly new concept in bolt-action rifle design since the bolt-action idea was first introduced. Foremost among its breakthrough features is its fast, smooth, straight pull bolt movement. Unlike conventional bolt actions, you operate the Blaser action by simply pulling the bolt to the rear and pushing it forward, with no lifting. Its faster, smoother and less likely to affect your aim for the next shot."

I am selling a barely used, all blued, Springfield XD9 Tactical. This is not an XDM and has 2 factory 16 round magazines. This also has the longer 5” barrel.

I am asking 480.00 in cash. I know this is not a bargain basement price but if I start at my “take” price, it gives me no wiggle room to make the perfect deal for both of us. I take care of my stuff and it is in really nice shape.

No holds please, unless a non-refundable payment is made.

I don’t want to deliver this but am in Wichita once or twice a week. FTF transaction only.

If you don’t like my price, make me a reasonable offer.

I have an extra 16 round magazine that I will throw in for a total of 500.00 and 500 rounds of Herters Brass FMJ for a total of 635.00. These are not for sale separately, unless the pistol sells."

Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome lined using techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.
Vepr Super in .308 Win caliber features a front sight / gas block combination and a fluted barrel with greater surface area for more effective cooling. The venting at the tip of the RPK style barrel acts as a built-in muzzle break and also created a look unique to the Vepr Super rifle. The furniture for this firearm is a solid piece of precision shaped walnut that runs the entire length of the body, ending at the foregrip. A unique feature to this particular firearm is the ambidextrous magazine catch release for ease of use for any gun enthusiast. Unlike an AK or the standard Vepr rifle, there is no scope rail attached to the side of the receiver. Instead, there is a rail system built into the receiver directly, just above the fire control group and below the top cover. A scope mount (not included) can be attached to this rail system."

WARRANTY INFORMATION •	Lifetime Fire Guarantee (manufacturer warranty) Hollon Safe backs all our fireproof safes with a lifetime warranty against fire. We will gladly replace and Hollon Fireproof Safe that has been damaged in a fire with the same or a comparable model to include all freight costs to the original address of purchase. Customers will be required to supply all requested documents to an authorized Hollon Safe representative prior to replacement. •	Limited Warranty (manufacturer warranty) Hollon Safe warranties all parts and labor, including all Hollon digital components, on all safes purchased for period of 90 days from date of purchase against manufacture defects. We provide a 2 year warranty on all replacement parts. Extended warranty includes Hollon digital components. Other brand digital components, electronic keypads, will only be warranted for a period of 90 days from date of purchase. Only digital components that are factory installed or installed by a Hollon Safe technician prior to shipment will be covered under this 90 day warranty. Hollon Safe will not warranty any digital component installed on safes that are installed within a floor. This warranty does not cover any damages caused by mishandling, neglect, water, tampering, improper installation, removal and/or reinstallation of the safe. Hollon Safe must be notified within a period of seven days of the receipt of any safe damaged during shipping in order to uphold the warranty and/or damage claims. Warranties on damage claims will only be accepted if the customer has properly executed the outlined Damage and Delivery Policy and Procedures. Re-setting of any combination on a Group II dial lock must performed by a qualified locksmith otherwise the warranty will become void. This warranty is valid for the original customer of purchase and is non-transferable. At no time will the warranty cover more than the original purchase price of the safe. At no time will Hollon Safe become liable for the cost of installation and/or removal of an Hollon Safe or any contents or valuables that may be stored in any Hollon Safe. Hollon Safe's sole discretion under this warranty, is at Hollon Safe's own option and own expense. Hollon Safes will repair the defective safe or part, will deliver to the customer the same or comparable safe or part for replacement of the defective part, or if neither of the two previous options is reasonably available, Hollon Safe may, at its own discretion, refund to the customer the original purchase price paid for the defective safe. All safes or parts that are replaced or refunded will become the sole property of Hollon Safe. An authorized Hollon Safe representative must approve all claims against Hollon Safe. All repairs must be approved by a Hollon Safe Representative before any warranty repairs can be completed. If a warranty repair is completed prior to obtaining an approval and a work order number from Hollon Safe, Hollon Safe reserves the right to refuse payment to the service provider or reimbursement to the customer for any unauthorized repairs •	Inspection for Damage Process All LTL freight deliveries MUST be inspected for damage at the time of delivery. The banding will need to be cut and the box taken off the safe in order for proper inspection. The safe itself should be inspected for any signs of damage to include indentions and friction marks. Any signs of damage MUST be noted on the delivery receipt for any attempt of a discount or refused for a replacement and you MUST notify us within 24 hours. Please note that the driver cannot leave until the delivery receipt is signed for. If you are uncertain of the proper procedures please contact Hollon Safe immediately. Again, Do NOT sign for the shipment until you have thoroughly inspected for any damage. Hollon Safe is not responsible for shipments that are not signed for as damaged upon arrival. Occasionally there may be damage that is not apparent upon receipt of a shipment. Some freight carriers allow up to 15 days from receipt of shipment to accept claims of concealed damage, others do not. After the allowable time of concealed damage claims has passed, Hollon Safe Company cannot assist with freight claims. For this type of damage, a replacement safe is not an option. Any discount will be given once the claim has been approved. All freight shipped via Hollon Safe is shipped in an upright position, banded down to a wooden pallet. Any signs of damage, freight not being delivered upright position are justified reasons for the customer to require further inspection of the actual freight itself. If the damage is minimal and acceptable to the consignee, they will be required to make note of the damage on the delivery receipt at time of delivery prior to signing the delivery receipt. Under NO circumstances shall the consignee discard the pallet or packaging material until the safe has been determined to be in good working condition and/or all claim issues have been resolved. When the delivery receipt is signed by the consignee in good condition. Failure to follow the procedures above will remove all liability of damage from Hollon Safe and require the consignee to file any claims against the carrier themselves • Authorized Dealer - Buying from an authorized dealer insures that the manufacturer warranty is valid. Buying from an un-authorized seller, even if the product is new, does not guarantee the warranty will be valid. credit adds 3%"

I have for sale a CZ-P01 9mm Pistol.

It is in excellent condition. I am ex-infantry so I am fanatical about maintenance of my firearms.

Exact round count is unknown (I don't keep track of my shots honestly, I just go and shoot until I'm tired or out of ammo lol) but I would venture to guess probably around 500-1000. It is still being broken in.

It has the CZ Customs Competition hammer installed on it, which gives it a much better trigger pull.

I will include one CZ-P01 magazine that has the pinky extension, one CZ Compact magazine with a metal plate base that makes it flush fit, and one CZ 75 fullsize magazine with plastic base that eliminates any gap between the magwell and the pistol itself. All CZ brand magazines, no cheap knockoffs. That's a total of *3* magazines, to be clear.

In addition, if the purchaser likes, I have a set of Red and Black VZ ""Frag"" grips that I can include for an additional price, and a Crossbreed IWB Super Tuck Holster.


Asking price is 550.00 for the pistol w/ comp hammer and mags and stock grip panels. 
VZ grips can be had for 50.00 more.


REASONABLE OFFERS CONSIDERED. Please feel free to make me one, worst I can do is say no!. Not really looking for trades but I could be convinced I suppose if it was a cash + steel deal on busse or bussekin.


Please PM me if you are interested. I can meet FTF in Virginia, or can ship from my FFL to yours. 

Thanks!

Here is a 1944 Izhevsk Russian M-44 carbine model Mosin Nagant in very nice clean condition Complete with bayonet and cleaning rod.

I am including a soft case,cleaning tools,oil can,ammo pouch,and 50-rds Surplus ammo with this rifle.(2-20rd unopened packs are inside the ammo pouch and 10-rds are the same ammo inside the bag. Ammo is sure fire and like new) All numbers match. The floor plate latch was force matched from the arsenal. Nice little powerful carbine. Smooth bolt. Bolt has been completely taken apart,and any cosmoline cleaned off,oiled, and put back together. I did a small upgrade you can do to these rifles as i have done before on previous Mosin's.   I installed a washer under the sear to make the trigger smoother and lighter and also added a spring behind the trigger to make the trigger act more like a 2-stage trigger with a shorter trigger pull, which both are an improvement. I am looking for about $240.00 for this rifle but i will consider a respectable offer in person while viewing the rifle. I will ignore anyone making offers through text messages. No trades-Cash only. Pick up in Commerce Township. 2-closest crossroads to me are Oakley Park Rd/S.Commerce Rd. I do not check this email ever so please phone calls or text messages only. I will delete this ad as soon as it sells. Thanks."
