The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

The Mk 79 Mod 0 signal kit consists of a Mk 31 Mod 0 signal projector, a plastic bandoleer that holds seven Mk 80 Mod 0 signals. The kit is used by downed aircrew personnel as a distress signaling device.

Because it is small and lightweight, personnel can carried it in pockets of flight suits or in life rafts. The projector aims and fires the signals. Each signal contains a single red star. On activation, this star is propelled upward to a height of between 250 and 650 feet. The star burns for a minimum of 4 1/2 seconds.

To operate the device, you cock the projector firing pin by moving the trigger screw to the bottom of the vertical slot, and slip it to the right so that it catches at the top of the angular slot. After cocking the firing pin, remove a signal from the bandoleer and mate the projector with the signal. Now, rotate the projector clockwise until the signal is seated. Hold the projector overhead, pointed at a slight angle away from your body. While firmly gripping the projector, fire the signal by slipping the trigger screw to the left, out of the safety slot and into the firing slot.

NOTE: This first step is very important because the signal is threaded and screwed into the end of the projector. If you don't cock the projector before screwing in the signal, the firing pin could be forced into the primer of the signal, possibly firing the signal prematurely."

If you're reading this, you're probably familiar with the history of the Jungle Carbine. If not-it was designed, not specifically for jungle warfare(the name is actually an unofficial nickname), but with the British Airborne in mind. WWII ended before the rifle was put into widespread use. It was criticized by the war department as having a ""wandering zero""(accuracy issues), but historians believe that this was over politics and not the actual quality of the rifle. Ironically, it's most noteworthy service came the year after the end of it's production. In 1948, British and Commonwealth troops were armed with No5 rifles fighting the communists in the jungles of Malaysia.
This particular weapon was made in December 1946 at the Royal Ordnance Factory in Fazakerley outside of Liverpool. This rifle also features the less-common metal-cap on the end of the handguard."

484,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2992484,For Sale/Trade:  RARE custom collectable Emerson/Neely SPECWAR knife,"Hixson, Chattanooga, Tennessee",$ 0,"Listed On: Wednesday, November 12, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Emerson/Neely Specwar knife, produced by Vaughn Neely at Timerline knives. It has the aluminum nitride coating (dark grey). There is not a mark on this knife, it is as new. These originally retailed for over $400, and they are no longer produced. 

Emerson's first collaboration with a knife manufacturer was with Timberline Knives in 1993 for this SPECWAR model. This model featured a one-side chisel-ground tanto blade almost 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) thick. Its handle was made from fiberglass-reinforced nylon molded around a near-full tang. Vaughn Neeley of Timberline designed the sheath. The knife was originally a custom piece designed for Naval Special Warfare Group One, and this factory version was soon entered in the trials for the Navy SEALs knife in 1995. Although it was not chosen by the Navy, the Emerson-Neely SPECWAR knife won Blade Magazine's 1995 American Made Knife of the Year Award at the magazine's Blade Show in Atlanta, Georgia, that same year and was displayed as an exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art in New York City from May 24 to August 15,1995

Sales guy said they found it in their stockroom. Had been there for at least two years. Have not put any rounds through it. Went from the store to the safe.

As luck would have it, need to sell to pay for a much more expensive holy grail rifle I just located.

At 3.5 pounds, the Papoose is tied with the AR-7 for the lightest production takedown survival .22LR.  Swinging the odds in its favor are the 70PSS's stainless steel barrel and receiver, better accuracy, and far superior reliability. The included carrying case makes the whole package floatable as well.

Asking what I paid for it...no more, no less. When you can find them on Gunbroker they go for far more.  You'll get the original receipt so you can count on the full Marlin warranty as well.

Must be willing to meet on west side of town.

So... I have this unused new glock gen3 40 cal. up for sale/trade (see below what interest me)
I purchased new last summer during the height of the gun scare and i know i overpaid for it and i never had much ammo to shoot thru it.

I did a function test and run both mags thru it with factory ammo and it shoots like butter!
It is deadly accurate with the sights as is from the factory.
There is a reason homeland security, military and the police all use it.
If you are looking for a full sized service pistol that is a rock-solid reliable weapon, then this is it. 
I did not see one listed locally so i figured i would check the interest out there.
It comes with everything like it came from the factory. (Papers, cleaning brush, lock, speed loader, etc.)

I paid well over $600 for it but i will not make that your fault!
I am willing to accept $550 cash or a possible trade - what do you have to offer?
It is in pristine condition with not a mark on it. (and it does not even have the glock smile yet)
Rounds down range is 2 mags worth (30 rounds precisely) then cleaned and stored.
I will toss in a weapon light and a box of ammo for full asking price to the buyer to get ya going.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
The first carbon fiber helmet made with our next generation helmet liner technology.

Leveraging our expertise in helmet liner development and our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Military, the EXFIL™ Tactical Bump Helmet is our first complete solution for head protection in the tactical market.

Using technology largely developed under an Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center program, the EXFIL™ features a hybrid sling/polymer structure impact management system that offers improved multi-impact performance. The liner also allows for superior air flow and ventilation by creating standoff between the wearer’s head and the helmet shell. Made of durable TPU, the liner is resistant to wear and environmental extremes.

Designed with functionality in mind, the EXFIL™ is made of lightweight carbon fiber and is compatible with tactical communication headsets. Picatinny rails provide a wide range of attachment and positioning options, and webbing slots offer cable management. The EXFIL™ is compatible with most 3-hole NVG shrouds and mounting systems. A custom Wilcox shroud is offered as an add-on option. The helmet also comes equipped with Team Wendy’s newest retention system made with cam-lock sliders for easy and secure adjustment and a Boa® Closure System for optimized stability and fit.
