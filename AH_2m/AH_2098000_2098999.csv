Sep. 09, 2013 @ 11:15 PM

Every week it seems there’s another story in the news about someone being scammed.

Either through an unscrupulous business deal, pyramid scheme, home improvement project or phishing email, scammers are everywhere.

But, with the current resources available through the Internet and elsewhere, consumers are better-armed than ever in the fight against these hucksters.

Google reviews, the Better Business Bureau and websites like Angie’s List (angieslist.com, subscription required) are good places to start when looking to complete home improvements or other ventures. A simple search of Google with keywords from an email or too-good-to-be-true advertisement can often turn up consumer complaints to warn you off.

In real-world, offline situations, avoiding scams can be just as simple.

Never be pressured into allowing work on your home from a crew that just happened to be traveling through your neighborhood and thought you could use roofing, paving, etc. 

Examples of this con job are seen repeatedly on regional newscasts — a person scammed into extending their driveway, installing new gutters or replacing a storm-damaged roof only to have shoddy, non-complete work and an empty bank account.

Real pros, for the most part, don’t do business door-to-door.

Perhaps the best advice for those who don’t want to get short-changed, hoodwinked or otherwise scammed is this: If a deal sounds too good to be true, it likely is.

African kings aren’t emailing you in hopes you’ll take 10 percent of their huge fortunes just to allow them to transfer it to your bank account; that’s a scam.

You’re very unlikely to make $50 an hour on a work-from-home job that you were offered via an unsolicited email; yet again, another scam.

The FBI offers a vast listing of tips to avoid being suckered in on these shakedowns, but the best of their tips are these: 

    Know who you are dealing with. If you have not heard of a person or company that you intend to do business with, learn more about them. Depending on the amount of money that you plan on spending, you may want to visit the business location, check with the Better Business Bureau, or consult with your bank, an attorney, or the police.
    Make sure you fully understand any business agreement that you enter into. If the terms are complex, have them reviewed by a competent attorney.
    Always take your time making a decision. Legitimate companies won’t pressure you to make a snap decision.

This is a full power plus 41 Mag. load. It is safe to fire in all 41 Mag. chambered firearms and has short enough over-all-length to fit even very short cylindered revolvers such as the Taurus. We are not able to use a flash suppressed propellant for this load, so you’ll notice a large muzzle flash when fired from barrels under 7 or 8 inches in length.

This load is designed primarily for hunting animals the size of deer and medium sized black bear. Additionally, it would make a wicked defense load against humans.

As always, Buffalo Bore refuses to follow the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to establish our published velocities. Our advertised velocities are generated from real world firearms so our customers can see what type of results they will get in the real world, where it matters.

It's under a year old.
Cash price would be $3,500.
For trades, I'd take a mid level AR-15 with cash. We can discuss value of the AR-15 (no Bushmasters please).
Not interested in AK, pistols or any other type of rifle.
Sorry about the photos.
Not interested in parting it out or separating the scope from the rifle. Full setup for the long range shooter.

He used it mostly as a snake gun on his land in East Georgia. In fact, it was loaded with snake shot when it was found in his safe. However, there is not very much holster wear and it could easily pass for a gun that is only a few years old. The finish is nearly intact and the rifling is very sharp. It comes with a leather holster and a new hogue grip that I purchased for it last week as well as the original wooden grips.

The receiver is topped with an integral 3/8"" groove for tip off rings plus unlike the Winchester 9422 it is a full length groove making it easy to install a standard length scope.

This rifle is 22LR only and is not designed to repeat cycle shorts, longs or Aguilla Colibri type ammo but might be able to shoot them single fashion.  Stick to Long Rifle and it won't be an issue.

Can shoot any type of long rifle ammo from sub sonic, standard velocity, high speed, high velocity & hyper velocity.

These rifles are known to be accurate.

18"" barrel with a 15 round tube feed, lever action with HALF COCK SAFETY (none of this cross bolt or tang safety business) sling swivels and REAL walnut.

Rifle has just been disassembled and cleaned & re-lubed throughout.

Potential local buyers can meet to examine and test fire this rifle.  Bring your own ammo.  Local buyers will receive a box of 50 rounds of 22LR ammo with purchase.

Will meet within 50 mile radius of 16509 for face to face FFL transfer.  So, if you live in Ohio or New York I will meet you ate your local FFL.

Unlike some Armslisters who can't be bothered to ship a rifle or shotgun I have no issues with shipping this UPS.  A flat cost of $30 should cover the shipping, packing supplies, insurance and my time and gasoline to the local UPS hub.  If you are outside of the continuous 48 states it may cost more.

If your FFL does not accept shipping from a non FFL and you want to use that FFL it WILL cost more because I have to transfer to my local FFL.

I am open to realistic offers.

Trades considered but not limited to or guaranteed I will accept are the following:

Savage Striker 503 17HMR
Savage Striker 503 17HMR Stainless
Savage Striker 502 22 Magnum
Henry H001V Varmint Express 17HMR
