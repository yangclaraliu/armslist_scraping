New tags, licensed and insured. Runs and drives. 4cylinder is epic. Full set of riding gear(leather size large) for the right price. I'm looking for a nice 380, 357, .38 revolver(the governor/the judge would make my day), shotgun (18 inch barrel->must) maybe a glock... Not sure. Cash on top of course, unless you have a couple guns you'd like to send my way. NOT INTERESTED IN HUNTING RIFLES. I have way too many
Trade value around 1500-2000. I have all the original part for the bike in case you want to restore it. Not a single bolt missing from the factory, I personally think it looks much better this way.

I carried this gun for a while in a 1911 commander holster, it's a $90 Stoner leather and I can include it for another $50. The gun carries great and is very comfortable.

This one has been modified and is competition ready. Every type of ammunition I have loaded has shot perfectly on the proper gas setting except Winchester target load. I tried Winchester when I first bought the gun but after making the modifications and new gas plug, I haven't tried to run it because the Federal target load has been running flawlessly. I did the work myself. I have years of experience with machinery and fabrication and have converted a few of these rifles. In all honesty... converting these things could be done by a monkey with a hammer and is definitely what I would call 'beginner's' level.

AAC MPW 300BO Mid Length $1619.95 gr Length:16”, 12.5” and 9” Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16”, 12.5” and 9” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply) A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.* Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer."

Tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.
Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using

precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries.

This bow has the power of the original Buck Commander (365 FPS) but weighs in at about 2lbs less at 7.1lbs.  Truly an awesome package here!  The bow has the illuminated 3x32 scope.  Comes with 3 100grain 20"" bolts. The target that is included was purchased new at the same time. I shot my 6 shots plus my stepdad and brother also shot a few to sight in, so the target has taken about 20 shots.  I also purchased an extra pack of 3 Barnett String Wax and a package of field tips. I also purchased a package of 3 Rage Mechanical Broadheads.  The bipod I mounted but ended up taken off because it just didn't need it and you couldn't mount the quiver then, it made it look cool but not really functional so the bipod in the pic is not included unless you want to buy it on the side.

What is included?
1) The Crossbow ($640)
2) Flambeau hard case ($60)
3) Target made to stop bolts shot from high speed crossbows ($55)
4) Quiver with 3  20"" bolts
5) Package of Field Tips ($15)
6) Pack of 3 Rage Broadheads ($45)
7) 4 pack of String Wax
8) Rope cocking device

I have been wanting and saving for this crossbow for the whole year.  Unfortunately I need the money to help cover Christmas expenses.  That is the only reason this is listed.  I will definitely buy this same bow again next year.
I used this crossbow for 1 week in October.  Fired about 5 practice shots into a target with it and shot a deer so total of 6 shots fired.

Price is $540 FIRM FIRM FIRM!
I got $800 into this so this is the best price I will let it go for.

This is the handgun version of the AK47 in 7.62x39. It is unfired in the box and the two 30 round polymer mags haven't been unwrapped. A friend let me shoot his a while ago and it was a hoot. I was impressed at how tight and solid the Hellpups are. Even the furniture fits tight, so I impulsively bought one. It has remained unfired in the safe ever since. It does not fit my personality and I don't have much ammo left anyway, So I figured I would see if someone else with a purchase permit wanted it. 
I don't ""NEED"" to sell it so lowball offers will be ignored. The only trades I may be interested in are a 1911 by either Les Baer, Colt Gold Cup, Kimber, or Clark Custom, or possibly a Rock River Elite Operator AR15. For those I would be willing to add cash.

It is topped with a Bushnell Elite 4200 6x24x40 scope with a sunshade.  Would sale without scope.  I have only shot it two different times and it is definitely a very accurate rifle.  I am not expecting to get what I put into it, but please make your offer Reasonable (know the value).  If you have any questions please let me know.

It features a shorter stock, shorter trigger reach, smaller grip and a raised comb; making it easier for a youth to acquire and hold the proper sight picture.

It is in overall good condition especially considering the age.  I was shocked as to how accurate it is....it actually grouped just as good if not better than a Ruger 10/22 Target that I had at 50yrds.  Functioned flawlessly with the .22lr rounds I all tried with it....it really likes the Wolf Extra Match.  The scope is an old Mossberg 4D scope with side mount.  The stock was refinished I believe but looks great.  It is however missing both the iron sights...but the scope is valuable enough to compensate from what I've seen them sell for on Ebay :)  I am also throwing in 500 rounds of CMP/match ammo as well.

between locked breach and blow back operation, depending on the pressure of
the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a design that holds 30
rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a
crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb
activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide
locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also

release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight,
Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive
coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective
