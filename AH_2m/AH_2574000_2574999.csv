I'm selling my .45 Les Baer Custom wad gun to help pay for an engagement ring (talk about priorities changing...) The gun is in very good condition and was used at a few NRA matches. I don't know what the exact round count is but I'd guess less than 100 as I spent far more time shooting my ball gun until I earned my distinguished badge.

It comes with an Ultradot sight (already zeroed for 50yds!!), Sharkskin grips and has a slide assist rod (see pics).

Besides my Model 41 .22LR, this is the MOST ACCURATE .45 I've ever shot. This gun is beautiful and ready to win matches.

Includes leather sling, Leupold 2X7 Vari –XII scope, Weaver sight rings, and immaculate, padded Ted Williams soft case. It was made in April of 1964, purchased in the late 60’s and hardly, if ever, used. It is clean and crisp as anything you’ve ever seen; a very sweet piece. The whole package is original, and could have just been brought home from the store.

We would prefer to keep it in the family, but one of our sons was selected for a band/choir concert tour in Europe, and we’re short the last chunk for the trip.

It’s a great gun for a collection or for a young person. My Father-in-Law said it’s an amazing, flat shooter. Research indicates it’s great for game up to and including deer.
If you think you’d like it, let me know quickly. I reduced the price from $1250 based on some input from a collector. This is fair for everything together. I think it will go fast. If I’m wrong, and we don’t make the deadline (1 Feb), it’s going off the market.

It has a full barrel length fluting. 20"" barrel, 12/1 twist. 1/4 MOA shot placement at 100 meters. Harmonized, crowned barrel and tuned adjustable trigger system.
The PD stated that was the scope I had to have if I was going to be a sniper on the swat team because the army uses Leupold MK4. So I ordered it for over $1k and found out I bought a clone worth about $300. lol But I put it on and we put 5 sniper challenge coins out at the 100 Meter mark and plugged all of them 1st shot. It is really nice. Im more of a schmitt and bender guy but its what they required. It works well. Obj. Lens Diameter: 1.575in / 40mm -Field of View @100 yds (ft): 29.5(3.5x) 10.7(10x) 
It has a filled out scope dope for the low mount so you dont have to spend a ton of time figuring out your click adjustments. two dope charts. One is in the scope cap, the other is taped to the stock for quick reference. Everything is top quality with no expense spared. I built it wile working a side job as a gunsmith at a gun store. So it is professionally put together. If you want it I will take the transfer charge and shipping out of it and get a low priced case to ship it in. I added butler creek scope caps. I added a sun screen to protect against scope flash. It is on quick detach rings, It has a cheap $75 back up site for close quarters getting to the hide. It has a bubble marker for extreme Long range. I put 15 rounds down range at 1,000 and 1,2000 meters and still worked great. Hence it having a high mount on it right now. I have a low mount if you want it too for the 100 and 200 ranges. It also has a angle cosign indicator mounted on the left side to not interfere with the ejections. These are for shooting from high to low or vice versa. You will find them on almost all sniper rifles in Afghanistan.
The Bi pod is a versa pod on a anschutz T rail running the entire length of the for grip of the rifle. This helps you move the bipod or accessories where ever you want on the rifle. Versa pod is a 6"" sniper model swiveling, locking and extendable. It comes with the T rail mount not a bead mount. Which is the little eye hole like a hunting rifle that a lower quality bipods attach to, however it has that also for preference.
 The stock is Bell & Carlson Tactical Medalist Style 5 Fully Adjustable 3-way adjustable butt assembly that adjusts for: length of pull; cant (left/right butt tilt); and height (up/down); adjustable cheek piece for precise cheek/eye placement to scope; Wide & Flat forend for bench / bag stability; Anschutz-style forend rail (attaches accessories such as bipods, grips, etc.) a aluminum bedding block, not glass. The stock is Olive drab with black spider webbing for added camouflage. The stock features a Wyatt brand M4 detachable 10 rnd box magazine. Uncle mikes sling rings quick detachable. The sling itself is a 1.5 inch wide black DPMS harness grade leather latch sling made to be used as a 1 point sling or two point sling. The one point is used a tourniquet to stabilize the rifle. Sort of like when you grip the sling to stabilize the rifle but in this case it wraps around your arm and hooks in place so it doesnt need to be held.
The writing on the side is vinyl decal that can be removed. I am sure you dont want Officer McCoy on there. It comes off easy.
I also have a speed grip for the bolt. I just have not put it on the gun yet because I dont like explaining things to metal workers.
Matte Black finish -Target style adjustment knobs -1/4 MOA windage and elevation adjustments with 15-MOA of adjustment for each revolution -Fully multicoated lenses for unsurpassed light transmission/contrast -Illuminated Mil-dot reticle (11 brightness level) Red/Green -Nitrogen filled -100% Waterproof/Fogproof/Shockproof -Actual Magnification: 3.3(3.5x) 9.6(10x) -Length(in): 13.8 -Objective Diameter(in): 1.83 -Eyepiece Diameter(in): 1.55 -Weight: 630 grams -Eye Relief (mm): 117(3.5x) 91(10x) -
It has about $3,500 + in it. It is practically brand new. I believe $3,500 is fair but willing to negotiate. Im in a spot so I can negotiate but I think $3000 is the right price. I wouldn’t sell it if I didnt need to move and that costs.
This is the stock rifle. Note the price of msrp. lol Then compare it to the price Im asking for.

The 1934 is in pristine condition with no refurbishment markings at all. It is a very early import with all numbers matching.

Not sure, its just mint and i have had alot if mosins in my lifetime. I can guarantee you will most likely never find a mosin in this condition. gently used early import that sat until now.. 
 200 for the 1942 izzy with refinished stock.
375 for the early import, that saw little use in the war 1934 pre war hexagonal izzy stashed away mint imported and never used .

Very nice Para Ordnance P14 45 ACP for sale or trade. Blued very good to excellent condition. It has a Custom action kit installed. Shoots great. Comes with 2 full cap magazines. Still at my dealers shop in Iron Station. Bought it to turn into a race gun but have decided to go a different route. Ran about 50 rounds through it at his place and it ran his dueling tree BEAUTIFULLY!!! Seriously thought of keeping it, but really want to go a different route now. You will be picking this up for the dealer so all laws apply, paperwork and permit required.  I'LL PAY TRANSFER FEE, no sales tax since it's a transfer not a purchase. 

Will consider slight adjustment to the price depending on your location (for help with your gas bill) since I cannot meet you.

All it needs is a rear sight, the bolt carrier group & charging handle. The lower is a complete LW-15 from New Frontier Armory. The upper is a standard flat top, with an ESS 16"" chrome moly barrel w/ a med. contour, similar to an M4. It has a 1 in 7 rate of twist, phosphate finish, bird cage style flash hider and is chambered for 5.56 NATO. Has a taper pinned factory A2 front sight, standard carbine length gas system, and standard M4 hand guards. Both the upper and lower where brand new before being mounted together and neither one has seen a single round fired yet. Also I must mention that the polymer lower is a very nice, tight fit for this upper with practically no play at all. I had my doubts about these lowers before my first build with one but it is still going strong after approx. 1,500rds and has not shown any signs of breaking down yet. They have some pretty good torture tests on the companies website if you are curious to see one in use. Granted it is from the company that manufactures them but still gives you a decent idea at least.

Anyways, it comes with one new 30rd mag which is also unfired and would make a great entry level AR for someone. I'm just short the last couple parts needed to complete it and can't really justify to the wife investing money in another AR right now so I'm testing the waters to see if I can't get another handgun in trade to enjoy with the family.

HB 1589 Hearing - Tuesday, January 21 - 1:15 PM

 COME FIGHT THE WORST ANTI-GUN NH LEGISLATION OF THE YEAR -
  BANNING PRIVATE GUN SALES

As we warned in an earlier article on the Pro-Gun New Hampshire website, www.PGNH.org, state representative E. Elaine Andrews-Ahearn (D - North Hampton)( See pic Below) has filed a bill to ban private sales of all firearms -- rifles, shotguns, handguns -- in New Hampshire, forcing them to go through a licensed dealer (FFL).  Violation would be a FELONY.  PRO-GUN NEW HAMPSHIRE URGES ALL NH GUN OWNERS TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS OF THIS BILL, HB 1589, TO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE COMMERCE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, AND TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC HEARING: Tuesday, January 21, 2014, at 1:15 p.m.   Because the legislature knows that this bill will infuriate gun owners, the hearing is scheduled not for the small committee room but for REPRESENTATIVES HALL in the State House.



This bill is a state-level version of last year's failed effort to do the same thing at the federal level, namely universal background checks, which we wrote about earlier.  (See the website http://www.noubc.com.)  The statement within HB 1589 that it's not gun registration is laughable; every gun transfer through a licensed dealer is recorded, and it's certain that registration will follow.  As has been proven all over the world, over and over, sooner or later registration leads to confiscation.

The text of the bill can be read at
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2014/HB1589.html .

It's interesting that the Speaker of the House has scheduled this bill to be heard by the NH House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee instead of the Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee, which has jurisdiction over gun bills.

Go to http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/committeedetails.aspx?code=H43 to see the committee members.  While you can click on the link titled ""Email Committee Members"" to send a message to the committee office, it's better to click on the name of each member to get their individual email address.  Paper mail to a home address is more effective than email, however, and the committee page includes a link,
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/committees/CommitteeMailingList.aspx?code=H43 , with the mailing address of each committee member.  In addition, you can contact the  bill's sponsors, as listed in the text of the bill, through the House Roster, at
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx, and the Senate Roster, at
http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/Senate/members/senate_roster.aspx.  PLEASE BE CIVIL in your mail and messsages!  PGNH members, please remember our bylaws' Statement of Principles, which calls for mature and honorable conduct.

At the hearing, you can fill out a ""pink card"" if you want to speak, or sign the ""blue sheet"" to say if you support or oppose the bill but don't want to speak.  If you plan to testify, keep your time (which you list on the pink card) very short (no more than three minutes) unless you want to wait all afternoon to be called.  If you attend the hearing, especialy if you plan to testify, we recommend you go early, as we expect Reps Hall to be packed.  Note that no firearms are allowed in Reps Hall or adjacent areas of the State House.

THIS BILL MUST BE DEFEATED.

He has been doing this for 20+ years.  He does everything from start to finish himself.  He starts with a solid 1/8 thick piece of 1660 stainless steel and grinds it into the shape he desires.  

Around Christmas he got hard up for cash.  I told him I would just loan him some cash, but he said he would rather just sell me a few of his hand made knives at a drastically reduced rate from how much he typically gets.  So I have 4 knives for sale.  I have no need for them.

If you buy all 4 you can also have the presentation case he built.  If you only want one that's fine also.  I am selling these for a lot less than he would if you asked him to make you one.  From start to finish it takes over 60 hours to complete 1 knife. These are high quality and will hold an edge much better than some Chinese made crap.

I loaded these rounds a couple years ago but never got around to shooting them before I got rid of my rifles and I'm just now getting around to getting rid of all the reloading stuff for it. 

There are 49 rounds, sized, trimmed, deburred, chamfered and loaded with 125 grain Speer TNT over 42 grains of Ramshot Tac powder with random COAL measurements of 2.571 to 2.577. This is simply measuring the bullet tip to case bottom as I haven't yet invested in a different tool. There is some variation in the bullet tips that may explain the variability of the COAL."

This beautiful rifle comes with its original box, cleaning kit, manual, one 5 round, one 10-round magazine. Also included are accessories that I purchased later: two CSSpecs 20-round magazines specially made for this VEPR 308, a Katlinka center scope rail mount, and an AIM Sports 8-32x50E-SF tactical scope (new in the box).
All items listed are new, un-used, with original boxes/packaging. You assemble this riffle and accessories to your liking.
The semi-automatic hunting rifles VEPR SUPER are designed for medium-sized and big game. AK-based design and construction of the rifles provides a reliable operation of parts and mechanisms as well as high-grade shooting in various weather and climatic conditions. The rifles can be used in a wide temperature range (frm -50 F up to 120 F).
VEPR SUPER's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel (550mm length for this rifle) with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with walnut stocks make these rifles very different from other AK-based rifles available in the US market.

I have an AK 74 as pictured in great shape with wood furniture. I'm the second owner and have put maybe 500 rounds through this rifle. It's very accurate and fun (cheap fun in this caliber). 1 mag included. I have lots of other accessories as well (quad rails, collapsible stocks, peep sights, etc for AK pattern rifles if you are interested, well talk a deal for all that stuff).

FYI, if your new to this ammo/caliber don't be concerned. I'll tell you how I clean my rifles. It's quick easy and works well! Current prices are around $170/1080 round can. This caliber was available for some time during the ""shortage"" and I was shooting while others were trying to find ammo. Just selling some of the AK patterns as I'm sticking with the AR platform for continuity and have a 5.45 upper that I LOVE.

top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.

No, because it's their stuff and they can sell it for whatever they want. Just sell your stuff, contact people about the stuff you're interested in, and leave everyone else alone.""

The gun is chambered in .458 WIN MAG, which as you know is one of the most powerful guns on the planet. Yes, it is an elephant gun that is used to take down any North American big game, as well as any of the most dangerous game on the DARK Continent. There is no wild animal on this planet that will not drop in is tracks once hit with this. 

With the purchase of the gun the new owner will receive two boxes of Remington Kleanbore 510 African Grand SLAM bullets. (Antique) and still shoot great. Also 1 box of Remington Kleanbore 510 Grand Slam bullets with 3 shells being shot. (hence the three times being fired) Lastly, i have two boxes of winchester ammo that is antique as well but its just the brass, so if you are into reloading then you have your start right here. In total you will have 57 Live shells and 40 pieces of brass. 

This gun does not have a scratch on it( in the stock or in the metal)and is brand new except for the three rounds that have gone down the bore. 

Selling it because i was supposed to go to AFRICA with some friends to stalk Cape Buffalo and figured i would need this along the way, but used my bow instead. I have no use for this gun now, so my loss and your gain. I will be selling it all as a package deal for 1200.00 OBO including the ammo and brass, which is a steal since the gun brand new is 1399.00 and that does not include ammo. Also considering ammo costs range from 85-150 a box of 20 you will be making out with an amazing gun and ammo to shoot.
