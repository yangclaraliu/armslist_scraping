This is a Polymer AR-15 lower with lifetime warranty*. Includes take down pins, MILSPEC trigger group, buffer, and buffer spring installed and tested.A1 Length Integral Stock (5/8"" shorter than A2) with sling loop. 13"" Length of Pull. Receiver weight (complete) is 1 full pound lighter than a complete aluminum receiver with an A2 stock.
Wider magazine well accepts unmodified, submachine gun magazines in pistol calibers. With caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks, standard AR15 magazines 
can be used without modifications. As well, any M16 magazine can be used with easier reloading than aluminum receivers. It has a longer service life, as Nylon 6 resists impacts and wear better than aluminum. The integrated buffer tube, pistol grip and fixed stock give this design its strength.

Have had one problem in 450 rounds and that was that it didn't take the first round off a full magazine.  That was before the Wolff upgraded recoil spring was in place and most people swear that will cure it.

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington commercial chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability when using the high velocity 5.56x45mm NATO military ammunition. It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers."

Bears the markings ""Euro Sport"" and ""AKAH"".  Adj rear sight.  VERY light trigger pull going single action.

What I think I know:  Between calling S&W some time ago and corresponding with another guy who had a similar gun up for sale, this was one of about 2,000 such guns sent to Germany and marketed through hunting clubs there.  About five are known to have been bought by US servicemen and brought back to the states.  I have never seen another one like it.  I am not sure what AKAH/Euro Sport may entail, but my guess would be they reworked the trigger amongst other things.  Seems to have case hardened trigger and hammer.

It has a front bedding pillar installed with epoxy action bedding at the take down screw area, and the barrel channel has been relieved so as to free float a factory contour barrel. It has an elegantly tapered forend, asymmetrical modified grip area (suitable for right handed folks), and has been refinished. The wood tint is espresso (that's not the name of the color; I brewed espresso and used it to stain the wood. In fact, I personally roasted raw coffee beans extra dark to get better color), and the finish is poly. It is the same length as a factory carbine stock, and has a standard OEM buttplate.

This stock creates a unique and classic looking 10/22 rifle, and is especially nice with longer sporter barrels. Buy this stock, tell your friends that you made it yourself, and receive a lot of compliments. I won't tell.

Item for sale is stock only, gun not included!

PLEASE NOTE: If you buy this stock and do not have experience tuning 10/22 rifles, please let me help you. Some basic shimming and bedding tips will help your rifle look and shoot better with this stock. I am not an expert, but I can share what I have learned.

All reasonable offers will be considered. Thanks for looking! 

My disclaimer: I stand by my word. I describe item condition honestly, I properly own all items I sell, I only make legal deals with qualified individuals, and I keep appointments. If you are a flake, don’t waste my time. If you don’t keep your word, the deal is null and void. Unless I specifically say I will reserve an item, it is open to the first paying individual. If you say you will buy it and then don’t get around to sending payment quickly, don’t be surprised if someone buys the item out from under you. When you pay, I ship ASAP. If you are unhappy with an item bought from me, I will probably refund your money, less my shipping costs, when you return the item to me promptly and in same condition. It is very important to me that both parties are satisfied with the transaction."

I picked up this rifle just before I found my son was coming and just never got around to shooting it. For sale is an unfired Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) MK114 MOD 0 with upgraded trigger and buffer tube. If you're looking at this rifle, you know exactly what you're getting. PWS uses a proprietary piston technology which in my opinion is much better than a direct impingement system. This an original MOD 0 rifle which means there are rails all around the upper as opposed to a MOD 1 version which uses the KeyMod rail system. Again, my opinion on the two styles is that the MOD 0 may be a little heavier but you can put just about any attachment on the rails without having to purchase additional rails. Currently, the MOD 1 versions of this rifle cost $1,949 retail (with no upgrades) and take up to 6 months to build/ship. I'm open to REASONABLE offers but new, this rifle would cost you $2,200+.

I bought these last year from someone on Armslist who made them and now have entirely too much. I believe it started off as a 1,000 pieces and I used around 250. There is nearly 10 pounds worth here. Out of those roughly 250 that I loaded, there were a few that didn't cycle in my AAC upper or Remington 700 SPS Tactical. I'm still fairly new to reloading and am not sure what would have to be trimmed or what to make them work. If you like I can throw those few in that are primed (Remington small rifle) and you may be able to fix them. I paid about $300 and I'm only looking to get $225 for what's left. Thanks for looking!

p.s. Also willing to part with the brass that I used once for a little extra. They have been tumbled in corn cob media and de-primed/sized."

For sale - used (but not abused) Mossberg MVP Varmint bolt action rifle with a 1:9 twist 24"" fluted and free-floated barrel, chambered in 5.56NATO/223 Remington.

Comes with the factory box, 10rd magazine and accessories.  Asking $520.

The action has Remington barrel threads and will accept Remington type triggers. One neat thing is that the action was milled with an integral recoil lug (much like the current Surgeon Action). And the bolt is milled all in one piece-no soldered-on handles and is a 7mm whisper.You'll also note how slick and streamlined the scope rings are. Illum made those as well. His rings mount to the action via two screws from the inside of the ring, a very elegant set-up for sure. Has Bomar sights and Scope rings. Comes with dies and 100 rounds of brass."

I have had this pistol for perhaps 15-20 years and never any issues.

Scorpion 229 threaded barrel 9mm. This is the gun I want to move to. I will trade the pistol/mags plus 150 cash. Must be in excellent condition. If well used we can talk, a well cared for gun that has a few rounds through it is not bad, I just may not pay as much cash.

This pistol easily hits the 100yd steel plate out at evergreen sportsmans. It is a great pistol that has been well cared for. I will ignore all other trade offers (except as listed). Cpl and dl required. Thanks and best of luck to you. :)"

This one is made in the USA and i have put talon rubber grips on it which really gives you a solid purchase on it (does not make the hand grips bulky and can be easily removed if undesirable). I have carried it for CCW and this gun is big but defiantly not to big to do a CCW job. This firearms is really an all around practical firearm. you have a full size frame for home defense but yet light enough and easy enough to carry for CCW. The reason i am looking to trade or sell is because i am wanting a Glock 20 which is a 10mm that i can carry on hunting trips. Also this Glock has right at 50 rounds through it and not a scratch or blemish on the slide or the frame. If you are interested or have any questions feel free to email me."
