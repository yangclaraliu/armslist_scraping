The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire. All 2"" barrel Rhino revolvers are supplied with a beautiful leather holster included.

Also have Chiappa large olive wood grip, Ghost International Kydex paddle holster, 3 moon clips, original hard case and book, and Box of 25 Hornady XTP .357 Mag.

This is an FNH-FNS9, it is the striker fired version of the FNX and as a Glock enthusiast it was a really good addition to my collection. I prefer the trigger to the Glock but not by much. The ergonomics are vastly superior however and it comes with two backstraps. I only carried it twice with the IWB holster I am including with this deal but I did carry it a bit with the level 2 Safariland Retention holster I am throwing in on the deal as well. Despite carrying it on duty with me there has been no wear to the slide.
Here are some of the specs on the deal.
9mm
4 inch barrel length
17 round capacity(I am including 3 mags)
Trijicon Night Sights(Great sights)
Comes with factory box and paperwork. Both holsters in the deal are in their original packaging. The IWB holster is not worn in at all so it is perfect for CC use and the duty holster is great for whatever situation permits open carry, this holster is also in excellent condition.

Considering the price of the holsters and that this is a used yet well maintained gun I am looking to get $550 for it. I will work with you on price.

Both are 115gr. FMJ 50/box.

Depending on where you shop this ammo retails between $14 and $17 a box. I value my ammo at a very conservative .30/shot or $15 dollars a box. Yes, you could buy it a little bit cheaper if you catch some on the shelf at Walmart, but you'll have to make 30-40 trips to the store to try and get a quantity like this together. That's a lot of time and fuel to save a few pennies per shot. Please note that no matter how ""like new"" your used rifle is I will not give you suggested retail plus a $10 fee in value, nor will I trade the whole lot for your pistol that cost $250 brand new. I'm not here trying to rip anyone off, but I'm not an idiot either, please be realistic.

I am most interested in a .22LR target style pistol, but will consider hand guns in .380 ACP, .40 S&W, 9mm Luger, or .357 magnum.

This is a very rare and deluxe frontier era revolver. Manufactured in 1880 by Hopkins and Allen, Norwich, CT, these guns are unique in design and were considered to be of the highest quality. As such they were the most expensive of the large frame handguns of the period. An 1882 dated invoice from the E.C. Meacham Co. of St. Louis shows a standard Merwin .44 billed out at twelve dollars, while a new Remington 1875 Model is eight dollars and a Colt SAA is eleven dollars. Had not Joseph Merwin died in 1879 and the Merwin Company gone into receivership in 1880, Merwin’s precision revolvers may have revolutionized the gun industry around the world. These revolvers had an automatic ejector system that selectively extracted the fired cases while keeping the unfired cartridges in the cylinder. Many considered them superior to their better known competitors of the period, Colt, Remington and Smith & Wesson. This gun remains in excellent original condition, with 90% plus original nickel finish and perfect mechanical condition. Engraved in the classic New York M&H pattern, it has a non-typical and perhaps unique, large Texas longhorn steer head in a circle on the left side of the frame. While other animals and busts of Indians, women and cowboys were more or less standard, the steer head is very unusual. It could have been a special order from a western rancher. Regardless, this is a very rare and interesting gun."

You can even eject the chamber round without unloading the magazine.  A real plus.
The finish is hard nickel and it's claimed you can leave it sit in a bucket of salt water without damage.  I don't know about that, but it doesn't rust despite sitting around for eight years.

The action hasn't been cycled 50-times, and it's never been fired once.  No box, but it's got a nylon sling, a Hoppes three rod cleaning kit, and I can throw in a few boxes of ammo with it.

The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistol’s performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE® Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite. the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long.

Info on the rifle is as follows:
- Steel receiver with matte blued finish
- Bolt action with 60° bolt lift
- Adjustable Feather Trigger™
- Detachable Rotary magazine
- Glass bedded stock
- Free floated barrel with matte blued finish
- Hand chambered
- Target Crown
- Gray Composite stock
- Sling swivel studs installed
- Inflex Technology recoil pad

The rifle only has 8 rounds through it for zeroing purposes (The 8 rounds missing from the included ammo)

I have over $1000 invested in this rifle but I do realize I will probably not be able to recoup all of my money spent. I'm asking $900 (OBO) for everything and I believe that to be a fair price. 

I am willing to trade for the following:
- certain AK's
- PSL or something similar
- partial trade for a Trijicon RMR
- 5.56 ammo 
- 5.45 ammo

Shoot me an e-mail if you have any questions or have a trade in mind. Thanks for looking."

The Glock 17 is a 9mm short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol.[29] The firearm's locking mechanism utilizes a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. During the recoil stroke, the barrel moves rearward initially locked together with the slide approximately 3 mm (0.12 in) until the bullet leaves the barrel and chamber pressure drops to a safe level. A ramped lug extension at the base of the barrel then interacts with a tapered locking block integrated into the frame, forcing the barrel down and unlocking it from the slide. This camming action terminates the barrel's movement while the slide continues back under recoil, extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge casing. The slide's uninterrupted rearward movement and counter-recoil cycle are characteristic of the Browning system."

To explain it further so there are no future emails with people asking for clarity I will put it very plainly. If you go Mega Maten Keymod you are stuck with key mod. If you want a different rail then you will need to buy a whole new Maten upper receiver. The set I am selling works with all types of rails and platforms.

Buffalo Bore's Deer Grenade 44 Mag. +P is a 240gr. Massive, Hollow Nosed, 12 BHN cast bullet with a gas check traveling at the below velocities out of stock, real world, over-the-counter firearms:

1.       1935 fps -- Marlin 1894 20 inch

2.       1897 fps -- Marlin 1894 18 inch

3.       1871 fps -- Marlin 1894 16.5 inch

4.       1578 fps -- Ruger Super Blackhawk 5.5 inch

5.       1535 fps -- Ruger Redhawk 5.5 inch

6.       1466 fps -- S&W MT Gun 4 inch

This load is designed as the world's premier deer load for 44 mag.  The cast bullet is not considered soft, but it is not really a HARD cast bullet either as it only has a BHN (Brinell Hardness Numnber) of 12 so, it could be termed a medium/hard cast bullet.  It performs as follows:

At an impact velocity of 1,100 fps it will mushroom to about 75 Cal. and should push right through any deer with a broadside shot.

At an impact velocity of 1,500 fps it will mushroom and some of the mushroom will fragment off and send bullet particles flying through the deer, but much of the mushroom and shank will remain intact and should push through any deer hit broadside.

At an impact velocity of 1,900 fps the entire mushroom will turn into shrapnel and send bullet particles all throughout the deer. The shank will remain intact, but will re-mushroom and do horrific damage inside the deer and will probably push through any deer hit broadside.

Of course all these results will vary depending on how much bone, if any, you hit, etc. This load was designed specifically to do horrific damage to deer sized game and as such does not penetrate like a hard cast flat nosed bullet. This bullet only penetrates about 30% as deep as a typical flat nosed hard cast bullet, which is perfect penetration for shallow game like deer, and medium sized pigs or black bear. This load is your best bet for immediately anchoring any deer with the 44 mag. cartridge that is not CNS (central nervous system) hit.

This bullet is properly alloyed, lubed and is gas checked; it will NOT lead-foul barrels.

This load is designed to be safe in ALL/ANY, all steel firearms that are in normal operating condition. We do not recommend its use in lightweight alloyed revolvers as the bullets may jump the crimp."

I have a 1850s area percussion Blunderbuss for sale. I’m not sure of its origin because I can’t find any proof marks anywhere. I believe it is under the barrel. I am afraid to remove the barrel, as I do not have the proper tools. There is some etching on all the screws and trigger plate, butt plate and hammer. The barrel is elliptical shaped and made of steel. Overall the condition is excellent. I tried to research this gun, via the Internet, and found one real similar, almost exact. That one was made in Belgium.

The guy I bought this from had it in his family for several years, he told me he and his grandpa shot it last back in the early 70s. This gun has been very well taken care of, the stock has some scuffs/small dents but has no cracks or splits. Very good condition for its age. I took this gun to a gun shop and they confirmed that this is an original not a replica, they too were afraid to take the barrel off.
I am asking $1500"

 I have owned this gun for about 20 years and only shot it about 10-15 times, it has been more of a conversation piece for me. I purchased it from a retired Wisconsin State Trooper who had all of the work done and used it for competition Shooting. I just had it gone over by my local gunsmith and it has a clean bill of health. I also took it out on the gun range and fired about 25 rounds through it along side of my Sig Sauer P220, I was shooting a tighter grouping at 50ft with the Smith than I was at 30ft with my Sig…Impressive fire power. This is not a museum piece however it is in outstanding condition for a Dirty Harry era pistol, mechanically VERY sound.

The Benelli Super Black Eagle II utilizes the proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism that allows it to shoot 2¾"", 3"" and even 3½"" magnum ammunition without any adjustments. The new Benelli ComforTech™ system reduces recoil up to 48% when compared to the competition, without adding any moving parts or weight. The buttpad, made of a shock-absorbing gel originally developed for the medical industry, works with the ComforTech™ system to reduce recoil. Benelli engineers created a corrosion-resistant recoil spring and guide which remains free of rust and ride in a recoil tube that is easily cleaned by removing the quick-detachable recoil pad.
