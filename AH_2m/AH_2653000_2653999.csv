http://www.berettausa.com/products/cx4-storm/
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics.

Action and assembly are tight and true with no play in the takedown joinery, and no mechanical faults. No rust. Meticulously maintained. Heavy external finish wear in all areas not originally covered by the heat-shield and bayonet-lug assembly, which seems to evidence that the bulk of the wear was incurred in honest military service.The gun entered service in 1917, and would have left service with the Marine Corps around 1937. All military hardware was  removed when it was reissued to the U.S. Postal Service sometime in the late 1930's. The missing hardware includes the bayonet lug assembly, heat shield, and sling mountings. The butt-stock is an arsenal replacement. The barrel/magazine assembly does not match the serial number on the receiver, though both are of the correct serial range for the trench model. I procured the weapon from a man who's father acquired it when it was removed from service with the Waunakee, WI post office. It has been properly stored for most of the intervening years. The gun is in full working order, and cycles/fires without fail. 

Having done a fair bit of research on this model and configuration, I have found that pricing is nearly impossible, and most appraisers won't offer an opinion. The general consensus among the experts is that there were somewhere in the neighborhood of 1500, likely less, trench models sold to the U.S. government during WWI. Given the scarcity of the weapon, I would prefer to discuss price with prospective buyers rather than try to assess it myself. I will not respond to ridiculous offers. I will provide photos to serious inquiry upon request. Please specify any particular points you would like to see in detail."

Yugoslavian M48 MAUSER 8mm bolt action military surplus rifle

M48: 1948-1952- The initial version of the M48, with full crest and all machined steel parts.

Most M48's were put into government storage shortly after they were manufactured. Most M48's that are encountered in the United States and Australia today show only slight wear—usually from storage. Many rifles are sold with accessories, including bayonet, bayonet scabbard, leather bayonet frog, ammo pouches, cleaning rod, and field cleaning kit. The rifles are normally sold coated in the protective grease 'cosmoline' which needs to be cleaned out before the rifle is fired. The condition is frequently excellent due to a Yugoslavian maintenance program that cleaned and inspected the stored rifles in rotation every 5 years until that nation's breaking up.
As such, the M48 only saw limited use in the Yugoslav Wars. Often the M48 was used as the basis for a sniper rifle, drilled and tapped for the ZRAK 4x32 telescopic sight and mounts.[1] However, other than an experimental batch of approximately 4000 rifles, no official M48 sniper rifle was ever fielded by the Yugoslav Army. (ref. Serbian & Yugoslav Mauser Rifles by Branko Bogdanovic, North Cape Publishing, 2005)

This Saiga has been inspected and has a fully clear, unobstructed 3-port gas system and has been equipped with an upgraded recoil spring, puck, and 6-Stage Gas adjustment to RELIABLY allow using low-powered (low-brass) shells from the cheap Winchester 100-rd. target pack up to 3"" slugs by adjusting the 6-stage gas selector knob. Additionally, Mossy Oak Bottomland Camo and Magpul FDE accessories were added to dress it up a bit. This camouflage is a high-performance vinyl wrap so it can be easily removed to return the shotgun to its original factory matte black finish with no glue or residue. Change camouflage pattern to suit your environment with the other Mossy Oak patterns if needed. A rugged picatinny quad-rail system allows the use of lights, lasers, fore-grips, and optics. The rail system included a short and long rail that can be changed or removed entirely for a 3 rail setup with smooth top to use the standard iron sights.(long rail pictured).The standard AK Stock has been replaced with a 6-position Mil-Spec AR Style Magpul CTR in FDE for a familiar and ADJUSTABLE length of pull, especially useful if you are involved with 3-Gun Competitions and prefer your shotgun to have the same feel and length-of-pull as an AR rifle.

The Bolt and Carrier group have been polished to a mirror shine and jeweled on the bottom where the carrier contacts the hammer.The action is extremely smooth far better than stock. The bolt polishing also allows for inserting fully loaded magazines easily on a closed bolt. A G2 Single Hook trigger gives a lighter, smoother pull and breaks clean. All moving parts have been treated with Militec-1 Dry Lube. All of the normal tuning you would have to do has been done. This is a very rugged shotgun ready for anything.

Here is the description from Sig Sauer's Website: 

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function."

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano is extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Nothing wrong with this gun and if it shoots like the other Savages I've owned it'll shoot less than MOA and typically in the 1/2-3/4 MOA range with good ammo.  You won't be disappointed.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

This gun is awesome and can be carried anywhere. A .22 magnum is no joke and with speer gold dot hollow points this is a defensive weapon. 

The name ""Pug"" may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (""much in little"") in reference to the small and convenient size.

Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1"" heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark.

Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm ""leash"" on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite"

They provide a great service to buyers like me.

And you know what else......

Private sellers' USED prices are usually above new retail prices out of arrogance or ignorance.
Dealers are reliable and reputable unlike many private parties.
Dealers employ people unlike John Q. Dipshit who wants to sell his used Glock 21 for $1100 just because it has a guide rod laser and a grip sleeve.

I don't see Gander listing their inventory on here. I see small owner operated shops on here who don't have the resources for a website.

SO EITHER SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE YOU SHOULD DO, OR FILTER OUT THE DEALER LISTINGS IF YOU WANT TO BE UN-AMERICAN."

From what I could find it was made by Noble for Montgomery Ward. The literature I have read would put the gun manufacture date somewhere in the 60s.

Mechanically the gun is absolutely sound. It is the gun I grew up rabbit hunting and deer hunting with after I graduated from my .410. It has been cleaned after each time shooting it and has spent its life in a gun sleeve in a safe. That said it could use a good going over if someone wanted a project. I'm consolidating calibers and phasing 20 gauges from my collection is all.

I haven't the slightest on value and can't find anything really on the gun. There is also 125 rounds of birdshot that go with the gun. I am thinking $225 with ammo, but am open to offers.

*Put 5 boxes of factory 300 AAC ammo through this upper and loved it but I've decided to get rid of my 300 AAC Project (See my other ads in the reloading EE!) in order to finish my 5.56 MK18 project. Over $900 invested in this upper receiver and it's got exactly 100 rounds through it. I've just got too many projects on my plate right now and the last thing I need is another caliber in the mix.
