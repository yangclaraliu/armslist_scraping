The P239 is a single stack pistol that is also shorter in barrel length than the 229 by having a 3.6” barrel. As the gun is single stack, it is thinner overall than the 226 and the 229 and is a popular concealed carry gun, it should be noted that of the P series guns in “service caliber” this one does not offer an accessory rail. This P239 is chambered in 9MM. This comes in the original Sig Hard case and has two 8 round mags, all mags are factory Sig mags. Also includes original manual. Original grips have been replaced with Hogue OD Green wrap around grips. Stainless slide has been stripped and is now highly polished. Overall finish on pistol is excellent.

The extra mags in the picture have been sold and the price on this pistol has been lowered accordingly.

(From Hornady.com)
     Since their inception, conventional hollow point pistol bullets have performed well, but have never delivered 100% reliability especially in self-defense situations. The patented Flex Tip® technology used in Critical Defense® ammunition eliminates the clogging and inconsistency that often plagues hollow point bullets. Hornady® achieved this by using the same tip material as used in LEVERevolution® ammunition.

All Critical Defense® ammunition is loaded in nickel cases for increased visibility in low-light situations. Premium low fl ash propellants deliver proven performance, even in very shortbarreled handguns, and won't disrupt your vision. Reliable expansion and dependable terminal performance can be counted on for concealed carry/personal protection.

The comfortable design of the all new XD-S™ feels so natural, it’s like an extension of your own body. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control.
Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target.
A game-changer in the marketplace, the XD-S™ offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from the XD® line. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S™ offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability.
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.
Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.
Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case 
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries. 
Specifications: 
•	Length: 6.3”
•	Height: 4.4”

Gun has been appraised at $1600, I am however more interested in tradeing. I am in the pistol less than the appraisal so dont worry too much about the value, it is more to deter people asking the cash priceit. First a little about this particular pistol, was built by Mauser Oberndorf in 1938 for the german army. It served through the war, ending up in Austria. There are only 2 parts of this gun that do not have a matching serial number, and here is why. The luger was rebarreled and reblued for service in the Bundes Heer, or Austrian federal army post war. This work was done at the Vienna arsenal according to the proofings that were applied to the frame and barrel at that time. As is common with the BH pistols the mag and sideplate do not match the gun. the rest of the gun matches right down to the numbered firing pin. Luckily the mag that is in the gun is a nice late war fxo which feeds much more reliably than the early mags (plus it is a $350 magazine on its own) and since I was going to keep this one I did range test it (I have run around 100rnds through this gun with zero malfunctions). The bore is mirror bright and the grips are new replacements (yes I have the numbers matching grip panels as well). Recently inherited my great grandfathers bringback luger and so this one will be traded off rather than sit in my safe. I am looking for a nice 1911 (no Asian or Philippine made guns), .44 or .357 mag autos, I do collect milsurps so those are always welcome, maybe a decent ar or ak setup, XDm .45 with the 5.25"" barrel plus cash (really want to convert one to .460 Rowland) other nice .45s, Ruger Gunsight Scout, will do multi gun trades, can add or take cash to make a deal, I do travel all over for serious deals, high quality .308 rifle either tactical or target, who knows I love to shoot and collect all sorts of firearms, worst I can say is a polite no thanks."

    The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a two-tone or Nitron® (shown) finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom rosewood grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.

It's in excellent shape. I am selling this because it is sitting around not getting used, NOT because I am desperate for money. So, while I will consider reasonable offers, NO TRADES or LOW-BALL offers please! You must have a CCW plus valid driver's license OR valid pistol permit plus driver's license (yes I realize this is not a pistol but I do not care as the pistol permit is my way of verifying you are worthy of being able to even obtain a permit). You can meet me in or near Greenville, but I will not drive more than 5-10 miles ie you will have to come meet me. Thanks for looking!"

I also have a full (440 round) Russian spam can of ammo (manufactured 1973, still sealed).  Also, a hard case which fits the rifle, a gun sock which fits the rifle, a set of original pouches (I have two sets, so the other one could be included too), the military issue cleaning/adjustment kit, the military issue shoulder strap, bayonet (I have two, and don't want either, so both could be included) and 5 stripper clips.

I bought two of these rifles a couple of months ago with all of the extra stuff I just listed, but bought a much more fun gun shortly afterwards, so never bothered shooting them.  However, the rifle I'm selling was shot by the previous owner, and did well.  It's a complete gun, ready to shoot (I've even adjusted the firing pin).  The bore and rifling are both good, and the crown is very good.

I have over $2130+ invested in this rifle package. I dont need to sell it just want a different type of hunting rig, I will continue to hunt with it throughout the season until it sells. I will sell it as a package right now OR WILL SEPARATE AFTER DEER RIFLE SEASON.

Priced as follows..

Whole package- $1650 everything included
Upper- $600 includes complete YHM upper, flip up sights, and comp with original box and packaging.
Optic and larue mount- $350
Lower receiver and weapon light- these items are not for sell as seperate items, must purchase as package 
Mags and Ammo- $150

This is zeroed for 100yards, the scope mount is detachable and returns to zero perfectly. I have harvested a big 8 point buck this year with it. 
The seekins billet lower can be adjusted to take out slack between the receivers and trigger. I cut a piece of styrofoam and taped in the the E-Mod stock as a cheek riser for the scope. Works great and is comfy, puts my eye right on the scope quickly. The BCG gay key is properly staked. The YHM phantom flashhider/comp works terrific. Vltor EMOD is solid as a rock! You will love this rifle. It has 41 rounds of premium ammo fired through it. 


The TLR game spotter produces a long range beam to 350 meters if you wanted to do some night shooting or legal night hunting.

Most interested in pump action, but will consider others if priced right. She enjoys shooting, and wants to go do some hunting, so she needs her own gun. I'm not looking to drop a small fortune tho, I'll just be honest. If I wanted to drop a small fortune I'd go buy a new one. I am just looking for a good dependable economical shotgun. Older guns are fine as long as they shoot well and are in good SAFE working condition.

Rifle was built by Ed sweet who has been gun smithing for about 47

The rifle now has about 330 rounds fired give or take. The last round fired dropped a buck in its tracks at 771 yds. The farthest I have shot at targets was 1309 yds. As far as groups it will hold .5 MOA if the shooter does their part but It has hardly shot any 100 yrd groups and when it did, it was just off the bipod on my belly so I have not shot any 1/8 MOA groups but am pretty positive the rifle could do it if it were on a bench. But for the most of its life, it has messed rocks days up anywhere from 400-1300 yrds. Will provide load data and I have tested many powders in this rifle (us869, h1000, rl50, rl33, retumbo, and rl25) h1000 is what I stuck with due to its temp stability. I've only shot 180 gr Bergers which with 75.5 gr h1000 under it touching the lands is right at 3100 fps. With the 1-8.4"" twist barrel it will stabilize the new 195gr Bergers if they ever show! Will throw in aprox 670 180 gr berger hunting bullets for addition price. Buyer pays shipping. Rifle was broke in properly and has never been fired more then 20 times without cleaning. 

Partial trade I'd be interested in would be Vetronix terrapin. Or anything with Kirby Allen's name on it. 

As of right now I do not want to split up due to if it doesn't sell soon, ill just keep it so scope stays until the rifle is 100% sold.

There is one scratch on the forend of the stock and the paint on the bolt has worn out a bit due to opening the bolt. Besides that its in great condition. 

Scope has one tiny scratch on the top of the tube which was bought from sportsman with the scratch but besides that it is in perfect condition as well. 

The rifle is pretty light would guess around 9 pounds its a great packing around rifle with a very far capability! I wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger on and animal at 1000 yards or even farther. And whitetail don't like 180 gr Bergers! Have shot 2 deer one at 771 and another at 589 yards and both dropped dead in their tracks!

Willing to hear offers on trades but please don't waste my time asking to trade for a stock Remington. 

$6500 for everything will only ship it in the skb case due to it high quality. Buyer pays shipping and am willing to meet up if in the Montana area so you can shoot it yourself if wanted.

Contact me at REDACTED. Below is a discription of the USP. Retails for about $1000.00 and I've seen them sell new for around $850.00.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges. Based on the full size USP models, this pistol combines compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot two finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly concealable pistol. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame."

(unless you're a museum curator, ...or me)-
 A group of eight Original Antique Battle & Dress Swords/Sabres dating from about 1740 to around 1900. And even if you do work in a museum; it probably lacks a good 'Museum Quality' Unicorn Skull.
 These Swords would (& do) look great in a Man Cave, Redneck Castle, or similar dwelling where foo foo is strictly just not acceptable.
 FACT: Proximity to Battle Swords actually raises testosterone levels in men & prevents....'wimpiness'. 
 Another FACT: I'd really like to sell these all as a collection too- because as any real man knows, it's a crying shame (& often painful) to break up a 'set' of testosterone producing....things.
 What (exactly) are these things? 
 Well; as near as I can tell....<1>A French & Indian Wars era (1740s) Small Sword <2> Huge 1796 Pattern British Cavalry Sabre w/ Sharkskin Grips <3> Moroccan 'Nimcha', European Napoleonic era (1810) 'trade blade' mounted in a traditional Rhino Horn Hilt <4> The most ornate 1822 Pattern French Cavalry Sabre I have seen anywhere with Fancy Etched Blade/ Deluxe Scabbard probably presented to a Confederate CW Officer, (very interesting provenance) <5>German NCO Sword (1840s) possible Confederate Civil War use <6>1875 Spanish Artillery Officer's Sword/Scabbard (Toledo) <7>Deluxe Grade Prussian 1889 Officer's Sword/Scabbard <8>Italian Cavalry 'Quill Back' Sabre Circa 1900
 I'm asking a very fair $2ooO for the Swords, which are all in fine condition for their age & intended purpose, (like myself... except I'm still working on that 'intended purpose' part), & if ya need a Unicorn Skull (& who doesn't, right?), we might be able to swing a deal on that too.
 After all; the Unicorn Skull DOES look great w/ those Old Swords- & it is likely the ONLY Unicorn related item around that actually raises testosterone,- not like that pink sparkly foo foo unicrap imported by- (& sold to)- people that really need to re-evaluate some priorities in life.
 If you are seriously interested in these blades, I will be happy to provide details/pics & may trade (in part) for Silver, or Old S&Ws, (unless you have an even better idea).
