It comes with the Bushnell Sportsman 3-9x40mm scope fitted with Leupold base and rings, the scope is as clear as my Nikon Prostaff and Buckmasters scopes.  The rifle is very clean overall, I took a pic of the only issue I could find on the metal finish, which are two light marks barely visible in the pic, but want to be as accurate as possible.  The wood stock is just about perfect, the only issue is in the same barrel close-up pic, around the sling mount where it rubbed off some of the finish, obviously a normal area of wear if you add a sling, so not a biggie.  Overall, this is a very clean wood stock model Savage.

It has an FNMI 20"" 1/7 twist heavy (will stabilize the heavier bullets) chrome lined heavy barrel (not bull barrel), rated for 5.56 and .223, has the three pronge flash hider.  The quad rail is a Knights Armament with the different rail cover kit & front grip.  They have provided the military and law enforcement with their quad rails for many years, if not decades now, so you know it is a proven system.  The upper receiver looks great as far as the finish goes, the rail has marks here and there from normal use as does the barrel.  I took a pic of the underside gas block area where barrel either took a good hit along the way or the mark was done during manufacturing/assembly process (this is my guess), but it functions fine of course, it's just cosmetic.  Bottom line, this upper is not a safe queen, so you won't be afraid to take it out.  This upper can of course be used with any standard AR-15 lower.  

$600 cash firm ($20 extra for shipping) or I will consider good trades of equal or higher value.

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™, “Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.  Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.  Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.  The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.  To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

Up for your consideration

Winchester 1897 12 ga shotgun
Shotgun is the ""Brush"" Takedown model 26"" Barrell
Serial numbers are matching. 
Shotgun has a nice patina finish and I have not found
any rust or pitting. Bore is bright and shiny.

Shotgun functions properly and the Take-Down locks up nice and tight.
Serial number places this shotgun in the grand year of 1903

Accompanied the shotgun is vintage Moose Brand shotgun case
which has 2 sleeves in which the shotgun can be carried in. 
Case is soiled but in good condition, one snap dosnt snap that tight
Others snaps work properly.

This case dates back to the early 1900's and came with the shotgun
when I acquired it, so the case will also be included.


Price is: $400 which includes the case 

I would also consider partial trade/cash for 7.62 NATO ammo
especially South African 7.62 battle packs.

It is in very good condition and fires without any hiccups.  Comes with one mag and holster.  9mm ammo available for reasonable prices with purchase.

The whole family of the ""Star"" pistol was (and stil is) manufactured by the Spain-based company Bonifacio Echeverria, SA. Back in the 1920s the company began to develop semi-automatic pistols, based on Browning-designed Colt M1911 design. These pistols were more or less similar to the original M1911, but usually chambered for 9x19mm Luger or 9x23mm Largo (Bergmann-Bayard) rounds.
The Star mod. A was chambered for 9mm Largo ammunition and mostly used in the Spain. The mod. B was chambered for 9x19mm Luger and had been widely exported into many countries, including Hitlers' Germany, and had been used during World War 2. The Star model P had been chambered for .45ACP cartridge and mostly intended for American market. The model BM was a compact version of the mod. B with shorter barrel and slide.
The Model B Super replaced the Mod. B in the production and in the Spain Army arsenals, and had been in production in 1946 - 1965, and had been in use by Spanish military until early 1990s, when new Star M30 had been adopted as a new service sidearm.
The Star pistols, mod. A, B and P were similar in design and differed mostly in caliber. All these pistols were recoil operated, locked breech, single action pistols that used Browning-deigned, linked barrel locking principle. The models A Super and B Super differed from mod. A and B, respectively, only in that the Super model utilised linkless locking scheme, similar to that used in Browning High Power pistols.
Being very similar in appearance to the Colt m1911A1 pistols, the Star pistols had some differences.
First, these pistols had no automated grip safety, and no detachable backstrap/mainspring housing
Second, Star pistols had simplified trigger/sear design with single trigger link, and pivoting trigger
Third, external safety swiths locked the hammer, not the sear
Fourth, Star pistols featured exetrnal extractors
Fifth, as noted above, Star A Super and B Super also had different barrel locking/unlocking
In general, all these pistols were of high quality, and offered good performance"

This pistol has been to Wilson Combat and had their tough coat finish applied (Very dark green) as well as their ambi safety and extended beavertail grip safety. I was told the pistol was given a mild tuning while at Wilson as well and the proof is in the trigger.

May be interested in something other than a 9mm, if you have something else let me know, who knows.  Possibly Ruger 10/22 with cash, or another pistol."

It is engraved with ducks unlimited underneath, just in front of the trigger guard. Trigger guard is engraved also. Sale comes with case and both barrels. Only problem is the spring in the guard mechanisim, broke on me. I was told you could easily get a new one from Mossberg for little or free. I have a contact for Mossberg if wanted. I just have never gotten around to it. The gun has really only been fired a handfull of times. Price I believe is a steal cause I've seen ones sell for $800 with only one barrel, and combos sell for over $1000. Buyer must have a valid FOID card. Local pick up only. I may be able to meet in or arround local area. Gun will be sold as is. No warranties or refunds after sale. Illinois residents only."

Anyone not familiar with his work can find it here : http://sre.belosic.com/. This hawk is the smaller version of his Anubis and was really the perfect size in my opinion. This one has a Black Durakote finish on both the steel and handle, The K9 Skull Crusher Pommel, sharpened Under Beard and Canvas Micarta Handles. It's been a great tool, it just needs a new home. The handles were modified by a friend and I to give them more grip after I applied Dura Kote. Please note that non uniform filing was my doing and not Jared's, his work is awesome and this hawk is no exception. The Dura Kote was also applied after purchase. This is definitely a user and is priced to reflect that.

Here's a blurb from Jared's site :

Aureus, named after the Golden Jackal is the more wicked, demented, and generally meaner little brother to the Anubis tomahawk.Designed with input from Army special forces soldiers, this close quarters battle tomahawk is made to intimidate, and cut like crazy.With sharp edges all around, and a molle ready locking kydex sheath for instant deployment and secure carry, the Jackal rounds out an urban or wilderness combat kit with both deadly and utilitarian purpose.
All of the features of our “Anubis” ultimate tomahawk are packed into a shorter more compact package.

Specs:
Material: High bainite Carbon 1095 steel
Weight: 1.5 lbs
Overall length: 14″ including optional K9 skull cruncher pommel (+$50)

It is lightly used but in great shape and has never been shot. It also has been professionally inspected, serviced, cleaned and reassembled. This armor can be hard to find and is highly saught after by people who want good fitting, light weight armor with great coverage. This is the same armor issued to the German military as well as the reserved GSG-9 German police. People who have got this armor like it because it allows freedom of movement as well as it has the neck and shoulder guards. It is level 2a rated and is meant to protect against handgun and shrapnel ( like 380,9mm,40cal etc. ) it can easily be upgraded by adding another set of inserts and also plates to take it to 3a and 4a rated. But it works great as just 2a and 3 a because if its fit , coverage and freedom of movement. Even with added panels they still fit great and are light and allow good mobility. I purchased these same vests for myself and my family after alot of research and searching to find. But in doing so i had to buy a small bulk order of them so i am just trying to sell the extra ones i dont need in order to get back some of the extra money i had to spend in order to get this model. I am selling them for less then i have seen them sold for. I also can get extra panels if you want them to upgrade the vest and if you want plates designed to stop rifle rounds i can refer you to where you can get the ones i feel are the best as well as the best deal.

Zero Tolerance Knives

ZT is proud to offer the model 0301, designed by Ken Onion and Strider - a top-quality combat knife equipped with the patented SpeedSafe® assisted opening system.

SpeedSafe® enables users to deploy the blade one-handed - using their choice of an ambidextrous thumb stud or an equally ambidextrous index finger protrusion.

In addition to SpeedSafe, the 0301 features a tough S30V stainless-steel blade with ZT's unique ""Tiger Stripe"" Tungsten DLC coating. The S30V blade steel is designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The Tungsten DLC tiger striping also provides a non-reflective camouflaged surface. 

The 0301's Ranger Green scales are made of 3-D machined G-10 and titanium for incredible mechanical strength and a supersecure grip. The 0301 also features a 3/8 inch hex head pivot shaft nut that makes field adjustments fast and easy with minimal tools.

In addition, this dynamic folding knife comes with a reversible or removable clip for tip-up or tip-down carry - so it remains securely stowed until the user needs it.

Second owner. Have title. Make me an offer!

The Good:
- Newer Transfer Case (never been engaged with drive shaft)
- A/C works
- Alternator is only a week old
- Starter has been replaced in the last 9000 miles
- Flex plate and torque converter are newer
- Power Steering pump, water pump, thermostat, A/C converter all recently replaced
- Newer Duralast battery
- New Tires (less than 10K miles)
- Starts and runs
- Lights (interior and exterior), Power Windows, and Power door locks are all working
- Auto Transmission with no issues
- Replaced rusted brake lines

The Bad:
- No four wheel drive shaft (Bent when original transfer case blew)
- Dent in hood (Hood latch has been replaced)
- Exhaust has been cut in the past, but is functional.
- Interior is decent, but headliner had exploding dr. pepper hit it.

Took it to Coughlin in Marysville in 2010, asked them to take a look at the torque converter, and they told me it needed a crank bearing. Turns out, it wasn't the engine at all, it was the flex plate and torque converter that needed replaced. Pulled the engine for no reason in spring of 2010. Needless to say, I was upset when I found the issue on the flex plate, and they refunded me my $188.

Engine has been pulled and has a rattle from a cut star headed bolt. Used the cut bolt as a guide when putting the engine back in, but now it rattles in it's hole. Rear drums need replaced, but internal shoes and master cylinders were replaced in 2010, and it's only had about 15K miles since then. Just replaced rusted brake lines on Saturday.

I don't know which transmission it has. Its never been replaced, no issues, and its an automatic. The 4WD can be engaged, don't know what the front differential is like. Might need flushed before setting up 4WD. I had ATS in Marysville replace the transfer case in 2008, and I've never replaced the 4 wheel drive shaft. Haven't needed the 4WD shaft, but transfer case does engage properly.

Need $1200 to cover parts and tires. Good fixer upper for someone who knows what they're doing.

Engine runs strong. I have a nice truck and don't have time to work on it anymore. I'm selling it because I don't have the time to work on it, and I need to pay off some credit card debt."

Holster, gun, model, vest, et cetera not included. JUST THE STRAPS.

The gun & holster should be up where it can be reached easier! Thus, the Chesty Puller Straps, named in honor of one of our nation's most highly decorated and truly heroic Marines, General Chesty Puller came about. This chest harness is very handy while wearing chest waders or a back pack, or worn with life jackets while boating, and worn under a coat in the winter. It is a rugged, comfortable, versatile, adjunct to your pancake holster (sold separately). What it is not, is a James Bond or Dirty Harry, style of concealment shoulder holster.

The straps connect through the belt slots on your pancake holster (3 slots required). SRH strives to make this as simple and rugged as possible, while still making it comfortable to wear and use for weeks at a time. This item fits a wide range of folks from 5'6"" and 130# to 6'3"" and 325#, 64"" chest is the widest. If you need more strap length, you can add on the 15"" extension.

Made from oil tanned, oxblood colored harness leather, or black; this strap system allows you to convert your Pancake hip holster to a chest rig. (Holster not included.)
