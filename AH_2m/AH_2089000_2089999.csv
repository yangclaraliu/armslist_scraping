I dont even want to sell it but i just received word of a deployment on short notice and need the money to move my daughter and wife back home before i go. I have a hard case, manual, and the integral lock keys. Has a rail to mount lasers/lights etc. and uses a glock rear sight and a sig front sight; gives you options in a more affordable pistol.  its a great cwp gun, got it less than a week ago and i regret letting it go, but need the money."

Local (Mpls/St. Paul Metro) trades considered, but cash is king. I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll. 

Be sure to check my other listings for other great items that I am selling. 

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case.

Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability. It still remains “the standard” that everyone tries to imitate, but no one duplicates.
This pistol features a Brushed Stainless Steel receiver and slide, boasting exceptional strength and a striking appearance. High profile white dot sights are fitted to the slide, and a spur hammer is equipped. The trigger is a solid aluminum unit with grooves. Composite grips are installed, contributing to a sleek, two tone look. A standard 1911 thumb safety and grip safety improve handling confidence. The ejection port is flared and lowered to improve reliability, and this pistol uses Colt's 80s series firing system with single action operation

The bolt is a mis-match (common during re-arsenaling) but the metal on the rifle is in flawless condition.  The wood is Canadian maple and in original conditon (I've only conditioned in with linseed oil). This particular Enfield was part of a contingent of arms shipped to Egypt following World War II, and is noted by the Arabic script on the brass unit disk on the buttstock. Rifle has the period-correct micrometer sight which makes this rifle very accurate and will include a ""pigsticker"" bayonet.  It has been a safe queen along with the rest of my Enfields.

The Thunder 380 is intended for general civilian use. This conceptualization might be appreciated in the context of handgun use and law in many South American countries, where the Thunder 380 is quite popular, and .380 ACP is frequently the most powerful cartridge allowed to civilians. Nevertheless, a number of military and law enforcement forces have included Bersa 380's in their tables of equipment, including the Ecuadorian Air Force. The Thunder 380 bears a loose resemblance to the Walther PPK, but is sold for about half the price.

The wood has either been refinished or is a replacement, it is genuine American Walnut and it looks like its supposed too but no cartouches. The stock matchs the upper wood very nicely. The gun is in excellent condition with 98% of the original military finish, every metal piece that they marked is marked H&R. I don't know all that much about Garands so I had the expert look it over, he gave it the thumbs up, he thought with a stock that was as nice as the rest of the gun it would be a 3000.00 to 3500.00 gun. I don't need near that much.The bore is excellent, I don't have a guage but i'm sure its not a worn out gun."

The scope I had on it I had to sell for some bills, which was a nice Nikon and with that scope it was DEAD on!!! I shot two rounds with the new scope today just to see how far off it was and it does need sighting in. The scope is a good one, no Nikon but its a good scope with good reviews, 3-9x-40mm. I only want to sell this gun to get a .243. I always hunted with that caliber until 09 when the rossi was purchased. It does more damage to the meat than I like, even with the ammo I shoot. I am open to any trade, I like guns period. But a savage accutrigger .243 is what I'm looking. Open to other options though. NO semi auto rifles, no shotguns, and NO Remington 770's!!!!!!

This is not a collectors item but a field ready weapon.

    I have a fully refinished 1954 Chinese Type 53 Carbine with Bayonet. 
This is the Chinese carbine copy of the very popular full size Russian Mosin Nagant also chambered 7.62 x 54R. This weapon came to me in fair to poor condition. I spent many hours slowly drawing the cosmoline out of the Chu wood and the steel of the rifle and bolt. I  hand sanded the wood down to a baby smooth 600 grit finish and painstakingly stained and sealed and then coated the stock with 6 individually sanded coats of polyurethane to give it a beautiful ( I think) deep red purple semi gloss finish and reassembled the rifle.
 The trigger has been lightened with new spring and shims. 
You'll have to take my word for it but the rifle had never been fired when I received it and I put one round through it just to ensure it functions properly. 
I have given it the ""sticky bolt"" treatment, polishing the bore and bolt assembly. 
The entire barrel, bore, trigger assembly and guard, butt plate, bayonet, etc. assembly of the rifle with the exception of the bolt assembly was re-blued. 
Comes with the wrench and I think I have a field kit somewhere too.

I have recently discovered skeet shooting and am separately selling this rifle and a Smith and Wesson 3000 12 gauge  pump to facilitate purchase of my first sporting shotgun. 

I also have available over 620 rounds of ammo, 440 still in spam can, for this weapon, at reasonable price.

Package deal for T53 and Ammo $250 obo.

It shoulders better than any weapon I have...it's just a natural fit when you bring it up. Muzzle brake is also installed.

5 in the tube +1 in the chamber.
This was a police duty trade in I purchased a while back. 
I have been all through the action and have put around 50 rounds down the tube shooting trap and skeet. 
The rifle operated flawlessly and I would keep it for home defense but I  would like to get a purpose built sporting shotgun. 
Instead of re-bluing the barrel I hvlp sprayed it with a satin black enamel and baked it on. 
It looks nice and is durable as can be and will now stand up to all kinds of abuse. 
I have replaced the front bead.
It has a somewhat different style synthetic stock than I've seen on other examples and think it gives it a much meaner look.
Pics are low quality and were taken after reassembly from paint.

This rifle was patterned after Remington's very popular and reliable 870 model and I like shooting it better than the Mossberg 500 I once had. Some shotgun purists out there say it is a bastardized copy or somehow lower quality because S&W outsourced the manufacturing to Japan. I think it is of great quality for what it is and am only selling it to break in to sport shotgunning.
I am available weekdays after 5 pm, weekends are more open.
Asking $250.

Will include a external 5 shell sleeve that fits over the stock and 40 rifled slugs for an extra $20!"

No classification on here for LLAMA
Gorgeous Llama .45 Full Size 1911 .45.  Box, instruction manual, unfilled out warranty card.  Made in 1980.  Hardly a scratch on it.  Clean barrel.  No rust.  I've owned for over 5 years and never fired it.  Blueing is so pretty it looks better than Colt Gold Cup's I've owned.  Almost purple in color.  They just don't make them like this anymore.  Beats any of the low end 1911's you will find today.  New Chinese, Rock Island, ATI, STI, and other no name junk sells for more than $400 today.  Fit is perfect, and finish is perfect.  I know it is not a collectable gun, but I cannot give it away.  It's not like anyone is going to make another one.  This was once the poor man's .45, and I have owned them since I was a little kid.  You might find bad reviews on them, but the versions I have owned always went bang bang.  If you want a cheapie plastic gun buy one.  Trigger pull is crisp, and clean.  I need $400 cash and I wont budge, otherwise will keep it beside my pillow every night like I always have.  I sleep well.

GLOCK 21 GEN 4
Purchased new by me on July 27th of this year.
100rds fired through it with zero issues.
Has standard Glock sights.
The only mark on the gun is on the trigger guard. I sanded the one edge with 2000 grit sandpaper to eliminate ""Glock Knuckle"", if you are unfamiliar with that term Google it. It was not a hack job, does not affect the function of the gun, and does not look bad or horrible. I have included a pic of this area for those who are deeply concerned by this minor modification.

Comes with the following:
All factory components (box, papers, 3-13rd mags, backstraps - yes the new updated beavertail ones, etc.)
Glock brand Extended slide release (original included)
Blackhawk Serpa Holster RH-black (paddle and belt mount)

There for a while in certain areas they bumped it to $1000 and my area was one of them. Long story short I got screwed, the policy was supposedly changed and I got 1000 ""Recognition 4Me"" points about a year later than I was supposed to. An HR rep got my money for the guy I got hired in and the best I was able to get out of it was $225 in Cabelas Gift Cards. Its better than nothing but long ways from what I was told I would get. Anyway I could deal with the cash more than the gift cards right now and would like to drop them. The unfortunate thing is that they sent me 9 $25 gift cards instead of one gift card for the whole amount and they are the online cards that can be used both on the net and in store but to be used in store you have to print them off.

Lot prices start at $48,500 for 38 acres and can be very negotiable for the right buyer (neighbor). Overhead or underground electric power is on some lots and can be brought in on lots where it is needed. Land is located on CR 44 (Big Hollow Road), 3 miles N/E of Lake Hattie, 6 miles east from National Forest and just east of Wild Horse Ranch. This land is ideal for those who want to park an RV or build a cabin and enjoy beautiful vistas with very few man made objects within miles. Personally, we are using it for a bug out when the SHTF along with being a nice retreat to target shoot and enjoy the solitude. We would be particularly interested in having like-minded neighbors that would appreciate a place to stock up and feel secure if/when the SHTF. We can build a cabin onsite using classic log building techniques .. our prototype cabin built last summer is shown in the pictures. We also have a sawmill and logs onsite, along with general construction equipment to get your property easily and economically usable for your particular needs. Please note that drilling for water is a hit and miss ordeal in this area, but you can easily haul your own water just like most everybody else living west of Laramie, or have it commercially delivered for $90 per 1500 gallons. The City of Laramie also has two high volume water dispensing depots designed for rural residents. One depot is in Laramie and the other depot is at the water treatment plant which is 10 miles from the property. Bottom line is, hauling water and a cistern holding tank is far more economical and feasible for a getaway cabin. Water well, casing and pump is estimated to be around $20K and that buys a lot of water at $.25/100 gallons at the depots.I am a licensed civil engineer and have lived in Laramie 30 years. I have a local Laramie phone number and address. If interested, shoot me an email and include your phone number so we can talk about being neighbors. All pictures, with the exception of the cabin picture and the ""big valley"" picture, are of the actual property available. The dirt road picture is of the private road that runs through the middle of the development. I look forward to hearing from you!"

Remington model 10-A, 26"" barrel 12 ga, take down model. all numbers matching. Only 3500 of the 10-A were made. From what i have read, the 10-A models were used in WW2 by the USMC to train aerial gunners. However i see no ordnance stamps. For being 2 months short of it's 90th birthday this ol vet is in remarkable unrestored/ original condition. there is one small area of pitting on top of the receiver, but nothing too bad at all. It has 1 minor issue that prevents it from being used. A broken sear spring as seen in the pic below. It's a $10 part readily available online. The sear spring from a standard model 10 will interchange. This just isn't the shotgun for me so i'm not interested in restoring it, but would rather just trade it out for something i'll enjoy.

I am looking to trade for one of a couple of guns. In no special order i'd like an sks for the wife , a norinco in wood furniture is fine, she isn't picky at all. A Hi Point in .45 cal. only. I'd also like a single action 'cowboy gun' in .45 LC or .44 magnum. I'm not concerned about aesthetics, just that they cycle & fire properly.

The value as the 10-A sits now is $200-250 in the collectors circles. Restored and firing, $400. 

This was Remington's very first repeating shotgun. Introduced in 1908 and discontinued in 1929. This is an amazing piece of history & one any serious shotgun collector needs in their collection. 

I also want to ad this is a HUGE shotgun. In the pics below with me holding it, I'm 6'1"" and 250lbs. I look like a kid holding 'daddys gun' ...lol. I picked this up last week & have decided it's just not the shotgun for me so i'm looking to trade out for something i will enjoy using. What do you have?

Its a few years old but still in good shape, I got it naked and added an arrow rest and sights to it.  It is currently set up for a 29 inch draw but this is adjustable, and the draw weight is adjustable between 50 and 70 pounds.  Also has a loop for usage with a trigger, but I've been shooting it with a glove.  Will come with a couple of arrows and some field points.  
The only thing I can say against it is that I have not had a chance to sight in the sights.

I'm wanting to trade for a crossbow, I'm not particular about brand or make but needs to be in good shape and it would be nice if it has some bolts to go with it.  I'd also like to have one with a 150lb draw.

From what I can tell looking around online, this is around $700 worth of parts, but feel free to negotiate or make offers. I'm also willing to entertain trades for anything I might find useful or interesting, firearms related or not.
I would prefer to sell it all together.

Colt 6921 upper receiver. Has C and keyhole forge marks, and is stamped M4 above the gas tube hole. Has T marks on the rails. Never used, but has been kicking around in my parts bin for a while and there are some dings here and there on the rails and such. No wear marks or anything on the inside.

Colt 14.5"" barrel, front sight post, and barrel nut. Has the O stamp, date stamp, etc. Also has the front plate thing for mounting standard handguards. I'm sure I don't need to, but I'll say it anyway... I hold no responsibility for what you do with it once you've purchased it from me, and if falls on you to ensure you're compliant with all applicable laws (i.e. if you are not putting it on a SBR or pistol lower, you must have a muzzle device of 1.5"" or longer permanently attached via pinning or welding).

Gas tube... new and unused.

I also have a charging handle that was replaced with fancy tacticool one that I can throw in with the upper. Definitely ""broken in"" as shown in the pics and does not have the latch or spring.

Email me with any questions or if you'd like more pics of anything.

I cleaned the receiver and barrel, and put a light coat of oil on the barrel (rust prevention), before taking pics, and there's a little bit pooled up in the barrel extension."

I paid $90 plus shipping for this set from gunbroker ($105 total), but it didn't fit my Stephens 350 Ithaca 37 clone.

Old price: $65.  Second price:  $50

NEW PRICE: $35 very very firm (add $10 for shipping anywhere in CONUS if not FTF)

If you have a decent scope/rings/base and or a bipod on it, I'd consider buying the entire package from you. 

I have cash in hand! Serious buyer and willing to travel a bit to meet up.

Please keep in mind when pricing your gun that I can buy these any day of the week for around 550.00 out-the-door. I'm not opposed to a used gun however, the pricing should reflect that."
