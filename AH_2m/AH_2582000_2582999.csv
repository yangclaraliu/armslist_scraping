The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models."

I am selling a Ruger LCR in 22 WMR (Winchester Magnum Rimfire), also known as .22 Magnum. It has a 6 shot capacity and is Double Action Only. There is no hammer for Single Action. The revolver has had 300 rounds total through it now. The first 100 rounds shot fine, but would take a little more muscle to extract the spent casings. I had Ruger replace the cylinder and crane and then ran another 200 rounds after that. All fired/extracted fine, no issues at all. As far as finish wear, there is some wear on the back of the frame where the extractor rubs against from opening and closing the cylinder (you can see it in the 2nd pic).

The revolver will include everything in the box that it comes with when purchased new (gun lock with keys, zipper carry pouch to store the revolver, manual, etc) Also included with the LCR are two 5-Star speed loaders. You can't go wrong with Ruger. They will take care of you. Their customer service is one of the best in the industry.

This can be an option for those who are looking into a CCW weapon.

I am asking $350 firm. I will only meet locally (I'm only willing to drive so far, depending on distance). I'd prefer to meet at a gun shop, IF possible (I've met other previous buyers at a local gun shop called The Gun Zone). Must be willing to sign a bill of sale and have a valid form of identification.

For sale is a new PTR 91 GI 308 battle rifle. I put this package together to be the ultimate survival rifle. It can handle the versatile and plentiful .308/7.62 NATO rifle round. This is the updated PTR model with the correct barrel fluting, allowing it to fire any type of ammo. Add this with the special parkerized coating, and this rifle is tough inside and out. PTR designed this rifle to be tough as well as accurate, with a match grade barrel.  Included with this package are the following:

-PTR 91 GI Rifle only 10 rounds fired through it.
-Original PTR case and paperwork (including an added HK armorer's manual)
-Approx 200 rounds of 308 ammo (combination of brass and steel cased)
-The rifle has a custom-fitted MFI low-profile sight mount on top. These are very hard to come by and provide a rock-solid base for mounting a sight.
-Approximately 35 20rd aluminum mags (many are like new, the rest are fully functional but surplus)
-Two extra complete lower assemblies including trigger packs (one steel SEF and one plastic SEF).
-An entire box of spare parts: Enough to rebuild almost the entire rifle (4 locking pieces, a full ""survival parts set"" from RTG, extra firing pins, springs, take-down pins, extra trigger parts, etc)
-A box of 308 blanks, and a rare HK-marked blank-firing adapter
-A brand new, genuine Eickhorn HK91 bayonet from Germany, new in wrap.
-FOUR full stock sets (3 surplus HK G3 olive drab stock sets, and one brand new PTR tropical green stock set, all with full recoil assemblies)
-An additional rare HK factory wide front hand-guard (green) (not military surplus, brand new)
-A bag of extra pistol grips (green and black) with screws
-Two HK factory leather slings
-An HK factory cleaning kit
-An HKpro rear sight tool

With this package, you will have all the extra stocks and spare parts you will ever need. Paint each stock set and a matching magazine a different camo pattern for the seasons. Keep you rifle going with the armorer's manual and spare parts without ever needing anything else.  This is one of the best all-around battle rifles you can get for under $2k.  This package will set you up to go to the range tomorrow, or to put somewhere safe with the parts for a rainy day when you need it.

$1400.  I will cover all FFL fees."

I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

Only about 19,000 of these were made and almost all of those went straight to the Philippines and few survived in any condition, let alone with as much original bluing as this one retains. The Model 1909 was an ""emergency"" attempt to provide a double action .45 caliber side arm to US Army forces in the Philippines to fight the Moros in the Southern Philippine islands. Prior to the Model 1909, the US Army standard sidearms were .38 caliber, which had very little effect on attacking fanatical Islamist Moros, who were often drugged up (See my other auctions for a Colt 1901 issued to the 7th Cavalry in the Philippines in .38). In response to a call from the field for a larger caliber weapon, the Army brought out old Model 1873 Revolvers in .45 Long Colt as a stop gap measure until the Model 1909 was fielded. This Model 1909 is serial number 42821 and it is all matching with the serial number on the frame, crane, cylinder release latch, both grips and butt. The Cylinder retains 90%+ of the original blue finish and has the ""RAC"" inspector mark on the rear cylinder face, which stands for Rinaldo A. Carr, who is the famous Colt inspector of the Model 1873 Models. Wear is generally on the front edges and to the rear of the cylinder between two chambers. The Barrel is marked ""COLT D.A. 45"" on the left side, on top it has the Colt Patent information and the bottom of the barrel is marked ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY,"" and ""RAC"". Barrel is where the predominant wear is located on this revolver and it largely carries a pewter finish with original bluing at the rear 1/3rd of the barrel where it joins the frame. The bore is, however, very clean with strong rifling. The Frame has a very clear and sharp Rampant Colt on the left side. Right side of the Frame has the inspection initials of Rinaldo Carr (""RAC"") as well as the Army acceptance stamp of ""WGP,"" which stands for Major Walter G. Penfield, US Army, who inspected and approved Model 1909s from serial number 42,801 through 49,503. Frame retains 90%+ of the original high quality Colt blue finish. The Cylinder Latch has the last 4 matching numbers and has 95% of the original blue finish. The Butt is marked ""US/ARMY/MODEL/1909/No/42/821"" and has the lanyard loop. The original walnut grips are in excellent condition and both are inspector marked ""RAC"" on the bottom and both correctly have the serial number penciled on the inside of each grip. The front and back grip strap finish is starting to turn a plum brown and pewter color. This is a very rare Colt revolver with a unique history fighting the Moros in the Philippines and is in incredible condition given that service. This Colt is C&R eligible"

If you're a shooting enthusiast with a dual passion for varmint hunting and driving tacks at the shooting range, the Acu-Bolt is the rifle to add to your collection. This all-stainless steel single-shot bolt action rifle chambered in  .22 Magnum . Every aspect of this handsomely crafted rifle is built to deliver the highest level of accuracy.

Henry Repeating Arms has included a 4x scope with a cantilever scope mount at no extra charge. If you prefer not to use a scope, it is also outfitted with Williams Fire Sights. The illuminated two green dot adjustable rear sight and contrasting red front sight allow for a simple, consistent and quickly acquired sight picture.

It sports a tough, weather resistant one piece synthetic stock. The beavertailed forearm with progressive width allows for sure handling. Its semi-heavy stainless steel barrel delivers the tight clusters you varmint hunters demand for a successful day in the fields. If you tend to do a good deal of moving about while hunting, the 4 1/4 pound weight won't be a burden.

The feel and design of the rifle's stock will enable you to be on target almost instantly. As you know, those critters aren't going to stand around for you to get a bead on them. It has been ergonomically designed to fit adult shooters beautifully as well as some smaller framed shooters. Wrap-around checkering, a pistol grip and a European style bolt handle provide impressive, classic great looks.

Like all Henry rifles, the Acu-Bolt's one-piece stainless steel bolt works incredibly smooth from your very first shot. Henry rifles have long enjoyed a reputation among shooters for providing easy to work actions. The Acu-Bolt continues the long standing Henry tradition of delivering a high quality rifle which can be purchased for a very affordable price.

Details:

Colt Railgun
Stainless frame and slide
Factory ""blackened"" finish which is a very nicely done non reflective black cerakote color. The best way I can describe it is that it looks like the non-polished areas of the new blued finish guns...flat black but not cheap and dull looking. 
Undercut trigger guard
Upswept beaver tail grip safety with memory bump
Beveled magwell
Grips are the type that allow for an aftermarket magwell 
Ebony wood colt grips. Very nice looking grain, not just some cheesy black paint like on other grips
Extended Ambi safety
Novak 3 dot sights low mount carry
3 hole aluminum adjustable trigger
Enhanced hammer
National match barrel
Lowered and flared ejection port
Extra set of grips

200 rounds fired, still looks brand new. You're welcome to look it over before the trade or I can take detailed pics of whatever areas you ask. This thing is a fantastic shooter!

Feel free to make an offer (particularly talo colts), but my list is pretty specific. The worst I can say is no. I'll respond to all offers unless you send me a crazy low cash offer. :)

Possibly open to trades but mostly likely not as I love this gun.

Leupold Mark 6 1-6x20mm Rifle Scope is a small, nimble, and powerful rifle scope that meets the needs of law enforcement, tactical, and sport shooters.image With an objective lens that's no wider than 20mm and a light weight of just over a pound, these small Leupold riflescopes won't hinder your weapon with a bulky profile or heavy load. The versatile 1x to 6x magnification range of these rifle scopes is ideal for close-range operations, with a wide field of view, fast target acquisition, and pinpoint precision at longer ranges. The professional-grade lenses of the Leupold Mark VI 1-6x20 34mm Tube Riflescope use the Xtended Twilight Lens System for edge-to-edge clarity, and their DiamondCoat2 lens coating excels at light transmission and scratch resistance. Fine-tune your measurements with the low profile Zerolock locking windage and elevation turrets, complete with tactile and audible 2/10th mil per click movement. Leupold has equipped the Mark 6 rifle scope with an illuminated reticle on the front focal plane, visible under any lighting settings with the right position on the 7-setting brightness adjustment. Smaller, lighter, and faster than most rifle scopes, the Leupold Mk 6 1-6x Xtended Twilight Scope is a versatile tool for any job."

It is a new barrel for a Beretta M9 9mm pistol (aka 92FS), and from my research it is a GI replacement part made by Fabrique National (FN) in North Carolina. FN makes many arms for the U.S. government. (And I bought it from a seller in North Carolina).

The barrel has been assembled onto my pistol once, but has not been fired. The finish is an even gray with a hint of green, like parkerizing. It has a few small scrapes from handling, nothing significant. It is chrome lined up to the end of the bore, nice and shiny. Barrel includes the locking block and plunger, assembled.

It has assembly number 9346426 3S679. I understand the 3S679 is the supplier number of FN. It is marked ""P M"" on one side, which indicates it was tested and proof fired, I believe."

Has all the great things the POF comes with; piston driven system, which keeps the rifle running super clean and cool.  This rifle has the NP3 coated bolt carrier group.  Less than 30 rounds down the tube of this rifle.  It is an awesome rifle, but I am saving for a high end bolt gun and have another POF that I will keep, so this one has to go.  It's a slick setup, sub MOA directly from the factory, and these rifles are TOUGH!  Condition is great, no crazy marks or anything on it whatsoever.  It has sat in my gun safe.  New price on these is around $1700-1800, so get this one, which has hardly been fired, for much less!  My loss, your gain.  If you are reading this you probably know about POF already.  If not, visit POF-usa.com for more information.

For $1500 I will throw in the Magpul BUIS (sights) and one magazine (Pmag).  Come and get it!  This rifle is slick!"
