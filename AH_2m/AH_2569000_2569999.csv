(This upper has ""Noveske"" printed on the top (see picture)

Brand new.

The MUR is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines.  The MUR 1A includes a forward assist and a shell deflector.

The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall making the MUR upper receiver a more rigid platform. A more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability while extending the life of interfacing components such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. 

The main benefit of the MUR is it's dimensionally correct. Unfortunately, with the current war effort, a number of AR suppliers are rushing through production, bypassing critical dimensions which will either make or break the reliability and accuracy of the weapon.

 The SPCS - Soldier Plate Carrier System is the current U.S. Army Plate Carrier System currently issued to all combat troops in Afghanistan (over 60,000 units). Following lengthy review, field evaluations and analysis, the U.S. Army chose the KDH model Magnum TAC-1 system over all other competitor's designs as a result of the following key factors: (1) weight and comfort, (2) ballistic performance, and (3) delivery schedule. The Magnum TAC-1 was the lightest of the plate carriers studied by the U.S. Army and it has the highest ballistic performance as well. This plate carrier/vest provides the soldier with a lightweight option to the standard issue IOTV vest and is designed to meet the requirements of troops working in high-altitude and rugged terrain. The system balances the fine line between coverage vs. mobility.

 Unmatched comfort. One active duty Army Major commented, ""It is by far the most comfortable body armor vest I have ever worn.""
• Highly adjustable for improved fit. The vest can be adjusted ""on-the-run"" without removing the vest with its side adjustable straps. The vest can be adjusted real time as mission requirements change.
• Cummerbund connects with side release buckles rather than Velcro for greater adjustability on the move and superior noise discipline.
• Side plate protection pouches can be easily removed when not mission critical
• Single-handed emergency egress quick-release system
• Low-profile system
• Fits U.S. issue X-Small thru X-Large hard armor ESAPI plates
• Reinforced drag handle
• 360° MOLLE mounting surfaces
• Easy donning/doffing
• IOTV groin and lower back protector compatible
• Provides IOTV specification soft ballistic protection
• Lightest weight military plate carrier on the market today with every objective requirement met
• Protected by nGuard®: resistant to odor, microbes, fungi, mosquitos, bed bugs, color fading"

THIS IS 308 WINCHESTER,  NOT 308 EXPRESS


Marlin 336 professionally chambered in 308 winchester.
This gun is only going to be sold to someone with extensive knowledge of hand loading bullets.  Being that it is a tube fed gun,  most factory loads you will find on the shelf at the sporting good store might not be safe in this gun.  Gun must be loaded with round nose bullets or one in the chamber and one in the tube.  Some factory loads are too hot.
Now that leverevolution is making .308 bullets,  I believe you could make some nice pointed bullets and load the tube.  
The finish one the gun is very nice.  Walnut checkered wood.  Not perfect,  but very nice.
If you are interested in the rifle,  you can call or text me at REDACTED
If you don't load your own bullets,  this gun is not for you.

You can, but the vendor has to ship the ammo to your FFL or a licensed ammo dealer, and then you pick it up from your FFL or dealer - that's what the SAFE ACT is all about - face to face ammo (and gun) transactions.
You just cannot have the ammo shipped to you directly, or to your home from an Internet vendor.  If Cuomo prohibited the purchase of ammo from outside the state, it would violate Interstate Commerce laws and could have been struck down easily by a Federal judge.  So they went around that by allowing the ammo to be shipped to an FFL/ammo dealer.  You can also pick up the phone and call the ""on line"" vendor.  That's a phone transaction and you are not using the Internet.  They will do the same on the phone, and ask you for your FFL's name & address and they will ship your ammo to them.  Some on line vendors have chosen not to deal with NY at all.  Others have changed their policy for NYers and require that you call them to place your order if you live in NY.  That's only because they have not updated their web site yet for you to choose an FFL to ship to.  I suspect it would be pretty hard for them to re-program their web site to recognize a NY address and bring up the FFL list for an ammo sale, like they do when you purhase a firearm on their site, but it can be done.  It's just a matter of them linking ammo product/item #'s to the FFL list like they do with guns.  

#2 - You can still SHIP ammo from NY to someone out of state!  The SAFE Act does not restrict or prohibit anyone from shipping or selling ammo to someone out of state.  I just shipped ammo out today UPS Ground. I also spoke to one of the UPS supervisors and he said there are no restrictions in shipping ammo out of NY state whether you are a private seller or not.  My FFL also confirmed this, as did my State Senator's office.  Call your (NY) Representative and ask about shipping ammo outside the state.  If they don't know, ask them why the heck did they vote the legislation into law if they don't know what they voted for. 

#3 - No private sales of ammo (or guns) permitted as of today 1/15 WITHIN New York State.  Cuomo does not govern the laws of other states.  No NY law says that you cannot drive over the border to PA to sell your ammo, or ship it to someone that lives in another state other than NY."

The muzzle does show some wear from spending lots of time in the holster, I tried to capture it in the pics below.  If needed, more pics can be furnished. 

I'd like $750 obo for it all, but what i really want is a S&W M&P with the 5"" barrel.  Prefer it to have the apex kit and a spare mag or two. 

let me know what you think.  (If the price seems high, i apologize, i'm not sure what to ask for it.)

ON TO THE PICS!

I used my phone and took them in HDR so hopefully all the little blemishes show, but i did just finish cleaning and wiping it down, so if any spots look ""wet"" that's why.

On 2 February 1994, there was issued an ATF encyclical placing 35 importers of ""7.62 X 39mm steel core ammunition"" and all Federal Firearms Licensees on immediate notice that those rounds were now considered ""armor piercing."" Quoting ATF Director, John W. Magaw, as stating ""(t)hese bullets are designed, when used in handguns, to pose a life-threatening risk to all law enforcement officers,"" the notification stated:
Recent production of handguns that are designed to fire 7.62 X 39mm steel core ammunition has resulted in the reclassification of that ammunition as armor piercing (which) can only be sold to law enforcement or governmental agencies. Prior to introduction of these handguns in the marketplace, 7.62 X 39mm ammunition was not considered armor piercing, because it was only used in rifles -- primarily SKS/AK rifles.

With this preemptive move, ATF struck a formidable blow at owners of between 7 and 8 million SKS rifles believed to be in this country, as well as those with AKs and sundry other shoulder-fired ordnance in that chambering. With a prime supply of ""cheap ammo"" suddenly gone, the cost of their shooting game had just gone up. As it was with the majority of small arms ammunition in the post-Brady Law hording frenzy, 7.62 X 39mm was already in extremely short supply, and the cost of an 1,100 round case of even lead core, available from over-stocked distributors during the summer of 1993 at $90/case, was suddenly selling in the $149 to $209 range when it could be found! Ironically, the importation price of the restricted steel core ammunition was actually three dollars per case less expensive than the lead fodder from Norinco via China Sports, the country's largest importer of 7.62 X 39mm."

Browning confirmed the serial number, year made, and that it was a numbers matching, all original shotgun. These Miroku's are widely known to have the same quality and performance of the Belgian made models, and have thicker barrels. This has the more valuable Vent/Rib 26 inch barrel, amazing wood, 98% finish, and perfect checkering and sheen on the wood and metal alike. Action is butter smooth, tight, and brand new feeling. This was purchased new in 1983 by my father, who casually shot it at the range a couple times a year, before retiring it about 10-12 years ago into his safe where it has been since I recently traded him for it. It is absolutely immaculate- light, balanced, amazingly ergonomic and comfortable to shoulder and aim. You have to hold it to really appreciate the finish and quality.

The original owner used it a lot and compromised its collectible value. However, these were a small batch, the serial numbers were produced out of sequence† (compare photo of serial to Ruger registry). The stock is beautifully figured, and it's the best .22 you'll ever shoot in your life. Crack shot without a scope, I was Davey Crockett for a few summers. Haven't shot her since I dropped the rotary magazine - it needs repair or replaced.

Surrounding serial number blocks place date of production approx 1995. These are the special edition Wal-Mart ""store-opening"" models that Bill Ruger reserved for Sam Walton.‡

The Sig Sauer 716 ""3-Gun"" is a non-cataloged rifle. This rifle has many features we have seen on the 716 Patrol including a 4-position piston operating system, flip-up front and rear iron sights, and a quad rail (albeit slightly longer). You even get the durable Magpul 20-Round PMAG, but two this time around compared to one in the Patrol rifle. The differences may not be easy to spot, however there are some notable upgrades which make this rifle stand out from the standard Patrol rifle (or other Sig Sauer rifles we have seen thus far).

First and foremost, this rifle is in a very nice hard plastic case similar to the SSG 3000 case. New is the 18"" Heavy Barrel which is threaded and includes a thread cap. This may very well be the same barrel we will find on the R716 'Precision Marksman' when it's eventually released. Next, a TI-7 stock with QD sockets on either side which you can use in combination with the included 2-point QD sling. This stock feels strong and sturdy - a fine addition to this rifle. Also welcomed is an upgraded latch on the charge handle to give a better grip, especially while wearing gloves. While on the subject of gloves, a Magpul Winter Trigger Guard sits nicely under the trigger. The guard is only the start as a raised letter 'G' is cast on the side of the new trigger, a hint that you will have something better than the standard Mil-Spec trigger found on all of the AR-10 and AR-15 style Sig Sauer rifles thus far. In place of this basic unit Sig Sauer has installed a Geissele 2-Stage trigger

*****Update:  I just finished counting brass from the range trips in the last year and I only had 334 rounds of .45, so since I generally finish boxes at the range the gun has likely seen 350 rounds exactly and not 500. This is my only weapon in .45 so I am certain about this.  Carry on and disregard my initial round count.

I have about 500 rounds down the pipe, so it's just broken in right and you can tell. The action is so smooth you can barely feel it cycle, just the recoil. I just replaced the recoil spring and I also have a flatwire recoil spring kit from Wilson Combat that I was going to install at 1000 rounds. Like everyone else says, it was cleaned directly after each trip to the range and I am extremely OCD about getting it perfectly clean. All original items will accompany it.

Comes with 5 Kimber SS magazines. Worth another $100."

The holes are 3/4 or 7/8 in diameter to accommodate 1/2"" or 5/8"" Carriage bolts, i have this set up where it is angled down at a 30 degree slant, I can throw these on there for an extra 5$ a plate. 

In the picture you can see my tester plates shot with .223 @ 200 yards w/ no dimples, .223 fmj w/ only slight damage, 17hmr no effect, 22 no effect.
Even AR-500 steel targets are only designed to take centerfire bullets, not rifle. but you can do as you want to and these plates will last years.
These plates can take everything their AR-500 counterparts can.



I prefer email or text, but you can call if you have to.(25three) 88zero - 4two2two
I work around the South Park area in Seattle during the day so we can set up a meeting around lunch time if that works better. 

I am able to repair or replace your current steel targets for dueling trees to plate racks. I could even build them if your interested. 

If you find better deals online, let me know so I can beat them! 

I'd Trade 10 or more Round plates for rifles, shotguns or pistols or CASH.
Thanks for readin this far, Austin.

I also have a 5/8"" thick silhouette plate that looks like a torso, its full size @ 28 inches high and 20 inches wide, - 160$ (I can fabricate these to be set up to your preferred style. i.e. hanged as a gong, stab in ground, 4x4 post, ect.)
1/2 scale silhouette 3/8"" thick 20x12 gong style, 100$ 
and a few square plates that measure 22x18 - 140$ obo
I could also get my hands on bigger plates that are 12""-16""wide and 1.5- 2"" thick, just ask what I have.

The holes are 3/4 in diameter to accommodate 1/2"" Carriage bolts, i have this set up where it is angled down at a 30 degree slant, I can throw these on there for an extra 5$ a plate. I can add chains and hooks but I'd have to charge more then it would cost you to set up yourself, so just let me know if you want it turn-key. And again these can be any color you want.

In the picture you can see my tester plates shot with .223 @ 200 yards w/ no dimples, .223 fmj w/ only slight damage, 17hmr no effect, 22 no effect.

These plates can take everything their AR-500 counterparts can.


I prefer email or text, but you can call if you have to.(25three) 88zero - 4two2two
I work around the South Park area in Seattle during the day so we can set up a meeting around lunch time if that works better. 

I am able to repair or replace your current steel targets for dueling trees to plate racks. I could even build them if your interested. 

If you find better deals online, let me know so I can beat them! 

I'd Trade 10 or more Round plates for rifles, shotguns or pistols or CASH.
Thanks for readin this far, Austin.

This rifle is chambered in 5.56x45mm and is set up in right hand configuration. Rifle has less than 200 rounds through it and comes with original box, manual and warranty card. 

Includes 3 Steyr AUG magazines (one 30 round magazine and two 42 round magazines).

This rifle also has a complete NATO Stock that has the NATO trigger pack as well as its own buttplate and sling stud. This allows the owner to switch between regular Steyr magazine operation and STANAG AR15 magazine operation on the fly. 

This set gives its new owner the best of both worlds.

Only looking for a FTF sale in Saint Louis Missouri right now as the whole package is too cumbersome to ship. Asking $1800.00 CASH. This is the normal going price for just the rifle itself without BOTH stocks and spare magazines.

Only Trade I'd consider right now is for a Tavor of like quality.

Here’s a REAL Safe Queen for Trade or Sale for you. A Kimber Solo Carry STS 9mm. IT’s the Stainless Steel model but doesn’t mean all stainless. The frame is still alloy and Kimcoated (painted) silver. The STS won’t show scratches like the black frame does and rarely do they come up for sale.
It’s in like new condition with less than 50 rounds through it. NO scratches, marks on the frame. The only sign that it has ever been shot is minor slide wear on the barrel. It shoots flawlessly and easy to keep on target when firing rapidly. It’s the perfect carry gun for both a guy or gal. It is extremely comfortable to hold and with its rounded edges slides easily into and back out of the concealed position.
You can buy a brand new Kimber Solo STS 9mm if you can find it from a store for about $800++ (Taxes and background included) with only 1 x 6 round mag and a carrying case ONLY or you can pick up my virtually new Kimber Solo STS 9mm  from me with extras like a pinky extention for the 6rd mag, an extended 8rd mag, a Left IWB Leather holster (also have a right IWB Blackhawk holster if you are a righty), 5 pairs of New No-Touch Ear Plugs w/ Cord and last but not least a brick of 25rds of Hordandy Critical Duty 9mm Ammo. All for less than if you were to buy new.
Package Includes:
- Kimber Solo Carry STS 9mm
- 1 x 6 rd Mag w/ Pinky Extension
- 1 x 8rd factory Kimber extended mag
- 25rds of 9mm Hordandy Critical Duty 135gr Ammo
