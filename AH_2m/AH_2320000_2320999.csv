The Mrs kindly bought me a 150rd box of this ammo in anticipation of a range day, and after shooting 50rds of it I decided that my rifle didn't like it.  So, I'm putting the rest up for sale.  This is where it becomes a good deal for you.

The 150rd box was bought for $70 + tax.  Before tax, that works out to about 47 cents per round.  I'm selling the remaining 100 rounds for $45.  You get them for less than I paid, and you save the tax as well.  The photo shows the ammunition on stripper clips, but this deal does not include the stripper clips.  The photo was taken with the ammunition on the strippers so you could easily tell there is 100 rounds as advertised.  Actually, you get 102 rounds, so bonus for you!

I'd like to meet up at the Academy located at 1604 and Potranco to complete the transaction.  Send me a message through TGT if you're interested.

These were only made for a couple of years (late 1959-early 1961) & then changed to the 18-2 & later were the -3 & -4.  Has double pins & 3 screws & recessed cylinders..  Very little info available on these.  All parts match including the grips.  The screws aren't buggered & all lines & seams match perfectly.  

This is a very rare gun to find in this condition.  The 18-1 is harder to find than a Colt Diamondback 22 & worth much more with the correct factory box.  This isn't a crappy ebay remake, it's the real deal with ball-point pen markings that are almost illegible.  The only trades that would interest me would be a H&R 999 4"" Sportsman or a Ruger Single-six 4 5/8"" plus considerable cash.

I'll listen to offers.  Save the lowball ones.  If your offer doesn't have at least 4 digits to the left of the decimal point, no thanks. The 18-2, -3, -4 & 17s are bringing $6-800 for just the gun.

Please see information below if you are curious about how the Rhino works and what it offers.

Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

 some spare and stock parts

I understand the rifle is not made of gold and am not willing to give an ""Obama"" price. I think $1250 is a fair price for everything included (far from breaking even) I would trust my life to this weapon. This rifle has been very fun to shoot and is very accurate. I am able to get awesome groups with match grade ammo.

 I am selling this because the weather has turned. I have my Harley on the bike lift with projects waiting, and they are expensive. Trading one hobby for another.

 No trades, no separating. I am located in Hobart, and willing to travel some.

 Face to Face only. No out of state sales.

 Thanks for looking"

This rifle has been fired less than 500 times at the most and has been well maintained.  It has a Fiberforce fixed stock that is more ergonomic and durable than the original. This model MAK-90 will accept many different fixed and folding stocks currently on the market and most can be installed easily in minutes.

 I have 33 - 30 round magazines, 18 are new (never loaded)and most of the others are in  great to like new condition.  Most of the magazines are European with the ""rib"" feature and four of the new ones are the very desirable Bulgarian ""Waffle"" mags.  Also, I have 1460 rounds of ammunition, 720 of these are in 120 round battle packs. The battle packs are Russian military surplus (NOT cheap ammo like Tula, Wolf,or Silver Bear) and the rest is a mixture of brass cased, hollow points, soft points, and FMJ.

Included at this price are an assortment of 20 rd, 10 rd, and 5 rd magazines, the original wood furniture, dust cover with base for optics, red dot sight, three European style 4-cell mag pouches, a pack of stripper clips with stripper guide, original oiler bottle, cleaning rods, sling, manual, etc.

I would like to sell all of this together but I would consider selling mags and ammo separately. I will not,however, consider selling it off 2-3 mags or 100 rds at a time. If you are thinking about a lowball offer don't wast your time, I will not respond. This is a face to face sell only in the North Alabama area, I will not ship. For the most part I'm interested in cash, however, I may trade for ARs, AR uppers, 5.56 ammo, high end optics, or bolt guns."

It was produced for standard issue to all Soviet infantry from 1930 to 1945. Most Dragoon rifles were also converted to the M1891/30 standard. It was commonly used as a sniper rifle in World War II. Early sniper versions had a 4x PE or PEM scope, a Soviet-made copy of a Zeiss design, while later rifles used smaller, simpler, and easier-to-produce 3.5x PU scopes. Because the scope was mounted above the chamber, the bolt handle was replaced with a longer, bent version on sniper rifles so the shooter could work the bolt without the scope interfering with it. Its design was based on the Dragoon rifle with the following modifications:
--Flat rear sights and restamping of sights in metres, instead of arshinii.
--A cylindrical receiver, replacing the octagonal (commonly called ""hex"") receiver. Early production 91/30s (from 1930 to 1936) and converted Dragoon rifles retained the octagonal receiver. These rifles are less common and regarded as generally more desirable by collectors.
--A hooded post front sight, replacing the blade on previous weapons.[13]

The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber.""

With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfieldâs reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XDÂ® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger Systemâ¢ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDMâs trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is 13+1 in .45 ACP. Available in all black finish and black frame with a stainless steel finish slide. Includes black hard case (unless noted otherwise), holster and double magazine carrier.

It is a Pointblank tactical vest with Galls level III-A kevlar blunt trauma protection. The vest is meant to be worn on the outside of clothing and has large velcro pads to place various patches or one large patch that states the business, organization or agency. It has several pockets conveniently located so you can store extra magazines, possibly a first aid kit, a small survival kit, food or other tactical equipment.

This vest is designed to resist most pistol calibers. This vest will have no effect on any rifle calibers or stabbing. Level III-A vests are the highest protection against pistols.

The vest was only worn a few times for my job, all I'm asking is $150.

If you have any questions, please feel free to TEXT (no calls because of my odd work hours/days) REDACTED or email!

Here is some additional information regarding bulletproof vests: 

""When a handgun bullet strikes body armor, it is caught in a ""web"" of very strong fibers. These fibers absorb and disperse the impact energy that is transmitted to the vest from the bullet, causing the bullet to deform or ""mushroom"". Â Additional energy is absorbed by each successive layer of material in the vest, until such time as the bullet has been stopped.""

It is important to know that Level II-A, II and III-A all stop the overwhelming majority of pistol projectiles you are ever likely to encounter (plus 12 gauge, OO buckshot), and also to know that NO armor is ever 100% 'bulletproof' under ALL conceivable circumstances."

Modified Vetterli rifles were also used by the Italian Army.
The Swiss Vetterli rifles combined the American Winchester Model 1866's tubular magazine and a bolt system derived from the German Dreyse needle gun. They were also the first repeating rifle to feature a self-cocking action and a small caliber. Due to the Swiss Federal Council's early 1866 decision to equip the army with a breechloading repeating rifle, the Vetterli rifles were, at the time of their introduction, the most advanced military rifles in Europe. The Vetterli was the replacement for Milbank-Amsler rifles, which were a metallic cartridge conversion from previous muzzle loading rifles."
