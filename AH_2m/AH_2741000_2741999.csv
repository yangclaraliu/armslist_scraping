Smith & Wesson 686 Performance Center .357 Mag Revolver – 2.5″ Barrel, 7-Round Cylinder, Wood Grips – Smith & Wesson 170346

This model is NEW for 2014!

The 686 Combat Magnum. Smith and Wesson’s 686 Plus is the perfect all around revolver. Chambered in .357 Magnum the Model 686 also gives you the versatility to shoot .38 special loads without any changes to the gun. The Plus in the name is to indicate a seven round capacity as opposed to the traditional six shot.

 The frame is the ideal size to allow for full grip grip control of the gun, while still decreasing felt recoil. The Smith & Wesson 686 Plus has a smooth trigger with superior balance. The three inch barrel allows for solid accuracy, making it an excellent self- defense handgun for either concealed carry or home defense applications. The fit and finish on the Smith & Wesson 686 are second to none.

Performance Center guns originate from standard designs or are created from the ground up. From hand-cutting and fitting to fine tuning for precision, these firearms are top performers. Products from the Performance Center are the ultimate expression of old-world craftsmanship blended with modern technology. These models come with the Performance Center’s Unfluted Cylinder, Chrome Teardrop Hammer, Cylinder Cut for Moonclips and PC Tuned Action.

SERVICE GRADE: (Good to Very Good): Service Grade Rifles show less wear and better appearance than Field or Rack Grades. Good to very good condition. Rifle wear will be exhibited by worn and mixed colors of the parkerized finish. There may be some minor pitting on receiver and other metal parts. Wood will be either Walnut, Birch, Beech or other variety and will be basically sound but may have minor hairline cracks, dings, scratches and gouges. Wood may not match in color or type of wood. Wood may be of new production on Service Grade Garands. Bores will be generally good with only minor imperfections. The barrel crown may be nicked, but the muzzle will gauge ""3 or less"" and the throat erosion will gauge less than 5."

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Mini Thirty rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

The CZ 712 is a gas operated semi-automatic shotgun built on a light weight alloy reciever. The 28"" barrel configuration accepts the 2 3/4"" to 3"" shells, making the new shotgun a great choice for both upland game and waterfowl. The barrel on the 712 is chrome lined with a moly black hard chrome exterior finish that will resist corrosion after many seasons in the field. It is fit with a Turkish walnut stock sized for a 14.5"" length of pull. The 712 comes with a magazine tube plug installed for waterfowl. If the plug is removed, it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity.

MANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTIONS:

With up to 2"" of precise elevation adjustment, the Primos Group Therapy Bench Anchor Rest is the ideal high-performance shooting bench for both left- and right-handed shooters. This rest also provides a convenient accessory tray to accommodate everything from weight bags to all of your must-have gear. Lightweight all-steel construction allows for simple, hassle-free transport. Includes a front shooting rest, and a buttplate guard that cancels recoil. Studded feet for turf-gripping traction. Only 15"" wide. Length easily adjusts from 28"" to 30"".

Save time, money and ammunition with the new and improved LaserLyte® Laser Bore Sight. Incorporating LaserLyte's patented one-piece design and caliber-fitting systems the new Laser Bore Sight is fifty percent smaller than the previous model. This easy-to-use product can get a shooter within three to four inches of the bull's-eye at 100 yards in about three shots. Constructed from tough T6 aluminum, the Laser Bore Sight comes in a sleek red finish and works great on any weapon with at least three inches of barrel length. The Laser Bore Sight makes sight-in sessions a breeze for scopes, lasers or iron sights on any firearm from .22 to .50 caliber with included adapters. For maximum versatility the system also works with new accessories (sold separately), including a shotgun adapter for .50 to .75 caliber and improved scope leveler. The Laser Bore Sight activates with a roll switch and is powered by three 393 batteries that provide one and a half hours of continuous use. This unit is also excellent for modern rifles and its modest design works great with most flash suppressors and muzzle breaks."

Fortis REV™ is an extremely lightweight yet robust free floating rail system. When designing the REV™, we didn't want just another rail system, we wanted a better, lighter, feature rich handguard that was robust and within budget. We've managed to reduce as much weight as possible while maintaining strength by utilizing a 1 piece body design. KeyMods were added at the 6 & 9 O'clock positions for modularity and additional weight savings. It's unique mounting system captures a standard AR15 barrel nut for easy installation. Check out all the features and see for yourself why the Fortis REV™ beats the competition. Because of the anti-rotational tabs, the REV™ rail may not fit all uppers without slight modification. Fits most mil-spec forged uppers without any issues.

here are the specs:

Springfield Armory® XD(M)™ Semiautomatic Handguns

Enhanced ergonomic design for greater control and handling
Superior capacity with 16+1 in .40 S&W 
Multiple integrated safety features
Rugged polymer and steel construction
Excellent accuracy and reliable performance
Integrated tactical rail for accessories
Includes hard case, holster and double magazine carrier
With the introduction of XD(M) series of semiautomatic pistols, Springfield’s reputation for ergonomics, intuitive operation and handling is taken to a whole new level. Deeper, longer and more slide serrations result in a better grasp when operating the slide. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip and three included backstraps tailor the fit to the hand of any shooter. Angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by hands of almost any size without twisting or adjusting hold on the shooting grip. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, the process is easier and faster. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XDM’s trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied, while a grip safety allows the gun to fire only when you have a firm grip on the pistol. The loaded-chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow you to verify visually or by touch and without a doubt, whether there is a round in the chamber and if the striker is cocked. Match-grade barrel and proven three-dot sighting system are standard. Capacity is impressive 16+1 in .40 S&W in all black finish. Includes black hard case, holster and double magazine carrier.

The detectives are beautiful guns and are now the next in line behind the Bright Stainless Pythons to collect. This is due to collectors now realizing that the investment is in the Colt's that were smaller in manufacturing runs. I suspect that there may actually be less Detectives in this configuration than the Pythons as we have only seen a couple in our time.

MANUFACTURER'S DESCRIPTION:

517
The 517.A65 was developed to optimize the functionality of the HWS. The buttons have been moved from the back to the left side for instant access, allowing a magnifier or a back up iron sight to fit closely to the HWS body. This new button position allows the user to operate the HWS function switches easier than ever before. Additionally, a portion of the front base has been raised to allow the sight to fit over standard hand guards found on many M-4 or M-16 style weapons.

*Buttons on left side to work specifically with magnifiers.
*AA Battery model (supports Lithium or Alkaline).
*Reticle: 65 MOA ring with a single 1 MOA dot.
*Interfaces to 1"" Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) rail.
*Suggested Retail from $509.00."

I'm going to try first to sell all of this stuff as one big lot. I know that by just looking at it all laying there at once, naked and metallic-y, that it may seem an awful much to wrap your head around. But give it a try. You can do it. I have great confidence in you and your abilities. You will also be doing us both a great service, so there is the humanitarian angle to think about. When was the last time you serviced the human race? Here is your big chance. By buying all of these little lovelies at once you will be saving me the trouble of making a bunch of separate postings. All one go, see? Easy-peasy! You will also be saving yourself a metric Scheiße-ton of money. And that, for you, is like money in the bank, my friend.

So. Here you will see a list of every thing in the photo, and its corresponding price if sold separately. At the conclusion we will refigure a super duper, all in, one time only, discount price, at which we will both rejoice and make merry. Got it? Alrighty.

There she be. That's one, big , spicy, meatball of military collectability to get down your gullet all at once, but you can do it. I know you can. I arrived at those prices by taking the low average of stuff I found online, and lots of other sources. Those arent unfair prices for real, genuine, of era stuffs in good condition and getting harder to find by the day. In fact, they are more than fair, they are outstanding! Just like me! Just like you! However, I'm willing to deal for convenience, simplicity, volume. The American Way! Just like 'Ol Ben Franklin(may his nose forever glow) All that adds up to $275 on the nose, and that's before shipping. (if you need shipping) If you hitch up your highwaters and take the whole shebang at once, I'll knock off 150 bucks. That's right, $125 measly, piddlin', rickyticky greenbacks for all that stuff. All that history! One stop shopping and whopping discounts, you can't beat 'em. If you need shipping, we're gonna have to work something out, but it can be done. I'll find the cheapest way if you give me your town and zip. I'm gonna let this run for a short time as only the whole package deal, then I'll re list everything separately at original price.

879,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2741879,For Sale/Trade:  Price Drop!! HOLD OUT ON BUYING PYTHONS AND COLTS!!,"waukesha, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 26, 2014",Handguns,Colt,no type,no type,no type,"Hey just giving shooters a heads up on Colts, especially Pythons. Just wait it out a bit longer if your looking to get one of these fine guns because the market is about to drop big time later this year. Unfortunately a lot of investors got into them for investments only which drove up the prices. This caused shooter like myself not to be able afford them because they went from $800-$1500 guns to now $2,000-$4,000 guns depending on which version you had. These puppies are made to be shot and not tossed back and forth between investors. Pythons are still very common online and offline, but thanks to investors who bought them at a $1000 to sell for $1500 and so on till now, investors are peaking. Investors are now stuck trying to sell a blued python for $2000+ and they aren't moving. Keep the waiting because if you go to the shows like I do and go online a lot you see they aren't moving like they use to. Hell some people are trying to get a MKIII Troopers which is a $500-600 gun all day for over $1000. These guns weren't built smooth and are a poor mans Python. My Smith 19 and Ruger with outlast troopers all day long and are much smoother to shoot. With this sluggish economy and Obamacare sticking it to people, no one is going to drop $2000 on a python. So keep holding out and watch the prices drop! This isn't anything different then when investors destroyed the Muscle Car market and the Comic book market. In the 90's certain comics sky rocketed and were valued in the hundreds and thousands of dollars, today you cant give them away, Those same comics can be bought online at Ebay for $5. SO HOLD OUT BECAUSE WHEN THE INVESTORS LEAVE THE PRICES WILL DROP!! I hope a lot of you investors take a huge hit!"

The gun functions flawlessly.  My wife and I have collectively put exactly 150 rounds through it, and it's starting to develop a slight wear line across the top of the barrel from the slide cycling.  We've upgraded to a new carry gun for my wife though, and no longer need this one.

Here's the info:
-mossberg 715t carry handle.
included is the original factory 25 round magazine 
foregrip included never installed but used on another gun 
counterpoint 4x32mm scope
everything that was included when I purchased the rifle is here. 
Including box and manuals. 

What I have done to the rifle is put an o-ring on the front sight base (increased accuracy/grouping) installed a o-ring on the bolt to stiffen then action has no effect on the function of the gun. 
I have also taken the two side p icatinny rails off thr side of the gun (gives it more of a bushmaster predator style feel to it) rails are in box. 

I will also include 200 rounds of 22 long rifle ammo so you can actually shoot without trying to buy the ammo. 

This gun was my first gun and I have taken care of it. 
Did recommended improvements to it. 
Shoots great, at 25 yards off of the iron sights I was able to  achieve a grouping 
of 3 inches rapid firing not taking time between shots. 
When I had the scope on this gun I had it sighted at 100 yards. And I was able to put a perfect hole in a pile of snow on top of a post at 200 yards aiming a bit high. 

This is a used gun. I purchased just the rifle itself for 360 dollars in December of 2012. I am asking 260 dollars but will take offers. Usually will not sell my guns but need the money at this moment in time."

It comes with the case, cleaning rods, loader, s/m/l back straps, and 3 - 14 round magazines (only 1 pictured). I have fired around 200 rounds through it with not a single problem - no matter which ammo I use. It is both single and double action, has the ambidextrous safety/decocker, and the rotating barrel makes it shoot quite nice (stays on target). Gun has always been cleaned after each use and looks almost new.

I do love the gun, I just need something a little smaller to carry on me.

They are now selling for around $485 new (with 1-2 mags) so I am thinking $425 will be fair with the extra magazine (paid $35 for the mag, well over $500 for the brand new handgun over a year ago).

.13 per casing up to 5000 .12 per casing on orders of 6000 or more

If you want it de-primed and swedged:

.18 per casing minimum order of 1000

If you are from out of town Shipping is not included in the price and really depends on what you order.

Figure on $12 per 1000 for shipping, for large orders I can split the cost.

We have several people that are return customers and like the way we do business.

We count the brass by weight and always add extra just in case we missed a damaged one (enjoy the extras because we don't miss dented casings that often).

958,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2741958,For Sale:  pistol crossbow. used a couple times. basically new.,"Madison west area, Madison, Wisconsin",$ 40,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 18, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"About this item
This 80 lb draw weight crossbow uses an easy and safe-to-use cocking mechanism. Manufactured with a strong plastic body and compressed molded fiberglass bow, this crossbow pistol is very durable and perfect for both small game hunting and target practice. Each crossbow includes 15 aluminum arrows with metal tips and adjustable tactical sight. With a firing speed of 165 fps, the 80 lb cross bow is great for hunting small game. The new self-cocking mechanism much more safe and far less strenuous to use. By simply pulling down on a pivoting arm lever, this crossbow's cable is cocked much more easily, even engaging the safety automatically. The speediness of the new cocking mechanism shortens reload time, allowing you to get off more shots quickly. Like all hunting weapons and gear, proper maintenance is essential in prolonging the life of your crossbow. With each use, elements of the crossbow can begin to wear. We also recommend applying rail lube often to your crossbow's rail slide and wax to your string to decrease the friction that can hurt your string. It's also recommended to check the tightness of your crossbow's screws often as vibration can loosen them overtime."

It needs a trigger guard and I think the firing pin needs fixed. Sometimes it shoots and sometimes it only makes a light primer strike.

Overall this is a very cute, great piece of American firearm history. Makes you feel like a kid again.

These pictures are of the actual rifle."
