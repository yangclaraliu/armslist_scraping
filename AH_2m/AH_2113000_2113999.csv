It has trigger safety, which makes the pull a bit similar to the revolvers' trigger work. It has a loaded chamber indicator ""peep hole"" on the top of the slide, to show the brass rim when a round is in the chamber. The gun has a smooth slide movement. The take down is very simple, does not need any tools or mechanical know-how. Cleaning is easy, and reassambly goes with one single step. I am very partial to this gun, and not only for the S&W logo. Holding it gives a feeling much like holding a Walther P38, and I had no problems with the ammo feeding at all. This gun comes with four original S&W magazines, shipping only

This is the 6.5 MOA LED version that operates off of a CR3032 battery.  I went back and forth on whether or not I wanted the 6.5 or the 3.5 MOA due to having an astigmatism.  Most people prefer to run the 6.5 on their pistol so that is what I went with.  I put the battery in it to test it out and see how it looked and I have a feeling that I would be better suited with the 3.5 version.  With that said I am selling this one in order to purchase the 3.5 moa version.  Price is $430. If you would like it shipped I could do it for $10 extra. Thanks for looking.

Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has introduced 5 new 45 GAP loads. These are full power, but not +P loads and are designed to be safe for use in ANY/ALL 45 GAP chambered pistols. All five of these loads utilize flash suppressed powder and will not blind the shooter in low light.

Please note the below real world velocities fired from stock over-the-counter pistols. At Buffalo Bore, we do not believe in using extra long test barrels to establish our published muzzle velocities as those long test barrels give false high velocities and we feel this is misleading to the shooter who carries the ammo to protect his/her life and will be firing the ammo from a carry pistol, not a long test barrel.

I have had this rifle since April of this year.  The rifle had 60 rounds (20 Federal Gold Match 175gr, 20 American Eagle 150gr, and 20 Black Hills 178 AMAX) through it before being returned to the manufacturer for warranty work due to being over gassed.  Since then it has had 140 rounds Federal Gold Medal Match 175 smk rounds through it without a hiccup.  I cannot speak for the other rounds, as I haven't been able to find any black hills, and American Eagle was not recommended by Hogan.  The rifle is very accurate for a semi auto .308, I've printed a hair over 1MOA, and on my lesser days shot 1.5-1.75MOA at 100 yards.

The Mueller Quick Shot sight has 2 built in sensors in the front that detects the surrounding lighting conditions and automatically adjusts the brightness of the dot to the these conditions, unlike all other Red Dot Scopes, which require manual adjustment. This new, innovative concept so important as lighting conditions change the user no longer needs to worry about manually adjusting the brightness of the dot, checking to see if it is adequate for the existing lighting conditions and continually making manual adjustments like all other Red Dot Sights. In rare cases there may be instances where the user could be in an area that is darker or brighter than the target area so we have also provided 10 manual brightness adjustment settings, which over-ride the auto setting, making this sight optimum for any situation. No other Reflex Style scope offers this many features. Select from 4 different Reticle styles with the flip of a switch. The Quick Shot is one of the most versatile illuminated sights ever produced."

All PMC cartridges pass rigorous inspection at our electronic powder-check station, which instantly and accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by as little as two-tenths of one grain, the system stops, and the cartridge is discarded. No other ammunition manufacturer can assure greater uniformity and reliability than PMC. These valued characteristics run throughout our entire line.
Our Full Metal Jacket cartridges incorporate a lead core bullet enclosed in a heavy copper topcoat, resulting in little to no expansion and deeper penetration of the bullet. Our PMC-FMJ provides smooth, reliable feeding in all types of semi-auto handguns.

Bulletproof vest laws in Michigan
In Michigan, you can buy and wear a bulletproof vest, unless you have been convicted of a violent felony.(Defined in section 36 of 1953 PA 232, Michigan Compiled Law 791.236)
Here's a quote from the Michigan Penal Code:
""a person who has been convicted of a violent felony shall not purchase, own, possess, or use body armor.""

Be careful: in Michigan, making a verbal threat while wearing a bulletproof vest is a felony! Here's the relevant section of the Michigan Penal Code, 750.227f:

""an individual who commits or attempts to commit a crime that involves a violent act or a threat of a violent act against another person while wearing body armor is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years, or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both""

Bulletproof vest laws in Michigan
In Michigan, you can buy and wear a bulletproof vest, unless you have been convicted of a violent felony.(Defined in section 36 of 1953 PA 232, Michigan Compiled Law 791.236)
Here's a quote from the Michigan Penal Code:
""a person who has been convicted of a violent felony shall not purchase, own, possess, or use body armor.""

Be careful: in Michigan, making a verbal threat while wearing a bulletproof vest is a felony! Here's the relevant section of the Michigan Penal Code, 750.227f:

""an individual who commits or attempts to commit a crime that involves a violent act or a threat of a violent act against another person while wearing body armor is guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years, or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both""

The Interceptor cannot, however, be called a Level III-A vest as military standard does not require protection against heavy .44 Magnum ammunition. However, both Level III-A vests and Interceptor do protect from much lighter 9mm threats in identical tests. The vest will stop other, slower-moving fragments and has removable neck, throat, shoulder, extended back and groin protection.
Two small-arms protective inserts may also be added to the front and back of the vest, with each plate designed to stop up to three hits from 7.62x51mm NATO M80 ball ammunition, with a muzzle velocity of 2,750 feet per second (838 m/s). The plates are the most technically advanced body armor fielded by the U.S. military, and are constructed of boron carbide ceramic with an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene shield backing that breaks down projectiles and halts their momentum.

The Interceptor body armor system consists of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) ballistic plates. The OTV features a carrier shell, and three main ballistic panel inserts (left and right side panels, and a rear back panel), which are made with a finely woven Kevlar KM2 fiber. These two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The soft ballistic panels are produced in five different sizes (S-XXL), which are installed into their respective pocket on the OTV carrier shell.
The vest was tested to stop a 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullet at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 (minimum bullet Velocity for a 50% chance of penetration) of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel.
The Interceptor armor also has a PALS webbing grid on the front of the vest which accommodate the same type of pockets used in the Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (MOLLE) backpack/carry vest system. This allows a soldier to tailor-fit his MOLLE and body armor system. While not specifically designed for it, the loops can also easily attach All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment (ALICE)-based equipment, MOLLE's predecessor, as well as many pieces of civilian-made tactical gear, and also features a large handle on the back just below the collar which can be used to drag a wounded person to safety in an emergency.
Originally the Interceptor Body Armor System weighed 16.4 pounds (7.4 kg), with the vest weighing 8.4 pounds (3.8 kg), and two plate inserts weighing four pounds (1.8 kg) each. This is lighter than the previous Ranger Body Armor fielded in Somalia which weighed 25.1 pounds (11.4 kg).
Due to the increased dangers of improvised explosive devices, a newer version of the vital plates and components have been developed. The Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPIs) and Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBIs) have become available, along with the Deltoid and Axillary Protector System (DAPS). These new systems are becoming the standard for forward deployed troops. The E-SAPI plates offer increased protection from 7.62mm armor piercing ammunition. The ESBIs is an attachable MOLLE ballistic panel with a pouch for a 8x6 side-SAPI, for protection of the side of the torso/under the arm. DAPS consists of two ambidextrous modular components, the Deltoid (upper arm) Protector and the Axillary (under arm) Protector, and provide for additional protection from fragmentary and projectiles to the upper arm and underarm areas. With the Interceptor body armor, E-SAPI plates (10.9 pounds), ESBIs (7.75 pounds), DAPS (5.03 pounds) and with the neck, throat and groin protectors installed the armor is significantly heavier at 33.1 pounds (15 kg)."

tula ammo goes for 5$ a box of 20 so ... 20 / 100 = 5, 5x5 = 25 + a little extra id say due to there being about 120-150 rounds and its not cheap tula im going to say the ammos value is right around 45-55$ but i will price it fair at 35$

then theres some front sight adjustment tool got it for 15$ but hell i will say its 10$

cant really think of everything else i got for it. its basically a solid steel trunk with the ak pistol and a ridicoulus amount of upgrades and just extras with it that obviously i spent alot of money on.

i have a super discreet carrying case thats disguised as something . very special cost 15$ and alot of time to think up and looks professional. i wont charge for this....but you will be surprised when you see what it is.

i will have you know i have shot less than 50 rounds through it and clean and lubed it the one time i did shoot it., i took a buffer to the bolt and carrier and also the fire control group it is as slick as a 79 nova on chrome wheels. so it is very smothe and has no drag very easy pull back on this bolt of all the aks ive ever had. it also has a notch professionally cutout on the safety lever by century arms to lock the bolt back as a means of additional safety.

i also have the rear pistol grip sling plate installed thats a good 20$ but i wont include that ethier.

well lets see what the value is of all my stuff that obviously isnt brand new and i am not priceing it as such, im also knocking off alot of value just because i need the money so here goes lets see what it all added up to and you can do the math and read so if you want to argue about my prices than so be it this is what i want for it and i have google and internetz and gunbroker too so ya i wont take your 500$ for my 1000$ investment sorry...

The gloss finish on the Walnut straight grip stock contrasts beautifully with the deeply polished blue finish on the receiver and the barrel. This is what a serious lever-action rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was. Now it's even easier to hike or ride in deep where the big ones hide. With the flip of a switch the BLR is in two easy to carry pieces. 

• The button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.
• Every BLR barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
• The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
• The barrel’s standard sights include a Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility front blade with gold bead fitted on a raised ramp-style base.?
• The richly blued steel finish on all external surfaces is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
• The aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.
• The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.
• The BLR has a rotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.
• The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.
• The BLR has a recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.
• The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.
• The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.
• The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.
• The BLR’s trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.
• The fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.
• The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.
• Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.
• Magazine capacity is 3 rounds
• The BLR’s stock is sculpted from fine Walnut and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip.
• The straight grip BLR stock is true to the classic lines of the lever action rifle and has a traditional carbine strap at the fore-end.
• The BLR’s stock has a deep, glossy finish that brings out every nuance of the wood’s warm color and grain.
• The well-formed recoil pad helps reduce felt recoil and flinching.
• Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod"
