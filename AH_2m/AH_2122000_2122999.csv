The Ruger M77 MkII VLE is Ruger's little known Law Enforcement tactical rifle. The rifle is based off of the M77 MkII VT target/varmint rifle but has a few changes. All the metal work is a flat black finish vs. the flat grey color of the VT rifles. 

The VT and VLE rifles have a laminated stock which is nicely contoured with a very wide forearm. The stock is different in that it is composed of darker grey colored laminates, vs the brown colors of the VT. 

The barrel is not as heavy as most tactical rifles, which keeps weight down a little. 

The trigger is a 2 stage trigger, which I personally prefer. 

This VLE has a Redfield 3x9 Battlezone TAC-MOA scope mounted and a MidwayUSA cheek pad.

What makes it recoilless is the rifle-length gas system combined with the battlecomp 1.0 muzzle device. With this setup you can actually get the gun recoiling DOWN if you shoot fast enough. 

It is immensely controllable and has been put to good use, surviving a training class flawlessly without a single stoppage for any reason. 

The rifle's Palmetto State Armory lower is built with a White Oak Armament lower parts kit and includes their ALG trigger. The stock is a Magpul ACS, grip and trigger guard are also Magpul. The barrel is a Green Mountain 18"" made of 416R stainless steel and has a 1:7 twist (Green Mountain namelessly makes the barrels used in many top quality AR makers), with a Wilson Combat low-profile gas block. It runs a M16 BCG and the long handguard is a Troy VTAC. 

It also comes with ARMS backup flipup sights already installed and zeroed for 50 yards.

As you can see (or Google), the parts are all top-shelf and it shows. It shoots like a dream and the weight distribution makes it incredibly maneuverable. There is some wear on the left side of the lower from my belt buckle as it swung on me while slung, and there is some scratching on the bottom of the handguard from resting on different real-life barricades like car hoods and boulders. Obviously none of these minor cosmetic blemishes will impede function in any way and if I had planned on selling it then I would've taken better care of its aesthetics. I meant to keep this as my One Rifle but real life has intervened as it always does.

I will also include two metal high-quality D&H 30-round magazines with the rifle. 

Price is $1,250; cash only, no trades and will only sell to an Alabama resident with valid ID. I don't think you'll ever find this nice of a rifle at this low of a price on Armslist ever again. This is not some backyard special going for panic pricing; this is my go-to rifle, made up of top-shelf components, built to perform and to last."

Lately, this rifle spends most of her time in my safe as I have purchased a new hunting rifle and do not need both. She needs a new home where she will get lovingly used and cared for, and not end up a safe queen.

253,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2122253,For Sale/Trade:  As-New 2006 Suzuki Quadsport LTZ 250 For Sale or Trade,"Downtown Portland (NW 25th), Portland, Oregon","$ 3,200","Listed On: Friday, September 27, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hey there Armslister's,

I have for sale (or possible trade) a like-new 2006 Suzuki LTZ 250 Quadsport ATV, purchased new from Bob Lanphere's Dealership in Tigard, Oregon. This bike was never ridden and always properly stored in my garage (elevated with fluids drained), starts up immediately and is in perfect running condition, not a single issue. This is a 4-Stroke 250 with electric start and reverse, the motor itself is completely stock, has not been tampered with or adjusted in any way and per compression tests, is 100%.  I have all original manuals and tool kits as well, just like when purchased new.    In order to make this bike a little bit more fun, desirable and powerful, I did install the below list of new parts, and have receipts for everything.  These are very basic modifications, mostly just clip-on aftermarket performance parts, designed to increase the output and performance of the 250, which they definitely do.  Here's a short list of the parts and their corresponding prices that I purchased and installed on this 2006 Suzuki Quadsport LTZ 250:

Parts:

K&N SU-2504 Performance Air Filter - $65.00
Outerwears K&N Pre-Filter (Black) - $20.00
DG Performance 4/144 2"" Front Wheel Spacers - $65.00
DG Performance 4/144 2"" Rear Wheel Spacers - $47.60
HMF Competition Series 3-Stage Exhaust (Black) w/4"" Stainless Steel Connector Tube - $290 
HMF Carburetor Jet Kit (Needles, Seats, etc.) - $50
Procom CDI/ECU Box - $120
Suzuki OEM Front and Left Swing Arm Protectors (Bushed Aluminum, laser etched) - $31.00 
Suzuki OEM Full Chasis Skid Plate w/Drain Hole (Brushed Aluminum) - $50.00
BlackPath Aluminum Billet Gas Cap w/Short Breather Valve (Blue) - $25.00
Stainless Steel Suzuki OEM Rear Grab Bar w/6 Pack Holder - $63.00 
Suzuki OEM Rear Shock Cover (Blue) - $20.00
Black Aluminum Anodized Valve Stem Covers - $10.00

Recent Maintenance Prior to Selling: 


New Sealed OEM Maintenance Free Battery - $70.00
Battery Tender ""Junior"" Trickle Charger - $40.00 
OEM Suzuki Oil Filter + 2 New Oil Filter O-Rings - $15.00
New OEM 12V 40/40W Headlamp Bulb - $46.00
Fresh Oil Change w/Amsol 10-40W Synthetic Oil
Fresh Final Gear Oil Change w/Suzuki OEM Final Gear Fluid
3 gallons Fresh Non-Ethanol Fuel 

With all of the above being installed brand new and the original condition of the bike, this is one cool 250.  The wheel spacers give it a nice aggressive stance and make is much less likely to tip, the K&N Air Filter and HFM Competition Series Exhaust do wonders for both audibles and performance, and the Procom CDI/EDU box increases RPM's by about 1000, maximizing the bike's full potential.  Plus it has full under-body armor made for this bike by Suzuki, so you don't need to worry about riding rough, rocky, Oregon terrain.  For a smaller quad, the bike looks great, sounds great, is as reliable as you can get, and is just all around fun and easy to ride/maintain.  This would be a fantastic bike for a beginner or even someone who just wants something quick to get around on without having to worry about shifting or any of that.  

Come take a look, you won't be disappointed, I promise. I'm asking $3200 OBO which is more than reasonable considering what I put into it and the condition of the bike.

Although long, please read this ad in entirety before replying with questions or inquiries as all pertinent details and information are included below and everything is 100% accurate and truthful, no embellishment whatsoever and I have detailed records and receipts for everything below, further backing the integrity of the listing.  

I have for sale or trade a new 2006 Yamaha Banshee YFZ350V, the very last of the two stroke engine's produced by Yamaha Motor Corporation and purchased from Bob Lanphere's Dealership in Tigard, Oregon in late 2008, verifiable by Vehicle Identification Number JY43GG0306C067666.  This quad was originally purchased by my neighbor, and he died of cancer in 2009, never having got the chance to ride the bike, it just sat in his garage until I purchased it from his brother, and then it sat in my garage with all fluids drained until recently, when I've actually had the time to put some work into it.  This quad has only been started and ran for tuning purposes, i.e. carb re-jettting on a dyno, exhaust installation, etc. but has never been out otherwise. It has always been stored in a climate controlled garage with all fluids drained (gas, oil, coolant) and raised off the suspension  for proper storage, per the manufacturer's recommendations.  It comes complete with the original owners manual, tool kit and all other paperwork.  I bought this bike for the sole purpose of tuning up a brand new Yamaha Banshee, all parts are brand new and I have receipts for everything listed.  Absolutely no corners were cut as I'm a perfectionist, and the final product is the result of over two years work and monetary investment.  This bike is absolutely flawless, and has had every desirable modification done to it with premium parts.  I finally hit the point where no other modifications could be done without messing with the integrity of the engine itself (it has NOT been bored out or tampered with, and has all OEM suspension), so now it's time to put it to market and hopefully sell it to an appreciative buyer.  The bike runs seamlessly, idles perfectly, and always starts on the first kick.  It's very fast (registered at nearly 64 HP on the dyno) and has been tuned with the utmost attention to detail.  I also have all the original new OEM parts that will be included with the purchase of this bike, minus the original tires which I did sell to help pay for the Holeshot HD Tires.  So, that being said, here's a list of everything you get on this 2006 Yamaha Banshee including what I paid for it, and keep in mind, I have all my receipts for everything listed.

The gun actually has a low round count, we estimated it was most likely less than 500, and the top of the barrel and slide show little wear.  One 8 round Helwan original mag is included along with two ProMags, an 8 and an extended 10 round magazine.  The 10 round mag does stick down past the end of the gun more.  The gun is single action with fixed sights, the front I painted a white square for better visibility since it is normally plain black along with the black metal rear sights.  The left side of the grip is slightly broken near the dovetail but the other side is fine.  Please ask any questions and I can try to provide any other information you might want.

The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included. The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.

The Tiger Shark uses microprocessor technology to create a true dual function machine. In Normal Mode, the Tiger Shark works like any other Tesoro detector. It uses the same great ground balance and discrimination features that made the Bandido series so successful. On land, the Tiger Shark can be used for coin and relic hunting and even gold prospecting. By using the four controls on the outside, you can fine tune your detector to handle whatever conditions you are working in.

Working in the wet salt areas is where the Tiger Shark outshines the land detectors. In land conditions, the most crucial adjustment is using the ground balance to tune out mineralization. In wet salt conditions, changes in the conductivity in the sand cause most of the problems. The Tiger Shark uses a completely different set of internal settings in the SALT Mode than in the NORM Mode. There are no special controls or techniques to remember.

731,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2122731,For Sale:  Rare Old Belgian Bayard 16 Ga. Double Barrel,"Georgetown 40324, Lexington, Kentucky",$ 375,"Listed On: Monday, September 16, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Made in Belgium by Bayard-a famous expensive European manufacturer from the 1860's-1920's, known for their scroll work & built in cheek piece & factory sling mounts. This is a 16 ga., 29"" brls., checkered wood, external hammers. The wood is in really good cond, w/typical blemishes for the age. The orig. buttplate has a small section missing. Most of the orig. bluing is still there w/a nice patina, no rust. The entire receiver, trigger guard, side plates, & other misc. metal pieces have really nice scroll work/etchings. This model has the ejector. Hinge has slight play in it. Everything works on the gun like it should, but 1 hammer has been replaced & a screw broken off, although it doesn't come loose, & the hammer looks to be same part, but w/o scroll work. The bore of the barrels have pitting, I've lightly cleaned them, but haven't gone crazy. It still shoots great! I had some low velocity shells that I shot thru it, & if I still have a few, I'll include them. Neat rare piece that is shootable! Asking $375 cash. Local pick-up only! Must show valid KY ID to verify residency/age! Thank you!"

The 6.8mm SPC cartridge was designed to address the deficiencies of the terminal performance of the 5.56x45mm NATO and bridge the gap between 5.56mm and 7.62x51mm NATO.

The Ambush 6.8 SPCII hunting rifle delivers ample takedown power in a package light enough for the most mobile hunter. The adjustable buttstock gives another way to adjust the rifle to fit you, no matter your size or the clothes you’re wearing. Further augmenting operator comfort are the included modular rail sections and an adjustable indexable foregrip, enhancing your natural shooting position. Outfitted with a two stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Trigger to decrease rifle movement, the Ambush 6.8 SPCII realizes its superior accuracy to take 'em down in one shot. The Ambush 6.8 SPCII features a contiguous upper rail platform and a 12” modular free-float hand guard, which protects the barrel while giving plenty of real estate for hand placement or accessories.

This rifle boasts an 18"" Cold Hammer Forged Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel with a 1:11"" twist that has been Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure flawlessness and Salt Bath Nitride finished for extreme resilience. A mid-length gas system reduces recoil and heat-related wear to internal componentry. The muzzle is threaded for easy installation of flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and even sound suppressors. The upper receiver complies with military specifications and features M4 feed ramps for smooth feeding. The bolt carrier group is Magnetic Particle Inspected and properly staked.

This rifle ships in a padded hard case.

Prefer Face-to-Face transaction.

I have a 1937 Walther PP .32 cal that sits in my safe and needs a great home.  This gun is a collector's item or can be carried.  It's in beautiful shape, the smoothest slide action I've seen on any Walther (mainly because this one is German made).

The serial number dates back to 1937 (Pre-war) gun and was issued to an officer in the Finance Ministry.  Carries the Crown N proof on the barrel, slide and frame.  Bares R.F.V. 9992 W on the frame, ""Reichsfinanzverwaltung” (Reich Finance Administration). This organization was the Nazi equivalent of the United States IRS.

The gun is in good condition.  Mechanically everything works great. The bore is shiny, but the bluing is worn near the muzzle and on parts of the slide from holster wear.

I bought this from a guy who's grandfather brought it back from his time in Europe during WWII.  The holster is original tan leather in fantastic condition.

I took this to the range, shot 1/2 box of .32 through it and it was perfect.  Low recoil, accurate as can be.  It comes with metal finger-grip magazine as well, however I'd recommend a new magazine if you're going to use this as a carry piece.

The cantilever positions the scope out front over any handguard or barrel nut, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Barrel: 16"" Mil-spec barrel steel, mid-length gas, Special lighter profile barrel, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, chrome lined bore and M4 barrel extension made for us right here in Columbia SC by FN Manufacturing.  Barrels are high pressure tested, mag particle inspected.  Profile starts out as an A2 under the handguards, but then is relieved between the gas block and the muzzle for better balance.  Requires a .750"" gas block.

 Barrels are marked ""5.56 NATO 1/7 CL MP Palmetto"".

The rifle has a 22"" barrel, synthetic stalk and adjustable rear sight.  The rifle will come with ammunition to test fire it if you like but that is all.  The rifle comes with the original box and manual.  The gun sells new for about $200.00 from Cabelas but I think that is way overpriced.
