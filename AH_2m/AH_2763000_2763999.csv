123,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2763123,For Sale:  sks with a Lot of upgrades,"Santa Fe, NM, New Mexico, United States",$ 375,"Listed On: Monday, March 3, 2014",Rifles,Norinco                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"When I bought this rifle last summer, it already had this ATI tactical folding stock on it. My opinion is that this is a far superior stock to the cheap Tapcos out there.  This stock was not fitted correctly when I got it, so I went to work and fitted it right. The ATI doesn't allow for the folding bayonet to be attached for a reason (sorry zombie hunters, lol). It is solid in the forearm area, and has a Picatinney rail there to allow attachment of accessories including lights and a vertical for grip. This is a much better system and allows better accuracy as well. There are also accessory rails on the sides of the forearm. the have covers also.

Since have fitted the removable covers to the rails,  it is quite comfortable to grip securely. If you want a vertical grip, good. Because that will come with it too. I regularly shoot this rifle at 220 meters offhand with superb accuracy, and have it set up to be a 10 of 10 on a gallon milk jug at that range. Basically anything inside 300 meters is a lock. I know that sounds like a stretch, but it isn't. 

Here are some other upgrades: Matching blued bolt (looks like Russian), high visibility front sight, upgraded gas piston, AK74 type muzzle break,  folding four position buttstock, bolt modification to allow mag changes with the bolt closed, trigger job, Mil-spec butt pad, four custom fitted 30 round Tapco polymer magazines, one US steel magazine, upgraded firing pin, polished and tuned action. One custom fitted 5-round hunting magazine (pigs are always in season in New Mexico) I am forgetting some.

It will also come with its original ten round fixed magazine as well, but you will probably never install it. This is a chrome lined bore, so minimal cleaning, and it just has superb accuracy and reliability. I have NEVER had a failure to eject, feed, or fire with it.

If you like to shoot but don't want to pay high prices for ammunition, the 7.62x39 is a great round. Prices range from $5.19 a box at Walmart (and they always have it) to about $6.00 a box at local sporting goods stores. So this is cheap shooting and ammunition is always available. I have had zero problems getting it. Power is on par with a .30-30, but recoil on these gas operated rifles is almost nil. My 5'2, 110 pound wife can shoot it all day.

Ok, so if this one is so great, why am I selling it, and why so cheap? Simple. Two reasons: I like to build these rifles and when they are tuned and finished, I want to build another one. The second reason is that while I shoot these I don't collect them I collect old Russian bolt actions and I need room for more of those. 

So if you have read this far and want a rifle that can protect your home or want one to hunt with - or just want one to play with, I think this one would be a pretty good choice. Even you Zombie hunters might like it. There are more than $100 worth of magazines alone that will go with this rifle, and another couple of hundred in upgrades, plus labor to do it. If you have wanted an SKS but they don't fit you because the stock is too short, don't worry. This one will extend out past where even I need to go, and I am 6'2'. It's quite comfortable.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number an we can arrange to meet in person. You will like this SKS. Frankly if I hadn't bought 15 rifles in the past 5 weeks, I would not be selling it.

Thanks for reading.

Okay, that's not true, to be honest it has some surface wear as seen in the photos. It cycles flawlessly as long as you don't use light 2 3/4 loads.

Other info: I have for sale a Glock 17c Gen 3. This started life as a frame/lower which I obtained in a trade. The exact round count on the lower is unknown, but the previous owner told me he only used it twice, both times with an Advantage Arms .22LR conversion (he said he sold the upper BNIB). I went on Gunbroker and bought a complete 17c upper for it, and have used it for 500 rounds with no issues. Fun to use, especially when you actually see it flash out the ports on occasion.

It has I believe an OEM extended slide lock lever and a OEM extended magazine release installed, and a grip plug installed. I also installed a Grip Force beavertail adapter and the big Decal Grip rubber stickers/overlays on it (both can be removed if desired). It will come with the original case, a OEM Glock magazine loader, one 10 round magazine, and a Hogue handall rubber grip.

If you want a deal on an amazing AR-15 now is the time to act. This is a Daniel Defense M4V3 mounted on an Anderson Manufacturing lower. The upper has less than 250 rounds through it, and the lower has less than 50. The lower was built using a Palmetto State Armory lower parts kit. In my opinion this is one of the best kits out there. I've used others considered to be ""high end,"" but this kit is better in my opinion. To top things off the lower has a Magpul MOE stock and pistol grip.

Features
- Daniel Defense 16"" cold hammer forged barrel
- chrome lined bore and chamber
- mid-length gas system
- Omega X rail system
- Daniel Defense BCG and charging handle

Asking price is $1,100.00. Would be willing to negotiate a trade for a lightly used M1A Socom. I'm willing to piece it out. $950 for upper and LMT sight, $850 for just the upper."

A sleek, handy rimfire that’s making a big impact on varmints and small game. Chambered for the hot 17HMR, it launches a 17-grain projectile at 2,500 fps – 25% faster than a 22 Win. Mag. – and does it with pinpoint accuracy. This rifle’s 22"" heavy varmint barrel cools quickly for exceptional shot-to-shot consistency. And, it’s built on a field-proven break action that comes complete with a scope. The stock and fore-end are high-density black polymer, with a recoil pad and sling swivel studs."

It's less than a month old and has about 180 rounds thru it. Had no issues, gun shoots great. I prefer a mid-length and longer hand guard so I'm looking to sell this carbine to buy a mid-length rifle. 

I replaced the standard M4 hand guard with a two piece UTG quad rail. It also comes with rubber rail covers. I've attached a Bushnell TRS-25 micro red dot on a UTG riser mount (high mount for absolute co-witness). I've got a generic rubber pad on the stock. One standard USGI magazine is included. Gun is in original packaging with everything that came from the factory...manual,lock, etc. I'll also include a delta ring tool (not pictured) which I bought to replace the hand guard. 

The M400 is a great AR carbine rifle. It has all the right specs you'd want in an AR rifle. In addition, It has ambi mag release, QD attachment on the lower receiver and spring that acts as a self tension adjusting feature which locks the lower and upper for a tight and solid fit. See more specs below. 

Action Type: Direct-gas-impingement operated, semi-automatic
Caliber: 5.56 NATO
Barrel: 16 inches; chrome-moly, chrome-lined chamber and bore
Rifling: 6 grooves; 1:7-inch RH twist
Trigger Pull Weight: 5 pounds
Stock: Six-position, M4 collapsible

It's a great gun with all the right specs and features at entry AR price. $880 for everything. The gun is practically new. Valid VA driver license and second form of ID will be required (preferably a carry permit or voter registration). I will also require that you sign a bill of sale.
