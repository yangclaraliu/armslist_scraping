The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other p­istols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

So I guess Cabela's had Remington Thunderbolts for sale today.  2.99/box of 50. Limit one box.  I thought that was silly, but they sold out so I guess a lot of people disagree with me.  $31.80 out the door for a brick, plus your gas to go there, or at least $5 shipping.  (And that was IF they had let you buy 10 boxes, which they didn't.)
So if you missed your opportunity to get in on that fabulous deal, or your one box limit wasn't enough for you, I have one brick and 10 individual 50 round boxes (1000 rounds total) that I'll never shoot and I will sell for $70.


I also have 3 bricks of Golden Bullets 525 packs that I can sell.  I like this ammo, so my price is $45 each.  All 3 for $130.

I am more looking for trade. If You want to pay cash there will be a little premium. Not to gouge... more to encourage trade. But if you want to pay over an above I guess i'll consider it.

This isn't an auction type sale. The first solid thing(s) that strike my interest and solid meeting will get my trade. Very simple. I need to make room. I enjoy going to my local shops and shooting the s**t. Buy a box or 2 of ammo. This is what im willing to part with

Prices are firm for trade. Im not looking to exact match price of your item to my item. If we are both happy that's what im after. If you have a new in box item never fired I will take $25 off new price. We will judge used items as condition. 



If your wanting ammo... that I have. And you have something you don't shoot or shoot often. Offer it and see if there is a deal to be made. Im not looking to get over on someone. Fair value to fair value. Doesn't have to be an amazing piece.

If you have a scope on your item.. lets just take it off the table.

Brand new rifle built with an Anderson Arms lower and Palmetto State Enhanced LPK. Upper is a PSA PTAC 16"" M4 profile 1/7 twist with dust cover, forward assist and Mil Spec BCG/ Carpenter 158 bolt not 8620. This is a quality gun I built as a nice alternative to an out of the box plinker sport model AR made with inferior parts.  Comes with a Magpul MBUS flip up rear sight, the real one not the airsoft model that a lot of people slap on guns to sell. 

Would consider trade plus cash (.45 only) but mainly looking to sell.

First off, I am a dealer and as such there is a background check and transfer paperwork. This must be done at my office in Oshkosh (or a gun show). I can't meet you someplace else or deliver. Wisconsin has a 48 hour ""waiting period"" for handguns, so you would need to come back after that time to pick up at my office.


I've shot one myself and it really can be shot with just one hand. Virtually no recoil even when compared to an AR15. But wear ear protection. The aggressive muzzle break works great but does produce a louder report. Alot of fun in a compact package.

I have the sling mount and rail kits in stock.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."

Maybe shot 300-400 times and then kept as a safe queen. I am really only wanting to trade it for a two tone 1911. I bought a two tone one a while back and just love it and thats what I carry when im feeling classy! So I thought I would trade this one for another one. Sorry does not have night sights!

Walnut Hardware with nice tight grain.

There were only 35881 Fultons manufactured between 1918-1946.

Was re-chambered at some point to 356 Winchester. What this means for you is your probably going to want to be a hand loader, there is factory ammo available still, but only one flavor, and its not cheap. the good news is I have the dies and around 100 cases that would come with the rifle (as well as a grab bag of various components, not a ton, but enough to get you started loading for it). Also has original wood stock & for-grip. Previous owner added is own checkering to them, their kind of cool, but I lightened it up with the composite set for packing around the woods.

Shoots very accurately, will clover leaf at 50 yards (with optics mounted). Comes with xs rail & ghost ring sight. Action can become finicky while shooting, but has always ran, but could use a little tinkering to fine tune; but it does run.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

Dated 1989 and the 29 before the serial indicates that this was a limited production year. http://www.makarov.com/makfaq.html Everything is perfectly straight on this gun. No canted sights, no poor rivet work, etc. Not like the bastardized ak's you see out there.  Hate to see this one go. Price is firm. No trades. Comes with 1 30 rd mag.

In case you are not aware the AK74 was designed in 1974 and is the AK currently in use by Russian military as well as a host of other countries. This cartridge is comparable to the 556. Actually, it was developed in response to the 556. What makes this round so unique is its tendency to yaw shortly after penetrating for inflicting maximum damage. It is said that the mujahadeen nicknamed it the poison bullet for its devastating effects when they encountered it in Afghanistan. It shoots flatter than the 7.62x39 and its less recoil will allow more rounds on target than the 7.62. 

The AK74 retains all of the same reliability qualities as the AK47. More pics available upon request."

Definitely a head-turner!

A quick note on ""featureless"" AR15s:

In the state of California, all AR15 rifles must not have a detachable magazine. There are two ways to get around this. The first way is by installing a ""bullet button"". These devices only allow the magazine to be dropped by using a tool (a bullet works). Personally, I hate this. The second way is to have an AR15 that has no ""evil features"". This means a fixed stock, no flash hider (compensators are fine), no vertical forward grip, and no pistol grip. Buy building a featureless rifle, you're able to drop the magazine just by pushing the mag release button. This rifle is featureless. 

Build Specs:

AR FiveSeven lower
Palmetto State Armory LPK & UPK
Palmetto State Armory upper reciever
Bravo Company medium ""gunfighter"" charging handle
Palmetto State Armory auto-profile BCG
AR Stoner 16"" barrel
Yankee Hill Machine black gas block and tube
Exile Hammerhead grip
Diamondhead VRS-T 10.25"" free-flat hand guard
Magpul MOE stock
Ambidextrous safety selector
Magpul MBUS front and read sights
Primary Arms 3moa red dot sight on a cantilever mount
VG6 Gamma compensator

Comes with two Magpul 10rd. Pmags and 120 rounds of 55 grain FMJ.

This baby shoots like a dream. No muzzle rise and hardly any recoil. By installing the Exile grip, the rifle is held just like a traditional rifle. It is very comfortable to hold, and I actually prefer the Exile grip over a pistol grip.

Now you may be wondering why I'm getting rid of it if it shoots so nice. Well, I just don't really like ARs that much. It really is a fantastic gun, but I much prefer lever and bolt action rifles, auto pistols, and revolvers. 

So, what am I looking to trade for? Lots of things.

Non-guns:
I dunno. Again, open to offers.
