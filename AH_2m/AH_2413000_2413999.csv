The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

I have three Lee 1000 progressive reloaders. Each is set up with carbide dies and powder measures and ready to load ammo.
There is one in 38/357 complete. One in 9mm complete and one in .45 acp that is minus the case feeder but working just fine other than you load the cases one at a time.
I have various parts and have the three of them mounted so a person can see them run. 10 disks for the measures and nylon ratchets to use for rebuild if ever needed along with various small parts.
Due to injury I have not been able to compete as I once did and these machines have sat for the last year. All have lots of life left in them.
I would take $250.00 for the three machines and what ever parts I have around for them.
I'd rather not split them up at this time but may if there is no interest in the set.
Thanks!"

Some info on Romanian wasr rifles. some people dislike wasr rifles because they have a reputation for being poorly built from spare parts kits. This may be true for some rifles produced while their quality control was lax/different management. This rifle however is built from all number matching parts. As well as chrome lined barrel.   some extra little known info about some ak 47 pattern rifles I wont name any names to not piss off other sellers on armslist do some research and you will find the brands im mentioning. To import ak's they modified the rifles to only accept single stack magazines in doing so some manufacturers simply built new forward trunions narrowed the stripper lug on the bolt and stamped new sheet metal receivers  these new parts were to make the rifle accept the single stack magazines for importation. Wasr rifles are built with all standard military internals (most importantly double stack capable forward trunion and bolt.) the only thing they do on wasr's is stamp a new sheet metal receiver that is single stack and throw all of the military parts back in. After importation the sheet metal is cut to widen the mag well to accept double stack magazines and 922r parts are added. This is true for many ak's however the catch for some ak's NOT WASR's is that the internal trunion has to be milled out as well as the sheet metal and much of the time the narrow bolt is reused  put these three things together and you get feed issues/mag wobble with some guns. Because wasr's only need one cut to be made on sheet metal there is less work and thus less error.  (trunion is the part that the barrel and receiver are attached to as well as the magazine. stamped ak's have two trunions a forward and a rear the rear accepts the stock)(look up 922r yourself)  ill stop with the talk."

 The TA31RCO-M150CP is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the US Army's M4 weapon system. It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Army, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO-M150CP features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included).

Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

The 75 B features a steel frame, a black polycoat finish, 3 dot sights, 16+1 9mm capacity (12+1 in .40 S&W) and, of course, the ergonomics and DA/SA action that have made it the most copied handgun design second only to the 1911. The 'B' designation is an indicator that the model is equipped with a firing pin block safety.

I listed this gun on Thursday morning and got about a dozen emails on it. I gave the first guy who emailed me a call and he said he would take it. So being the trusting fool I am, I thanked the other inquirers and deactivated this listing.  The guy even told me how he hated for people to stiff him on Armslist. Never happened to me here but I empathized with him. What does he do to me besides stringing me out  for 2 days? You guessed it. Now he wanted even more time. For an $85 gun. So now here I am wih a reactivated ad. Please don't arrange to meet me and have me rearrange my day off twice if you don't have 85 bucks. I am not trying to be a jerk here, but it's 85 freaking dollars. I know 85 dollars is a lot of money to a lot of people. But this guy was telling me about his AR15 and quad rails and acting like he was my friend. I wouldn't doubt it if this pistol is worth exactly $85 more than his imaginary AR. I just had to get this off my chest. Gun people are normally honorable so I'm guessing this guy isn't one of us anyway. 
Now back to the gun...This one is a really good gun, and I am only selling this one (and a couple of others already sold) so I can piddle around and rescue some more. Once they are finished, I generally lose interest and go on to the next project gun. But not until I am sure they are dead reliable. This one comes with two original magazines. Since tuning, it is dead nuts reliable with 6 rounds instead of the 5 rounds marked on it. I have hand fitted both mags as well and they work great.

What is there to say? This is a good shooting handgun that is accurate and functions perfectly. I have a bunch of these, and I have learned how to tune them to make them reliable. This is one of those. Since it has a fixed barrel it happens to also be accurate. I routinely shoot spent shotgun  shells at 20-30 yards with these. On this particular one I tuned it and added three dot fluorescent orange sights. Lol, I actually drilled all the way through my left index finger when I was drilling the dimples. so this one has my blood, sweat, and tears invested in it.

The best part is...where else can you find a reliable semiauto pistol in a serious caliber(.380 ACP) with 2 mags for $85 ? They make a great car gun or just plink with it like I do.  I had one failure to feed and that was while I was intentionally trying to limp wrist it using flat point bullets. Other than that it has been perfect. 

Contact me through Armslist and we can arrange to meet in Santa Fe any time. I will show you how to keep it running great indefinitely. These are neat little guns despite their low price. They just need some initial tweaking since they were made to be sold at a very low price point. I have done this.

To be Honest the box and papers look to be mostly covered in some kind of oil.(possibly gun oil from the gun it self being cleaned in the box over and over again since 1935)
Also the box is a little beat up most likely from sitting around a garage for 78 years.

I do not know where the firearm is now (I really wish I did) but this box would be great for a collector despite its shape.

the pages are very fragile but all of the info in the manuals is readable.

The innovative Browning A-Bolt delivers dependable, pinpoint accuracy that exceeds the stringent standards of the modern rifleman.  With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.  This rifle is slightly used and has one blemish at the top of the wooden stock.  For sale at Plan B Pawn & Consignment, 2400 Lincoln Ave, Steamboat Springs, CO 80487. Feel free to call REDACTED.

It's also very comfortable with a decent quality holster as I've been carrying it every day for 4 months with an Aegis Armory Shield holster.

I bought it new back in July and, except for a single FTF in the first box of ammo, it's performed flawlessly after about 550 rounds. It feeds everything and has a great, short trigger with a pretty short reset. I'm only selling it now because I'm fickle, purchased a Beretta PX4 Compact and would like the money from the sale to fund another purchase in the near future.

The SR9C came with 2 magazines - a 10 rounder and a 17 rounder with the grip sleeve - but I am including 2 extra 10 round magazines along with their respective pinky extensions.

Also, I went ahead and installed a 16lb stainless steel guide rod and striker indicator from Galloway precision. There was nothing wrong with the original guide rod except that I didn't like the plastic cap at the front. The original black striker indicator is a little difficult to see so I replaced it with the steel version which both looks and functions better. I'm also including the original guide rod and striker indicator as well.

I did put rubberized Talon grips on it which feel really good in the hand. You can easily remove them however.

It does have one small scratch on the back plate near the hole for the striker indicator and a slight amount of wear on top of the slide, just forward of the rear sight. Otherwise, it's in like-new condition."

Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.

Henry U.S. Survival AR-7
Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Henry U.S. Survival AR-7
Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

Henry U.S. Survival AT-7 x-ray
When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

Henry US Survival in the wild
Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

The new ambidextrous lightweight thumbhole 10/22® stock is made of polypropylene with fiber additives for maximum strength. The stock comb height is designed high enough to comfortably and properly shoot with optics. The new stock design also features a checkered semi palm swell on both sides of the pistol grip, and a molded-to-fit hard rubber butt plate attached with screws.

This rifle is equipped with the Magnum Lite® revolutionary patented graphite bull barrel, exclusive to Magnum Research. The patented uni-directional graphite fibers, parallel to the bore axis, results in a barrel with 6x the stiffness of the equivalent weight of steel. The lighter barrel weights (from 13-16 oz, depending on barrel length) are easier to wield and dissipate heat up to 43% faster than steel. The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy.

Other features include a .22LR Bentz target chamber designed specifically for semi-automatics and a full floating barrel with an 11 degree muzzle crown for maximum accuracy. Magnum Lite® receivers are CNC machined from a 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging and include an integral Weaver type rail for optics. The MLR22AT has an approximate weight of 4.25 lbs, barrel length of 17 inches, and over all length of 35.5 inches.

This rifle utilizes the 10/22® trigger group and 10/22® rotary magazines. MRI bolts are manufactured and machined from heat treated and through hardened 4140 steel with minimum headspace for better accuracy.

As barrel and gas system length is reduced, reliable function can be compromised. Purchasing a factory built SBR designed from the ground up and fine-tuned to be a short-barreled system greatly increases 
reliability and function. 

SIG SAUER has previously offered complete short-barreled upper receivers for their SIG516® rifles, but 
this is the first time complete rifles are to be offered in SBR configurations. 

Preferred by entry teams and CQB specialists for greater maneuverability in tight places, SBRs deliver 
significant ballistic performance over pistol-caliber weapons. With the growth of the suppressor market, 
SBRs have also seen increased interest from those who want a suppressed rifle without introducing 
additional length. 

The Factory SBR Program will offer shortened variants of all SIG SAUER semi-automatic rifles, from the 
.22LR SIG522™ to the 7.62 NATO SIG716®. Each platform will have a SBR-tuned gas system to ensure 
maximum performance and reliability. 

SBRs are available in Classic, Patrol and SWAT configurations, giving the user a wide variety of options. 
All NFA rules do apply; so please see your Class III firearms dealer for ordering information.

With 1 cartridge and 1 holster

Centerfire, double action, “decock only” magazine-fed, autoloading, recoil-operated pistol. The P91DC is chambered for the .40 S & W cartridge. 

Sights have high-visibility white dots both front and rear. Rear sights can be adjusted for windage.
Slide’s open top design minimizes possibility of jamming, enables shooter to clear any malfunction easily by hand. Cartridges can be loaded singly if desired.
Grooved, exposed hammer spur enables the shooter to cock the hammer easily for accurate single-action firing if desired.
To decock the pistol, depress the decocking lever until the hammer drops. This action moves the firing pin forward into the slide. This temporarily places the firing pin out of reach of the hammer stroke and locks the firing pin a neutral position, preventing it from moving toward the cartridge.

RELEASING EITHER DECOCK LEVER WILL ALLOW THE LEVERS TO SPRING UPWARD TO THEIR ORIGINAL POSITION, PLACING THE PISTOL IN A FIRING CONDITION.

Frame is precision investment cast in lightweight aluminum alloy, hard-coated for toughness. Double-action mechanism and strongly curved trigger provide that cocking and firing can be accomplished with a single pull of the trigger. Oversize trigger guard permits shooting with gloved hand. Recurved trigger guard bow accommodates non- shooting hand in two-hand hold. The ambidextrous magazine latch permits positive retention and quick removal of magazine.
Slide stop holds the slide open and is activated automatically when last shot is fired (if magazine is in pistol), or can be manually operated.
Lanyard loop provides security for carrying in the field or police use."

There may be one or two places Online that has one but they all want $400-$500 or so for one.

This would be perfect for that lightweight, 14.5 build and why not have the best of the best U.S. military barrel that can be had? I bought this off Armslist the other night with the intention of building a mid range gun but found a complete upper somewhere else so I now don't need this barrel. 

To move this barrel quick, I WILL TAKE CASH OR TRADE OFFERS FOR IT. The first person able to PM and meet me the fastest will get it. Who wouldn't want a Colt?

Trades I will consider at $400-$500 value:

1. Complete high end lower ($400-$500 value) to include big name lower, nicer LPK, ALG or better installed trigger, Magpul or better buttstock, upgraded buffer and tube, etc. I'm not trading straight across for a no name brand lower with unknown LPK, junk trigger and Magpul knockoffs from eBay.

2. Combination of AR related parts that I need such as WMD, Fail Zero or other nickel boron BCG/hammer group, Noveske Pig flash hider, 7 or 9"" YHM, Midwest, D&D, Troy or other skeletal style lightweight forend/quad rail, Rainier Arms Raptor ambi charging handle, ALG, Geissele, Timney trigger group, stripped lower (name brand), etc.

3. Optics wanted: Trijcon RMR-01 (LED), Docter reflex (genuine, no fakes), Burris Fastfire III (retail for $250 so I will want something to go with it), etc. I am looking for a big name mini-reflex style sight for a pistol AR build. I will also consider a straight trade for eotech XPS-2, Aimpoint, etc. Must be either new are LNIB.

4. Gun trades: $400-$500 gun or combination of guns...looking for 9mm compacts (would consider straight trade for Glock 19), other ARs, AKs, Krinks, mint Arisaka rifle (no aftermarket stocks) partial trade, etc. Let me know what you have.

EGYPTIAN RASHEED 7.62X39MM SEMI AUTO RIFLE. This unique design is a cross between the Hakim rifle (evolved from the Swedish Ljungman) and the Russian SKS. It uses the basic operating system and stock design of the Hakim, but incorporates the exposed barrel, front sight and folding knife bayonet popular with the Soviet Union, as well as use of their 7.62x39mm cartridge. These are believed to have been made circa 1959-60 to provide large numbers of arms using the same ammo as the Russian supplied AK-47s being adopted at that time. This very rare carbine is in great condition. Wood stock is very nice, with assorted minor handling dings of an issued military arm, but none really significant. Has original 10 round magazine. These were made at ""Factory 54"" which later became Maadi Military and Civil Industries Corp. Overall, a very good example of a very scarce rifle, with something like only 6,000-8,000 total production and only about 2,000 brought into the USA. This carbine is a key piece for the “assault rifle” collector or someone interested in Egyptian arms, middle eastern arms or the evolution of the combat rifle. This is one nobody else you know will have. No trades !!!!!! Leave your name and # and I'll call you back. ALL OTHER EMAILS WILL BE DELETED WITH NO REPLY."
