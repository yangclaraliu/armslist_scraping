 However everything must go at some point, and now is the time for this spectacular & collectible pistol. 

Pistol is in at least 95% overall condition. It's a single action semi-auto and resembles the German Luger, however it's much more robustly built. It's chambered in standard 9mm Luger. 

Metal finish is excellent with very few handling marks. Grips are perfect & bore is bright/shiny with no rusting, pitting, or other imperfections whatsoever. 

Pistol was made in 1944 by Husqvarna (Sweden) and It is 100% original - not an arsenal refurb or refinished piece. It is one of about 10,000 that was contracted by and then sold to Denmark. It is stamped with the Danish military/police unit marks, plus all of the normal Swedish proof and inspection marks. All numbers on pistol match, however Lahti magazines are not numbered. 

There is a very similar pistol listed right now (by Jackson Armory) on Gunbroker for $1595. 

Pistol comes with a correct & original holster/belt that is black leather with brass hardware in very good condition. Also included are 4 original magazines, oiler, cleaning rod, magazine loader/screwdriver tool, & original Lahti leather lanyard. Plus 3.5 boxes of collectible 9mm ammo by Sako. The ammo is beautiful for 1950's production and has SINOXOID non-corrosive primers. 

My asking price for everything is $1300 or best reasonable offer.  

FTF transaction with pickup in Brandon Florida. You must be at least 21 and a Florida resident to purchase. A proper bill of sale will be provided. 

I'd be happy to arrange a time for a serious buyer to inspect this pistol in person as the photos don't do it justice.

i have a slightly used Wise Lite Arms Gen 2 AK47 pistol. (like a draco ) After some research on it, it seems to be somewhat rare. Measures about 19 inches from end to end. Comes with a 30 rd tapco polymer smooth side mag(these fit better than steel mags ive found in all my AKs..no mag wobble at all) . Very hard to find item here. This is one of the best AK pistols you can buy.  Very Solidly built.  Functions and cycles perfectly, a great AK pistol.  Its fun, but im just looking to fund another project at the moment. I can include a few rounds of 7.62 (the sooner, the more ammo ill include).

I have more pictures upon request and can do a ""proof of life"" thing (i understand the doubt as when you google this my pictures pop up as some of the firet ones. But that also demonstrates the rarity.  This isnt just any old draco)

Manufacturer: Wise Lite 
Model: Gen 2 
Action: Semi-automatic 
Caliber: 7.62 X 39 
Barrel Length: 7"" 
Frame/Material: Steel 
Finish/Color: Black 
Grips/Stock: Synthetic 

Thanks

Price is firm. These are right in line with what i paid a year ago (i paid $850. taking the loss to fund another project.)

Still has original box, manual, and brush. It's only had about 200 rounds put through it and still runs like it did when it was new. Has a rail under the barrel so you can attach your favorite flashlight or laser.

If you don't know about the Rhinos, they have their barrels aligned with the lowest cylinder, so the recoil from each shot goes straight back into your wrist and reduces muzzle rise. A rhino will have much less felt recoil and muzzle rise than a conventional magnum revolver. .38 specials out of the Rhino feel like .22lr's and you can go through a box of .357 mag without having sore wrists afterwards. Designed by the same man who designed the Mateba Autorevolver, the Rhino shares a lot of the same characteristics, mainly the lower axis barrel. 

I'm in no big hurry to sell this pistol, I just don't have the time to shoot it anymore and would prefer to have a semiautomatic pistol for home defense. 

I'd prefer to trade this for a HK 45, HK USP (or compact), or a double stack 1911, Sig Sauer 1911, a glock 34 with some cash, ammo, or accessories on your end, but will also take $850 cash for it. Contact me via email with offers, worse I can say is no and will respond to all offers."

If you already have an SBR or ar pistol i will only hold the lower until stamp is sent. Will possibly sell certain items if interested in specific parts.  If buying the upper alone, you will need either a current registered SBR or an AR pistol to meet ATF regulations, if buying the lower alone I can complete the SBR deactivation paperwork but upper will have to be sold prior. Just so there is no misunderstanding on the trigger group, the Geiselle Super 3 Gun trigger is an extreme light weight and short reset trigger that is meant to send as many rounds down range as quick as possible, this trigger group can be held in the floating position that allows for a bump fire effect (awesome trigger!).

This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil
when using an AR-style pistol.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols
equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the
operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A
flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features
- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
- ATF compliant*
- Veteran designed
- Made in USA
- Quick and easy to install

* ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control.

Note: Also available on P516™ and P556® Pistols in states where permitted. PM400 and P716 models available soon. 

A portion of the proceeds from the sale of every SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace goes to support the veterans of HAVA (Honored American Veterans Afield).

I had planned to just keep them but I have have a change of heart so they are back up.  I will also sell them for the cash price listed below.

1). Nikon Monarch 2.5-10x42 with BDC reticle. I really love this scope but don't care for the BDC. Since Nikon doesn't change reticles I am just going to let it go I guess. Glass is in superb condition and is very clear as usual with Monarchs. The scope does have ring scratches but that is the only cosmetic issue. Everything from the factory included (box, papers, flip up caps etc). Lifetime warranty.  $250 Cash firm or $300 trade

2). Burris Signature 1.5-6x32. Made in USA scope. These scopes have great glass and are built rugged. They are a step ABOVE Burris Fullfield's. I own a few Fullfield's and can confidently say the Signature is significantly better, especially in low light. The only issue since new is it has a tiny dust spot on the inside of the lense Only at 1.5 power, size of a pen dot. It is at the very edge of the glass and again Only at 1.5 power. It doesn't show in your field of view unless you look for it at the edge. It never bothered me so I didn't send it to Burris. It has a no questions asked Lifetime Warranty.  $250 Cash firm or $300 trade

If you would like to purchase both together I would be willing to do $425 for BOTH.  Thanks for the interest everyone!"

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

1938 Mossberg & Sons model 44b .22LR in oroginal form with the rarest sight set (Mossberg & Sons 3 apurature peep sight). This sight set, unlike the army models does not have to be removed  or flopped to the side to take out the bolt. 
The finish on this gun is great for as old as it is with only a little wear on the blue finish and a great finish on the stock.
History: 1938 was the first year of production for the M44b .22LR and was hand built until the contract with the US Army. This Rifle is marked Patent Pending without a serial #, making it one of the very first M44b rifles ever built.

I just returned from an extended road trip/vacation and along the way I traded a couple of guns off. So now I have ammo I have no need for.

4- boxes of PMC 38 Special, $20 a box or trade round for round, 9 mm or 45 ACP, take all four boxes and I will throw in the two speed strips shown in the picture for FREE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 1700 rounds of .22, I don't like the paper boxes Winchester uses so I bought the watertight plastic boxes shown in the picture, see below.
333 rounds of Winchester LR HP plus box
360 rounds of Winchester LR HP plus box
900 rounds, of Winchester LR HP in hundred round reusable boxes

Now, here's the deal, I will sell the .22's for $8 a hundred. If you take them all, I will give you for FREE, the three plastic watertight boxes shown in the picture, that's an extra $25 value in your pocket.

Trades----I will trade for 9 mm or 45 ACP. 
250 rounds of .22 = 1 box of 9mm
300 rounds of .22 = 1 box of 45 ACP.
I am only interested in ammo made on this side of the great water, no Russian, Bulgaria, India, Pakistan, Japan, etc, the list goes on with what Walmart imports.

Sierra Varminter Bullets deliver the performance and consistency needed in the demanding sport of varmint hunting. Lightly constructed to provide explosive expansion while minimizing ricochets. These lightweight bullets easily handle being pushed at very high velocities to obtain flatter trajectories. Trust Sierra Varminter bullets to perform like you expect on your next varmint hunting trip. These bullets are ideal for use in the 222 Remington and 223 Remington. Recommended for use in barrels with a 1 in 12"" twist or slower as these bullets can disintegrate in mid-air if fired out of a fast twist rate barrel. This is not loaded ammunition.

Only had 50 rounds through it, has two 12 round mags. Excellent carry gun, very light weight and the same size as a Glock 26.

No issues with it, I just prefer to shoot .40 in a semi auto.  I'd like to trade for the same gun in .40 but I'm open to pretty much anything in .40, so let me know what you have.  I have an assortment of 9mm ammo that I can trade towards .40 if you have any to swap.  Will trade for handguns ONLY though, no rifles or shotguns or random household items.  Have no problem trading for something of lesser value+cash as well.  NOT interested in Sigma's, though I would trade for an SD40VE.

If not interested in trading I will sell the package and ammo I have left for $300 FIRM.
I have 33 rounds of 9mm nato (+P equivalent), 31 rounds of Ram fmj reloads, and 37 rounds of hp's for the full asking price.

You can't even tell it's there with the compact 10 round magazine, and if you get it just right, you can conceal it with the extended magazine in as well. Here are the specs:

These magazines are based on the older Master Molder magazine design re-engineered and updated for improved fit and function across more platforms and newer systems while still maintaining 100% backwards compatibility. 

Freshly manufactured in 2013 out of top quality self-lubricating Dupont Zytel glass-nylon composite in the U.S.A., these tough and durable magazines are the lightest of similar capacity available for this platform, weighing 6.3 ounces empty.

Shipping for one of the above magazines is $4.00 via USPS First Class. For weights over 13 ounces the buyer pays actual Priority Mail cost.

This rifle has about 120 rounds through the barrel. I've taken it to the range twice to sight in the Aimpoint and again for the Troy battle sights. There is approximately $2000 in this rifle, but I am willing to accept an offer as low as $1500.
