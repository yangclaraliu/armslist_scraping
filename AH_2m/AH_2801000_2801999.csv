Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet."

Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail"

What we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a customized and tuned (and I don't throw that term around loosely. If you ask me, the words ""custom"" and ""tactical"" are thrown around way too loosely nowadays.) stainless Ruger New Vaquero in .45 Colt. 

SO, for the sake of explanation, let me tell ya why I picked customized to describe this beauty-

 1. All springs have been replaced with low-power Wolff springs, The trigger pull is now 1lb or less and the force required to rotate the cylinder is better than butter (I'm confident that you'll love it as much as I did, I'm willing to meet up with anyone with no prior commitment to buy just so you can test the action and trigger pull for yourself.) I know that main spring has been reduced to 30 lb, and if you're interested I can come up with the 'lb' reduction for the rest of the springs should you be interested ahead of time!

Also, every friction point on every part has been painstakingly honed on a super light Arkansas stone to a mirror finish without removing any metal.

2. The trigger has been aligned with trigger shims from TriggerShims.com, a website run by this great guy who sells different widths of trigger shim, reducing ALL play in the Vaquero trigger, as well as smoothing it out more. 

3. The oxblood grips (That I don't have on the vaquero in each of these pictures, as I was deciding what would work best for this particular piece) these are the grips that are on there right now, ordered brand new a few weeks ago:  http://www.ebay.com/itm/RUGER-OXBLOOD-GRIPS-NEW-VAQUERO-MONTADO-50TH-ANNIVERSARY-w-CHECKERING-/REDACTED92?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item3f2fd0c2f0

And, finally, I'm the original owner of this New Vaquero, and I've never fired round-one out of it. So, it's never been fired and new in box. Very high quality revolver with high quality work! A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into this one, and if you've enjoyed my projects in the past then please have a look here!

As I stated before, please please feel free to come handle her, no strings attached, I'll let her speak for herself! Personally, this revolver is my favorite piece in my collection right now. But I can't bring myself to shoot it, so might as well sell it!

Comes with original box, manual, test-cartridge from factory, etc.

NO TRADES PLEASE! TULSA AREA PLEASE! As always, thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Hope to hear from you guys, you'll love this one."

Full original field accessory kit, including 4 extra magazines (for a total of 5 magazines), cleaning kit, and canvas mag-carrier.  Original leather sling, PSL scope with canvas cover, Doskosport hard case, paper owners’ manual/pamphlet all included.  530 rounds of 7.62x54r assorted ammo is also included.  Ammo is Wolf, S&B, and surplus from a 440rd spam can.

At the time I bought it, it had only 100 rounds through it.  I’ve put another roughly 100 rounds through it.  Great shape inside and out, and I’ve cleaned it after every shoot.  I have a few more pictures of it, just ask and I’ll send them along.  I’m selling it to get down to fewer calibers I need to buy ammo for, just to be practical.  I've been asked about trades and unfortunately I'm not looking to trade.

I prefer face to face sale/transfer in Vermont, with a copy of valid drivers’ license or photo ID.  I’ll provide a bill of sale.

Price has been reduced."

Here is a very attractive specimen from Mossberg’s model 500 Military & Police series. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500, Persuader series; factory sku is 50411 or thereabouts. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with durable synthetic stock and traditional synthetic forend. Finish is blued steel with semi gloss black anodized receiver. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced combat trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered 18 1/2 inch matte blue steel plain bead sight, with .730 vicinity Cylinder Bore muzzle. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. If this shotgun didn’t have a heat shield, we have added a trench type black polymer heat shield for the barrel, that will be obvious from the photos. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean.This 500 Special Purpose comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers.. Replacement pricing on mossberg com was well over $400 on this shotgun."

I also added a regular slide stop but it will come with the extended one as well, I can install which ever one you want but it will come with both. Lastly the trigger guard was professionally undercut to allow a shooter to gain a higher purchase on the pistol.

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is proud to announce the return of what many shooters and collectors feel is the most handsome of all the Ruger single-action revolvers, the .44 Magnum ""flattop."" Originally introduced in 1956 when the powerful .44 Magnum cartridge was brand new, the Ruger .44 Magnum Blackhawk set new performance standards for the burgeoning sport of handgun hunting. With its massive chrome-molybdenum steel ""flattop"" frame and fluted cylinder, precision adjustable sights, and all coil-spring construction, it was a pure hunting handgun, combining power, precision, and elegance in a most pleasing form. 

Many other .44 Magnum revolvers followed the original ""old model""* Ruger Blackhawk. The Ruger Super Blackhawk (1959), New Model Super Blackhawk (1973), Redhawk® (1979), Super Redhawk (1987), Bisley (1989), Vaquero® (1993), and Hunter (1996) continued to revolutionize the world of handgun shooters. Yet, many longed for the compact simplicity of Sturm, Ruger's original .44 ""flattop,"" which was discontinued in 1962. 

Following the success of the Ruger .357 50th Anniversary New Model Blackhawk in 2005, Sturm, Ruger is proud to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of its original .44 Magnum Blackhawk. The Ruger 50th Anniversary .44 Magnum New Model Blackhawk features the trim ""flattop""-style cylinder frame with ""micro""-style click adjustable rear sight, a fluted cylinder, and smaller, ""XR-3""-style grip frame and checkered black panels with the original black Ruger grip medallions of the very first Ruger .44 Blackhawks. A 6 1/2"" blued steel barrel with a ramp front sight also gives this revolver the look of the original, while its patented Ruger New Model Blackhawk transfer bar and loading gate mechanisms give an unprecedented measure of security and convenience. The Ruger 50th Anniversary .44 Magnum New Model Blackhawk also has a gold color-filled barrel rollmark ""50 YEARS OF .44 MAGNUM - 1956 TO 2006"" to commemorate the introduction of the original .44 Magnum Blackhawk. New features include a patented reverse indexing pawl for easier loading and unloading and, to meet various state sales requirements, an unobtrusive internal lock under the right grip panel. 

The Ruger 50th Anniversary .44 Magnum New Model Blackhawk comes in a special red case with a unique handsome lens label. A California-approved external locking device, comprehensive instruction manual, and a special commemorative booklet detailing the history of the .44 Magnum Blackhawk complete the package. This special 50th Anniversary .44 Magnum New Model Ruger Blackhawk will only be produced in limited quantities until the end of 2006."

This is a colt series 70 mark iv goverment 1911 45 auto. Original bluing and barrel in excellent condition.   This is NOT a rock island so if you are one of the people expecting it at low price pass on by. I will be fair but if you're wanting 800 for a 500 dollar gun expect me to jump price up also.   
If you dont know what all goes into a custom build then you probably dont need this. 
If you dont realize what it cost to buy the parts from wilson combat and have installed you probably dont need this.
 If you cannot come to me you probably dont need this. 
If you cant keep your word you probably dont need this.
I am a gunsmith I dont need a lesson on what or how to do anything  to a firearm so if you are a know it all you probably dont need this. 
 If you dont like me being blunt then your probably the reason I am. 
So be fair be honest and be a man of your word.
 This has been gone through completely. It is a very smooth action straight shooting pistol.  I have already done all the little secrets that needed done to make this flawless shooter.
 Sorry if I sound hateful but many people on here need to hear it.  
 I do not play games but I will be easy to deal with if you are willing to be real and serious on offers. 
 I dont care how cheap you can supposedly buy one for on the internet if you can then do it ."

When all the people were showing up in the mornings to buy out the ammo we simply started telling them none came in and then we stock it a little bit at a time through out the day. You can tell which people are resellers and which ones want it for their own personal use. It's real easy to say no we are out to the vulchers and the nice people we say, let me check in the back and you can come out with 1 box and say yes there was 1 box left that hadn't got stocked yet. The annoying phone calls of people asking if ammo came in we simply tell them NO, sorry. 
    Now I know you vulchers and even the nice people will want to email and find out where our stores are. Don't waste your time because we won't give up the name of our stores. This posting of our information is just something you can copy and print and bring to the managers of all the ammo stores you go to and maybe they too will adopt our policy which will cut done on the daily ammo grabbers that resell it for 2 to 3 times the store values. There is no shortage on ammo other than the one that is being created by the price raisers. Refraim from paying the high prices and the gougers will have to come down on their prices or just quit and things will get back to normal where the average person can walk in and say I,d like a box of those 22's and there will be one for him to buy. If you keep letting them do as they do then it won't stop and we can call you all STUPID AS SHEEP for following the herd to slaughter. Have a nice day. Oh and on a second note that the manufactures will be forced to push op manufacturing to meet the demand will also let them know they too can raise prices due to supply and demand which will result in no one seeing the 4 cent 22 bullet ever again."

I would entertain the right trade plus cash. These things are hard to find, I have seen some good deals on them then I have seen where you cant find them at all and people want 2k for them. When people had them in stock they were around $1200.00 or so but those places are limited now.  There is nothing wrong with the gun what so ever.

This is the model without the external safety. In a shooting situation, the last thing you want to deal with is trying to remember if the safety is on, and fumbling to check it. If you're concerned about the lack of a physical safety, look at Glock. None of them have one either.
Please note that mine is the newest revision, with the low-profile slide lock/release.
All the older Gen 2's had a plastic shroud over the slide release lever. It was one more thing to hang up on clothing, so they eliminated it in favor of a flat metal release, which is sleeker and easier to draw from a holster or waistband.

Includes all original paperwork and box, 2 mags, interchangeable base plates, trigger lock and key.

All new never been opened.  50rd box Win Dynapoint 45gr HP, 50rd box CCI Maxi-Mag 30gr JHP, and a 20rd box of CCI 52gr #12 shot shotshells.  
I know how tough it is to find any 22 ammo much less 22mag ammo.  Simply make a reasonable offer on all of this.  I am not listing a set price because it's what you are willing to pay.  I do however have a minimum amout in mind as to what I paid for these when I had to shake the trees for ammo.  Just that I only have a NAA mini revolver, don't go through a lot of ammo with it, and took some more 22mag ammo in on trade a couple days ago.  So here's your chance to find some local without paying shipping via internet.....paying entry fee to a gunshow where you may or may not find and pay scalpers' prices.  I'm just making this available.  No trades, cash only.  Honest deal.  Lowball offers won't get a return response.  If you are still reading, you know the fair market value,  and what it's worth to you.  Plain and simple right?"

The lead pours out of the bottom spout of pot so it is clean going into mold. I use a Lee double cavity mold. I try to make them as perfect as possible. Since they are cast you can see the end where the lead is cut off at pour hole and sometimes you can see the seam from the 2 halves of molds, but this is normal. I look at each ball and give you the customer the best ones. The real bad ones I remelt. The ones with little imperfections I keep for myself to shoot out of my Ruger Old Army muzzle loading revolver. If you shoot one of those revolvers it resizes the ball when you push it into the cylinder. The Ruger Old Army takes .457 balls even though they call it 44 caliber. You can also use these balls in a slingshot or a ball mill when you make black powder. George Washington would be happy to have this quality of a musket ball for his soldiers. I sell them for $10 per 100. You can buy more than that. I believe I can put up to 500 in a small rate shipping box.

The P220 has factory night sights, still decently bright at night.  The barrel has some wear on the outside finish, but this is common with Sigs.
