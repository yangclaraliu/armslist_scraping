Will trade on shotgun 
I bought the gun a few years back from an old boss, and took it to the range once or twice. Since then, it has just been in indoor storage. The 380 was made by Mossberg in the early to mid 1980's, and is unique in the fact that it uses a 15-round tube fed magazine, inserted through the stock. As stated above, the caliber is .22LR. The gun overall is in good condition."

The Glock is clean with no marks on the exterior and shows normal wear on the inside.  I bought it for a carry piece, but decided on a single stack pistol instead.  

I bought this through West Coast Armory.  The pistol works flawlessly with defense rounds and range ammo.  It probably has around 500 rounds down the pipe.  Figured about 50 rounds put through it most trips to the range and about 10 trips total.

The night sights are about $100 plus install. 

I also have an unused Blackhawk Leather Pancake (3 slot) Holster.  Flawless!  Was $50.  

Would like to sell all together, but I'm not just throwing in to get rid of it.

$525 for Glock, Trijicon sights, 1 standard mag and 2 extended mags 
$555 gets you the holster plus the above listed items

No Trades wanted or needed.  I've already bought the single stack I wanted.  Selling to Concealed Carry Permit holder only.

You are welcome to send offers, but I will only reply if I accept it.  I'm not going back and forth.  I know you can find these at about $490 new...don't forget to add the cost of the sights, the installation of the sights, the mag extensions and the holster PLUS taxes if you are comparing apples to apples.  You are saving about $150 and giving up 500 rounds worth of wear. I will only consider lower offers if I don't have to travel to meet you...you must come to Gig Harbor.

Please send a phone number and I will call.  No shipping.  Face to face only.

Its a 16 inch barrel with A2 birdcage flash suppressor and is threaded 1/2-28 so you can add a different flash hider or a can on the end without having to go to a gunsmith to get the hider off.  Has an upgraded Blackhawk! ergo grip on it and comes with 2 30 round magazines.  I'll even throw in rounds so your mags are full so you can hit the range right away.  Its chambered in 5.56x54 so you can shoot 5.56 and .223, the barrel and upper have M4 feedramps cut in them.  Trigger group has been polished so its a crisp pull.  Would love to keep this gun as its clean, not a scratch on it nor have i fired it but girlfriend says i have too many black rifles.  Let me know what you have to offer in trade even if its just partial.  Thanks!"

I prefer PаyPаl since it's quick, but if you're local, cash is cool too. If you are unwilling to use PаyPаl, then I can take USPS MO, but since it takes significantly more time, preference goes to PаyPаl and local users.

I have bought and sold plenty of things on ebay, gunbroker, rs25.com, and ar15.com (username Vuddha on everything except ebay, it's vuddha_tran), so if you're interested, buy with confidence.

Here are pictures. While I bought it as new, the slide is not absolutely perfect, as seen in the first and second pictures.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR

This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"
