Also if you don't want the Fortis handguard I'll sell without for $1,000* I'm selling my DPMS Oracle AR15 that I have put a LOT into. It's been an amazing rifle that has worked flawlessly. I love the way it's setup and I love the Fortis Rev 12"" Free Floating Rail. Not one FTF of any kind, it's ran everything perfectly. I shoot 90% of the time at 50 yards(150ft) and the other 10% from 7 yards to 25 yards. It drives center every single time. All the work was done professionally at Hawk Tech Arms, everything on it was put on buy them. Basically I want to dig deaper into the AR world, try other brands, and setup another AR the way I want. I'm in the Army and M4's have always been my thing, that being said I would have no problem putting my life on this DPMS. It has honestly ran like a dream. I just want to get out of if what I've put in so I can move one and start another build, it's my new hobby :) The EoTech 517 does NOT come with the AR, that is my baby and will go on every build i run. The Pmag doesn't go either. I would trade for the right items. If you have an ACR that maybe you're just not a fan of I will trade straight across for it, I love that platform and would love more time behind it. If an AR15 that maybe you don't have time to configure your way, I would consider depending on the brand, specs, condition, and depending on price point cash to come with it. You never know give me a line. Lot of people bash DPMS but most have never owned one, a lot of Law Enforcement Agencies use DPMS including SWAT teams. I'm pretty confident this AR15 will out live me. I would keep it but I can't afford to have multiple projects. Again I will trade for an ACR, I'll even throw $200 cash on top of the trade or OBO depending on model. I have seen a lot of people dislike the ACR and want to go back to an AR, I've even seen it right here on Armslist. If maybe you want to go back to an AR platform this is an amazing AR that's setup well, good condition, and accurate. There are people out there that put there lives on DPMS every day and so would I. I just want to play with an ACR or start a new project.

It's only had maybe 600 rounds through it and it's been cleaned and oiled often and after every use. Everything listed is what I've done too it. It had a stupid gas block on it that didn't even align to the receiver and a commercial buffer tube which makes it harder to find good stocks for it. It's all been changed. Also it comes with the original box, paperwork, and magazine. The new Magpul AFG1 and Stock boxes will be included. I have shot both 5.56 and .223 different grains and loads of each, all factory ammo. it runs everything flawlessly. I personally loved the PMC 5.56 62gr X-tac LAP.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place.

  This shotgun  is very interesting b/c instead of using a greener cross bolt, there is a bolt that slides forward between the barrels from the breach face.  This is a very similar system that was used by the Snipe and the later 686/687 models. 

It is designed for field use.  It has extractors, not ejectors. A classic vintage field Beretta side-by-side,  due to it not being offered in the US and something of collectors item I am asking $2k for it.  Barrels have Ausonia Electric Steel inscribed on them & made in Italy."

I have a Talo edition Ruger MKIII. Has a 5.5"" barrel that is threaded 1/2""x28. Trigger is very light but not unsafe. This pistol model is very hard to find these days and I believe only 1500 were made in this configuration. Has high sights made specifically to see over a can. I have already modified the pistol to let the mags drop free when you hit the mag release. I have not done a bench rest accuracy test but I can tell you that hiting a milk jug at 100 yards, with bulk ammo, standing up, is no problem with this pistol.
The pistol is in excellent condition. It has 1 or 2 light tiny scratches on it, and its collecting dust from sitting.

Comes with 2 10 round factory mags, barrel thread nut, and a flash hider.
I'm pretty stiff on the price on this pistol so don't call if you don't have the cash.

 http://www.barnesbullets.com/products/components/rifle/tsx-bullet/

Loaded with Triple-Shocks, these revolutionary bullets from Barnes are made of 100% copper and contain no lead. When the bullet expands, four razor-sharp cutting petals are created, allowing the bullet to penetrate farther through tough bone and tissue. Triple-Shock bullets usually retain 100% of their original weight, making them a superb choice for hunting. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases. 

This ammunition is loaded with Lake City brass that has undergone factory annealing which extends brass life. As a result of the annealing process the neck portion of the brass may be discolored until the case is cleaned. 

Please Note: While the 5.56x45mm NATO will fit in a .223 Remington chamber, the 5.56 is a military round that runs at higher pressures than its .223 counterpart and is not recommended to be fired in a .223 Remington chamber."

New RIA 1911. 9MM and .22TCM barrels and springs. Incase you don't know, .22TCM is a hot new round recently developed. Clocking speeds between 2000, and 2500fps, making this round capable of penetrating most body armor. It easily rivals the much much more expensive FN 5.7. It has a remarkably flat trajectory and sports accuracy that's borderline unbelievable. This pistol shoots the same group at 10ft that it does at 50yds! That's the truth."

They are all in very good condition, no torn out pages or dog ears other than normal handling from stacking.  All are 2012-2013 except for one I saw was 2011 so it's all still very relevant.

There several different magazines in this group such as Tactical Operator, Guns & Ammo, American Handgunner, GUNS, Shooting Times,  Special Weapons for Police & Military,  Combat Handguns, Gun World....The picture is a sampling out of all the titles because taking a pic of this many magazines would be too big to show any detail.

There are also several ""Special Editions"" included that have plenty of great info.  There's a whole lot of great reading here for anyone who's into firearms!  

Retail price without tax was over $300, so with tax probably $340 or so.  I'm asking $100 which is way, way lower than retail so the price is firm.  This really is a fantastic offer so don't miss out!  If you love reading about new guns, equipment or anything related this amount of material would cost a large chunk of change so why not save a fortune and score a great deal?  

I know most of you guys love gun magazines and you love to read during your morning constitutional so why get stuck flipping through your wives copies of Home & Garden when you can be reading up to date, current copies of Guns & Ammo or American Handgunner or Special Weapons and Tactics or Gun World or Shooting Times??  Or set them out in your man cave to make your buddies jealous!! The possibilities are endless!!"

Well, I have a very lightly used Kahr CW9. This handgun has 75 rounds through it, and has been carried very little. It has spent its 5 month life sitting in this holster with minimal draw time. The holster is a Minotaur MTAC Holster that is has worked for me flawlessly. I have the box, packaging, and everything that came with both of these items. I have decided that this gun was just a little to small and vastly different from what I am used to shooting, therefore, it has to go.

It will also accept AR15 triggers an such. The upper uses a gas system that's basically a combination of the AK and FAL (AK style piston with gas adjustment like the FAL). The bolt is like an AR bolt but the ejector is a piece fixed in the lower. The sights work well and are adjustable for windage and elevation.

For those shooters who expect the best, GGG is the ammunition of choice.

“The Lithuanian NATO (GGG) is not just good but great brass. I would swear it was made by Lapua or Lapua at least set up their plant. Necks annealed, very uniform in weight, slightly smaller internal capacity than Lake City, and capable of extraordinary accuracy once you take the crimp out of the primer pocket. In fact, the NATO load itself is the most accurate military ball I have seen” -  Sniper Hide Forum

“I've used the Lithuanian ammo and found it to be the highest quality of any M80 type ammo I've used. Accuracy was superior to WCC and LC M80 ammo that I've used. The brass is good quality also” - Sniper Hide Forum

“It's awesome ammo!! - I've got several cases & wish i had more... it's accurate, clean shooting & boxer primed” - M14forum.com

“The GGG brass is fantastic! Its loads great and is a high quality grade of brass too, nice primer pockets to[…] the brass alone is worth it” -M14forum.com

“[GGG] seems to be abnormally accurate, and the brass abnormally good for reloading” - M4carbine.net

“The GGG stuff is something I keep hearing about” - AR15.com

Unlike most other ‘NATO’ ammunition on the market GGG GP21 and GP11 is new production; not old surplus, product overrun or ‘NATO like’ imitations. GGG GP21 and GP11 are 100% authentic military ammunition exceeding all STANAG and MOPI requirements. ADINT and GGG manufacture and qualify GGG GP21 and GP11 ammunition to the same rigorous standards whether the end user is the US commercial market or a front line military combat unit. GGG and ADINT spare no expenses in the manufacturing process using only the highest grade of brass with deep annealing that is excellent for reloading. The military grade boxer primers are non-corrosive, non-mercuric and exceed all sensitivity requirements for combat use. A high quality double base smokeless propellant is used. The full metal jackets are made from tombac. The case mouth and case primer joint have a waterproof sealing. The M2A1 cases are sealed with a full rubber gasket. There is also a wire and pressed stamp lock around the hinge which must be cut to open. As a result of both the quality manufacturing and the packaging, when stored in this fashion, GGG NATO ammunition has a minimum shelf life of no less than 20 years. GGG NATO qualified ammunition far exceeds the benchmark and typical performance of other NATO ammunition.

GGG’s use of the highest quality materials and attention to detail are differences shooters notice downrange. Old surplus or ‘knock-off’ military ammunition that never pass NATO qualification testing is simply not a valid comparison for GGG ammunition. GGG GP21 and GP11 is redefining the way shooters are thinking about military ball ammunition."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance.

14.7"" DEA

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The special DEA configuration M6A2 has all of the standard features of the M6A2 plus some added features found only with this rifle. The standard features found in our rifles include our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas-piston system, NiCorr™ treated hammer-forged barrels, nickel-boron coated bolt group, our Advanced Combat Bolt (ACB), and Enhanced Fire Control Group. In addition, the DEA configuration will feature a YHM Phantom flash hider as well as an engraving of the US Flag on the magazine well.

I am asking $950 without the pearl rack (just the stands), and $1400 for EVERYTHING (rack and extra stands). I am FIRM on both prices. I don't need to sell and if I can't get my money out of this set I will just keep it. I purchased this set to get back into drumming. I have not drummed since I have had my two boys. Now I realize that I don't have enough time to enjoy them. 

 I didn't hunt for the best new prices, I just priced on Ebay and Guitar Center what this would all cost to build at new prices, and with the Paiste Cymbals, the Pearl Rack, the Orion Obiter kit, and the added hardware this would cost approximately $3,935 to build at new prices. Maybe with hunting you could find some lower new prices, I just looked stuff up quick to get an idea of what this would cost new. I am not trying to make a dime on these, I got a GREAT DEAL and I just want to see if I can get my money back out of them. 

 I am told that the Orion Orbiter was their upper line for the two years that they made it. It was replaced with the Pro M line. I am not that familiar with Mapex drum lines. I was told that it was about $1000 when purchased new in 2006 or 2007. The drum shells are in really good shape. The only cosmetic blemishes that I have found were on the floor tom. Just a few minor dings. All the other shells are in really good condition. It has not been moved around much, The first owner did not take it to more than 3 or 4 gigs. Here is some information that I found online for the drum kit.
