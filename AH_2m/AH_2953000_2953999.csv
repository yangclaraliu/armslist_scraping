Proceeds from the event, which kicks off the 2014 NRA Annual Meetings and Exhibits, will go to ensuring the future of America's shooting sports traditions.

After becoming the first commercial manufacturer to ship one million firearms over a twelve month period in 2011, there were doubts that Ruger could reach the milestone a second time. But the one millionth gun of 2012, a SR1911, came off the assembly line on August 15, and Ruger CEO and President Mike Fifer had special plans for the occasion. The pistol was handed to Baron Engraving to give this collector's item a truly unique design."

The 5.56 Midlength Evo Ultra Lite 16"" Upper is a .625"" lite profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston systemparts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.With the combination of the .625"" ultra lite pencil barrel, the Samson Evolution rail, amd the new ultra lite .625"" gas block, we not have the lightest dedicated piston upper on the market. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

It was designed from the outset to be chambered for higher-powered cartridges such as the .38 Special, considered to be a powerful caliber for a concealable pocket revolver of the day.

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. Available with a tactical designed mil. spec. lower handguard with flash light.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

Taken to 400 yards. Best at 300 yards an closer and destroys anything in that range 

I am the second owner and I've ran 110 rds through it with, had a nikon prostaff 3x9 and that worked really well. First owner put 50 rounds though it. Rifle is in great overall shape. Only been used at ranges. I was going to use this as my new big game hunting rifle. 

Only reason I am selling is I recently got in an accident which left me with no use of my left arm. Pretty firm on price. Not breaking up the upper and lower. Not shipping

This particular Rifle appears to be one of the guns that was lent to Denmark after WWII due to the fact of the ""Rack Number"" on the bottom of the buttstock. Since Denmark was occupied during the war, it is not a ""Lend Lease"" gun and therefore has NO IMPORT MARKS> It has a ME reading of 3 and a TE reading of 3 also which puts it well within the parameters of being a great shooter. The gun has been through an arsenal rebuild and it was re-barreled in early 1952 as the photos show. The wood shows marks from military use, but has no major issues such as chips, splits or cracks. This Rifle is a great collectable ""War Horse"" that certainly saw action in WWII and would fit great into a Military collection. It's a great nostalgic shooter and a real piece of American History"

Second owner, so can't provide round count but from the fit and finish of wear surfaces I'd expect it to be around 1,000 or so.
Cosmetically, 100% minus two diamonds on LH grip checkering (can see in photo, a bit of linseed oil or equivalent will make it virtually invisible).
Functionally, 100% reliable, internals in great shape exhibiting little wear.
Comes with 5 mags and original plastic box.

Prefer Texas sales, as I don't know of a local FFL dealer I trust enough to ship.
No trades unless you have a Jericho 941 (Baby Eagle, Uzi Eagle, etc.) in .45ACP or .40S&W.
Will travel up to 100 miles to make a deal.
Thanks for the interest!"
