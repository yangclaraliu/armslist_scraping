A-008 Box Magazine Feed Elbow
B-001R Box Magazine Magazine Switch Housing - Right
B-001L Box Magazine Switch Housing - Left
You can get these parts from a warehouse store on Google or Rap4.

The noteworthy Cons: 
Pictured, there are light dirt smudges on the magazine well where I held it, which I'll clean. If you have a HPA tank and want to fire it, I have no problem with that either. Also, there are home made thermoplastic brackets on the box mag where it stress cracked and had broken off small portions of the plastic by the base of the black box on top of the box mag. I've taken a clear picture of it so you understand why I listed the parts that I recommend should be replaced. Although it works, internally in the box mag, there is sound deadening lining and I JB welded the exterior of the stress cracked Magazine Feed Elbow (A-008) part so it wouldn't break apart. 

I'm selling this personal marker (last one to go) since I barely paintball anymore. I've put hundreds of dollars into it but it's used and shows signs of wear in the hydrographics (example: mainly on the right side where the QD swivel connects into the stock adapter.)

I already had one and I liked it so much I bought another and set it up identically.  Now that my daughters are off to college and work It seldom gets used. I took it to the range a couple weeks ago and it's still holding the 50 yard zero I put on it last summer. I can't shoot two rifles at once, so this0 one is for sale.

Marlin XT-22 chambered in 22LR. Features a 22 inch micro grooved barrel with a 1:16 twist. Ultra smooth bolt action, 7 round factory clip magazine, beautiful Monte Carlo walnut stock, and a user adjustable trigger. The trigger is nothing short of awesome. It is super smooth with little take up and a crisp clean break with no creep or grit.
Not a scratch or blemish on it anywhere.

Included is a Simmons 8 point scope (3X9X40), Weaver tip off rings, Allen soft case and all the original boxing and owners manuals for the scope as well as the rifle. I will also include a Marlin nickel plated 10 round clip magazine and a 550 round box of Federal 22LR. Everything you need to go to the range and have loads of target and plinking fun.

I have never run Match grade ammo through it. Using just bulk 22LR this rifle is amazingly accurate. I can imagine what it would do with Match ammo.

The listing manufacturer says Walther because there was no listing option for Radom and it is similar to the Walther PPK.  This is a perfect sized carry pistol that is easy to pack in winter and summer.  The P-64 is a double-action blowback-operated pistol. It has a spring extractor mounted within the slide. The rotating slide catch, installed inside the pistol's frame, contains a protrusion which acts as an empty case ejector. The pistol's trigger mechanism includes a disconnector (which ensures semi-automatic-only fire); a double-action trigger (which allows the pistol to be both cocked and fired with one pull of the trigger); and an exposed hammer. The slide features a loaded chamber indicator (which, both visually and by feel, indicates the presence of a round in the chamber) and a manual safety lever that prevents the weapon from being accidentally discharged with the hammer either cocked or released. This feature also allows a round to be chambered with the safety engaged or toggled off. In the ""safe"" position, the firing pin is locked and the trigger bar is disconnected from the hammer notch. If the hammer is cocked and the safety is engaged, the safety will release the hammer. In the 1970s the trigger mechanism was slightly modified and the hammer spur was enlarged.

The P-64 is fed from a 6-round single-stack box magazine. After the last round has been fired, the magazine follower lifts the slide catch, which locks the slide open. The slide can then be released by withdrawing the magazine a short distance and pulling the slide back. The pistol is equipped with a fixed front sight, and a dovetailed rear sight with a square notch. The sights are calibrated for firing at 50 m.[1] The all-steel P-64 is manufactured mainly by machine cutting.

Despite its similarity to the Walther PP, the P-64 is an original design, holding a Polish patent, number 54822.[1] The patent applies to the unique disconnector (an elongated plate sliding vertically inside the pistol's frame) which provides an internal safety, decocks the hammer when the safety is engaged, interrupts the weapon's cycle after every shot fired, and allows the weapon to be reloaded with the safety on.

This is a private transfer and will be conducted legally.  Pick up with Tennessee driver's license or I will ship to your authorized FFL for an additional $20.00."

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL--A 46100 steel plate is military spec armor steel. Typically MIL-A 46100 armor plate steel is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel plate is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. (Ar500 is target Material only) I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 hangdun...still no penetration. As displayed and shown in the photographs you will see the test shot target and the ones never before shot at. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches and etc.

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

I'm interested in trading for a pistol that isn't hard on the hands and wrist. I'm a little tired of pieces that are no pleasure to shoot, so I'm open to all calibers on this from .22 to .45, as long as the recoil isn't overpowering for the size package it's in.  In other words a range gun, I don't need defense.
A simple trade in a similar price range would be great but values vary so whatever it takes to barter a fair deal.  Let me know what you have and we'll go from there.  If you're interested in buying or have a piece to trade, please indicate that in your email.  Communication is a two way street.  In other words, don't ask for information if you're not leaving any, it's common courtesy.  Thanks.

 U.S. Army Standard-Issue Backup Sight For M4/M16A4

 MATECH BUIS Leaf Sight is current issue to US Military. This Windage and elevation adjustable flip-up rear iron sight is battle tested with a low-profile design. Folds down out of the way when not in use. Will fit under a Trijicon ACOG riflescope.

 Elevation adjustable to 600 meters.
 Windage: 1/2 MOA 
 Elevation: 0-600m
 NSN 1005-01-484-8000 , PN# 12996812

 Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any .223 5.56 rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights.

The only reason I'm selling is because my dad has passed his down to me and I don't need two. I have nearly 1000 invested in this rifle. It is not your average marlin 336 from Walmart."

I love this pistol because it's fully ambidextrous and you have the option to carry it cocked & locked like a 1911.

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP™-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

Got this rifle mainly to SBR, however work in the otilfield keeps me away from home a lot, so I can just never get around to it.  

Arsenal did announce that that their SLR-106 rifles are discontinued, so if you want one that is mint, now is the time before they are gone!! Price will obviously go up on the SLR-106 line of rifles, and the price for Circle10 mags with it!!  Anyway, text for more pictures!!

Like new, fired very few times cleaned immediately. East German Makarov from 1961 that is collectible and one of the best units made. 

Includes a NEW shoulder holster for concealed carry and 50 rounds of ammo

Includes 2 sets of grips (Originals and larger Grips)

Must have a CCW or permit to buy

Mine is 1960 T

The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows. If you can get them for a good price, these are the ones to buy.
Markings on them include a letter 'y' with a circle of dots, which some Russian folks think stands for for uchebneii or ""training"". This would be strange for a German pistol, but we haven't heard any other explanations. 
Note that this table is not complete and there appears to be a sequential pattern, so don't panic if yours doesn't fit into the ones listed.

Probably 300 rounds through it.  Not even broken in yet.  There is a small rub mark under the trigger guard and some wear on the moving parts (hammer, grip safety).  I put Meprolight night sites on it and Kimber wooden grips.   I have 2 extra Kimber 7 round mags.   I've also got a Crossbread ""Super Tuck"" IWB hoster, 230 rounds of FMJ and about 25 rounds of self defense ammo to go.  

I'd like to package everything together, but would entertain offers on the different items.  I'm in about $1,200 on the gun alone.  Another $100 in ammo and $85 on the holster.
I'd like to get $950 for the whole package.  If you want to purchase the gun alone with 2 magazines I'd like $850.  I'm not very interested in trades or low ball offers.  I priced about as low as I can go without really taking a hit.  My loss is your gain.  The ONLY thing I'd be interested in trading for is a Sig P229.  Feel free to call or text anytime.
