It's not the Rosewood grip that comes with the catalog CDP II...that grip has a single button on the frontstrap you depress with your middle finger.  This is a polymer grip with thumb buttons on both sides.   The previous owner had Kimber remove the ambi saftey lever and put in a right handed only.  I don't have the original case, but I'll include the Plano hardcase in the pic.  Comes with the stock Kimber Mag.

It includes one 10 round magazine and two 14 round mags. If sold in Connecticut I will not include the magazines. Please contact me if you want to talk about it.  Thanks for looking

My name is Mike. I am a Veteran of the U.S. Army having served both as a 19K - M1 Tanker, and an 11B - Infantryman.  I have over 11 years experience in Law Enforcement and am a Law Enforcement Instructor in Use of Force/ Defensive Tactics, ASP, Taser, and Pepperball Launcher.   

I am not in this to get rich. The small income I get from these classes is small compared to what I could make simply working overtime.   My prices are low and I am willing to even hold one-person classes if we can't find a good class day for you otherwise.  The reason is simple - Your right to protect yourself and your loved ones is something I believe strongly in. You also have the right to quality training. 

The right TRAINING, the ABILITY, and the MEANS to protect yourself and your loved ones is not just a right, it's an obligation!"

Here is a link to this exact rifle at Gander Mountain, where I purchased it (note the great reviews)

 - 1 additional 7 round magazine (2 total magazines) ($20)
 - Simmons 3-9x32 scope, with scope rings, mounted and sited in for 100 yards. Includes lens covers for the scope as well ($65 for scope and rings)
 - BlackHawk fully adjustable pivoting/titling bipod ($50)

I shot 1 box of 50 and 13 from this box to make the 63 total rounds fired from this rifle. (on average I paid $13.75+ tax per box of 50 rounds - $330 total in ammo)

Price for the entire package is $625 firm. This is a very reasonable and is priced to sell. There is over $700 in gun, accessories, and ammo here that has hardly been used at all. For sale/trade as a package only, will not separate.

A true classic

In the year 1929 Pelikan was the first company in the world to introduce the differentiated piston mechanism. This technique causes the spindle inside the fountain pen to turn quicker than the end piece of the barrel, with the help of two different threads. To this date, this fountain pen exists in many different variations, and though it has been developed in design and technical details over time, the basic mechanism remains the same.

In 1950, the model 400 was launched. With its green-striped sleeve, it has become a world-wide symbol for the brand of Pelikan. In the eighties, the series was baptized Souverän, though popular lore has taken to calling it by its nickname Stresemann, because the state secretary of the “Weimarer Republik” was famous for his striped suits... . With the models in ""Black-Green"" and ""Black-Blue"" already enjoying great popularity, the color variation ""Black-Red"" was added in 2001. The striped pattern of its sleeve presents itself in strong contrasted colors.

The production of the sleeve is work-intensive. Adhering to a special Pelikan recipe, the raw material cotton is processed through many different steps until it is shaped into a striped sheet. It is then formed into the right shape, cut and sanded with a diamond. Next, the characteristic double clips at the back of the barrel and on the cap are integrated into the material. This is done with the highest precision in order to obtain a virtually seamless transition between the materials. The writing instrument is then polished to a high sheen before the slightly springy clip with its famous, stylized Pelikan is mounted.

If you love classics, you own a Souverän writing instrument.

So, you see a Tromix Saiga-12 for sale and the buyer is asking a premium price. How do you know if it's a real Tromix gun, or simply a fake, cobbled up on someone's kitchen table? Here's a few tips to help you identify a fake from the real thing.

How to identify a real Tromix Saiga-12.

1. Your gun must have a Tromix HK style trigger guard Tig welded in place.

2. The pistol grip does not use a square hole cut in the receiver to hang it in the conventional AK style. There is a threaded rod welded to the receiver to hang the grip. There were a handful of guns, maybe 5 or so, with the square hole, but then the square nut would have been welded in place (externally) in order to make grip installation easier.

3. No Tromix guns were ever produced with an external safety stop like the factory unit. Very early guns, just had a dimple detent. Later guns had a welded in nipple on the side of the receiver to stop the safety selector.

4. All guns have a welded in back plate which has threaded inserts to bolt stock in place. No guns were made using the ACE adapter block to affix the stock. 

5. If the gun is equipped with HK sights, you can remove the rear sight and look at the welds inside. The rear mount is affixed via Tig welding front and back on the inside. If it looks like a Mig weld or the welds are in a different location, it is not a Tromix installed sight base and most likely not a Tromix gun.

6. All Tromix guns had the four extra original trigger axis pin holes welded up and blended out, as well as the rivet holes for the original trigger guard/plate. No guns were ever shipped with plastic plugs or screws in those holes.

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
operation and function."

Gun is extremely accurate and has a smooth trigger pull in double action and a crisp break in single action. I bought this gun solely for range shooting, but decided to go with the full size B model after trying out a friend's. 

The gun has only been to the range two times, each time less than 100 rounds were fired through it. It will include the factory case and all paperwork (warranty registration has not been sent in, so you could still register it with CZ to make use of the factory warranty) and will come with 5 14-round magazines. 

I paid almost $600 for the gun and two mags and almost another $85 for the three additional mags. 

Will sell with just the factory 2 mags for $520 (this is the absolute lowest price I will take, please refrain from making lower offers). 

Asking $570 for the gun and all 5 mags. Willing to trade with a trade value set at $600.

Please, no inquiries about purchasing just the magazines. They are not for sale until the gun sells without them. If you email me asking to let you know I will be sure to not sell them to you if they do become available."

This setup is extremely nice.  I've only put about 500 rounds through this rifle and it shoots very tight groups.  The included components are nearly everything you'd need to reload thousands of rounds of ammunition (except powder and reloading tools).  Much of the surplus brass has been capped and tumbled and if my asking price is met I would be willing to tumble and cap the rest.  I don't really want to separate any of this but cash talks so if you're interested in any of the accessories separate from the rifle make a reasonable offer.  I don't absolutely need to sell and won't be ripped off.
If buyer is willing to come close to my asking price I will also include a few other accessories / extras like an outers varminter rifle rest, hard case, and some splatter and zombie targets.

Please email me if you want to see more pictures of the rifle or any of the accessories and extras ...there really is a lot of stuff here. 
I also just found a 20 round box of soft point quality winchester ammunition so this rifle could even be used for hunting this year.

I will only sell to a Wisconsin resident with DL but I prefer that you have your CCW.

this is a 1000yrd range finder that has setting for both archery and modern rifle
it has calculated bullet/arrow drop for the yardage and type of weapon you are using, so it is not a bad little range finder.
I have always been pretty dam good at guessing yardage, my wife got this for me because I'm also a hunting guide and so I could be dead on for the hunters, what I found out is I'm truly dam good at estimating the ranges, now the bullet drop indicator for someone who has not a good understanding in it is a great added feature. I was also a sniper in the service so I'm real good at that also lol... so me with a range finder is not something I need, I know my wife paid way more  for it then she should have, since we live in a small town, she bought it at the local sporting goods store for $359.99
now it sells as high as $429.99 but if you search hard you can find it as low as $199.99

This is a belt holster color stealth black. Purchased in 2001 never used, still in original packaging. Concealex is much easier to mold then the new Kydex. Blade-Tech's latest innovation is Concealex, a camouflaged form of Kydex that incorporates the camo pattern right into the plastic itself. This remarkable material is resistant to most chemicals, oils and solvents, and is absolutely waterproof. It has a permanent memory with excellent retention qualities, facilitating extremely smooth operation. The unique camouflage patterns are integrated into the Concealex and have a matte finish for tactical field applications. They blend very well with their respective BDU patterns or solids. One of our favorite Blade-Tech designs is the straight-drop holster for a 1911. This holster is approved for competition, but it is secure enough for daily carry. The front is cut down to the middle of the pistol's ejection port, a ""speed cut"" as Blade-Tech describes the design, but it is a far cry from the radically low-cut ""competition rigs"" used in IPSC."

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. 

Operation:
A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe' to 'Fire'.

It is dead on at 25 yards, I mean a small fist sized hole every time. I really love this firearm too. Only shot enough to confirm the iron sight and EOtech 553 were zeroed and kept zero since I wanted to SBR it. To be honest, I never thought I'd list it.

It was professionally converted and uses an HDPS stock block. It has five vents, all 4 HDPS rails (the only section of the rifle that indicates it has been used), a front forend sling attachment, a backup recoil spring and polyurethane buffer, a barrel roll pin, and 6 Factory HK 25 round magazines. 

It does not have the ejection port flare or the UMP engravings and it is on a 3 position lower. 

Price for all of the above to be $3,250 shipped to your FFL or face to face, not including the Eotech or Magpul foregrip.  I am a member of several forums with the name Whitebrad25 and one includes AR15.com where I have 81 transactions all with positive feedback (most of those are firearms as well).  Email me with ANY questions you might have.


Payment(s) needs to be discrete money order/cashiers check or discrete Paypal, you pay the fees or cash for face to face.

I can take detailed pictures of ANYTHING upon request, deal with confidence and trust my feedback. I can also remove magazines at -$50 per magazine.


I was going to have it Form 1'd and short barrel rifled.  The engraving is in a discrete location and could likely never be found.  I can fill over it as well or even file it down if preferred. A picture of it and where is below."

Please note this is a left-handed bolt action, but I am a right-handed shooter. I found the left-handed bolt to offer a quicker follow-up shot on varmints. This would be an excellent rifle for a left or right-handed shooter! The stock does have a one blemish on the front (pictured below) but is overall in very good condition. It shines beautifully in the daylight. The bolt is incredibly smooth and the accutrigger makes this rifle a joy to shoot on the bench or in the field. I have used this rifle to hunt prairie dogs and have scored successful hits with minimal error up to 400 yards - I'm sure an experienced, seasoned shooter could squeeze even more performance out of this platform.

I have all the original parts, thumb hole stock, wood hand grips, iron sights, handrail cover, sling holder, and all numbers are matching this is not a mutt ak. Hard to find gun this one is all original with original mags and tons of modifications and extras.

I did some research on this gun finding it to be odd its a .556 AK. China made 10,000 to 20,000 during the cold war specially made for Russia. My guess is they planned to use them behind enemy lines so they could use our ammo in their guns. I know mine made its way to Germany due to the vintage sturm mags. Due to its age nothing has been changed but the US cutting the sear during import.

What i have bought put on and modified to this, here is the list nothing done was permanent. 
-Tapco folding stock
-SAW pistol grip with storage compartment
- top rail cover, not the cheap pop on one. This one sets in to the sights and screws in to the stock, it is very secure and has two extra adjustable side rails.
-BSA red dot scope with lazer which is very accurate.
-aircraft aluminum metal quad rail hand guard.
-180 degree folding pistol grip mounted on the bottom of the quad rail. So you can fold the stock and use the lazer from the hip.
-3 black metal unmarked 30rd clips (2 on a magazine coupling)
-4 wood (i think bamboo) Made in Germany 30rd Sturm mags
-1 plastic promag 30rd brand new never used
-1 10rd black metal unmarked mag
-3 ak mag couplers
Mags are real hard to find for this gun.

Extras i have are:
-3 extra scope/ lazer battery's, stored in saw grip compartment
-extra hammer
-flash suppressor (but i never had the barrel threaded)
-300 rounds of ammo mainly ballistic and hollow point (what i kept in the clips)

It will not be ready to sell or trade until this Sunday. Saturday i am picking up a 30 rd pro mag i have already paid for at the gun show. Sunday i am going to my storage and i have 2 to 8 30 to 40rd mags. After i get these i will be ready to sell.

This rifle would be a good youth gun as well due to the short barrel and stock. The barrel was cut to 16.5 inches and threaded for my suppressor.

865,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2230865,For Sale/Trade:  1974 Yamaha DT250MX Vintage Motocross Racer,"Redmond, Bend, Oregon","$ 1,500","Listed On: Thursday, October 17, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my AHRMA legal Yamaha. I built this bike for racing, but by the time I finished it, I had other projects and so it was never raced. However, I did ride it a few times and it is very fast.

The entire bike was rebuilt, new piston, rings, transmission (includes an extra transmission too), cables, levers, seat. After it was mechanically sound, I stripped it down to the frame. I removed all of the wiring to make it a dirt only machine. I removed the oiling system, and blocked off the pump to make it a pre-mix only bike. I replaced the enduro head with an MX250 head for higher compression, and dual spark plugs. The original 28mm carb was replaced by a 32mm flatside carb which improved performance A LOT. All of the suspension is from an MX250, and it has a rare fork brace. The head was redone, and it has boost ports for increased power. Even with all of that, there are some other performance mods that would make this even faster (although it would be competitive as is).

This is a really neat bike, with all of the performance of a motocross bike. The AHRMA rule book does allow this bike to run in the pre-75 classes because it is of ""similar construction"" to the pre-75 bikes (twin shocks). Race it, ride it on trails, etc. I will include lots of original parts, an MX250 tank, and some other new parts like sprockets, exhaust, etc.

I am looking to sell it, but I would be happy to consider trades or partial trades. Especially for a modern enduro dual sport, KLR 650, etc. I am also interested in older BMWs, airheads, 2 stroke street bikes, or GUNS. If you have an AR-15, and want to go fast instead of waste your money at the range, please contact me!..... email me or text 5FOUR1-NINE77-FIVE347"
