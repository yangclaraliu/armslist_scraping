It is awesome for ccw if you want to carry a real mans gun and it has fixed combat gunslinger sights and a rubber houge combat grip. Truely a one of a kind because it has had alot of custom work done to it to achieve the look that it has! I am open to all kinds of trades so let me know what you have the worst I can say is no thank you. I would really like a (smith & wesson m&p shield 40) ( ak-47 pistol) (ak-47) (nice 1911) (12 guage shotgun) or anything else cool. The value of this pistol before all the custom work was done to it is between $800 to $1000 but I am willing to make the trade well in your favor or strait up for something worth alot less than my pistol if its something that I want so if anybody has any of the things on my wishlist then here is your chance to make some good money off of a trade with me. Please text or call me @ REDACTED. Dont miss out on this pistol if you like the looks of it because you will not see another one like it once its gone!"

This is a 10+ pound varmint gun. With the .204 caliber (Google it) the recoil is laughable. You can watch the bullet impacts through a high power scope. Perfect for predator or varmint hunting. Stupid accurate rifle and the trigger is a HUGE improvement over standard military triggers.

Stoeger's Vursan shotguns are manufactured by the BERETTA Group. 

The Vursan Model 2000 is the only shotgun licenced to use the Benelli inertia-recoil operating system - the heart of the world's most prestigious and expensive Semi Autos. 

Unlike common gas-operated guns whose fore-ends conceal operating rods, pistons, O-rings, valves and other moving parts, the inertia system is entirely contained inside the receiver. The results? A trimmer fore-end, better balance, more reliable operation and the ability to fire everything from light target ammunition to the heaviest waterfowl loads without adjustments. And because propellant gas isn't used to cycle the action, inertia guns like the Model 2000 stay cleaner, even after hundreds of shots. Even in the toughest conditions, your new Model 2000 will keep on firing! 

The Vursan is also capable of taking up to 5 rounds standard without a magazine extension.

I've recently stepped up to a Kimber and so this gun is now available to someone new. This is a quality little pistol that will serve you well for years to come. It disassembles exactly like a Glock...in fact, this is almost like the micro that Glock never made.

Superb accuracy, extremely concealable, and excellent ergonomics make this an excellent choice for a concealed carry even in light summer clothing. Sure, you could conceal a Glock 26 easily in the cooler months, but it becomes much trickier in shorts and a tee shirt. This pistol will give you piece of mind all 4 seasons.

A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

 A steel trigger (not plastic like so many others) with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

This is the ultimate weapon for home defense, survival, hunting, target practice, and non-lethal force (bean bag rounds, rubber bullets).  The U.S. Military uses the 500 series shotgun in many applications such as riot control, breaching, and security forces.  This shotgun is very durable and reliable and light enough for small framed individuals to shoot.  The collapsible stock is adjustable for length of pull for short arms.   The Ghost Ring Sight is adjustable for elevation and windage and can punch a 1"" hole with slugs at 50 yards (5 shot group).

I just priced this entire gun piece by piece from brownells and it was over 1100 dollars. Could it be built exactly as it sits for less? Possibly.  That is why I included all the Company names and models in case you wanted to check it for yourself.  Now I understand that this IS a USED gun.  I am listing this gun for $900.  Realistically has only had about 1500 rounds through it max. Anybody that knows AR's knows this upper/lower combo is not the top shelf but at the same time are both WELL respected companies.  

THIS GUN SHOOTS PERFECTLY.  Nothing wrong with it, ready to roll.  THE REASON FOR SELLING is I am building a short barreled rifle (SBR) and don't need this many ar's in my safe.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of the new Springfield XD-S 9mm Compact pistols in the awesome Bi-Tone finish. I’m not normally a fan of bi-tone, but these look awesome. They come fully equipped with both a 7 and extended 9-round magazine, XD Gear, and all the precision you should expect from a Springfield handgun. These are sweet.


I just got TWO of these in stock, and they are priced to sell quickly for only $559.00 each (cash price).


Springfield XDS9409S XD-S 9mm Compact Pistol with 4 Inch Barrel, 7 and 9 Round Magazines, XD Gear, Bi-Tone Finish- Springfield XDS9409S

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9″ wide) with enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a stainless steel slide. The XD-S also boasts multiple safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. 
The disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol. These features come together to create a superior slim pistol. This XD-S model comes with a durable rugged case and two magazines–one flush-fitting stainless steel 7-round magazine and one full-size Mag X-tension 9-round magazine.

-New WOLFF: XP RECOIL SPRING, 3 XTRA POWER MAGAZINE SPRINGS, XTRA POWER FIRING PIN SPRING, 23LB RECOIL SPRING ($30 for all spring update)
-New WILSON COMBAT BULLET PROOF SERIES 70 EXTRACTOR ($37)

This particular pistol is highly collectible. It has two specific traits that very few combat masters have. Specifically this one has no slide markings which were intentionally emitted for either the factory executives or factory gunsmiths and it has a crown cut muzzle on the barrel which I have only seen twice before, but never on an un-catalogued piece. Barrel, original extractor, interior slide all have hand etched serial numbers that match the frames’.
Beautiful ultra compact conceal carry piece in hard hitting .45
This pistol is the size of my hand and can easily be concealed with no printing. Accuracy is on the same level as my Wilson CQB 4”. My wife can hit the same target hole 3 of 7 shots from 7 yards regularly. 
It will come with two magazines, one OEM (easily sells for $85 on ebay) and an aftermarket that is identical except blued. I have two others for sale separately or if a trade is right. 
The last Detonics collector that has about 18 of these put the value around $1500 for collectors and around $1,250 for personal protection buyer and that was three years ago.
I would like to get $1050 cash or a trade value of $1,200. 
Very nice pistol and with the updated springs and parts, it runs like silk. Must have CCP and ID or a purchase permit from a NC county Sherriff. Trades must follow the same rules. Bill of sale will be signed and a copy provided to both parties. If this listing is up, the pistol is still for sale. Any requests to ship or hold the pistol will require a non-refundable deposit that I can take with a credit card through my business. I can also accept credit cards with a 2% fee. 
I’m willing to make a deal, just ask. You can text or call REDACTED if you want more pictures or info. Thanks"

From the manufacturer’s web site:

This pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

As of 2007, Ruger has discontinued production citing low demand. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series 9mm and .40 S&W caliber pistols.

Both the PC9 (the 9mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol."

I've had it for about a year or so, carried it regularly and I loved it.  I'm just looking to sell because I recently purchased a smaller gun and I find that I'm carrying it more regularly and the M9 is just sitting at home in its case.

I've upgraded this M9 with many included parts and accessories.  I replaced the factory plastic parts with Beretta's OEM Steel parts, upgraded the trigger spring to a lighter pull, which helps tremendously on that first shot if you're shooting it on that first DA trigger pull.  I found the stock spring was always a little too stiff for my liking, as I preferred some consistency between the two pulls.

Included accessories are listed below:

- 2x 18-round Mec-Gar steel magazines.
- 2x 15+1 Beretta factory steel magazines.
- 2x 10+1 Beretta factory steel magazines.
- Kydex holster mold designed for Minotaur holster (actual Minotaur MTAC holster not included as I'm using it for my current CCW).
- Hogue aftermarket rubber grips.
- All stock boxes, trigger locks, warranty cards and factory manuals included as well.
