All 6 God of War games which include God of War, God of War 2, God of War 3, God of War Chains of Olympus, God of War Ghost of Sparta, and God of War Ascension. Also have Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Resistance Fall of Man 1&2, Grand Theft Auto 4, and Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Plays Blurays, gets free wifi and free to play online, can watch Netflix, it's really cool. Easy way to make a gamer or kid happy."

Originally a btvs, but would now be considered a fvss with the synthetic stock. stainless steel, with upgraded bases (factory bases are usually junk). these bases are a little taller than the factory bases, and I have been able to use low rings on the scopes I have had mounted to them (40mm-44mm). comes with the stainless rings in pictures. comes with original 5 shot stainless magazine.

Also comes with stainless trigger guard, bottom metal and screws to upgrade to a wood stock. the stainless bottom metal on the synthetic stock in the pictures is for wood stocks and doesn't fit like the synthetic bottom metal, which is a little longer. The rear screw on the bottom metal is not it the stock, because the rear  hole for the wood bottom metal does not line up like the synthetic bottom metal. You can put the screw in it when you get it if you want to keep it in the synthetic stock. If you are going to use a wooden/laminate stock and sell the synthetic, I would not put the screw in and enlarge the hole (that's why I haven't put it in). all you need to upgrade to a wood/laminate stock is the stock. the stainless trigger guard, bottom metal and all screws are included (I will put a picture up later).
very accurate with the 17gr vmax, doesn't like the heavier (20gr) or the lighter (15.5gr). 
this is the older pre-e receiver with the accutrigger, which I have not adjusted since I have had the rifle (I bought it used and have owned it for about 6 years). I kept the stock I had it in and bought this synthetic to sell it. Gun is in excellent condition. always kept clean and stored properly indoors in a case.

The ""Taurus Judge"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances where most altercations occur, or for longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sight, fiber optic front sight and Taurus Ribber Grips, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

It is a bit heavier due to quality metal parts than its competitors yet still carrys in the pocket or iwb with ease and comfort. This one has the full set up with the sig laser which is one of the brightest lasers I have used and also the sig tritium sights are as bright as any I have seen. Comes with everything it did new including the nice holster that perfectly fits gun with laser on it. One six round flush mag, 2 8 round extended which makes this a full size grip...not just a pinky extension on this gun the larger mags make this guns grip large enough for anyone to get a full hold that they are comfortable with. Laser is activated on either side with the rubber button and remains on when pressed. This gun was designed to handle plus p 9mm and shoots anything out there.
with new going for 650-700 and this being in great condition with a 50 dollar extra mag I am asking a low very fair price for a gun that is not going to fail you when needed and is set up with everything you would want on a gun that can go in your pocket. 
I would consider a couple of trades such as Glocks in 9mm, 17 or 19, glock 23, I will consider other guns as well so long as offer is fair or cash is included. Just because I do not inflate prices 200 more than real value like lots do on here does not mean I will accept your 400 dollar gun being offered as a 600 dollar gun. I am fair on price and only expect the sameWould be great as well but be fair on condition and value when offering. please remember that this sig retails for over 600 so offering me junk is not going to happen. Besides price these are not easy to find either. CCW holders first in line, Bill of sale and ID a must."

I kept it in my car since then and with all this rain some moisture must have got to it a little and it has a couple very small surface rust areas, I have a picture included with that, it is not much so it might not show up in the picture... I am sure it will clean off I just saw it and wanted to mention it...  I will clean it later if I do not sell or trade it.

The guns I am interested in letting go are:

Well Kept Taurus model pt-25 .25 ACP pistol with gold accents and pearl grips. All steel frame, pocket sized. 10 round capacity with the break open barrel design for easy chamber loading / cleaning. Excellent weapon, and ungodly deadly with some magsafe ammo, which will make it shoot faster than 380 and bring it to just under standard .380 muzzle energy.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VERY good / Like new condition rossi break action 12 gauge shotgun, has had about a dozen rounds fired in its life. put a shotshell sling on this thing for $15 and you will find it to be an amazing hunting tool or home defense weapon. The ejector slings that spent shell out of the way so fast, you should never have a problem speed loading this baby. Beautiful wood stock, sling loops installed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PT738 .380 - I am not in a hurry to let this one go, it is a great and reliable pocket sized .380. The smallest and lightest of all of the pocket 380s. If there is something worth trading it for I might consider it. this is a very reliable pistol and i did a quick 6 round mag dump so u could see for yourself! http://bit.ly/16Ljk5N"

That being said, the pistol has been VERY THOROUGHLY cleaned, inside and out. I am including a box of White Hot powders, a box of Remington primers, and about 20 rounds. Comes in the original box with all original paperwork.

The rifle up for sale is a 1941 Tula SVT-40 in very good condition. Finish on the rifle is as to be expected; shows some wear, minor chips to the shellac finish, and a small section of wood behind the trigger guard was replaced during re-arsenaling post war.

The bore is in good shape, especially given the typical pitting and rough nature one usually finds an SVT-40 bore in. The lands are bright and shinny, while the bore is a little dark and has some frost to it. The rifle is accurate, producing groups of 4-6 MOA with cheap ammo and surplus, and will shoot ~2 MOA with match and high quality surplus such as Yugo, and the recent import of 60's Russian Match ammo.

The stock matches the rifles, but the magazine is a parts bin mismatch. Rifle functions flawlessly with everything accept lacquer and polymer coated ammunition. The action makes use of a fluted chamber, which blows gas back around the case, to keep the case from sticking. While this works great for brass and steel, it has the opposite effect on lacquer/polymer, causing it to melt the coating. Not the fault of the rifle, just a bugbear of the design. Also, I would not feed this rifle any brass you want to keep, as the charging handle functions as a brass deflector and WILL bend your cases.

I am willing to meet face-to-face anywhere in Pensacola, and will entertain any reasonable offer. I am also willing to ship outside the Pensacola area, but will wait until payment clears before shipping the rifle to your FFL of choice. I have an FFL who will act as a shipping agent.

I apologize in advance for the lack of photos as I don't have a camera capable of taking a decent quality picture."

This is the concealed carry version of the 45ACP glock, compact enough to be hidden easily while still packing a mean punch with 10 45ACP rounds. The pistol comes with factory box and papers, cleaning rod, and loader. The pistol comes with two ten round factory magazines as well as one 30 round Kriss Vector factory magazine. The Kriss Vector Super V mag holds 30 rounds of 45acp. The main shortcoming of the 45acp concealed carry weapons was the limited capacity of their magazines given the size of the rounds. With a 30 round stick this 45acp pistol has as much fire power as any other pistol on the market. I have only fired the pistol 20 rounds of federal hollow points to test functionality. If I did not tell you the pistol was fired it could easily pass as new. This is a great all around 45ACP pistol. Please make sure you are legally allowed to own the pistol and high capacity magazines before buying. Thank you for your time and consideration.

CASH ONLY if you are highly interested please email me and leave a name and number. will not settle for a doaller less than my asking price so DO NOT bother if you dont have this kind of money, i show exactly how much i spent on it all so no BS!

gun itself was 800$

solid steel lock box has been built for this gun that is lockable, essentially a gun safe. custom fit with foam padding and welded together.  value? priceless... keeps gun from being stolen i will not add a charge for this, but it damn well seems like it would be worth 80$

it comes with 1 5 round mag from china 8$ value

2 yugoslavian 30 rounder rare lockback follower that has a built in bolt hold open in the magazine, 40$ value

2 cheap crappy tapco magazines. 30$ value for both

1 ultra uber rare russian star bakelight orange magazine from cold war era it is  a 30 rounder 40$ value

1 ultra uber rare russian slabside magazine, its a 30 rounder 40$ value


2 unknown origin steel magazines 30 rounders 40 $ value for both

1 different style tapco magazine smoothe side 15$ value.

cnc warrior muzzle break 100$ online but lets be fare and say its a 50$ value even though i cant find one for less than 50$ im sure my asking price for this set is serious.

1 russian sling 15$ value


then theres about roughly id say 100 rounds of different various ammo. and its not the cheap tula stuff its legit yugoslavian brass surplus and zinc platted chrome rounds. high end ammo in the box still. and actually theres more than 100 rounds so this will be priced fairly aswell.

tula ammo goes for 5$ a box of 20 so ... 20 / 100 = 5, 5x5 = 25 + a little extra id say due to there being about 120-150 rounds and its not cheap tula im going to say the ammos value is right around 45-55$ but i will price it fair at 35$ 

then theres some front sight adjustment tool got it for 15$ but hell i will say its 10$ 

cant really think of everything else i got for it. its basically a solid steel trunk with the ak pistol and a ridicoulus amount of upgrades and just extras with it that obviously i spent alot of money on.

i have a super discreet carrying case thats disguised as something . very special cost 15$ and alot of time to think up and looks professional. i wont charge for this....but you will be surprised when you see what it is.

i will have you know i have shot less than 50 rounds through it and clean and lubed it the one time i did shoot it., i took a buffer to the bolt and carrier and also the fire control group it is as slick as a 79 nova on chrome wheels. so it is very smothe and has no drag very easy pull back on this bolt of all the aks ive ever had. it also has a notch professionally cutout on the safety lever by century arms to lock the bolt back as a means of additional safety.

i also have the rear pistol grip sling plate installed thats a good 20$ but i wont include that ethier.

well lets see what the value is of all my stuff that obviously isnt brand new and i am not priceing it as such, im also knocking off alot of value just because i need the money so here goes lets see what it all added up to and you can do the math and read so if you want to argue about my prices than so be it this is what i want for it and i have google and internetz and gunbroker too so ya i wont take your 500$ for my 1000$ investment sorry...

lol sorry bout that this is not charitylist

anyways, looks like its 1083$ you know what lets be fair i was going to round it up to like id say 1100 doallers but instead since im so serious on selling it and i know the value of all my stuff i spent way to much money on i will take the loss and price it at 1050$


very firm on 1050$ and if your interested in a highly prized gun that  is in great condition contact me and i will send you pictures ethier via email or through phone text thank you.
and all that i will require from the sale is for you to fill out a form similar to a stores  and a valid id to cover my own ass from selling to criminals thank you."

Finish on the rifle is as to be expected; shows some wear, minor chips to the shellac finish, and a small section of wood behind the trigger guard was replaced during re-arsenaling post war.

The bore is in good shape, especially given the typical pitting and rough nature one usually finds an SVT-40 bore in. The lands are bright and shinny, while the bore is a little dark and has some frost to it. The rifle is accurate, producing groups of 4-6 MOA with cheap ammo and surplus, and will shoot ~2 MOA with match and high quality surplus such as Yugo, and the recent import of 60's Russian Match ammo.

The stock matches the rifles, but the magazine is a parts bin mismatch. Rifle functions flawlessly with everything accept lacquer and polymer coated ammunition. The action makes use of a fluted chamber, which blows gas back around the case, to keep the case from sticking. While this works great for brass and steel, it has the opposite effect on lacquer/polymer, causing it to melt the coating. Not the fault of the rifle, just a bugbear of the design. Also, I would not feed this rifle any brass you want to keep, as the charging handle functions as a brass deflector and WILL bend your cases.

I am willing to meet face-to-face anywhere in Pensacola, and will entertain any reasonable offer. I am also willing to ship outside the Pensacola area, but will wait until payment clears before shipping the rifle to your FFL of choice. I have an FFL who will act as a shipping agent.

I apologize in advance for the lack of photos as I don't have a camera capable of taking a decent quality picture."

Just add powder and primers and you are ready for the range.  I wish I could post more than three pictures of this pistol, as there is not a worn, rusted, or bad spot on this gun. If you wish, I will email you more pictures. 

This pistol was my father's and I have had it in the safe for over ten years without shooting it. It deserves to be used and I couldn't bring myself to shoot it, but that is my problem. Enough of the sentimental BS, if you would like more information please email me and I will respond. I can also provide a phone number if you like. I am asking $775 for this pistol and all  of the above listed accessories. I can ship this listing but it must go to an FFL. If your FFL holder will not accept a shipment from me ( I don't have an FFL), then there will be an additional $20 charge to ship from my FFL holder."

Ive had an M&P40c and I wasn't impressed with it, so I'm not interested in M&P's, sorry.

Can post pictures later, but it looks like any other glock.  However, it might interest you Glock enthusiasts out there to know that this one is marked ""USA"" on the slide and ""Made in the USA"" on the frame, my understanding is that these US made glocks are uncommon in the states.

I bought this gun new so I'd like to have a bill of sale filled out, I have my CCL and would do the same for your gun if you'd like.

 By no means is a used WASR 10 worth $1000 when you can buy one brand new for $599.00, and to the jerk off TRYING to sell his Century Arms Bulgarian AK-74 for $1300, you can buy the same one from Atlantic Firearms for $699.00 new. You can also buy a new Yugo AK for $799.00, so why would you buy a used one for $1000?
 Don't buy someone's used worn out junk rifle that has been run through the ringer that might actually blow up in your face or cost you hundreds in repairs, buy new."

I have 65 rounds of NEW 135 gr. FMJ (flat nose) Winchester .38 Spl.  +  34 spend pieces of brass ( I lost one)........... if you reload.  

These run $.40 /round.  This would put the value of the .38's at $26 (pre-panic price).

I'm not picky, as far as the brand - except, I do not want the  Remington ""Golden Bullets""..... unless they are the ""New and Improved"" type.  The older ones are way too dirty.  

I did not compare the price of specific type/brand of .22's.....  just make an offer. 

I may add $$ if needed - but not if you want PANIC prices.  I am not desperate for .22's - I have plenty, I simply do not need these .38's.

I am looking to trade ONLY at the moment.
