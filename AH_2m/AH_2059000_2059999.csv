Stainless steel mags are much stronger and durable than traditional aluminum magazines. These magazines are matte black in color and are proudly made in the USA. ASC had purchased all the equipment from the old C-products company and improved upon the design (better heat treatment and welding), producing yet another evolution of quality magazines. These magazines have the latest generation of anti-tilt followers.
These are not the cheap imported or inferior old stock grade magazines you see everywhere else. These are freshly made in 2013.

Mags are $45 each, shipping is $8 for any quantity you purchase.

I advertise it as such because of the following reasons. When I was serving in the military I had the opportunity to go to the Middle East and buy galil parts from IWI. I bought all the parts there except for the lower receiver because ITAR regulations won't allow it to be imported straight over without a company or LLC title. So, I had to buy a CAI golani lower to use as the base of the build. It has been professionally assembled and is amazing. It comes with 4 magazines, all of which are Israeli. It has meticulously maintained and always cleaned with Frog Lube. Every part of this gun is genuine Israeli except the lower receiver. I'm asking 1500 obo, that's a steal for what you are getting. I'll entertain trade offers for other assault rifles. Only reason I'm getting rid of this gun is because I thought I would use two but I haven't. Text josh at REDACTED."

Selling a fred bear badge dual cam hunting bow. Draw weight is 35 to 45 lbs. 7 1/2 inch brace height. Draw length is adjustable from 25 to 27 1/2 inches. 

This bow has easy adjust cams for easy draw length adjustment. The limbs do not require a bow press to increase or decrease draw weight.  I hunted with this bow for two years due to a problematic shoulder injury. The bow is very accurate, easy to shoot and compact in weight and size. I have taken three deer with it with no trouble, as well as a turkey and some squirrels. 

The bow does show signs of use with some finish dings, but it is mechanically sound. Cosmetically I would give it an 8 out of ten, mechanically i would rate it 9 of 10, as the string needs to replaced.  I have a new string on order, which will come with the bow. The bow will come ready to shoot, with an NAP quicktune 800 rest, tru glo 5 pin fiber optic sight, quiver, peep sight, and release.This would be great for a new younger shooter or women, or in my case, someone who wants to hunt but needs a lower draw weight due to injury."

Manufacturer's propaganda:

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. 

What sets it apart from the 92FS is: 

A. Distinctive military style markings: on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.
B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.
C. “Dot-and-Post” sight system: clones that of the M9."

Model A1041. Competition grade rifle.
These are very rare and hard to find because people keep them, but I am wanting a nice handgun, mostly for home protection.
High Standard has been at the top for competition guns since 1952, many people used them in the Olympics because of their durability and accuracy. Longer barrel, 22”, light weight and very well balanced. Vented receiver, helps when shooting a lot of rounds and keeps the receiver cleaner. It also has another unique feature, it doesn't feed another round in the chamber until you release the trigger forward, but it will feed them as fast as you can pull the trigger, with no ftf or fte.
This rifle is in excellent condition and will shoot 22longs, shorts and 22long rifle, any brand. It has been kept clean inside and out.
Comes with 2,125rds of good ammo, new Bushnell 4X32 scope and new case.
Sell for $475.00 or prefer handgun trade with ammo. Please, I will not separate, package deal. Will sell fast, I will not ship or hold, first one with cash or trade gets it.

The revolver was made in the late 70's, and has holster ware, but is in excellent mechanical condition. My cousin is a gunsmith, and he said for its age it looks like it was almost never fired. I always ment to have it reblued, but it just never happened. It is a very good CC gun, and it is also very good for home defence if you just want to keep it in a bedside table.

It is in very good condition and the new Siglight Night Sites were installed less than a year ago. West German Manufactured. Comes with 2-15 round magazines.

From Sig ""The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols.""

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Up for TRADE, I have a very nice, clean, and ""finished/fitted/tuned"" black Springfield Armory XDS chambered in .45acp.  Package comes with everything as if purchased new (XD Gear, holster, mag holder, case, and lock with test fire casing dated 3-21-13.  Also with this package are the original SA Parts that were replaced during improvements by a gunsmith, (stock weight trigger assy. springs and sights)

Upgrades installed are as follows:

1. Extended grip safety (provides higher grip on handgun and fills void in frame when depressed so the sharp edge can no longer chew on your hands) Plus it looks very nice.

2. Talon rubberized textured lay over grips (Black in color flash makes them look grey in picture and provides comfortable, non printing, positive grip on handgun.

3. TruGlo T.F.O. sights (Tritium Fiber Optic)  Best sights on the market! Quick target acquisition with BRIGHT green dots that glow very bright in day and night!  GLOWS IN DAYLIGHT!

4. Powder River Precision's trigger enhancement spring kit (4lb smoother than stock trigger with a very clean, crisp break and very short reset.

5. Cosmetically have installed a Freemason's striker cover and flat mag plate.  Also second mag has Pierce grip extension.

Has 350 rounds down pipe, all ammo CLEAN BRASS FACTORY AMMO. Not a single failure, I HAD NO INTENTION AT ALL OF GETTING RID OF THIS GUN, BUT A RECENT 1911 PURCHASE HAS MADE ME VERY CURIOUS ABOUT TRYING TO GET A OFFICERS OR SMALLER 1911 TO CHANGE TO AS MY DAILY CARRY."

This bow is unusual in that it has a aluminum arrow rest assembly that is machined to accept the two arrow guide strips that form a slot to accept the fin adapters and arrow. The string of the bow travels down the center of the rest. Also attached to the rest is an arrow holding spring to keep the arrow in place at all times before the shot. The release is a dual caliper model with a pistol grip handle and trigger. When the bow is drawn the release, rest, string and arrow are all in equal motion. At release only the string and arrow move forward. The rest is mounted to the bow using an aluminum fixture equipped with five rollers. These rollers allow the rest to be drawn with no noise. The attachment fixture is also hinged to allow the bow to be placed in the stored/resting position.

It also comes with 4 STI standard capacity mags and 2 STI 10 round mags, all with extended basepads for quicker, more efficient reloads in the pistols beveled mag well.  All of the mags are in excellent, serviceable condition and if bought new, would be $64 each.  

This pistol was made back in 2006, only has 500 rounds through it, and has sat in my safe the last 5 years after I stopped competing in IPSC and focused on IDPA.  This is an ideal pistol for any one wanting to get into IPSC Limited and Limited 10.  

I do not need to sell this pistol and am only parting with it to fund the purchase of some other projects.  The price for this pistol is very reasonable and it will go fast.  Feel free to ask any questions and I will answer.  My only request is no low-ball offers; I am firm on this price.

Used by the United States armed forces since 1984, the 92 series has proven itself in battle and testing over and over. The 92A1 is the newest edition of this venerable 9mm handgun. The front rail, recoil buffer and 17 round magazine capacity set it apart from the rest of the 92 line.

I have no more than 200 rounds through this 92A1. Shooting the 9mm makes more sense today than ever. Ballistically it is right there with the most effective pistol rounds and it can not be beat for fire power. The price of 9mm ammunition is right too. Includes everything that came from Beretta including all three original 17 round magazines."

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron
sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much
as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive,
they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and
without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and
cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights
feature a unique shock- resistant design that is patented by
Trijicon. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help
evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from
solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for
additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone
rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green
lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of
manufacture.

The perfect storm of a person very likely incapable of being held to a verbal contract, which equates to a very risky potential business deal. Besides his inflated asking price, I present the following as evidence.

I sent him a simple message, which follows:
""Please edit or remove the picture with your finger on the trigger. Responsible gun ownership means NEVER putting your finger on the trigger until you are aimed at and ready to shoot your target. Thank you.""

His reply, verbatim:
""Do you seriously have nothing better to do? A responsible gun owner.... im 40 years old with a family. Never had a problem I have my permit to carry. The guns empty. Responsible... I have 2 jobs 3 kids and a wife. I think im pretty responsible.""

My reply:
""Yes, I seriously have nothing better to do than help raise awareness of irresponsible gun ownership. Your response does nothing to prove responsibility, only arrogance. Where did you get your PTC? Your instructor has 1 of 2 possible problems: 1) Failed to discuss the 4 rules of gun safety, or 2) Failed to stress the importance of gun safety. Here's a refresher from the NRA;
1) ALWAYS keep the gun pointed in a safe direction.
2) ALWAYS keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot.
3) ALWAYS keep the gun unloaded until ready to use.
4) ALWAYS treat every gun as if it is loaded.""

Rossi's 6 round revolver in the well-respected .357 caliber is the Model 462 in stainless steel.


Two inch barrels make them the right size for personal protection. While they're built extra tough to handle all .357 Magnum cartridges, they will fire the popular .38 Special Standard and .38 Special +P rounds as well.  


All Rossi Revolvers have the lifetime repair policy, as well as the patented Taurus Security System. The Taurus Security System is a simple, integral locking device that allows the firearm to be secured by use of a special key. When the system is engaged, the hammer cannot be cocked and the trigger can not be pulled.
