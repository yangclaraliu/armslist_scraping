The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has a 24” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs.

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.

Some of it is still in boxes and some has been dumped into ammo cans.

The ammunition is pretty much sorted between:

155 grain hollow point Remington and Federal

180 grain hollow point Federal

I don't have specific numbers on how many of each grain we have.  Neither one of us have 40's anymore.

The ammo has been stored inside in a climate controlled environment, again, either in ammo cans (not included, but negotiable) or factory boxes.

So what is a fair price per 1000 rounds?  $500.00?  I see that on some of the online sites that ammo is still out of stock and that for a hollow point round by federal and Remington that they sell for $30.00 plus dollars a box not counting shipping.

Just seeing if anyone is interested.  If we were to sell, the person would have to provide a valid Indiana BMV license and a handgun permit and be willing to sign a declaration that they are legally allowed to possess ammunition according to Indiana state law and federal law.  No domestic battery convictions, restraining orders, etc.  

If not willing or not able to meet the above stipulations then please don't even inquire.  This is non-negotiable."

BRAND NEW & UNFIRED

4-5/8"" Barrels
45 Colt caliber
Custom Matching Bearpaw ""Black Line Maple"" EIG 5 Grips (Original Grips Included)
All Original Box, Manuals, lock, etc. included 
Here is some information about the grips from the maker
EIG 5 Means egronomicly improved grips ...as compared the traditional factory type grip profile and the 5 main reasons they are better: 

1. drastically improved recoil control during rapidfire or heavy recoil applications. 

2. repeatable correct trigger finger positioning because EIG 5 puts the gun in the hand the same every time. 

3. rapid and repeatable sight picture because EIG 5 again places the gun in the hand the same every time. 

4. allows for a more relaxed grip creating more pleasurable and longer shooting sessions. 

5. decreased butt bevel angle allowing for a longer grip surface. 

All BearPaw Grips have these standard features: 

Premium luthier grade wood (domestic) 

Premium exotic hardwood (imported) 

All grips are from bookmatched blanks made in house 

All woods kiln or dried & tested in house for 6-8%/h2o> 

Solid brass escutcheons/stainless screw 

Old world formulas for coloring/finishing 

Hand made in USA one at a time 

Each grip is signed & serial numbered

Please note that the EIG 5 system is far more difficult to hand carve than the simple straight lines that a factory type grip represents, and it is a very practical feature which still retains the original look of the old west.""

This pair of New Vaqueros makes the perfect set for cowboy action shooting, home defense, defense while outdoors, or self-defense purposes, as the 45 Colt has been taking care of business for the past 140 years! 

These pistols are PRISTINE, having never been fired. The actions are smooth and the cylinders have ZERO play in them!

These pistols have an amazing pair of functional and classy grips on them which will bring compliments from friends and admirers! As well, they will improve your shooting and your shooting experience! Although I have not fired these particular sixguns, I have used Bearpaw EIG 5 Grips in the past which inspired my purchase of these! The grips alone cost $75 per pair, and here you have two matching pairs on two pistols with consecutive serial numbers!"

It is the top rifle in the picture.  I have fired this carbine and it is a good shooter.  All metal is in good condition with some fading to plum.  It has a folding bayonet and is a Kokura 1st variation of this type of carbine, probably made in the 1920's or 30's.  It is also probably a vet bringback though I have no documentation of this.  None of the numbers seem to match on this carbine...but I understand they are matched through assembly numbers located on the receiver below the stock line.  The stock is very dark on this one...a light crack on the top handguard near the front sight about an inch long.  The wood is dented and dinged but no other cracks that I can see.  Stock is heavily worn on left side where it would have rubbed while slung across shoulder or back.  Please no trades....looking to reduce holdings for a move.  Will consider reasonable cash offers on this fairly rare Arisaka carbine."

Model: Single Action Army Frontier Six Shooter 

Serial Number: 80378 

Year of Manufacture: 1882 

Caliber: .44 WCF 

Action Type: Single Action Revolver 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is etched “Colt Frontier Six Shooter”. The left side of the frame is marked “Pat. Sept. 19, 1871 / "" July 2,-72 / "" Jan. 19,-75”. The top of the barrel is marked “Colt’s Pt. F.A. Mfg. Co. Hartford, CT. U.S.A.”. The underside of the frame, back strap and trigger guard are marked “80378”. The loading gate is assembly numbered ""5200"". There is a ""Ca"" on the left forward trigger guard bow. 

Barrel Length: 7 ½’ 

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a fixed blade. The rear sight is a notched top strap. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are one piece smooth wood. The fit is very good, though just a bit shy. There is scattered marking and the finish is a dark oil. There is general wear at the edges and a possible light sanding. There are no splits. The grips rate in about Good overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Nickel 

Finish Originality: Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is gray and the rifling is present but worn. There is mild and even erosion in the bore. 

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 3% of its metal finish. There are only traces of the original plating, though enough to determine it is a nickel gun. The balance of the gun is void of finish and drifting to a light patina. There is mild erosion throughout and some mottled aging. There are some tooling marks on the hammer, and someone has replaced the base pin screw, apparently it required being re-drilled and tapped. The gun has a great frontier appearance. The screw heads are worn but serviceable. The markings are light. Overall, this handgun rates in about Good condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions properly, though the lock up is not always strong. We did not fire this handgun. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None 

Our Assessment: The Colt Frontier or Frontier Six-Shooter was a Colt's 1873 ""Model P"" type revolver, manufactured in .44-40 Winchester caliber instead of .45 Colt (in which configuration it was called the Single Action Army), so as to be cross-compatible with Winchester 1873 ammunition. Production began 1877. Colt Frontier Six-Shooter was the actual name of the Colt pistol model and this was acid-etched on the left side of the barrel. After 1889, the legend was roll-stamped until 1919. This is a desirable gun with the etched panel, and though there has been some metal work and wear, the gun remains acceptable."

There are strong case colors remaining, particularly on the forward parts of the frame and hammer. The barrel and cylinder retain most of their original finish with some normal wear/thinning. The grip straps are worn to mostly silver. The screw heads are clean/undamaged and retain most of their original fire blue color. The original hard rubber grips are in excellent condition also and although unnumbered, fit ""factory perfect"". The mechanics are in excellent condition and the revolver is tight and functions ""like new"". The bore is also in very fine shape...bright with sharp rifling and no pitting. It comes with a very nice El Paso Saddlery deluxe left-hand tooled holster. A 1992 dated factory letter indicates this revolver was shipped to Simmons Hardware Co. on January 24, 1899.

Gun is in good condition.  Was used as a hunting gun, and shows some surface rust on barrel's bluing (pictured) Bore is good though.

Action is tight and gun is a straight shooter. Comes with 49 rounds of 30.06 and a redfield tracker scope 3x-9x. 

Excellent gun, only issue is bolt release will not actuate, why I'm not sure, if you know guns this could be something easy for you. RIFLE is still fully functional and can still be cleaned. I took it to a gun smith and he said it would be about a 50 dollar fix.  Seeing as I don't have a need for this gun I don't want to put money into it.

I will take 400 O.B.O for it.  These go anywhere from $500-$800 so you're getting a good deal.

I recently bought a .308 SCAR and just never shoot the SIG 556 enough to justify keeping it. First off im looking to trade everything pictured for a decent running Jeep to fix up and be a DD. Otherwise im asking $2600 for everything listed/pictured.

All I ask: Nothing rotted out, nothing beat to absolute ****, must have a title.Trade must be value for value. IE: A $500 Jeep would not be a trade for my offer. Just like my offer would not be a trade for a $5K Jeep. I can throw in some cash if we are a little ways apart. I paid well over $4000 for everything listed. 

If your not familiar with a 556: It is based off the SIG 551, just uses a magwell that accepts AR15 mags. Internally it is a fine tuned AK47 with the most beautiful machining I have ever seen in a military styled weapon. 2 stage gas piston and adjustable trigger pull. AK reliablity with the 5.56/223 round. I sold all my AR15s after purchasing this firearm because I was that impressed with it. 

You get:
SIG 556 Classic with less than 150 rounds through it. Been babied since day 1. Still has the factory grease on the bolt an carrier. Works 100% and only shows normal wear from those intial 150 rounds of use. Inside is spotless - the bolt looks clean enough to eat off of.

Known as the ""BABY GLOCK,"" the GLOCK 26 in 9x19mm has been the most sought-after concealed carry option since its release in 1994-a market once dominated by the 5-round snubnose revolver.

The magazine capacity of 10 rounds is standard, and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain why the G26 is the mainstay backup option among security personnel and agencies worldwide.

This rifle shoots true and is a great all around mid-level AR. At this price, why buy an off the shelf starter rifle and pay more? I easily have $1100 into this rifle and it is only a few months old. Keep that in mind please and low ballers don't bother.

I want $799 for this beautiful AR. Check out the rest of the way overpriced ARs on SGN right now and then keep coming back to this one. I work in Renton but live in Puyallup so my meet locations will be in those areas depending on work week and weekends off.

Trijicon TR243G Accupoint 1-4x 24mm 97.5-24.2ft@100yd 30mm Tube #4 XHair Grn Dot

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

Even the safety has been sniper modified and even the bent bolt has a arsenal proof on it! None of this was ""at home work"", century a while back started ""sorting"" out the sniper rifles and I was lucky enough to pick one right out of the crate with about 20-30 other drilled rifles. This was the NICEST one. I wanted to resniper this one but realize now I will never get around to it, its sitting collecting dust and time for someone else to enjoy it.

I do not know what to ask for this. I have seen some m48 snipers sell for $400-600 depending on condition.. This one is nearly perfect and is an m48a which is quite a bit harder to find. The only one I have seen for sell is currently on GUN8R0KER and has been sitting at $1000..

Scope was purchased back in 1988 and lived on my Ruger 10/22 up to this year. For its age, the scope is in very good condition. It was made in the Philippines (unlike the 22 Mag’s of today, that are made in China). The glass is perfect and multicoated, with just a few blemishes on the tube from the rings. The scope is water proof, fog proof and shock proof.

I no longer need it and would like to pass it along to someone that can use it. You’ll be hard pressed to find another vintage 22 Mag, in this good of condition. at midwayusa.com the scope goes for $36.99 and the rings go for $29.99. Not including shipping. 

I’m asking asking $55 for the pair. Local sale only, not interested in shipping. Please text or call REDACTED. You can also reach me by email."
