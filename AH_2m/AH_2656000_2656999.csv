If you know AK47s then you know about the quality of the Polytech AK47 variants over just about any other variant out there. If you don't, just google ""Polytech AK Reviews"" and you'll see they're considered to be the finest AK variants to end up in the US. Anyway, take a look a the photos and I'll be glad to answer any questions you have. These rifles are superior to the US rifles in that they were assembled in factories and shipped over here complete, not some random mix and match parts kit from Romania assembled by some idiot at Century Arms. The factory this came from built and inspected the firearm before it was ever shipped. As such, the finish and fitment is unlike anything you can buy on the market today. I'm not the original owner as this was a KFS Atlanta pre ban import. 

Like all polytech AKs, this rifle has run flawlessly and has the smoothest bolt and action of any AK I've ever held. I own an Arsenal SLR which is a fine firearm, but honestly, this one is just smoother shooting. This AK was made in the famed ""Factory #386"" where the Polytech Legends were produced. When I take it to the range, it shoots 3-4MOA with iron sights and would likely do better if I was a better shot, haha. Rifle comes with 2 30-round magazines and sling, I can add more magazines or ammo to the trade at additional expense, let me know what you're thinking.

I prefer cash but would consider trading only for a New or LNIB Arsenal SAM7R with a fixed stock. The only other trades I would consider include MINT Sig P228 or P226 from W. Germany plus cash or a NIB P226 MK25 plus cash."

these are not very common guns, I wouldn't say rare but they aren't easy top find. even marlin enthusiasts often know very little about them but those who do love their 995 with all their hearts. I hate to see it go, but I would rather have a competition .22 revolver, which I would be open to trading for. I....kinda sorta lost the clip but they are very easy to find and very affordable. I think even walmart has one that fits for 14 bucks. .22LR
rounds are kinda being a pain in the rear to find these days so I will gladly give out 25 of my last 50 rounds with the trade. so no matter what u will get to do a little shooting with your new favorite rifle.

if you love an accurate and lightweight gun, you cant go wrong with the Marlin firearms co. model 995. considering the market is dry, only three listings on here nationwide the price im asking for this is a steal. 304 so give 751 me a email 62 or a text 10"

100% Legal to own and use!

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward."

Higgins Model 50 chambered in .270 Winchester 
The Sears model 50 is frequently referred to as one of the finest hunting rifles made, and since it was sold by Sears instead of having a famous name, they're still moderately cheap. 

It has an FN made Mauser action with a chrome lined High Standard barrel in a Bishop or Fajen stock assembled for Sears by High Standard. Factory drilled and tapped for a side-mount weaver scope base. 

The overriding consensus regarding the J.C. Higgins Model 50 is that it's a rifle worth holding on to if you have one, and worth seeking out if you do not. Prices are generally suppressed because of the department store association. Despite this, it is among the finest hunting rifles ever mass produced. This point is emphasized by the fact that these can be bought at bargain prices. If one were to build such a gun today using the same FN action, the price would easily exceed $1000.

This gun is a great shooter and conceal carry weapon. Listed below are the customizations that have been done:

- Full grip stippling (including front and 2 back straps)
- Ambidextrous index stippling 
- Magazine release button shortened and stippled
- Magazine release scalloping to make more slim lined 
- Magazine baseplate extension stippling
- Magazine baseplate finger grip scalloping
- Front trigger guard index stippling
- Trigger guard reduction and smoothing (underneath trigger guard)
- Slide engraving color fill - White (can be removed or color changed)
- Barrel and guide rode have been polished (not pictured)

Gun includes original case, 3 different sized interchangeable back straps (small and medium are both stippled and can have the large modified/stippled for additional cost), 1 12 round magazine with extension and a Comptac 2 o'clock kydex IWB holster. 

You will not find another M&P identical to this one. Not only is it improved in grip and functional, it looks very appealing and one of a kind. A full stipple and grip modification job, like done on this one, cost anywhere from $200-$350 depending on what all you have done, and as you can tell, this one is very clean. 

I am looking at reasonable cash offers or possible trades for other guns only. I know what these cost without being customized and without night sights so please be realistic with your pricing and/or trade values.

They were produced to compete with the remingtons and the winchesters and are every bit as nice and American made, they just lost the marketing war. This one is in about a 90 percentile as far as the furniture goes and about 95 percentile as far as blueing goes. It has flip up iron sights and a 22in barrel. I have put 40 rounds through it to get the scope on paper. It shoots very nicely and the action works flawlessly and has very little if any play. The scope on it is a tasco 4x40, not a high dollar piece but was able to be dialed in and it held a zero. The scope is sitting in a set of nice weaver mounts that are far newer than the rifle itself. Unfortunatley I do not have the original box or the paperwork with it because I took it as a partial trade a while back. It comes as is with a new box of ammo. With the right ammo this would make a great all around hunting rifle for everything from groundhogs out to whitetail. I live in the cincy area and would prefer not to travel more than 30 miles in any direction."

It is a 22"" barrel (it's a short action ultra mag so this was the most common barrel length for the caliber). Recoil is much less than a typical 300. The scope is a Bushnell 6-18x50mm AO Wide View model in great shape (NOT the made in China model)

I have checked the bolt gap with a feeler gauge set and it falls within the proper range. Unlike some Century CETME builds the rear of the bolt on this rifle was NOT ground down to ""cheat"" and create bolt gap in an unsafe manner. The wood furniture is nearly pristine while the metal finish has the sort of minor damage around areas such as the magazine well and ejection port that you'd expect from a used rifle.

659,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2656659,For Sale/Trade:  COLT 1903 .32,"Snohomish, Seattle, Washington",$ 900,"Listed On: Saturday, February 22, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless (not to be confused with the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammer) is a .32 ACP caliber, self-loading, semi-automatic pistol designed by John Browning and built by Colt Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut.     The Colt Model 1908 Pocket Hammerless is a variant introduced five years later in .380 ACP caliber. Despite the title 'Hammerless', the Model 1903 does have a hammer. It is covered and hidden from view under the rear of the slide. This allowed the weapon to be carried in and withdrawn from a pocket quickly and smoothly without snagging.

  These pistols were popular civilian firearms for much of their life, and also served as United States General Officer pistols from the 1940s until their replacement by the M15 General Officers pistol in the 1970s. The Office of Strategic Services issued the Model 1903 to its officers during World War II.The Shanghai Municipal Police issued the M1908 to its Chinese officers in the 1920s and 1930s and it was a popular back-up/off-duty model with police officers in the United States.

  In addition to lawful owners, many gangsters of the pre-World War II era favored the Model 1903 and Model 1908 because they were relatively small and easily concealed. It is said that Al Capone kept one in his coat pocket and Bonnie Parker used one to break Clyde Barrow out of jail after smuggling it into the jail by taping it to her thigh. Bank robber John Dillinger was carrying this model of pistol when he was shot by FBI agents outside the Biograph theater on July 22, 1934, and another famous bank robber, Willie Sutton kept one when was captured by police in Brooklyn on February 18, 1952."

673,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2656673,"For Sale:  FS: Saiga-12 shotgun, converted w/high-end parts. Includes 3 high-cap mags","Lincoln County, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 900,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 5, 2014",Shotguns,no type,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Shotgun,"I have for sale a Izhmash Saiga-12 shotgun. This gun has been tested with about 50 rounds of cheap bulk-pack 2.75"" Federal 12ga birdshot and 20 rounds of S&B 00 buckshot, operation so far has been flawless and if it will cycle these cheap, low-powered brands of ammo it will cycle about anything else. It can fire either 2 3/4"" or 3"" ammunition and safely handle up to high-brass magnum slugs.

The gun is in nearly-new condition mechanically but as with most Saigas that have been handled and shot there is some minor finish wear on sharp edges such as the optics rail, charging handle, etc.

This gun was converted with high-quality, US-made parts and is fully 922(r) compliant even without the use of US-made magazines. List of upgrades include:

1) Tromix Shark Brake- 6-slot compensator/brake with 6 sharp tines on the end, on top of reducing recoil and rise it gives the barrel a standoff to prevent damage should it be fired with the muzzle against an object.

2) Gunfixers Gas Plug- this replaces the factory two-position gas regulator with a 4-position unit that can be adjusted to provide a wider range of gas pressure; this lets you open the gas system up further to fire cheap bulk birdshot or restrict it more tightly to fire heavy magnum loads. Saiga-12s are infamous for choking on light loads and beating themselves to death with heavy high-brass, this improved plug does a great job combating that.

3) Tapco SAW grip with storage compartment

4) Texas AK Designs all-metal adapter block with modular ACE LTD AK-FX stock. Although currently a fixed-stock gun this setup allows the addition of an ACE-pattern folding mechanism in just minutes, and unlike many of the cheap Saiga conversions out there the adapter block is fully internal (which both keeps unnecessary length to a minimum and looks far better than full-tang adapter blocks.) The stock has been paracord-wrapped at the cheek areas and comes with a 1/2 inch recoil pad with a thicker 1"" pad is available from ACE if so desired.

5)  Tapco G2 hammer and disconnector, which provides 922(r) compliance and a decreased trigger weight compared to factory

6) Tapco fire control group retaining plate, which replaces the sometimes difficult to use shepard's crook spring normally found in AKs with a spring-steel plate that slips in and out in seconds

7) The manual bolt hold open system has been modified to work with the relocated fire control group. Again, many cheaper Saiga conversions omit this part but since it is nearly impossible to reload a Saiga-12 on a closed bolt this is an essential feature to retain 

8) Three AGP Arms 10-round magazines- these are, in my experience, the best US-made hi-caps. Features a textured surface for grip, anti-tilt followers, and steel feed lips for durability and round control. 

Also comes with factory Saiga manual, Gunfixers Plug manual, factory muzzle cap, muzzle wrench, and bolt disassembly tool. Has optic rail mount on left side of receiver."

Very nice gun with three magazines which are around $60 when you can find them. This Gun was recently Cera Koted in black and when this happened the spring and bearing for the safety was lost, safety still functions but is prone to slide out of the gun if the hammer isn't half or fully cocked, when half or fully cocked the safety will NOT slide out. Functions and fires flawlessly and is very accurate. the spring and bearing is an $8 part i just haven't taken the time to track one down. between the Cera Kote and the number of magazines i feel like this is a great deal, just don't have the time or energy to track down this simple part."

Like the title says never been fired Colt  heavy barrel with Colt upper. Comes with New mil spec. BCG, and CH.

Barrel is chrome lined 1/7 twist heavy profile chambered in true 5.56. The heavy profile allows for better heat dissipation and resistance against rapid expansion and contraction damage that occurs with light barrels which over time will/has/does cause heat cracks in the rifling as well as ruin the barrels heat resilience by constantly heating up quickly. The heavy barrel also slightly mitigates muzzle flip and  sympathetic movements by the shooter.

 The Barrel is magnetic particle tested and pressure tested stamped by factory for proof. top quality, a true reliable work horse that will never quit. est. barrel service life of 7 to 10000 rds but I have an identical twin with over 15000 easy through the pipe and is still true to me.The upper has a mounted A2 style flash suppressor that brings it to legal WA length, but would need to be pinned or welded to make it legal for use.

 Rails are Knights Armament nothing flashy but works well and are solid as a rock.

The carrier is Colt chrome lined and has it's gas key properly staked as it should be. All internals are new and are from Brownells. 

The bolt itself is an AO Precision (formally Advanced Ordnance Corps) it is a very high quality.The bolt is Mag particle inspected as well as high pressure tested and shot peened for hardness. Constructed from Carpenter 158 tool steel it is made to last and of coarse is stamped for proof. 

Extras included in the sale include  Daniel Defense desert tan Ergo grip/rail protectors and a Knights Armament LAW forward grip.

  I build/fix guns/rifles as my zen time and this platform has always been my go to platform for NO non sense reliability.this platform is time proven and made with the highest quality components and hand assembled down to the last pin by my self. This is a pick up,slap on a lower set up.All it needs is some BUIS and its ready for weekends at the  range,small to medium game, or as my primary use home defense. 

Like I have stated the upper is unfired and all !00% new. The barrel has been test fired as per Colt/Federal standard for pressure testing. It is also Mag particle inspected for cracks and other structural defects.

 The bolt undergoes the same process. A lot of popular companies only batch test             ( meaning every few thousand get tested) Colt does this on every one, the same goes for AO Precision. 

The upper has been housed with CLP applied to all high friction and wear areas. Rails have several corners on them with a few sand grain sized paint chips on them from handling and assembly, the receiver also has a few of those same specs on its edges where the paint is naturally vulnerable. 

Always open to Q&A so don't hesitate to shoot me an email. thanks so much for dropping by and checking out this beauty- you wont be dissapointed!!

I just moved here from Canandaigua NY. The rifle is made in Canandaigua NY, and I couldn't own one there. LOL NY SUCKS

Since moving here, I also got my tax stamp and have a nice Osprey 45 suppressor, so I was thinking about getting the JRC .45 Carbine.

Anyone who has one email me. We can do cash, trade, partial, whatever. I got a lot of stuff, chances are youll be interested. If not, cash is cool too.

FYI, I really don't want a high point or a Keltec. Maybe would entertain it, but there is something cool about moving here and having a rifle made where I used to live but wasn't able to own.

The ammo boxes have been stored in plastic, sealed (o-ring style), ammo-containers with desiccant to protect against moisture.

The photos are of the actual rifle. I was going to say the rifle is ""New In Box"" as I don't recall ever shooting it, but I found a 20-round box of ammo that only had 10 rounds in it, and there is a slight mark on the black finish of the ejection port, so it may have had 10 rounds through it. Anytime I use a firearm at the range, I always clean/oil it afterwards.

I've had the rifle for about 5 years and it's been stored in a safe with a gun case that has the film/technology designed to preserve/protect firearms (I forget what it's called, but I know one brand of that technology is called Intercept Film Technology - you can Google it if you are curious).

Why am I selling? I'm not a deer hunter or a western shooter, and I rarely get to the range - and I don't think any of those factors will change anytime soon. I'm not a gun collector, so it doesn't make sense for me to have a gun sitting in the safe that I never use -- plus, my work situation has changed over the past year. If I ever do start hunting deer I can deal with getting a rifle then.

At this point I'm only selling the rifle and ammo together. I may split them out later on, I don't know. I'm figuring the current pricing as $375 for the rifle and $.70 per round = $750; however, I'd currently accept $710 cash for it all ($365 for the rifle and $.65 per round).

Also includes box, user manual, sling, offset hammer spur, lock, and key."

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.
