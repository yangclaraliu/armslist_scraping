BlackHawk CQC Holster Matte Finish engages the trigger guard as you holster the pistol and wont let go until you release it. The release is made using your normal drawing motion, with the trigger finger beside the holster body. As your trigger finger naturally comes to rest on the SERPA locks release mechanism, simply push the mechanism as you draw the weapon and it releases the gun for a smooth, fast draw.

This is a compact .38 special 5 shot revolver with an Airweight frame and shrouded hammer, but the hammer spur can be cocked back so it can be fired either single action or double action. I bought this gun myself new in August, 1984 and it was carried in a padded nylon holster in a purse maybe 6 times, then stored in a dry environment. The finish is 100% original. There is an almost imperceptible turn mark on the cylinder and of course there is the wear mark on the breech face behind the cylinder from the spring-loaded pin in center of the ejector, which is visible with the cylinder opened. Other than that, the gun is flawless--it looks like it did when it came out if the box. There are no defects. The finish is as new. The grips are original and as new. I have the original box and all original paperwork. Everything. I have a 30 year old box of bullets that were bought with the gun and the box still has rounds in it, so it has less than 50 rounds through it in its lifetime. Anything that looks like a finish flaw in the pictures is just glare. This is really a time capsule gun and would be a prized addition to the collection of any lover of Smith & Wesson revolvers.  And there is no S&W lock on this gun!!! You are welcome to examine the gun in person in Columbus, Ohio. Shipping will be $35 and only to your FFL. Cash only in person and Postal Money Order, Moneygram or Western Union otherwise.  And ""Postal"" means a money order issued by the U.S. Postal Service.  Don't let this one get away--you will likely never find another one this nice."

Ranger® Bonded handgun ammunition was specifically created to deliver maximum penetration through the toughest of barriers. This effectiveness is made possible thanks to the Winchester proprietary core/jacket bonding process—and is enhanced with a special hollow point cavity that acts in unison to control expansion, leading to maximum weight retention and deep penetration through hard and abrasive barriers including auto glass. Selected by federal law enforcement agencies for their .40 and 9mm caliber service rounds, the Ranger Bonded gives you the penetration to handle the most serious of threats.

$30.00 SAME ROUNDS AS THE FAMOUS BLACK TALLONS
2 BOXES- 25 ROUNDS PER BOX– 50 ROUNDS TOTAL
Winchester Supreme Elite PDX1 ammunition was tested by the FBI to see if it can stand up to real world, life threatening situations, this ammunition has impressive expansion and notable velocities at various ranges thanks to Winchester's proprietary bonding process. The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 is available in three calibers – 9mm, .357SIG or .40S&W – offering you the choice that’s right for you."

Two extra magazines.
100 rounds of Remington Golden Bullets, which are the ammo it likes best.

Price is firm. I'm not desperate and I'll keep it before I take a beating on the price.
CPL and WDL required. I will take a photo of them for my own records, but will not report anything to the state. This is in case the gun is stolen from you and used in a crime, so if the police come knocking on my door I can tell them when it left my possession and where it went next. This is non-negotiable. No photo of CPL and ID, no sale."

It's a great optic, but didn't meet my requirements. It is very fast up close, and aids in target identification and engagement at greater distances due to the 1.5x magnification. It is also very good for people who suffer from astigmatism since the circle dot will not blur or smudge like most red dot optics will. Below is from Larue's website:

Trijicon ACOG TA44SG-10 1.5x16 Green Ring & Dot Reticle w/ LT105 QD Mount

Wrapped in a smaller package, at 4.9 ounces, this ACOG is perfect for fast-moving tactical teams operating in close quarters or for speed-oriented competition venues. This very compact model provides weapons like the M16/M4 with excellent fire control capability. Targets are easier and quicker to acquire through the 1.5x16 models because of the larger field of view (7.4 degrees) and eye-friendly design.

The TA44SG comes complete with LT105 QD mount, spare mounting screws with wrench, QD adjustment wrench and Instructions.

(5) 20 round boxes of Hungarian Yellow/Silver Tip.This ammo was made in 1988 which is practically brand new in the world of 7.62x54  ammo. It features a heavy FMJ 182 grain bullet with a steel core.It's loaded in lacquered steel cases giving a pleasant shiny gray look.
The bullet and primer are both sealed with a red lacquer. I've shot a ton of this long ago when it was available and it's some of the very best ammo I've ever used. It's quite accurate, packs a heavy punch and it penetrates like crazy- far more than the light ball steel core ammo available today.The only flaw with this ammo is that recoil is noticeably heavier. Asking $75 for the 100 rounds. 

(5) 20 round boxes Russian made Match Ammo. This ammo was specifically loaded for accuracy. Tolerances are tighter and it uses a match grade propellant. It's brass case with a heavy FMJ 182 grain boat-tail bullet. It was made in 1971, but is bright, shiny and sure fire. It's without a doubt the most accurate ammo of this caliber that I've ever shot and I was able to routinely achieve sub-MOA 5 shot groups with a nice Finnish M27 rifle I used to own. It also performed very nicely in my Mosins and a SVT40. Asking $90 for the 100 rounds. 

(5) 20 round boxes East German M39 7.62x54 ammo. M39 ammo was originally designed as practice/training ammo primarily for machine guns. It's loaded with special black 124 grain FMJ steel core bullet. Velocity is not reduced, and the thought process was that the lighter projectile would travel less far than standard weight bullets. It's definitely not your typical training ammo as it penetrates 1/4"" steel plate with ease at 100 yards. One big benefit is that felt recoil is greatly reduced because of the light weigh 124 grain bullet making it suitable for younger shooters and the ladies. This ammo is nearly impossible to find anymore and I've had it stashed away for many years. Asking $100 for the 100 rounds.

I've owned at least a half dozen Nagant Revolvers over the years and fired them extensively. To me they were always one of the finest surplus handguns ever brought to the states. That said I've always found that the real Russian surplus ammo was the very best shooting ammo. It's clean, dependable and designed specifically for the Nagant. Plus it features a heavier 108 grain bullet with a steel core while the commercially loaded stuff has a lead core 98 grain bullet. Then to me at least the Russian ammo seemed to be loaded noticeably hotter than what you can get from PPU or Fiocchi. I suppose it's a liability issue? The last piece is that the Russian ammo always shot more accurately. The only negative at all is that this ammo does use a corrosive primer so cleaning your gun is a must after using. Listing is for (20) 14 boxes or 280 rounds total. Head stamp is 38-77 meaning it was produced at the Russian State Factory at Yuryusan, Russia in 1977. However it looks like it

I can tell the mags have been loaded but cannot tell if it has been fired. This is a collectors Holy Grail. I know it will take a special buyer. I have included a link to an article from Shooting times about the gun. Below is an excerpt from that article. This is not a 52-1 or 52-2... The 52 no dash was the only gun to go through rigorous testing before it left SW. Do not low ball me. Do not waste my time. According to History of Smith & Wesson by S&W historian Roy Jinks, “To insure the accuracy of the pistol, extra rigid inspection was incorporated by having the Model 52 machine rest tested at 50 yards to insure that the pistol would shoot five-shot groups having maximum spread of two inches. Any pistol that could not meet this standard was returned to production for reworking.” Insistence upon such tight tolerances meant that production was slow, and only 3,500 units were produced by 1963. http://www.shootingtimes.com/2010/09/23/ handgun_reviews_st_swmodel5238_200906/ WILL TRADE FOR: I would trade for a Tavor, Wilson, Colt Anaconda, Les Baer, FN PS90 with ammo...

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface

conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside

and out. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or

phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without

the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it

for many years.

Just because I might think it is over priced doesn't mean that the next guy will. What will I do if I think it is over priced.......I WON'T BUY IT! It's that simple. I don't throw tantrums, act like some juvenile delinquent, stereotype you all and start flagging anything that is even remotely related. Let this free market take care of itself and stop ruining a cool site in the name of the gun community.
That being said, I am offering up some hard to find ammos. However, I am NOT giving it away, and thank you to the flagging freaks, cause when you flag me, I relist. Which puts me at the top of the forum again :)"

I got a remington 700 tactical 20inch heavy barrel. Rifle has 12rds down the tube and it shows. No wear marks on it. Gun looks like new. It has a vortex viper 6-20-44mm on top. Rifle is benchrest accurate. One hole three shot group at 200yrds not 100. Got the target to prove it. Im the only one who has shot the rifle. Seeing if theres something that trips my trigger to trade for. looking for a 1000.00 OBO in trade. got more then that in it. Its a proven shooter which is a big plus. Any way looking for a upper end 1911 in 45 or 9mm. Also looking for a 3 or 4 inch 44mag. would trade with or with out scope. Also could do trade plus cash on your end. Text me a pic of your trade and what you looking for in a deal. I can text back pic of the 308 set up. REDACTED. the way this rifle shoots its a 1000 yrd gun with no problem at all. i have had 3000.00 rifles that didnt shoot quit as tight as this one dose. Let me know what ya got."

This would be a great piece for a collector and with so few of them made, they have tripled in value in recent years and they just continue to go up. I have handed this to friends/ dealers and so far most that have handled this pistol  do not know what it is and it certainly is a conversation piece!
 They made very few of these pistols as they had a poor reputation for a few reasons.  This particular pistol was just received back from Colt for maintenance, work and a recall to address many of those issues.  I have not fired it since I have received it back, however it was test fired at the factory.  *IF* you can find one without all the recall work done, you can find them cheaper.  This one was all serviced at Colt April 2014 and it should be better than new (and more valuable)!

CONDITION:  It is in absolutely top notch condition currently.  It comes with one 15 round magazine. 

HISTORY:
The Colt 2000 or All American 2000 is a polymer or aluminum-alloy framed, locked-breech, rotary bolt, semiautomatic 9mm handgun with a magazine capacity of 15 rounds. Designed by C. Reed Knight (Of Knights Armament) and Eugene Stoner,(Designer of the M16/AR-15) as Colt's entry into the marketplace of the high-capacity polymer framed handguns of the early 1990s; it was believed by Colt that this pistol would recapture their stake in the police market as Police Departments across the United States switched from double-action revolvers to semiautomatic pistols.  It was hoped that sales of this pistol might save the troubled company from bankruptcy on the heels of recovering from the UAW labor strike.

FUNCTIONALITY:  
The Colt 2000's internal workings were based on older firearms designs from the early twentieth century.  The rotating barrel, for example, was based on that of the Steyr 1912 and the roller-locking mechanism was based on a design used by the French Manufacture d'Armes et des Cycles de Saint-Etienne since 1914.  These features allow the barrel and slide to work as a unit moving to the rear until the barrel lug rotates into the cam-block and stops. The barrel lugs then align to allow the slide to continue its travel to the rear and extraction and ejection of the spent round occurs. The pistol breaks down into seven major parts for disassembly.

This is a very good pistol for what it is- a great collector for only $575!  The lowest price in the country on Armlist!

The scope power is adjustable from 3.5-10X and the objective diameter is 50mm. The condition of the rifle is mint. No scratches that I can find on the laminate wood stock either. The laminate wood stock has nice checkering on the grip and forearm, a rubber butt pad, and a raised cheekrest. The optics are beautiful and crisp. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. The rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

Also, I am willing to sell the rifle and mounts seperate from the scope and rings for $625.00. My price is firm and Im not in the market for anything else.

This rifle is for sale in Rockfield, located in Carroll County."

This rifle was constructed in 2014 with 100% mil-spec quality parts. Palmetto State Armory produced the lower receiver frame however I personally put the rifle's parts together. This is NOT a store bought rifle being re-sold after a few uses. This is a brand new rifle that was constructed by me and modified by me to meet certain standards of quality and to have certain features that are NOT featured on store bought rifles.

Keep in mind that Surplus Arms and Ammunition did barrel the upper receiver for me and install the muzzle break but other than that this rifle was built locally by me.

16"" Barrel chambered for 5.56 NATO and .223 Remington loads.

Barrel is threaded and does have a standard A2 flash hider installed. Also, this is NOT a pencil barrel. It's a standard .750"" barrel.

Chrome lined chamber and barrel prevents corrosion and promotes long barrel life.

1 in 7 twist rate keeps heavier bullets stable in flight.

Mid-Length hand guard and gas system (same plane).

Upper receiver is an A3 flat top which is optic ready.

Sling and sling attachment are already installed (not found on most off-the-shelf rifles)!

6 position stock with mil-spec spring and buffer tube.

Mil-spec, MPI tested, phosphate coated BCG.


This rifle has several features you will NOT find with an off-the-shelf AR-15:

Polished feed ramps prevent jamming and other malfunctions with match grade hollow point bullets. This rifle can be used in competition or for hunting where it's legal to do so.

The single stage trigger has had its pull weight reduced from 8 pounds to 6.5 pounds.

Flip up, removable iron sights have already been installed on this rifle and sighted in for 100 yards distance.

Picatinny/Weaver rails have already been installed onto the hand guard allowing the addition of a bi-pod, fore grip, laser/light mount, etc.

This rifle also comes with 5 magazines. You are not going to find retail stores offering 5 magazines with their rifles unless you purchase them separately. I buy my magazines in bulk and can pass on the savings to my customers. They are brand new and still in their original packaging.

The rifle also comes with a carrying case. Some companies offer carrying cases but very rarely. This rifle will come with a nice carrying case that has a shoulder strap, smooth nylon inner lining and the ability to have room for a scope on top of the rifle. Protecting your investment is crucial when hauling it in the back of a car or truck.

Contact me any time if you are interested in taking a look at the rifle. I do have my own shooting range we can use if you are a serious buyer. The range is equipped to handle distances of 200 yards or more and we also have high quality steel targets."
