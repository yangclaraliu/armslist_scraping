Hornady Manufacturing has taken cartridge case cleaning to the next level with the new Lock-N-Load Sonic Cleaner. A combination of intense ultrasonic cleaning action and a unique cleaning solution, One Shot Sonic Clean, provide an extremely effective and efficient method to remove carbon residue and other foreign materials from the entire case. Unlike tumblers, this sonic cleaner quickly cleans the inside of the case as well as primer pockets. The ultrasonic action creates microjets that blast carbon buildup off cases, small gun parts and equipment. The Lock-N-Load Sonic Cleaner can hold up to two hundred .223 cases or one hundred .308 cases. No other cleaning tool on the market even comes close.
This machine has a total of approx. 2 hours run time.

PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj - first Croatian pistol) is a somewhat strange weapon which was hastily developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s. Production and quality of this pistol (which was produced in at least two versions, short-barreled PHP MV 9 and long-barreled PHP VM 17) was sporadic, and it was soon replaced in production and use by much better and more modern HS 2000 pistol.
By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame."

Hello and thanks for taking a look! I have decided to sell my very, very lightly used LNIB SCAR 17s (7.62 NATO/308 Winchester) in black. Less than 100 rounds fired through this beautiful rifle.  If you know anything about the SCAR you know the quality and capabilities of this weapon and they are simply a joy to shoot.

Included with the 17s is all the original stuff including the  box, magazine. I can include a very nice tactical bag for it as well if you wish!

Price is was $2,800 but I'm dropping it to $2,650 which is an incredible deal for this exceptional which.

This gun is in excellent condition. There are no flaws in the wood, and the metal finish is still in excellent condition. These were made in the factory 26, the only Russian supervised factory in China. They came with chrome lined bores, and the notorious SKS slamfire issue was resolved. In my opinion these are the top of the line iof the SKS world. Accurate and very reliable you cannot beat these guns. I fitted this one with a promag 30 rounder (properly) and it will also come with the original 10 round box magazine and sling.

Will also come with 10 boxes of ammunition.

I have kept it from rusting, cleaned it regularly. But other that that, I know very little about the gun. I have not documentation as it was a gift and I did not personally purchase it. I am selling this gun because I only ever shot skeet and I have no need for a long barreled shotgun in an second-story apartment. I would probably cause more spray damage to my home than effectively defending it. The price that I am asking is negotiable so please contact me if you are interested."

***The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. 

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. 

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. 

Comes in a Cammo padded pistol case....This case contains all of its inserts. It contains internal mag pouches, a suppressor pouch, (2) misc pouchs, gun tie down, large document pouch. The case also has an external ID pouch on the rear side of the case. All pouches are fully modular for custom arrangement. The carry handles are full wrap around with handle grabbers at top."

This gun has only been to the range twice for a total of 86 rounds and is in 'like new' condition.  The gun is fun to shoot and the recoil is pretty tame for it being a small 9mm handgun.  I also purchased separately two (2) 7-round magazines with finger extensions, a Barsony brown leather belt holster, and a Barsony brown belt holster for the two extra magazines.  Although there were no problems (FTE's, FTF's, etc.), it's just a little small for me.  Smaller guns take a lot of practice to get good/consistent accuracy, and my shots were all over the place (I think I'll stick with bigger handguns).  The holsters were over 70.00 and the two extra magazines were about 130.00.  I will include all paperwork, case, Sig holster, lock, and everything else it came with.  Thanks for looking! ** I have had this listed for about 6-8 weeks and have had a few offers, but no takers.  The more time passes, the more I'm thinking about keeping the gun (it's kind of growing on me).  So, I'm lowering my price to 800.00 (ABSOLUTE LOWEST).  I will not 'bump' this listing anymore and will remove from armslist in about a week to 10 days (if I remember).  So, this is your last chance to get a pretty good deal on a great little carry piece!!  800.00  FIRM."

Running on 2x LR44 3v Lithium button cells ( included ) it turns on with the flick of the switch; what is normally an SVD scope reticule gains a red colored highlight to be seen in low light. Unlike lower quality scopes, the light does not wash out the tube in low light but in fact limits itself exactly to and no more than just the reticule markings. 

If you have a luxurious SVD-Dragunov, VEPR, PSL, AK, SKS weapon without a scope or just want to splash out on your beloved Soviet styled long rifle then look no further; this has to be the very best scope option out there short of an honest to god real steel SVD scope.

To see pic. Click on other listing.


Mine is new in box, unfired.  No issues with it.  Comes with all normal stuff and 2 mags.


I prefer the Glock OD or FDE color.......the one I really want is like the desert sand color GEN 4, but I am open to any Gen 4.  Might possibly consider a Gen 3 if the right deal.


Mine is stock so does not need to have Night Sights but if it has a trigger job done by gunsmith, that would be great.  If yours has extras like trigger job, extra mags, extended slide release, pinky extensions, we should be able to work something out to make up difference if price is realistic.





Must be FL Resident and legal age, no felons......prefer cwp and FTF only near Clermont............please look it up b4 emailing me.  I will only drive 10-15 minutes to do this which would be the edge of Clermont.





I prefer New with box gun, but possibly open to a very lightly used one.  





I would also consider trading toward an inexpensive AR. By inexpensive I mean under $1200 based on walmart pricing. I have a few other guns I could trade and a bunch of ammo I can trade to even up the deal.  Mostly 9mm ammo and 22lr.  I cant add cash!   

Upper and lower must be same manufacturer please.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.
FEATURES

    100% new-production parts and components.
    Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger
    Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
    Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
    Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.
    AK scope rail.
    Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.)

This SR40 comes with two 15 round magazines, hard carry case, speedloader, lock, and all manuals. 

With all the features of the popular SR9® and the award winning SR9c™, the Ruger SR40® is possibly the easiest recoiling, smoothest shooting .40 on the market.

HIGH-VISIBILITY 3-DOT SIGHT SYSTEM: Rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable and front sight is windage adjustable. 

UNIQUE REVERSIBLE BACKSTRAP (FLAT OR ARCHED) that allows shooters to quickly customize the size and feel of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools.

AMBIDEXTROUS THUMB SAFETY AND D-SHAPED MAGAZINE RELEASE are easy to reach and actuate.

INTEGRAL ACCESSORY MOUNTING RAIL provides space for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. 

OTHER FEATURES: Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9, the SR40’s custom slide design reduces
recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors.

It is pretty much impossible to find anyplace unless you go on gunbroker and are willing to pay about $900-$950 for one. CZ hasn't shipped any new ones in months and no dealers have them.

 This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired. Great gun for the range or home defense. Competition grade.

 It comes with the original hard plastic case plus, the owners manual, certificate from CZ, factory test target and 1 18 round magazine. This model has the decocker.

 Copied from CZ's website:

 The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

 The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

My husband Paul left for military training last week,and he wanted me(his wife) to sell his prized possession, his Colt Law Enforcement M4 in order for us to pay rent for the end of the month. It has never been shot. It comes with Magpul furniture including the Magpul rear flip up sight, and also 2 PMAGS. At some point during the gun scare it was selling for $3,000-$3,500. And again, it is practically brand new since it has never been shot. I will also include a carrying case that came with his other rifle, which is a dual rifle carrying case. I am asking $1,100 Firm.

I'm selling my brand new in box, never fired Springfield XDM-40 (3.8 barrel with Bi-tone finish, and full size 16 round capacity grip). MODEL: XDM9384SHC

I purchased this pistol just a few months ago and have never gotten around to firing it due to busy work schedule. I'd rather sell this pistol than it sit in a box. The gun is genuinely unfired and has never been loaded. I'm happy to have the buyer field strip the pistol to inspect that it has not been fired, except for test shots at the factory.

The buyer will also receive a box of 50 rounds of .40 ammo. I'm also including an extra 16 round magazine (for a total of three 16-round mags) that I purchased along with the pistol.

Not looking for any trades, just for sale only. Text messages or phone calls only....I won't respond to Armslist emails. 
$570 FIRM....this Pistol is $658 new on Buds Gun Shop and are still out of stock.....cash only. Must show valid TN DL to purchase pistol.

Gun History: Received this gun on a trade from the original owner who is in a Army Competition Shooting Team. He said he lazer bore sighted this rifle in at 100 yards, then shot 3 rounds at 100 yards, 3 rounds at 200 yards, and 4 rounds at 300 yards. So rifle only has 10 rounds down the barrel. I have not shot any rounds thru this rifle. Must see to appreciate the wood stock. The gloss finish is in perfect condition. Beautifull gun, I just wont ever shoot it, so I want to sell.
