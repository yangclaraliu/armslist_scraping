Here is what Remington's website says about it.  This gun is NOT the waterfowl edition.:

A morning forecast of sleet and freezing rain sounds great to a serious waterfowl hunter but these tough and demanding hunting conditions chew up and spit out most autoloading shotguns – not ours. Remington has created one of the world’s toughest autoloading, 12-gauge shotguns to meet, beat and thrive in the most extreme hunting conditions. The Model 11-87 XCS Super Magnum features new finishes and features to make it the ultimate shotgun in the duck or goose blind. (Note: The Model 11-87 XCS Super Magnum shotguns are exclusive firearm offerings available only from select wholesalers through independent Remington Premier dealers.)

This gun is based on the proven Model 11-87 Super Magnum action and feature our proprietary, armor-like TriNyte® Corrosion Control System coating on external metal parts for superior corrosion and abrasion resistance. Strenuous scientific testing has proven this durable TriNyte PVD (Physical Vapor Disposition) coating to be the toughest, most durable firearms finish on the market today, perfect for mornings in the mud, stubble of a Midwestern cornfield or the Atlantic’s salty spray. On the XCS, we go one step further and nickel plate all the gun’s internal components, including the bore and magazine tube, to add another level of corrosion resistance - a feature not found on most ordinary shotguns. Though many autoloading designs have trouble digesting different length shotshells, the XCS Super Mag version handles the full range of 12 gauge shotshell sizes from 2 3/4 to 3 1/2-inches. Barrels are proofed for steel shot and the newest generation of heavier-than-lead loads like our high-performance Wingmaster HD™.

The Model 11-87 XCS shotguns utilize the innovative SpeedFeed® I stocks, which keep extra shot shells handy for quick reloading. The stock holds up to four 2 3/4-inch shells or two 3 or 3 1/2-inch shells. A patented Remington recoil pad significantly reduces the felt recoil of hard-hitting, magnum loads. Matching durable, synthetic fore-end provides for positive grip in wet conditions. These guns come equipped with carbon steel 28-inch hammer-forged, vent rib barrels and Improved Cylinder, Modified and Full Rem® Choke tubes are supplied to allow waterfowl hunters to match the pattern to any hunting situation. Rear sling swivel stud and front magazine cap swivel stud provide for easy attachment of the black, padded sling which is included.

The Model 11-87 XCS Super Magnum features an “Overcast Gray” TriNyte finish on the receiver and barrel, complemented by matte black furniture.

The Xtreme Conditions Shotguns are the perfect marriage of the time-proven Model 11-87 action with the best corrosion and abrasion-resistant finish technology has to offer.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

I'm not looking to stockpile, accumulate, or collect in any way. I have seen postings for .22LR offered way above market price and I'm not interested in paying that much. Obviously its scarce so a mark up is understandable but $13 for a box of 50 is ridiculous. I just want to shoot my Sig 522 with friends. It's extremely fun to shoot and is very friendly to new users. I figured this would be seen by enough decent people that maybe someone had an extra box or two they would be willing to part with. Thanks."

The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.

The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The SIGM400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle with unparalleled accuracy. A 16” Nitride treated barrel provides superior corrosion resistance, and a 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability that users come to expect from SIG SAUER. MSRP: $1,234.00

This rifle has been fired (120rds).
Upgrades included a Magpul Tan pistol grip, Magpul Rails, 30rd Magpul Magazine Tan, and a CAA telescopic stock. Also included is (1qty) ACOG 4x32 M4.

The Trijicon ACOG (Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight) is a fixed power, compact riflescope with an illuminated reticle pattern for use in bright to low/no light. The ACOG is designed to be extremely durable and reliable. Combining traditional, precise distance marksmanship with CQB speed, many variants include a bullet drop compensated (BDC) reticle. Every feature of its design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions.

The TA31RCO-M150CP is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the US Army's M4 weapon system. It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Army, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO-M150CP features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included). MSRP: $1,727.00

The upper has between 420 and 840 rounds of Federal XM193 fired through it. Shows minor handling marks and normal marks from mounting optics.

I bought a Mathews Z7 a few months after I bought this crossbow and hunt solely with that. This crossbow has never actually been hunted with, only sighted in. Unfortunately, I paid a lot more than I'm asking for it but, hey, it's used now. I probably only shot it 50 times.

I believe bbl is 6.5” with serrations for scope mount if desired. Nice shooter very comfortable ,I purchased as a sidearm for woods running, varmints rabbit, hedgehog, squirrel, I believe it would drop just about anything of course with proper shot placement and always more fun, challenge with a pistol, again the flat very fast 17 HMR is fun with a bit of range.

It has a 2012 manufacture date, so it is part of the newest generation (that I know of) of SP2022's.  It also has a rail on the front, a hole on the backstrap for a lanyard or ring and a DA/SA action with a de-cocker (there is no safety on this gun).  This means you can either fire the first shot in DA or pull the hammer back for SA.  Gun is in great condition, I purchased it used but have put maybe 60 rounds through it myself.  The gun will come with one 15 round magazine and the case (no ammo included).  The gun is always kept clean with me after each range session and will come pre-cleaned as well.  Reason for selling is that I like to shoot a lot of different firearms and see what's new/cool out there.

The gun has less than 200 rounds through it. No issues, sights are dead-on. These rifles came with a standard AK side-mount rail riveted to the frame. I am including (1) 40-round promag magazine, lightly sanded to fit properly and (2) Tapco 30-round magazines that fit perfect out of the box.

I have to say that the 5.45x39mm round is my favorite. I shoot at a backstop that has 1"" foam on the front and 3/4 inch plywood in the back. Every shot leaves a perfect circle in the foam but keyholes out the plywood. I have only fired silver bear ammo, never corrosive.

I like Glocks, Sigs, Walthers, HK's and Smith and Wesson revolvers. If you have a $500.00 Glock you better have a $100 bill to go with it unless you have extra mags and ammo to sweeten the deal.

This is a brand new set of Chiappa Model 1911-22 Sport Handguns With Wood Grips & Pink Hogue Grips.   These 2 Handguns Have Consecutive Serial Numbers and Are Being Sold As A Set.    Pearce finger grooves have been added also.



Featuring a completely adjustable rear sight, the finish is mat blue with polished sides of the slide. The Chiappa Model 911 is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomaticpistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue side arm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces. In total, the United States procured around 2.7 million M1911s and M1911A1 pistols during its service life. The Chiappa Model 1911-22 features the same weight, and handling characteristics of the original 1911, however, we have redesigned the action utilizing a fixed barrel design yielding very high accuracy at an affordable price. (Less money than most 1911 rimfire conversion kits). The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy* & steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. With both standard and target models available, it is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

The only reason reason I am selling this is because I am moving and need to downsize my collection. (This means I seriously have no room for trades, I will NOT respond to anyone who has trade offers). 

Condition is fair, I carried it daily in a case or holster on my hip or in my purse. I did practice with it a few times, 200 rounds or less has been through it. The only flaws are cosmetic flaws, when these green LCRs were released, only a number were released in green, you will not find this again easily. They were also Duracoated, versus what we use now Cerakoting. I took pictures of where the Duracoat is wearing, but the wear is only behind the frame, behind the wheel and extreme little wear on the nose. 

All in all, condition is fair, surface cosmetic defects, no function damage or defects, works like a charm. 

Do not email me about condition since I have already explained it in full, with photos included, I will not respond. 

The front sight is in-fact aftermarket that I have installed. It is a day time/night time glow dot sight that increased accuracy by at least 50%. The brand is XS sights.

Everything in the picture is included, IWB holster by DeSantis and original soft zip case.
