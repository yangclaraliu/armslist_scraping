As I said it's a gas piston AR15 rifle with a cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with NiCorr surface conversion process.  The. Spiral fluting shaves 20 percent  of the weight of the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally  fluted barrels.  The SPR features the enhanced fire control group.   This is really a MUST SEE look up the reviews it really is the Best out there and when I get the floor done I'll get another one.

Has a leather sling, but it is showing it's age.
This rifle was estimated to be a 1941 model - however, it still cycles beautifully and is a wonderful, smooth shooter.

Back of stock is a little discolored due to the old guard on it - was falling apart, so I removed it, but the stock is still in great shape.

Lever action cycles through 5 rounds without any hanging too.
I had inherited it from my uncle when he passed and I honestly love this firearm and shooting it, but I don't hunt and really believe it needs to go to someone who will use it as it was intended.

This safe is heavy = 950 lbs.
It's heavier than other safes its same size because of the fire rating duration = 95 minutes at 1200° F.
Two LED light strips work.

You'll see that Costco sells this for $3,000, which is where I bought it.

This safe is discounted because the outlet on the backside is dented out of shape, but still works because the power cable was trimmed to fit the shape. The battery cover/holder on the electronic lock is also missing. I called Sports Afield and they said a new entire lock would be shipped for free to whoever registers the warranty (I didn't use the warranty). I don't have the owners manual either.

I'm selling because I don't need this heavy or large of a safe right now; I bought a smaller safe.

Here's Costco's website:

Took me plus two guys to move it on and off a motorcycle trailer, although I believe you can remove the door, which is around 1/3 of the weight, which would make moving it easier.

I have used it for 'live' Iaido exercises however I acquired another sword for that purpose before I had the chance to use this one. I have periodically removed the sword to clean it; other than that it has been on display in my house. The Sword weights 2lb 7oz. The blade is forged and differentially hardened (HRC60 edge, HRC40 back) and the hamon is prominent but etched. The Practical Plus Elite features genuine Rayskin on the Tsuka with a tightly-woven Tsuka-Ito. The long tang is double-pegged for security. The blade is traditionally proportioned to appeal to the collector but it will also perform well in general cutting of hard or soft targets. The blade length is 28.5"", handle is 11.5"", and point of balance is at 5 1/2"". The width at guard is 1.39"", at tip is 1.03"", thickness at guard 0.26"" and thickness at tip 0.16"". The Sori is 3/4"".  The fittings of the Practical Plus are decorated in a Japanese Dogwood motif with dragon menuki, and the handsome Tsuba is of an iron “sunburst” design with a brass habaki. There are a lot of names for this type of tsuba (sunburst, wheel,….) and it’s claimed by Hanwei to be an old, original tsuba (museum piece). 

The sword also comes with a cleaning kit with the sword cleaning elements. The box was cracked, but I re-glued it.

Replica Irish Hand and Half Sword Ring Pommel or Galloglass Sword - Price $165 plus shipping
The term Galloglas (or ""Gallowglass"") is an Anglicisation of the Irish, Gallóglaigh (""foreign soldiers""), incorporating the word, Óglach, which is derived from oac, the Old Irish for ""youths"", but later meaning ""soldier"".  These swords were brought to Ireland by Scottish mercenaries from the 13th through the 16th century. They were noted for wielding the two handed Sparthe axe (a custom noted by Geraldus Cambrensis to have derived from their Norse heritage) and broadsword or claymore (""claíomh mór"").
This Irish Hand & A Half features a sharpened carbon steel blade with heavy duty full length tang, wood grip with leather wrap and steel guard and ring pommel. The good balance and light weight make this a quick and deadly weapon.
This sword offers a great compromise between durability and weight. It is made for strength. They test them on 2x4s and telephone poles! As well as in direct steel to steel tests. It's not recommended, but it's always nice to know it could.

Used very little.  This was my wife's every day carry pistol until she decided to go with a Glock 36.  

This was purchased back in August, taken to the range a few times (if I had to guess, probably 400 rounds, perhaps 450 through it) and we've had absolutely no problems.  Reloads have never been shot through this pistol.

Comes with original box, lock, paperwork, a sticky holster and a new 50 round box of ammo.

This laser can be fitted to binoculars, rails, and even scopes. When in line with crosshairs at night, you pretty much have something similar to night vision! It's great for hunting at night and it doesn't spook the animals as much at night due to the fact that it emits a green laser. I've used it a handful of times but since I won't be hunting as much, I don't have a need for it anymore. I have everything that it came with as well as the original box plus the receipt to prove what I had paid for it. Since I bought it $249.99 new, I will ask $200.00 for it.

The problem is I would rather have military surplus rifles. So I have over 2,000 22lr (most 100 rd cci ), 1,700 rounds of 9mm fmj ( 350 of which are steel case) 440 rounds of brass 223 and 800 or so steel case Tulammo.

I can do partial trades mix and match or whatever. Before someone asks, no, I don’t want to sell a couple boxes. The only reason I’m parting with the ammo is to further my collection. If you inflate the price of your gun, over the current market rate, than expect that I will follow suit.  Located in Louisville Ky and willing to travel short distances. **** Please do not ask me to sell the .22 if I can not find any trades I may re list some of the ammo for sale****

This is not a $2000 gun but I'm not asking $2000.  Well built parts that don't carry trendy name-tags will serve the general shooter very well.  Add a SHTF gun to your safe, run, gun and have fun without worrying about scratching your more-expensive-than-a-used-car showpiece.  Add your optic/sights and use my ammo to get sighted in.  I'll keep the scope mount if you don't want it.  

I'll travel almost anywhere west of I-5 between Salem and Astoria as long as you will meet me half way.  Portland metro is OK, east of Troutdale gets harder.  Bring an OR ID/CHL and be willing to sign a bill of sale for my records only.  $800 for everything or $750 without the mount.  I'll trade straight for a BNIB Remington 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD.  For the right person, that trade could result in you making money.  No other trades, save your breath.  Looking forward to hearing from you."

Full size 1911 with 5"" barrel. 

I am the first and original owner.

This is by far the most accurate handgun I own. It is also incredibly smooth and reliable. The slide racks like it's on ball bearings. I fired approximately 500 rds of 230 grain factory ammunition out of this pistol consisting of Federal, Remington FMJ ammo and Federal Hydra-Shok hollowpoint ammo. It fed the FMJ and Hollowpoint ammo without a hiccup. Never had a single jam or misfire, even during the 'break-in' process. This is the most reliable 1911 I have ever owned. I will send you as much pictures as you want to see . I will Ship if buyers accept 50 for shipping . I will Accept Bank tranfer, usps or western union money order .

The pistol is in excellent condition and has been well cared for. It is still tight but somewhat broken in. Comes in the original box with all of the original accessories including the take-down wrench, paperwork, patch and instruction manual. 

Comes with 2 sets of grips: the original Baer Premium Checkered Cocobolo wood grips and also a set of Hogue Wraparound Rubber Grips with Finger Grooves. It also comes upgraded with 2 Wilson Combat 47D 8-rd Stainless Steel Magazines. 

You'll look a long time to find a real custom pistol at a price this low. Baer's Custom Carry is perfectly suited to home defense, duty use or weekend plinking. Like all Baer pistols, it's guaranteed to shoot 3 inch groups at 50 yards. Features include:

Baer NM frame, NM slide and NM barrel with stainless bushing • Baer deluxe fixed combat sight • Baer dovetail front sight, improved ramp style Trijicon night sights • Double serrated slide • Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe hammer and sear • Baer tactical style extended ambi safety • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Tuned extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop • Lowered and flared ejection port • High checkered front strap @30 lpi • Tuned for total reliability • All corners rounded for tactical carry • Flat serrated mainspring housing"

It fits in a backpack. 

But what makes this M92 special is the Midwest Industries handguard installed. It’s a quad-rail and accepts all modern rail attachments, including long eye relief optics in place of the standard sights. The recoil spring has also been replaced with an Extra Power Recoil Spring, noticeably reducing recoil. I’ve also added a Hogue grip that is super comfortable. 

I am the original owner, and this pistol comes with original box and owner’s manual. I’ve only fired ONE magazine through it (of brass-cased ammo, no less, cause I'm OCD), so the round count is exactly 30, after which it was promptly detail-stripped and cleaned obsessively. Surprisingly accurate and recoil is VERY manageable. She has been kept in a silicone impregnated sleeve inside a desiccant dehumidified safe her entire life. 

It’s an outstanding firearm. I'd be willing to meet up just so you can hold it in your hands and cycle it a few times. You'll fall in love, as I did.

Comes with four 30-round magazines, fore-grip, a recoil buffer, and a ""conversion kit"" bought at the last gun show but has not been installed(79.99)

NO TRADES please! And Tulsa area! Thanks as always"
