The mum is in decent shape. It's been slightly defaced like most, but not severely.  I was going to restore this rifle but I just don't have the time right now and I could use the cash instead. 

I got it on trade. I've shot one box of soft points through it and it is a tack driver. It' doesn't kick very bad. Kind of like a .270. It's very light because it's been sporterized. Honestly, this is a perfect deer hunting package for anyone looking for something to hunt with this year but doesn't have a lot of money to spend.

This is a smaller camper with three beds. One end slides out for a twin bed. The other end slides out for a full size bed, and the dinette converts quickly into a full size bed.
The propane stove functions. The camper does have a heater, but I have no idea if it works or not. We have never attempted to run it. The hand pump sink needs some work on the seals as it quit pumping last year.
Here is the biggie. One of the leaf springs broke on our last trip. Kettlesen Campers said they should be able to match it with a used one for about 50 bucks if you bring the spring in. In the meantime, there is a temporary repair in place that allowed me to tow it back to Denver, from up in the mountains.
The canvas has had a few repairs, but it has no leaks, and has always kept us dry and out of the elements.
Running lights all working. Tires will get you home and that's about it. They need to be replaced.
We are located between Denver and Aurora, near Iliff and Parker Road.

Beretta PX4 Storm Inox Information from Beretta.com:

The Px4 Inox brings a fresh look and unique style to the Px4 family. Starting from a solid bar of stainless steel, the slide is bead blasted to a smooth satin finish, ensuring a non-reflective surface that is highly resistant to the elements (barrel is black). Mated to the highly refined, techno-polymer reinforced fiberglass frame, the Px4 Inox is optimized for use in the most challenging environments.Together they create a two-tone finish that is not only practical and functional, but distinctly attractive.These features make the Px4 Inox perfectly suited to humid climates or harsh environments.The Inox continues to maintain the proven features of the Px4 line of pistols.The three interchangeable backstraps make fitting most shooters with different sized hands quick and easy.The magazine release is easily changed to accommodate both right- or left-handed shooters, and the unparalleled reliability of the in-line feeding system keeps the Inox running shot after shot.The Px4 Inox epitomizes functional elegance for the most demanding shooter.

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.

The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.

1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.

2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.

4. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.

5. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.

6. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individualâs hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.

7. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.

8. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.

9. Barrrel: The Px4âs unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

Item Description: Okay, up for sale or trade is my freshly built AR-15. I built this as a challenge during the height of the panic just to see if I could, I know I won't break even, but I am asking what i feel is fair based on what's included and the current economic climate. If I am way off, please let me know as I don't to offend, being a new member here. Anyways, here is the build info:
I have built this gun and never fired it.
Stag Lower -- $140
PSA MOE LPK (moe grip, trigger guard) -- $90
PSA M4 Premium Upper CL 1/7 flat top -- $450
MOE carbine length handguards -- $28
MVG MOE vertical grip -- $13
MOE stock with Armalite buffer tube assembly -- $140
Magpul ASAP Plate -- $22 (i think)
R Guns m16 BCG -- $120
PSA Charging Handle -- $12
6 P-Mags (black) -- $70
1 10 round bushmaster magazine -- $10
MBUIS rear site -- $48
AimPoint PRO optic -- $395
Will include 4 p-mags full of ammo (some green tip and some standard brass) -- $60
All Magpul Parts are genuine magpul and not the airsoft versions. I have the packaging to all magpul parts as well if you want them.

All said and done I think i have right around $1600 +/- a little into the build and accessories and ammo, and as I stated, I know I will never get that back. I can however take away accessories to adjust the price if it doesn't sell as a package. All parts were brand new other than the AimPoint. It was used on another rifle that I upgraded to a micro, but it has a brand new battery.

So yeah, offer away. I have a few pictures now, and will upload some more when I get back home. Please PM with any questions. Would prefer to sell, but I am open to some trades as well. Partial trades are good to. I've always wanted a 686. Cash however, is ultimately desired. And if you are worried about me being a new member, I will gladly answer any questions over the phone or via email or text or send any sort of verification you may desire.

It is pictured with a windowed P-Mag, I traded those to my dad for some non windowed ones. Here are a few photos of the gun and as I stated, more will follow Tuesday evening when I return home. Reason for selling is we just moved and other things have piqued my interest other than owning multiple AR-15's at the current time!"

651,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2018651,For Sale:  SOLD -- 7.35 Carcano Ammo,"Grey Forest (NW of SA), San Antonio, Texas",$ 160,"Listed On: Sunday, September 22, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"here is a combination of original military and later commercial ammunition, loaded for the Italian 7.35 Carcano.

The military ammunition includes 108 rounds in the original military cardboard packaging with cotton straps. 90 rounds are in five 20-round brass stripper clips, one of which has only ten rounds left. There are also 18 rounds in three of the 6-round clips used in the rifles.

The other 80 rounds are four boxes produced by Old West Scrounger, Inc. They are all soft point bullets, of different sizes: 40 rounds are 125-grain, 20 rounds of 147-grain and 20 rounds of 164-grain. The shell casings are reformed from other calibers since the original shell casings are not reloadable (Berdan primed). The casings for this ammunition were formed from Remington .303 British and Norma 6.5x54 brass.

It should go without saying that this ammunition is old stock, apparently produced shortly before WW2, and may not be as reliable as modern, recently-produced ammunition. You assume all risk of its use should you decide to attempt to fire it.

Prefer a face-to-face deal for cash somewhere in the NW SA area. I'd be willing to ship it on your dime, but be warned, shipping ammo is expensive.

Start with a two-die set from RCBS - a decapper & full-length sizing die; and a bullet seating & crimp die. They are in excellent used condition. RCBS shellholder #9 or an equivalent shellholder from another manufacturer is necessary to use these dies, but is not included in this deal. Though not visible in the picture, a reloading chart in the die case does include someone's (not my) load data that you may wish to use as a starting point.

Next are 70 shell casings. These are reformed from other calibers since the original shell casings are not reloadable (Berdan primed). These casings were formed from Remington .303 British and Norma 6.5x54 brass. Nineteen casings are once-fired and 51 are new.

Finally, there are 145 of the fairly-rare 0.298"" diameter bullets for this cartridge. These are 150-grain soft-point bullets, and they show some discoloration from age and handling, but should work as intended, and could be tumbled to improve them cosmetically if desired.

I prefer a face-to-face deal for cash somewhere in the NW SA area. I'd be willing to ship it on your dime.

I have 188 rounds of loaded ammunition for this same caliber listed separately, so take a look at my other listings if that'd interest you."

Only taken to the range once, it's in perfect condition. I really need $350 for this to help with some recent financial problems. 

Benelliâs SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun sight. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isnât just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

The SuperNova Tactical comes with either rifle sights or newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights. The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. Optional three-dot tritium inserts can be easily installed. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. Butt stock options include a tactical pistol grip stock, or the ComforTechÂ® stock. The top of the SuperNovaâs receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics.

I have a Springfield Armory 1911 loaded in stainless with trijicon night sights and 4 magazines for sale. It has the factory wood grips and VZ ""linen"" grips as well. The VZ grips are a grayish color. I also installed the finger swells under the grips. The rear of the slide was machined by the same gunsmith that does the SWAT's stuff up in Virginia to accept the Trijicon night sights. The sights still glow extremely bright. Two of the four magazines are Wilson Combats. The gun comes in the original box as well. It probably has around 250 rounds through it and was cleaned after every trip. No trades.

I have 100 rounds of federal HST HP that I will make a good deal on if bought with the gun.

Gun is in excellent condition, with a excellent bore/chamber, and a smooth action.  The adjustable trigger on this rifle is far superior to any other manufacturers in my opinion.  Much lighter and crisper.

This is a sweet little gun used mainly for recreational target shooting.  It has been out to 400 yards, and for the price of these guns they are phenomenal shooters.  With cheap factory loads I was getting 1 1/4"" groups out of it at 100,  once I started developing some loads for it.  That number dropped down to 3/4"" or better and stayed there.  With solid handloads this gun really shines.  I hate to see her go, but I have my eye on bigger things (.338 Lapua) and simply do not have room for it.

Asking $375 or best offer."

I am taking a loss on this upper and am mainly just selling to cover the cost of a new standard BCM upper and bolt. This upper is a steal considering its a colt and has less than 100rds through it with a troy sight and rail.

Barrel nut had antisieze applied to it by the gun smith to avoid any future issues with barrel removal. This is a solid upper, I just miss my standard issue plain upper.

http://www.surefire.com/illumination/weaponlights/handgun/x400-led-weaponlight.html

The SureFire X400 combines a brilliant white light with a bright red laser aiming device in one WeaponLight. A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light--enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision--for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses NylokÃÂ® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger.
