This gun spent almost it's entire life in a gun safe and then I bought it a few years ago to shoot clays. I have put about 1500 rounds through it and it functions flawlessly, as you'd expect from Beretta. Mechanically it is perfect. There are numerous very minor safe dings in the wood, but very light and nothing through the finish. The wood as you can see, is obviously custom and was added after the original owner bought the gun, It is spectacular to say the least. The wood is worth at least $800-$900 from Coles. When I bought the gun, I had Jack Concannon install a kickeez recoil pad, mercury recoil reducer in the buttstock and open up the forcing cone. I also bought 4 Briley extended chokes which will go with the gun. It shoots great and with the improvements, very comfortably. I just don't shoot anymore - 3 times in the last 2 years. I am asking $1500 cash OBRO.

It runs on a 7.2V rechargable battery that is self contained inside the buttstock and it drives an electric motor which cocks the spring mechanism with a push of a button, which is located on the trigger guard just behind the trigger.  There is an 'on-off' main switch located on the pistol grip area of the stock which turns the main power on.  Once the battery is fully charged, it can run approx. 300 shots before recharging again.  Another unique feature is the loading port, which is located on top of the fixed barrel, it flips open and there is a generous loading area where you can place a pellet into it, then just close the port cover.  The trigger is electronic, with no creep, no over travel, and has an automatic safety as well.
This was only imported into US by Browning for a very short time during the 80's and I had it kept in the back of the safe, only test fired a few dozen times.
It has a beautiful walnut stock with a nice rubber buttplate and very fine micro-meter, interchagable front sights and adjustable rear sight.  This is complete with box, extra front sight inserts, etc. in like new condition, with the factory AC charger.
Besides being a highly collectible Browning, it is also a very fun shooting, nicely build air rifle that is unique and classy at the same time."

The rifle is in pristine condition.  The sale includes a Swiss Products clamp on scope mount and a Weaver K4-1 scope with rings.  Also included is a leather sling, muzzle cover, and 50 rounds of GP-11 7.5 x 55 ammo.  You have everything you need to head right for the range.

The K31 is considered by many to be the most accurate of all of the WWII era surplus rifles.  This rifle is no exception.  The bore is bright and shinny just like most of these rifles.  The beech stock looks very nice with only very minor dings and scratches.  The serial numbers match and indicate a 1949 year production date.  Overall the metal parts look great with minimal pitting or corrosion.  

In addition to the rifle you get a Swiss Products clamp on scope mount.  Remove one bolt and you have the rifle in original unmarred condition.  Reattach the scope quickly with the same bolt and the scope maintains zero.  This mount also allows you to use the iron sights with the scope in place, so there would rarely be reason to remove it.

The scope is the excellent Weaver K4-1 with a duplex reticle and micro trac adjustments.  This reticle is great for hunting or target shooting since it allows quick target pickup with the precision of fine cross-hairs in the center of the optics.  The optics are clear and the bluing on the scope itself is good with only minor scratches.

This would make a great hunting setup.

Also included is 50 rounds of Swiss GP-11 surplus 7.5x55 ammo.

Looking for a FTF cash transaction.  Since this rifle is on my C&R listing, I will need to see a driver's license for the purchase.  Additional photos are available upon request."

It is for a 12ga action, and is left handed, with a left hand palm swell, and left hand cast and toe out.

This stock came off a wide/competition/heavy frame gun, but will fit any generation of the above mentioned models, the sides of the stock will be slightly proud if used on a lightweight action. Any questions feel free to ask.

The stock does have a Danuser counter coil installed, as well as a fully adjustable recoil pad adjuster, and a flat Pachmayr Tank Tread recoil pad.

The Countercoil does need to be rebuilt. Last I checked, this was under $70 including return shipping from Danuser. Or you can just remove the unit and use it without.

Stock bolt is included.

Very good shape. Minor bumps and bruises, but overall, very solid with no chips, cracks, or splits.

As with any shotgun wood, fitting by a competent gunsmith may be required.

The LOP with everything as shown, and once the countercoil is repaired, will be 14"". The LOP with JUST a 1"" pad will be 12 3/8"". DAC is 1.4"", DAH is 1.5"" (very nearly parallel comb). I believe this was an international trap stock, as the comb is more parallel than a skeet/field/sporting stock would be.

$250

Just to have a Countercoil installed on YOUR stock will cost $60 more than that, and wouldn't include the pad, adjuster, or obviously the stock."

The gun is used but in excellent condition with a low (approx 500) round count, and features a custom green & tan finish (very cool looking). This is the model that accepts 92FS magazines, and includes 1 preban 30 round magazine, TRUGLO Red-Dot 30MM TRI Color optics w/ pressure switch, factory hard case & original paperwork.

Only flaw I can find is some wear in the finish on the inside of the stock, behind the grip (see picture). This is from the way it sits in the factor hard case.

This is a really fantastic gun - lightweight, easy to manipulate, very accurate and a joy to shoot. The availability of high cap mags is a big bonus, plus the compatibility with the 92FS is nice if you have one. I bought it as a home defense rifle for my wife, but I ended up with two and need to sell off one of them.

Asking $795 cash, O.B.O. May be open to trades or trades + cash. Contact via PM. Exchange to be completed FTF on an FA-10 in the greater Boston/metrowest area. Buyer must have valid MA LTC. All laws to be followed.

Please don't contact me and ask ""is it still available"" or ask me to call you. If you contact me about the rifle, either say ""I'll take it,"" or make an offer, or ask a question."

I bought this brand new, shot 20 rounds through it, and put it in the safe. It is in perfect shape, absolutely no flaws, and it comes with two mags, box, instructions, an IWB and OWB holster, and cable lock. I have many other Sigs, and don't shoot this one.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with it- it's a beauty. I have it for sale locally ($800- I have a $1000 in it, but I know that I will take a loss), but I am also interested in the right trade. I have been looking for a 220 Carry (it would have to be in similar condition and value), and I would also be interested in the right 229, 228, 226, 227, or a 239 SAS in 40 or 357.
I want to be clear- I am interested in cash, but I would also be even happier to trade for the right Sig. I am not interested in any other makes, and I would only trade for a Sig that is comparable in condition- I don't want to trade a virtually new gun for something with wear and tear. I am only interested in a face to face transaction, I have a valid VA drivers license and concealed permit and expect you to, and I am not interested in driving more than two hours for a trade. I live in the Shenandoah Valley near Staunton. Contact me with what you have, and I will consider it. Don't get offended if I don't want to trade- I have other Sigs, love them, and while I have enjoyed owning this 1911, I am looking for the next joy. This isn't a have-to, but a want-to. If I don't sell it or find the right trade, I'll just keep it.
So, to put it in a nutshell, 1911 for sale but even more interested in a trade, $800 value, face to face, particularily interested in a 220."

Selling my NEW NEVER FIRED Mossberg 715t that still has it's original mag/paperwok/lock/etc..SEALED IN PLASTIC! Purchased an additional 6 Mossberg FACTORY (NOT Chinese/Korean knock-offs) 25 round mags (the original still sealed in its original plastic equals 7).  Has the picatinney rail mounted on the ""carry handle"" for the mounting of a scope (of which I believe I have a decent .22LR scope laying around that I can include in the deal). As well as a hard shell case to carry it all in.

I am attaching a picture of the rifle and mags, ALONG WITH the receipt SHOWING that I did indeed purchase the mags NEW, and that they are indeed factory Mossberg 25 rounders that totaled just South of $200 for all (and I am NOT including shipping in that as you will see that the shipping was free).

At $500 I am STILL LOSING MONEY on this deal considering the the amount paid for the rifle (which you can inspect to your hearts delight, the ONLY bullet that ever traveled down that barrel would have been the Q&A Test Fire from the factory), mags, case & if I throw in a scope even more.  The rifle is less than 4 months old.  Reason for selling is that I already have a built Ruger 10/22 that I have already invested $$$ in, and the 715t is simply just taking up valuable safe space, and as it is now I simply just do not have the time to shoot all that I own, so this landed on the chopping block. 

Sorry folks I know that money is tight for many of us out there, but I must stay with $500 FIRM. Or a straight trade, or trade +cash that is SLIGHTLY IN MY FAVOR since I am already taking a loss here.  This rifle hasn't so much as a single scratch on it. Went from box, to cleaning, to safe and that is where it has stayed. Hasn't even seen the day of light yet."

This has no more than 300 rounds. It comes with the box and all of the original parts.
-The slide stop has been upgraded by the newest factory piece to give it a better reset. The original ones had an indistinct reset and they made their new M&Ps more like the Shield reset. 
-The front sight has been replaced with a night sight
-the rear sight has been replaced with a 10-8 black U-notch (non night sight). The U is meant to draw your eye to a natural sight picture.
There is some mild holster wear on the slide. The Smith finish quite frankly isn't as nice as Glocks. If you look at the breech face, you can tell there aren't many rounds through it. I put a very mild polish on the feed ramp (by hand).

I will include one factory 12 round magazine and one 12round+5rd extension for $425

I also have a 17 round full size M&P9 magazine with a grip cover to fit the compact (it fits super nicely, feels just like a full size grip). I will also include a Blackhawk Serpa holster with paddle and belt configuration. 

****The cost with these additions is $480
