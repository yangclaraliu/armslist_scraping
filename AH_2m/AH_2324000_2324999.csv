Glock Gen 3 Model 22; 40 caliber handgun; plus a nice set of extras!

EXTRAS INCLUDE:
9mm ported conversion barrel (Lone Wolf Distributors, $119)
2 Glock OEM 15-round mags
1 aftermarket 31-round mag, has a +2 on it, (29 +2)  ($49)
OEM Glock easy loader
Original Glock case
Owners Manual
OEM Cleaning rod
Partial box (15rnds; 20-rnd box is $25 at Gander Mtn) Hornaday Critical Defense Ammo (I own no other 40 cals so I'll throw this in)

Round count through 40cal bbl is very low (100 or less?)
Mostly shot it as a 9mm (250 ?)
Pistol was carried (vehicle gun) more than it was shot.
Does show handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks in the black finish, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. They are ""swirlys"" from carry in a Kydex holster (already sold in a separate listing). Please note the finger index mark on the trigger guard on side opposite ejector port. This is a 101% reliable, great shooter grade/carry gun, but it's not a show piece! (Do you expect a show piece from a Glock???)

For the whole setup, $475 should be a fair price. With the accessories, that's roughly $375 for the pistol itself, $50 for the 9mm barrel, and $50 for an extra 15-rnd OEM Glock mag, an extra aftermarket 29-rnd mag, an aftermarket +2 mag extension, and a partial box of expensive self defense ammo . . . should be a GOOD DEAL !"

This pistol is in great condition and has had approximately 300-400 rounds through it.  It's been a very reliable pistol.  The only thing that I've noticed which I can point out is some discoloration at the base of the magazines, as can be seen in the photos.

The pistol has the original box and paperwork, the original trigger lock with padlock, and has Trijicon night sights.  There are a total of four magazines, the factory 7 round which was never used, and three six round magazines.

Included with the pistol is a Don Hume (leather) inside the waistband holster, and a DeSantis Superfly pocket holster.  I'm also including a small nylon knife pouch which I used as a covert magazine pouch on my belt.  In the time that I carried this pistol I don't believe that anyone even noticed the extra magazines on my belt.

If you've got questions please ask.  Additional photos  and info upon request.

I will meet face to face for a sale if the buyer is willing to sign a bill of sale and provide a copy of a valid Florida CWP.  I will also have my FFL ship to your FFL at your expense upon receipt of payment.

If the ad is still up I've still got the pistol for sale.

Sorry, I'm not interested in trades at this time."

This is the best sword you will find in the price range. Ever heard a picture can speak a thousand words!!!! Look a the pics again!! What else can I say about this stunning work of art hand crafted in the traditional method. This sword starts out as a 12"" block of thick hard outer steel with soft inner core as in pictures. Soft core allows flexible sword and hard 1095 steel on outer edge for razor sharp edge! This is a much more expensive method called (Kobuse) and is heated, Hammer forged and clay tempered to length. Then it goes through several steps to grind and sharpen then hand polished out as you see it in the pics. The result is Amazing! This truely is a collectors item but is Fully Functional and Battle Ready! Even the Tsuba(hand guard) is hand forged which truely makes each of these swords unique as none are the exact same! The Detail on the one piece brass Tsuba is amazing. I work directly with a forge that will hand make this exact sword with all the hardware and clay tempering once you purchase it.

Taurus Model 605 .357 Magnum Revolver, 2in bbl, 5-Shot, Stainless, RARE PRE-LOCK !

1993 (94?) vintage; Pre-frame lock model ! ! ! I bought this new in 93 or 94. It was made WAY before the integral frame lock models came out. Round count is very low for its age, maybe 400? Pistol was carried a lot more than it was shot.

Shows some very light handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. No rust, well maintained.

I bought this so long ago, I no longer have the box/manual. So I will deliver it to buyer in a Mil-tec Holster w/ 4 ammo loops. You can get a manual free from Taurus, I can even download one for you and deliver it with the handgun if desired.

You don't see vintage PRE-LOCK guns of this type for sale very often, $350 should be a fair price. They go for $430 new on gunbroker, plus shipping, plus a transfer fee, maybe plus tax depending on where you are. But this PRE-LOCK model is PREMIUM compared to the new ones!"

The Vz.2008 Sporter is a semi-auto rebuild of the original Czech Vz.58 assault rifle, which has been in use for over half a century. This rifle has a milled receiver, last-round BHO, and metal side folding buttstock.

The Vz.58 has been the standard issue assault rifle of the Czech military since the late 1950s. It was designed primarly after the AK-47 but with a milled receiver and about a pound lighter. However, about all it has in common with the AK is its 7.62x39mm caliber. In all other ways, the Vz.58 is a unique weapon.

It features a milled receiver, lightweight barrel, short-stroke gas system (similar to that found in the FN FAL or SKS), tilting locked breech, and last-round bolt hold open device. Even though it has a milled receiver, the Vz is over a pound lighter than even a stamped receiver AKM. Its magazines are also made of a lightweight alloy; as weight was of prime concern to the developers. It is also shorter/more compact than the AK.

The Century Vz.2008 Sporter is built from original Czech mfg parts, using a newly made US milled receiver and 16"" long threaded barrel. All other parts are original, including the furniture, bolt group, gas system, sights, dustcover, and more. It can feed from original surplus magazines and does feature the BHO. It has all of the military features including bayonet lug, threaded barrel with muzzle brake, and sling swivals. This particular rifle has an original Czech metal right side folding buttstock, which when folded, makes the weapon extremely compact.

This gives you the same frame, grip, trigger, slide action, holster and everything from your XD but allows you to use 22LR ammo instead of the pricier 9mm ammo for practice or small game hunting.

A description of the USP follows.

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The USP is available in nine trigger/firing mode configurations and three calibers. 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release"

OPERATING SYSTEM: Gas trap/piston operation, rotating bolt (short stroke system), reversible gas piston for suppressed or non-suppressed operation. Unlike some other ""op-rod"" systems, on the HOGAN gun, op-rod springs have been eliminated due to possible damage and system failure during sustained firing of the gun. The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system. Each piece of operating system is hard chrome plated and/or melonite heat treated making them almost self lubricating and act as non stick surfaces making them easy to clean and maintain.

Very nice Browning rifle with BOSS system (both ported and non-ported).  Very smooth, great condition with a shiny bore, no rust, always well maintained and functions like new.  Comes with Burris scope rings.    Price is $500 or best offer.

Description:
With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.

Barrel
The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.

Trigger
A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.

Magazine
Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine."

OPERATING SYSTEM: Gas trap/piston operation, rotating bolt (short stroke system), reversible gas piston for suppressed or non-suppressed operation. Unlike some other ""op-rod"" systems, on the HOGAN gun, op-rod springs have been eliminated due to possible damage and system failure during sustained firing of the gun. The HOGAN gun system has been designed and manufactured to greatly decrease/eliminate heat, carbon build-up, gas leaks, fouling and wear/tear on operating parts which can have an adverse effect on an operating system. Each piece of operating system is hard chrome plated and/or melonite heat treated making them almost self lubricating and act as non stick surfaces making them easy to clean and maintain. Operates in semi-automatic, but can be made full-auto for Military and Law Enforcement.

Spike's Tactical Lightweight .223/5.56x45 caliber Complete Upper Receiver assemblies for AR15/M16 type Rifles. These rifles feature a 14.5"" Light Weight barrel with permanently attached DynaComp muzzle break for 16"" total length and Spike's 12"" BAR 4 Rail Free Float Handguard. Complete Upper receiver assembly.

Specifications:

    Spike's Tactical M4 flat top upper receiver, Machined from a 7075 T6 Mil-Spec Forging with Mil-Spec Type III Hard coat Anodized finish, T-markings, Spike’s logo and M4 feed ramps.
    Barrel is certified MIL-B-11595E CMV.  Bolt & barrel are HPT/MPI tested, M4 barrel extension, Chrome chamber and bore, 5.56mm Nato chamber, 1:7 Twist, Magnetic particle testing on every barrel, Phosphate finish.
    Lightweight (Pencil) Profile with Mid-length gas system.
    Barrel is Phosphate finished under the .625 pinned gas block.
    The M16 carriers are Chrome lined with a Mil-Spec phosphate finish.
    Forged Mil-Spec carrier key, Chrome lined, attached with Grade 8 hardware and Properly staked.
    HP/MP Tested Bolt, Each extractor is fitted with a Mil-Spec black insert and Mil-Spec Viton o-ring.
    Spike's Tactical 12"" BAR 4 Rail Free Floating Handguard.
    Pinned Spike's Tactical DyanComp Muzzle Break.

The Spike's Tactical 12” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The 12” BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA.

Glock Gen 3 Model 22; 40 caliber handgun; plus a nice set of extras!

EXTRAS INCLUDE:
9mm ported conversion barrel (Lone Wolf Distributors, $119)
2 Glock OEM 15-round mags
1 aftermarket 31-round mag, has a +2 on it, (29 +2) ($49)
OEM Glock easy loader
Original Glock case
Owners Manual
OEM Cleaning rod
Partial box (15rnds; 20-rnd box is $25 at Gander Mtn) Hornaday Critical Defense Ammo (I own no other 40 cals so I'll throw this in)

Round count through 40cal bbl is very low (100 or less?)
Mostly shot it as a 9mm (250 ?)
Pistol was carried (vehicle gun) more than it was shot.
Does show handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks in the black finish, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. They are ""swirlys"" from carry in a Kydex holster (already sold in a separate listing). Please note the finger index mark on the trigger guard on side opposite ejector port. This is a 101% reliable, great shooter grade/carry gun, but it's not a show piece! (Do you expect a show piece from a Glock???)

For the whole setup, $450 should be a fair price. With the accessories, that's roughly $375 for the pistol itself, $50 for the 9mm barrel, and $50 for an extra 15-rnd OEM Glock mag, an extra aftermarket 29-rnd mag, an aftermarket +2 mag extension, and a partial box of expensive self defense ammo . . . should be a GOOD DEAL !"

The M-24 Sniper Weapon System is the finest long-range system available today. It delivers multiple-shot capacity with match rifle accuracy at extended ranges. In addition to the M24's unsurpassed accuracy, it also offers reliability and durability under the harshest conditions of combat use and transportation. This is the Savage Police/Tactical version.

Designed for and used by the United States Military, the M24's popularity also stretches from SWAT teams nationwide to International Military and Government agencies. Based on Remington's legendary Model 700™ and 40-X™ rifles, famous for their ""out of the box"" accuracy, the M24 has quickly gained a reputation for precision among the sniper system community. An essential element in the M-24's accuracy is its H-S Precision® aramid fiber-reinforced, fiberglass stock with an aluminum bedding block, is utilized for exceptional strength and dimensional stability in all weather conditions.
This stock is brand new and is made for savage long actions. (30/06, 7mm Mag, 270, 25/06, etc.) It includes the bottom metal for use with detachable magazines. It also includes one 5 round magazine. The magazine was made for .338 Lapua but will feed a variety of rounds. Use google to research if it will work with what you are looking for. I have found that it feeds many different calibers simply by bending the feed lips a bit. The bottom metal is designed to use accuracy international CIP mags. One is included and I have one more available for an additional $90. Check my feedback, you wont be disappointed. This is also for sale locally so I reserve the right to remove it at any time.

   Our desire to keep interesting used firearms on the shelf, and our commitment to helping our clients fund the build they truly want is at the core of why we've always allowed both consignments and trade-ins to be applied directly to their AR build. This has helped many of our customers start their builds with no money up-front. And for quite a few, this has paid for their entire custom build start to finish!


Consignment
 * You set the price the gun will be advertised at.
 * We handle the rest! That's right, no more calls, or parking lot meetings!
 * House gets 5% after the sale.
 * Funds will be applied to your build once your gun sells.

Example; You consign a gun @ $600. We handle ads, the sale, shipping, etc. When your gun sells, $570 is applied to your build.
(consignment services also available if you aren't starting a carbine build, see our other ads!)


Trade-In
 * You are credited 80% of est market value(the price we will advertise it for).
 * These funds are applied to your build immediately.

Example; You trade-in a gun est @ $600. The amount of $500 is immediately applied to your build. You are welcome to follow the ads, we are honest about what we say we'll sell it for.

""Oh gosh, I'll only be able to sell your Kimber 1911 for $500...""
Haha, none of that bull here.


   All of our builds are guaranteed for life, and are meant to be the weapon you keep for life.

   Our RTA carbines are available in 16"" and 14.5""(NFA-legal, no stamp required) barrel lengths, are built to be abused, and feature a variety of optic/sight/furniture options. From the bare-bones ""RTA Classic"" to the famed ""Signature"" model, these carbines will take anything you can throw at 'em!  

   Intended to be custom configured for you, the Series13 line is our premier weapon system. Want a free-float rail over a Socom-profile barrel? Need a DMR rig, or perhaps something light & nimble that can still take a beating? Just let us know. Not sure what to get? No problem. From duty requirements, to your height/build, your new rifle will be just that.

    Your rifle.


   While the ""standard"" Series13 platform is the 14.5"" barrel/mid-length gas system, we will be happy to configure your ideal build any way you need it.    

    * Lightweight, Gvmt/M4, Socom, and bull-barrel profiles
    * Rifle, Mid-length & Carbine-length gas systems
    * 14.5"", 16"", and 18""+ barrel lengths
    * AR-pistol configurations also available


   So if you decide you'd prefer a custom AR platform weapon designed specifically for you, over the big-box factory carbines, we'd be happy to take on your project! All our builds feature a Lifetime Transferrable Warranty, and are designed to provide flawless performance. Always.

This pistol is a licensed reproduction of the Beretta 92, and comes in a variety of finishes with a variety of grip styles.
Like the Beretta, the Taurus PT92 utilizes the open-slide design where the upper portion of the slide is cut away exposing much of the barrel itself. The original PT92 was exactly like the original Beretta 92, though it was also unusual for the time in that it featured a squared trigger guard for supporting the index finger of the opposite hand while firing, a feature which was subsequently introduced to the Beretta 92 with the 92SB-F (92F) model in 1985. The Taurus PT92 is less expensive than the Beretta 92 in most cases.
Other versions of the PT92 include the PT99, which has an adjustable rear sight and a taller front sight, the compact PT92C version, and the PT100 and PT101, which are .40 S&W versions of the PT92 and PT99, respectively.
The Taurus PT92 has undergone many revisions in design since it was originally produced in the mid-1980s. Early PT92s and PT99s did not feature the third safety position decocker that is now standard; this feature was added to the second-generation models in the early-1990s, which also included the three-dot sights found on the Beretta 92F. A third revision in the late-90s changed the grip and slide design (which now has wider cocking serrations than PT92s manufactured before 1997).
More recently (as of 2005), Taurus has begun manufacturing the PT92 with built-in accessory rails on the frame, a feature found on the newer Beretta M9A1, a military upgrade of the Beretta 92F from which the PT92 is derived. While 15-round magazines were standard for the PT92 for many years, Taurus now manufactures 17-round magazines for the gun in order to give it comparable firepower to the Glock 17, and aftermarket 30-round magazines are also available."

The gun was purchased new 1 month ago and has exactly 100 rounds down the barrel.  I paid 2299.00 before taxes for it and was on a long wait list. The only reason I am considering a sale is to do an add on to my home which requires some cash. 

I shot every round (Remington FMJ) with zero issues. This rifle comes with the original 10 round magazine and hard case as well as all the paperwork. I also have a vertical MOE grip mounted from Magpul on the front rail. 

The rifle has a brand new (box included) Eotech XPS2 mounted on it. This scope cost me 425 bucks before taxes. I also have a 30 round magazine with it, but some discussion will have to take place before we work something out on that due to local laws.

I am offering this rifle up with 2 different prices.

Priced WITH eotech- 1900.00

Priced without eotech- 1650.00

I am not interested in trades. I am interested in CASH only. No paypal, no shipping, no BS. Face to Face meeting. I live in Buena Vista, CO and can travel a little ways for a full price offer, but please look it up to see where I live. Bill of sale is required as well as local Co. ID. 

Again, this ACR is in pristine condition. The only blemish is the ammo catch where the rounds extract. The paint has worn (small mark where the round hits when it extracts) there from 100 rounds being shot. This is common on every ACR made. Otherwise, a perfect ACR with zero issues. Just needs a good home.

No lowballs please. My price is pretty firm as I paid a fortune for this rifle not a month ago and am looking to recoup some of that money spent. 

Recap:

1  month old Bushmaster ACR Enhanced version all black
10 round magazine
possible 30 round magazine
Magpul vertical grip
Original factory hard case with all paperwork, etc
Brand new Eotech xps2 with pelican box (if purchased)

All Stainless and much more beautiful than pictures can show!
I’ve owned this beautiful gun since early 2008. 
I’d say it has somewhere around 1,500–2,000 through it now.
This gun has been, by far, the most accurate gun I’ve ever shot.

The original box and papers from the factory are included.

It comes with 10 magazines.
7 of them are 229 original Sport magazines(10 rounds).
3 of them are 229 factory 12 round magazines(shiny) with special made 229 Sport bases.

I'm taking a real beating on this at this price so, the price is NOT going to go any lower than $1100.
Sorry, I know everyone wants a great deal.   Me too!.  I just don't want anyone to think that if they wait until next week just 'maybe' the price will go down.  It ain't going to happen. (:-)"

I am asking $200 for the entire package. 

If you wanted to make this a fully tactical self defense shotgun, you can purchase a collapsable stock with a pistol grip for $50-60. An entire set up for less than what many of them cost brand new. 

There is some rusting along the end of the magazine tube, not a big deal but if you keep onto the shotgun you could get it blued sometime in the future.

Great gun, but not for me, just not an S&W guy. 

I bought the gun at the end of August. Have taken it to the range twice, put 150 rounds through it total. Gun has never been holstered. 

Looking to sell it for a little less than I paid before tax, so save yourself a few bucks and the tax for a gun that is as good as new. Never registered for warranty so new owner should be able to register the gun with S&W. 

My asking price is $430 (I paid $449.99 + tax a few months ago)

Willing to trade, would prefer a Glock or possibly a Springfield. Would prefer a 45acp, but will consider another 9mm. 

Thanks for looking.
