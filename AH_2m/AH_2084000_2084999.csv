Remington model 10-A, 26"" barrel 12 ga, take down model. all numbers matching. Only 3500 of the 10-A were made. From what i have read, the 10-A models were used in WW2 by the USMC to train aerial gunners. However i see no ordnance stamps. For being 2 months short of it's 90th birthday this ol vet is in remarkable unrestored/ original condition. there is one small area of pitting on top of the receiver, but nothing too bad at all. It has 1 minor issue that prevents it from being used. A broken sear spring as seen in the pic below. It's a $10 part readily available online. The sear spring from a standard model 10 will interchange, from what i am told.

I am looking to trade for one of a couple of guns. In no special order i'd like an sks for the wife , a norinco is fine, she isn't picky at all.a Hi Point in .45 cal. only. The HP would need to come with ammo to help balance out the trade. I'd also like a single action 'cowboy gun' in .45 LC or .44 magnum. I'm not concerned about aesthetics, just that they cycle & fire properly.

The value as the 10-A sits now is $250-300 in the collectors circles. Restored and firing, $400-450. 

This was Remington's very first repeating shotgun. Introduced in 1908 and discontinued in 1929. This is an amazing piece of history & one any serious shotgun collector needs in their collection. 

I also want to ad this is a HUGE shotgun. In the pics below with me holding it, I'm 6'1"" and 250lbs. I look like a kid holding 'daddys gun' ...lol. I picked this up last week & have decided it's just not the shotgun for me so i'm looking to trade out for something i will enjoy using.  What do you have?"

These are some of the nicest 22's Remington ever made.  It's a take-down gun that easily comes apart.  It has all the original parts, and had some custom work done over the years.  It was professionally re-blued with care not to effect the stamping, edges, and lettering...all crisp.  Also, the original owner checked the pistol grip & added a cap...very cool!

Regardless, for nearly 100-years old, this is in AMAZING shootable condition, and is adult-sized.  She has the metal deep-cresent butt plate, perfect magazine tube, great bore, and a no faults in the blueing...just a sweet gun someone really cared for.

The Hammer Forged Barrels offer distinct advantages over traditional barrel cutting.  The process reduces the outer diameter of the barrel without removing material, making the barrel stronger and more rigid, at the same time as forming the interior rifling.  This leaves a much cleaner and smother surface throughout the bore reducing projectile resistance and premature wear.

To work properly it will a new Ruger BX-25 clip the one it came with makes it jam so I took the clip from my Ruger 22 rifle and it works flawlessly but since Obama's gun scare started I have been unable to find a BX-25 to dedicate to this TEC-22. You may be able to fix the clip it comes with? to make it work in this gun. It is fun and cheap to shoot and everyone always wants to shoot it again after the first try and if you have a few BX-25's around it would be a perfect gun to plink with.

From Ruger:

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

The Ruger Mini-14 has been with us since about 1974. It was designed by Jim Sullivan and William Ruger over a six year period from 1967-1973. The Mini-14 name comes from the last American battle rifle issued in large quantity, the M14, a 9.2 pound, .308 Winchester caliber, U.S. service rifle produced from 1959 – 1964 in quantities exceeding 1.5 million units. It remained standard issue until about 1970. 

The Mini-14 itself has seen several design changes, a rework in 2003 and then a gas system tweak in 2005. Sometime between 2007 and 2008, the Mini-14 was revisited again, allegedly with new tooling, better tolerances and the current somewhat heavier profile, stiffer barrel to improve accuracy.

Compare at $299 new price.

The LG-452 Laserguard® is Crimson Trace’s first GLOCK green laser sight and is designed to fit seamlessly on the trigger guard of most Gen3 and Gen4 Full-Size and Compact GLOCK pistols.  The LG-452 takes the brilliant low-light sighting capabilities of red laser sights to a new level.  The human eye detects green more than any other color and Crimson Trace builds the brightest green laser available, making the LG-452 a versatile laser sighting system for all lighting conditions.

Providing over two hours of run time on a single (1) CR2 lithium battery, the green laser sight market has never seen such incredible battery life.  Additionally, the LG-452 Laserguard platform is the most lightweight and compact green laser sight available for GLOCK pistols.  The Laserguard is quickly and easily user-installed in minutes with zero alterations to the firearm.

In addition to the vibrant green laser, superb battery life, lightweight and compact engineering, the LG-452 features windage and elevation adjustments (with provided wrenches), and a Master On/Off switch which allows the shooter to completely power down the unit.

As with all Crimson Trace Laserguard models, the LG-452 features patented Instinctive Activation™ - a Crimson Trace exclusive.  Instinctive Activation allows the operator to activate the laser by simply holding the firearm with a normal shooting grip.  No one else can claim that.  No one else builds them close.

Micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, it features a ""zero-energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth trigger pull. It features a finite element analysis designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

This model is a decocker version of the basic CZ 75 B model. The decocking
lever mounted on the left side allows the hammer to be easily lowered on a
loaded chamber for a safe ""hammer down"" carry. CZ 75 B is used by more
Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol
in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. All steel
construction (except alloy framed compacts). High capacity double column
magazines. Hammer forged barrels. Ergonomic grip and controls. Unparallel
accuracy, slide-in-frame design for better recoil control, 3 dot sighting
system (Tritium night sights available). Smooth double action and crisp
single action.

2007 Bowtech Commander 50-60lb Right handed 

This bow is probably one of the smoothest shooting most stable bows ever made. Very easy draw cycle. It is extremely accurate and is fast, and completely dead in the hand.

Makes an excellent target or hunting bow. This particular bow is set up in a special custom shoot through configuration (arrow shoots through cables instead of pulling both cables off to one side). It uses two identical cams (instead of opposing top and bottom cams) This provides superior symmetry in the bow's geometry, making for an even smoother, more accurate, and easier to set up bow.

Draw length approx 29.5 - CP3 modules.

Comes with an excellent, easy to adjust Cobra Diamondback drop away rest.

Strings were replaced recently with winners choice strings.

Will ship with payment by paypal, or Cash if ftf. $350 if local. $375 shipped. Quite a steal for such a great bow in this custom configuration.

This is more of a feeler ad to see what offers I might be interested in. I have a 1999 Honda CR250r that I am interested in selling/trading. I'm mainly looking to get rid of it because I have no way of transporting the bike any longer. The bike has sat in my garage for over a year and I feel that it is time for it to go to someone else who can actually enjoy it. The bike is bone stock with the exception of the handle bars being replaced a while back. 

PROS: 
Mechanically sound
Runs great
Absolutely no issues with the bike
Comes with both Rear Paddle & nobby tires
Comes with Jack stand 
Comes with Triangle bike stand
Comes with 2 gas cans. One has gas in it.

CONS: 
Plastic is slightly rough on one side.
Fatty pipe has a small dent, but does not affect the bike in any way.
I no longer have the title for the bike. I went to register the title into my name with the DMV and because the bike was previously registered in another state, they required me to take the bike down to the DMV to have them inspect the VIN. Because I have had no way to transport the bike, I was unable to complete this and they are still holding the title at this time."

762,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2084762,For Sale:  Black Hills MOLY COATED 168 gr Match Ammo for 308 Win.,"North, San Antonio, Texas",$ 150,"Listed On: Friday, September 6, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 5 boxes remaining of factory new / older stock Black Hills 168 grain HPBT Moly-Coated Match ammo.  That's 100 rounds total, 20 rounds per box, 5 boxes.  Moly coated bullets tend to reduce copper build-up in barrels, and the coating reduces friction and pressure as the bullet travels down the barrel, thus slowing down heat build-up, and allowing you to shoot for longer periods of time before groups start to wander from hot-barrel effects.  This stuff used to shoot remarkably well (consistently 1/2 moa or less) in one of my benchguns, but that particular rifle has been sold, and my last 308 benchgun happens to have a specific liking to Federals.  So I have no use for these anymore, but the ammo is excellent, and no longer easily found. It may have been too expensive for Black Hills to continue producing these bullets, and I think they stopped making them .  So here's a chance to pick-up some stock.  You may buy a single box, or purchase all 5, whatever one prefers.  This ammo when new cost over 2 bucks a round if I recall, but I will let them go here for 1.50 a round, or 150 bucks, which is about 45 cents less per round than Federal match.  So a decent savings for some very cool match grade rounds you can only find on the secondary market these days."

The ammo that wasn't firing did have a strike mark in the primer so it may have just not been hitting hard enough. 

The spring and pin are both easy to replace if it ends up being needed. Springs sell for $5 and pins for $20. 

The wooden stock has a wilderness scene with a deer carved into one side, cool if you like that sort of thing, not if you wanted it to be all original. I don't have any stripper clips for it but they are available on the market.

I would look into cleaning it, trying other ammo, and or fixing it but I just don't have any room in my gun safe as is. (I know, I should get a bigger one :) )"

The Police Pistol Slim (PPS) packs Walther innovation into an unbelievable 1.04""-wide profile. Available in 9mm or .40S&W, the PPS has several notable features aimed at better fit and safe performance in its narrow dimensions. From your choice of perfect-fitting backstrap (small or large) to the patented QuickSafe™ innovation, the PPS sets the bar high for competing designs. Ambidextrous magazine release is easily located by right-and left-handed shooters. Loaded chamber and cocking indicators show when a round is chambered and the pistol is ready to fire. Three safety systems ensure peace of mind. A trigger safety and internal striker safety prevent accidental discharge. Simply remove the QuickSafe™ backstrap when storing the pistol to prevent the PPS from firing. The 9mm caliber comes with a seven-round magazine. A six-round magazine is included with the .40S&W model."

The Black Diamond bolts are 1.5"" on all but the BD5928 which are 1.25"".

Beige Carpet Interior with versatile adjustable reinforced shelves and a 51 gun rack capacity.

5 spoke chrome handles standard with a Manual Dial lock.
Electronic lock available by request. (additional $119)

Black Diamond safes are built with heavy 12 gauge steel (with the exception of the 7242 which is 11 gauge) and come in one color, Textured Black.
And of course, all safes come with the Black Diamond logo emblazoned on the front in silver.

All Black Diamond Gun Safes have Anti-Pry tabs. Very few safes have this feature included in the design of their safes and it is usually upper end safes.

All safes have hardened steel plates to protect the vital parts of the safe. Making it so no one can just come in and drill the locks. All safes have a re-locker, a spring loaded pin. This pin is tripped, if tampered with, and locks up the whole mechanism. This feature is ONLY found in upper end safes.

All safes have a handle design that utilizes a slip clutch to disengage the handle and keeps it from engaging the bolts. This feature is one that is usually found in upper end safes.

All safes have under shelf support bars on all big shelves. You can load your shelves with ammo and a year later they will still hold their rigid form. Again, this feature is one that is usually found in upper end safes.

All safes have four bolt down holes so you can anchor them in place. Each safe comes with a bolt down kit.

All safes have fire rated gypsum interior linings with a 75 minute, 1200° fire rating. This makes the Black Diamond Safe the most secure fire resistant safe in its class.

Fully continuous welds throughout. You will never see a spot weld on one of our safes. This is one more way that we will provide the best value for your dollar. And yet again, this feature is ONLY found in upper end safes.

All safes come with expanding door seals made to expand at higher temperatures to better seal your valuables from smoke and water damage.

All safes come with beige fabric interiors, including the gun and storage shelving. You can add light kits or pocket door systems to your safe for a nominal fee, call for details.

We inspect our safes to guarantee that they are the highest quality safe in its price range.
