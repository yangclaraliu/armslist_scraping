It is in excellent condition.

- Stainless
- 4"" barrel
- Magnaported (from the factory)
- Target Trigger / Target Hammer
- White Square Adjustable Rear Sight (Windage / Elevation)
- Red Ramp Front Sight
- No Internal Lock
- Black Rubber Stock Grips
- Original Box

It is an accurate and smooth shooter. The magnaports make the recoil very manageable.

Based on the research I have done it was manufactured in the mid 90s. It is in a blue box, so that puts it on the shelf around 96. It does not have the internal lock so manufacture date was before 97.

In 1999, S&W discontinued the model 29. It has been released since then in limited production as the Classic Model with a really nice key lock on the left side. ""According to Paul Pluff, S&W director of marketing, 'We do not have any new model 29s that have been recently or are going to be released. ' "" ~American Rifleman, August 2013~

You are not going to find this one at Academy Sports. If you would like to own this fine S&W pistol, shoot me a PM and let's see if we can work a deal.

I will consider PARTIAL TRADE offers + CASH. (No BP or Archery)
I am in Little Rock and will travel a little bit for the right deal.

$500 for the package. 

I have a like new/very good condition 642-2 for trade only at this time.  This 642 has has exactly 50 rounds through it.  It's also had wolff springs installed and Fred at CAR did a trigger job on it.  It has the best trigger I've used on a 642.  Fred does stellar work.

It comes with box/papers/etc.  

It also comes with these 2 boxes of ammo.  Super duper heavy recoil and very light recoil with pink tips.

There are 3 holsters as well for any occasion.  The first one is a BLACKHAWK! speed holster.  It's a very nice owb for the J-frame.  The second is a Galco pocket and the third is a KYTAC Braveheart AIWB.  It makes the 642 completely disappear in the appendix position.  Very nice holster and was $75 and took a very long time to get.  

I'm looking to trade for an AK in 7.62x39.  WASR's are fine as long as there's no canting or much mag wobble.  I'd be willing to add a small amount of cash to the package.  Also open to other FIREARM trades, particularly compact and subcompact pistols in .380 or 9mm or rifles in 7.62x39 or .223.

RUGER & COMPANY INC Ruger 11134 SR22RDS Rifle, 22 Long Rifle, 16.12"" 10+1 6 Position Stock, Black

New Ruger SR-22R, an autoloading rimfire rifle that combines the legendary reliability and affordability of the Ruger 10/22 with the ergonomics and configurability of the Ruger SR-556.

a black collapsible stock, picitinny rail for easy optics mounting, 10 round mag capacity, and a flash suppressor. Ruger released this rifle as legal in California but not Massachusetts. The final product is an affordable, feature loaded rifle that faithfully replicates the AR platform dimensions between the sighting plane, buttstock height, and grip.

 This was my first Black power rifle and at $100.00 and thought I was getting a good deal! But the sights were missing ($35.00 from CVA); the ram rod was missing ($25.00 at WalMart).  That put me having $160.00 in it right off the bat, then I had to buy powder and bullets

Several of my buddies had muzzle loaders and I just did not like the raw powder (it spilt everywhere) and having to lube the patch before inserting the ball, forget it.

I found some 250 grain bullets & sabots (I think) at WalMart, these were new to the market at the time and I believe I gave $21.00 or $22.00 for them. After shooting the rifle a couple of times I was impressed and went back and bought two more packs of bullets & sabots, the 12 pack of 250 grain power point aerotip bullets is still un-opened. There is also 10 – 300 grain bullet’s & sabots (My wife’s uncle has seen Elk on his farm and I was hoping to use these to harvest one). There are several powder pellets still in tubes that came with some of the bullets plus I bought a new box of Proxen 50 grain Proxed powder pellets ($30.00). 

The first couple of times I trided to shoot the rifle I had a misfire, the rifle came with #11 percussion caps and it turned out that they were not hot enough to ignite the pellets reliability. So I bought bigger / hotter # 10 nipples, there is one on the rifle and two new ones still in the pack, along with a new box of CCI percussion caps (might be 6 or 8 missing).

There is also a Thompsons Black Powder cleaning and a powder horn. To carry all the accessories I have an old military pouch I use for a possible bag, for the rifle there is a zippered camo rifle carrying case made by Allen Co.

Back to the powder horn; it is a real powder horn but because I use the powder pellets and I’ve just never fooled with it so for now it’s for looks only.  Also for looks are two knives ($22.00 each from Smokey Mt. Knife Works) these knives have fake Damascus blades and plastic handles. I had hoped to make new handles and sheaths from dear hide and horns. But became disabled instead.

I have $160.00 in the rifle, the bullets, powder, sights & cleaning kit, knives etc. I’m guessing I have around $250.00 / $260.00 in the accessories, making a total investment of around $420.00 (max) in the rifle.

EGW scope rail included.
Comes with a black synthetic stock also.
Will come with factory Weatherby 120 grain Nosler Partition ammo, brass, and RCBS dies. Will get an exact count on ammo and brass later. This was a back up rifle and has been shot very little. Recoil is similar to a 270 and very manageable.

Looking to sell my Gen 3 Glock 23 with lonewolf 40-9 barrel. Comes with two .40 mags ( one 13 rd and one 15 rd), 1 15 rd 9mm mag, and the lonewolf barrel. All mags are made by Glock. Like having a Glock 19 and 23. Also have 4 piece chrome set (not installed) slide release, take down lever, and two pins. This 23 is a bit older I believe around the year 2000 was when it was manufactured. The slide is the less slippery slide unlike most gen 3's. Has minor holster wear  on the tip of the slide. 9mm barrel has had around 200 flawless rounds and the .40 barrel has around 500-600 I'd say. All flawless as you'd expect from Glock. Internals look excellent, surprisingly smooth trigger for stock. Not in any rush to give it away, please feel free to make offers. Feel free to text or email me REDACTED. Will respond quickly to either one. Will ship on your dime.

Power, pure and simple. 

Barrett Model 99 

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again. 

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. 

The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. 

Model 99 in action 

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. 

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on.

Rollmarks and proofmarks are sharp and the wood has a nice figure to it. Of course, the barrel and receiver serial numbers match. One flaw that you will see in the last picture is that the screw on the magazine tube has been buggered up some at some time during the last 60 years. Despite that, it's still and outstanding example of a post war gun, although this does have a pre-war style buttstock with the post war style 14 groove flat bottom forend.  if interested, call or text REDACTED"

It is the VGX Deluxe Model with the high-end European Walnut Stock with Rosewood trim.  The barrel has the deepest blue finish of any rifle you will ever see, it's like a Colt Python!  Included is a really nice leather sling and a very soft padded carry case.  The 300 Weatherby Magnum is the most power 308 on the planet, it'll take down a small elephant...  The scope is a Deerfield 4X12X40 that came from Weatherby on the rifle new and works quite well.  I do not have a picture of this rifle to show just how nice it is.  I am asking $1200 for this rifle and this includes every thing I mentioned plus the following: 4 boxes (80 Rounds) of factory loaded ammo that is worth as much as $4 per round.  I also have somewhere around 75 brass cases that have all been cleaned, trimmed, measured, inspected and primed.  They are ready to be loaded how you like.  I am also including my RCBS dies in this package.   This rifle looks like a $3000 Mark-V.  This Vanguard was made by Howa in Japan and the craftsmanship is exceptional!  I'm not really looking to trade but will take something at fair value that I can resell.  The Magnum is just a bit too much for me so it you have an interesting bolt action that shoots .224 or .308 I'll listen.  I am including over $500 in factory ammo, brass and dies...  This is a smoking deal for a rifle that needs nothing.  Shoot factory loads or load them the way you like, it really is a total package.  You can call/text me at 5O5*6IO*529I.  Make me a reasonable offer and we can talk, low-ball me and I'll ignore you.  This is a rifle that has to be seen in person to fully appreciate.  Thanks."

I was the first person to shoot it and it has only had 20 rounds through it, total!  This rifle is as new!  You will be hard pressed to find a nicer example of an Enfield anywhere!

Here are the Stats:
Make: Enfield, UK - Fazarckly England 1955 
Model: No. 4 Mk. 2 
Year of Manufacture: 1955 
Caliber: .303 British 
Action Type: Bolt Action Rifle 
Barrel Length: 25"" 
Sights: The gun is mounted with standard military sights, with protected front sight and ""H"" adjustable rear sight. 
Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is as new, light colored nicely grained wood. There is a matching serial number on the underside of the forend about 9"" down from the muzzle. 
Type of Finish: Matte Blue / Parkerized 
Finish: Near Perfect 
Bore Condition: The rifling is sharp and deep, the bore is bright. There is no erosion. 
Overall Condition: This gun retains about 99% as refurbished of its metal finish. The markings are obscured on the stock band but clear elsewhere. Overall, this gun rates in excellent condition. 
Mechanics: The action functions correctly, test fired and shoots very well. 
Accessories: There is no box but there is are two original British military Bayonets that are still with some cosmoline and a frog for your belt. 
My Assessment: This is one of the best representations of an Enfield British military rifle that I've ever seen. The stocks are in great condition, the bore is perfect, the action good and the finish is as new. If you ever wanted to own a collector Grade UF55 British Lee Enfield, this one is in just super condition all around. The .303 round is powerful and accurate. Attention collectors, shooters and British enthusiasts, these aren't available everywhere anymore.

I am asking $850 or best reasonable offer for this Rifle.  I do have some factory loaded ammunition, once fired brass, and a new set of British .303 dies I will include at my asking price.  Make me a reasonable offer for the rifle, ammo and dies and we can talk, low-ball me and I'll ignore you.  This is a rifle that has to be seen in person to fully appreciate.  Send me your contact info and your name and I will be intouch ASAP."

A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The name ""Pug"" may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (""much in little"") in reference to the small and convenient size.

Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1"" heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark.

Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm ""leash"" on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite.

It's a 1914 Springfield Model 52-A bolt action single shot rifle in .22lr. I have another of these from the 30's and I absolutely love it! It is the straightest shooting gun I have ever fired. The reason I am keeping the 30's over this 1914 is because of condition. The one from the 30's survived a house fire and is horribly ugly. So I figured I would let this one go. I am asking $130 and am willing to sell a little .22lr ammo with her for a price that won't make you want to punch me in the face. Same goes for my other firearms I will be listing. I am not willing to sell any ammo without first selling you a gun so please don't ask. This will be a face to face transaction paid in cash. If interested you can call or text me at REDACTED.

Description:
This is a used gun, however is in excellent condition.  It has had a total of 200 rounds down the barrel and has been appropriately treated and maintained.    This model is pre-threaded for a suppressor.  

This posting includes the following:

1 Walther P22 Semi-automatic pistol

Original box

Factory Toolkit

Interchangeable back-straps (small and medium) 

Extra front site posts

850 rounds of new-in-box Remington ammo

Low profile concealed carry holster which can be worn either inside the waistband using the integrated metal clip, or on a belt using the integrated belt loop.  Rand handed carry.

Asking price is $400 for everything as a packaged deal.  Would consider trades for other like items (Firearms/Firearm related items)

This gun shoots just like a new gun should.  I have put a couple of different brands/types of ammo (including subsonic) through this gun and it fires/ejects everytime.  This is an excellent choice for Concealed Carry, tool/tackle or just to throw in the glove-box.  Hopefully someone can get more time with it than I could!"

The bluing is worn in two places opposite each other on the cylinder and base of the grips have similar wear.  But there is no evidence of the gun being fired.  My guess is that it has been carried extensively, but not fired since leaving the factory.

I had the hammer bobbed, making this carry weapon virtually snag proof.  This packs 6 rounds of .32 S&W is less bulk that the 5 shot .38 Chief and its copies.  I left the grips alone, you can modify them to fit your hand size and need.

This boat and trailer are in EXCELLENT condition and ready to put onto the water. No scratches, dents and no leaks! It is very well made and has a riveted hull. The EZLoader trailer has all been professionally wired and the tires have but one season on them, so you have absolutely no worries about unexpected problems there. The seats are in great shape with no rips or tears. The only reason I am selling is that I have a disability and my health condition has gotten to the point I question being able to handle it all by myself right now. Ideally it is a 2 man boat but one man can handle it all by himself. I regret having to sell it. This is an Ideal boat/trailer setup for a one man operation. All the equipment is in excellent working condition and most of it brand new. I have fished with it on large reservoirs’ with no problems at all and would make a great set up for a man that wants to hit multiple smaller lakes and ponds.I had planned to do some duck hunting with it, but now that is out of the question. The 12volt deep cycle Everstart Battery is “Brand New” and has never been used. The 45 lb thrust Motor Guide Trolling Motor is like new and a perfect match for this size of watercraft. It will support a small (5-10hp) gas motor as well. It is ready to launch. Fishing, Duck hunting or whatever, all you have to do is hook up to it and you’re ready to go!

Was my daily driver until I purchased an SUV to fit the kids. It needs tires and some TLC. It has a newer compressor and alternator. Has cold cold air and hot heat. It was my daily driver for about 3 years. I drove an average of around 25 miles per day. As far as running it runs fine but acts like it has a miss. I'm guessing its probably plugs or something. Drives fine though. No power loss. The interior is fair for being 23 years old. It needs a drivers side door panel and handle. Also it has a hitch I put on it several years ago. It was used to pull a little 4x6 trailer I built just for this car. It was never used to pull anything heavy. Only about 100 lbs at the most at the time.
