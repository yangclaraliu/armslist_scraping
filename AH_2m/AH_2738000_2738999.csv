The wood has been restored, and of course the buttstock has the cleaning kit. The slant break is original as well. 

This is an All Numbers Matching proper AK with a proper military SAR 1 receiver. The bayonet and frog are also numbers matching, have a low 4 digit, and sport the original leather straps. The bayo and the frog join together to make wire cutters.

The upper was professionally built and test fired and I put together the lower myself. This is my second build, using the same parts as the first AR I built and loved. Everything fit together smooth and tight like it should.

   I spent a TON of time researching parts combinations for the look, materials quality, and function I wanted. My goal was to put together the best gun I could for the money.

The Troy Alpha rail is a beautiful and practical design. The top rail mates almost seamlessly with the flat top upper for a monolithic look. Finger tips fit snug in the holes around the rail. If you need more railspace, Troy sells different length rail sections that bolt into the holes in the rail. This allows you to attach accessories where you need them, and save weight where you don't. When I can afford to own another AR, I will buy it again. I am including a 30 round generation 3 Magpul PMAG.

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics.
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol. Click the below links to get magazines.

TAC-XP 40 S&W, STANDARD PRESSURE, LOW FLASH","Azusa, California, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 25, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=303

This is a high performance STANDARD PRESSURE 40 S&W loading, which means it is safe to fire in all 40 S&W chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition.

The lightweight 125gr. all copper Barnes bullet will mushroom readily, yet penetrate as deeply as a typical 165gr. JHP style bullet, while generating the low recoil and fast velocities of a light weight projectile. This aids in fast/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 13 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone. 

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

Accuracy was excellent in every test pistol. Feeding and function was also 100% in every test pistol.

As always, we have used real world firearms to generate our published velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of generating velocities from extra long laboratory barrels is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to duplicate those velocities in the real world, where it matters.

1420 fps -- Caspian 1911, 5-inch barrel
1302 fps -- Taurus PT100, 4.7-inch barrel
1300 fps -- Glock Mod. 23, 4-inch barrel
1303 fps -- Kahr PM40, 3-inch barrel

You’ll note that the shortest barrel did not give the slowest velocity. This shows that there is often internal barrel dynamics that influence velocity, more than barrel length alone."

They also built a custom all steel free float chassis system and gave it 8 coats of hand rubbed oil finish. The blank before any work was 800. It was then sent to Colt Firearms where one of there Master Engravers did the beautiful wrap around Flure De Lure checkering. She also hand engraved the floor plate as well. The checkering was 700. It looks amazing and is flawless. The stock has awesome fiddle and figure running the full length of the blank.

My 99 Blazer 4.3 Voltec (with 4 doors) was having a problem with the Fuel Gauge, so I purchased (on line about 2-3 months ago) A/C Delco Fuel Pump assembly for replacement. It turned out, it was the ground wire causing the problem with the fuel gauge. So, I do not need these parts anymore. They are still in package, brand new, never been touched. Still have the receipt for them. These parts will be good for most of the older Blazers with 4 doors up to 2003 models I believe. You won't find A/C Delco Fuel Pump Assembly for this price anywhere else.

Remington 700 BDL in 7mm Remington Magnum. It is built for a high caliber, lightweight hunting rifle for traveling when hunting for big game. It features a Boyds Featherweight Thumb-Hole Pepper-Wood stock (Original nice BDL stock is included). Stock is lightweight but has nice recoil pad made for the stock so the recoil is not bad at all. When using the high grain 7mm mag ammo, it is comparable to a 30-06. It also has Leupold base and rings and a Leopold Vari-X III 4.5x14x40 (with objective yardage dial-in focus and Duplex Reticle) sighted in at 100 yards. I also have two boxes of HORNADY Red ballistic tip (high and Medium grain), Winchester Silver-tip ballistic tip high grain, and one box of Winchester brass rounds (High grain) for range. Also has Claw sling installed. Stock also has additional forward lug for a Bi-pod. Total amount invested in rifle is below. The bolt is very smooth (like new), the gun is very clean (inside barrel is like new), very flat-shooting, very powerful. Blueing is 90% from use, but overall round count is less than 40. I am someone who takes very good care of their things, this gun was no exception (regular cleanings/lubricating even when not used just to remove dirt particles from air inside cabinet). Carried more than shot. Spends most of its time in gun cabinet. Can send more pics from if needed.

Here's a heavy duty six shooter that'll do double duty as a destroyer of pop cans and slayer of bird feeder raiding squirrels. Capable of leaping tall buildings in a single bound (or not) and chambering .22Short, .22Long, .22LR and .22Stinger in the .22 cylinder.

With the .22Mag cylinder securely in place, you're ready for the varmints in the backyard woods.

This is more accurate than I am with any and all types of ammo. Regular pleaser of children and grandchildren combined - the red squirrels at deer camp were never safe, and small ragged holes in the paper at 25 yds were always good for the ego. 

Willing to accept an offer of $450 (cash or card +3%), or a trade including any combination of: some type of AK-clone, a 9mm carbine, cash from me or you, complete AR lowers, complete AR uppers, stripped AR lowers, stripped AR uppers, AR parts, nicely sporterized old military rifles.

No shotguns, no deer rifles, no handguns, no Llamas (unless they're Tony Llamas), no kidding.

I can include some ammo* or cash for the right deal. I'll need to see your MN PTP/PTC and matching .gov issued ID. A Bill of Sale will be completed with copies for both parties. 

I'm in Saint Paul and northern suburbs daily. I won't ship it (sorry), and I likely won't drive to Warroad unless you're offering $1k, a 12 pack, and a place to sleep for the night.

First and foremost, this is NOT a TGI or Century Arms ""truck gun"". You are getting an ALL MATCHING NUMBERS original military parts kit, newly built in Kentucky, by Meridian Ordnance LLC (a licensed 07 FFL 02 SOT manufacturer) on a FULLY heat treated NDS2 premium receiver with a 4140 steel, chrome lined, 1:8 twist barrel. Correct riveted construction. Furniture is original black polymer Bulgarian with correct, original salmon color pistol grip. Finish on ALL metal parts is Moly Resin flat black which is a very good match to many original rifles of this type and date code. The barrel is manganese phosphate parkerized under the Moly Resin finsih and under ALL the barrel components for added durability and worry free operation even with corrosive surplus ammunition. The fire control group is the excellent Arsenal Inc. unit with smooth take up and a crisp break. The rear sight is graduated to 1000 meters and has the desirable white fill on all the markings. Both selector notches have been cut for aesthetics but the rifle is of course semi auto only in operation. The lower hand guard has the heat shield present. This is a newly manufactured rifle from a surplus military parts kit in excellent condition and has only been test fired. *We can substitute original solid wood furniture in good condition for the black polymer if you desire and subtract $50 from the cost. We can also add or install any other manner of part or accessory from rail systems to muzzle devices if you wish, at cost. 

We accept credit and debit cards plus 3%. Price does not include sales tax for KY residents or shipping to your dealer. Local pickup requires 4473 background check."

First and foremost, this is NOT a TGI or Century Arms ""truck gun"". You are getting an ALL MATCHING NUMBERS original military parts kit, newly built in Kentucky, by Meridian Ordnance LLC (a licensed 07 FFL 02 SOT manufacturer) on a FULLY heat treated NDS2 premium receiver with a 4140 steel, chrome lined, 1:8 twist barrel. Correct riveted construction. Furniture is original black polymer Bulgarian with correct, original salmon color pistol grip. Finish on ALL metal parts is Moly Resin flat black which is a very good match to many original rifles of this type and date code. The barrel is manganese phosphate parkerized under the Moly Resin finsih and under ALL the barrel components for added durability and worry free operation even with corrosive surplus ammunition. The fire control group is the excellent Arsenal Inc. unit with smooth take up and a crisp break. The rear sight is graduated to 1000 meters and has the desirable white fill on all the markings. Both selector notches have been cut for aesthetics but the rifle is of course semi auto only in operation. The lower hand guard has the heat shield present. This is a newly manufactured rifle from a surplus military parts kit in excellent condition and has only been test fired. *We can substitute original solid wood furniture in good condition for the black polymer if you desire and subtract $50 from the cost. We can also add or install any other manner of part or accessory from rail systems to muzzle devices if you wish, at cost.

We accept credit and debit cards plus 3%. Price does not include sales tax for KY residents or shipping to your dealer. Local pickup requires 4473 background check.

CALL JOHN AT REDACTED 


Leupold model 53436 Competition 40X45 Fixed Power rifle scope with the Leupold 1/8 MOA TargetDot Reticle and a Black Matte finish. This scope has tactical dials that have easy to read 1/8"" click adjustments at 100 yards (1/8 MOA) and the parallax is adjustable from 50 feet to infinity. 

Leupold is probably the most recognized name in rifle scopes at shooting competitions. When going up against tough competitors where the margin of win or loose can be measured in hundredths or thousandths of an inch you need a top quality scope that was designed especially for the competition arena. The Leupold Competition Scopes have features like side focus, 1/8 MOA Target Adjustments, 30mm tubes, and threaded lens covers for added protection of the objective and ocular lenses. Of course, they also have the superior optics that Leupold has based their reputation on. 

Every Leupold scope made has a full Lifetime Warranty but they are so finely crafted and ruggedly built the warranty will probably never be needed. 

All Leupold scopes are made in the U.S.A.

It is currently set up for production division, however I also have all of the original trigger and action components, as well as the parts needed to convert the gun to single action only.  Here is a list of what is included, and I will not part it out.  This gun has been to the CZ custom shop in Arizona for polishing work.  It has the firing pin block removed.  It is a sweet shooter.

That is roughly $1125 worth of accessories if purchased new, plus the gun.  Over $2000.  Unaccounted for is the labor for the polishing and installation of certain components by CZ Custom.  The only thing its missing is magazine pouches and ammo!  This gun has between 3k and 4k rounds through it by my estimation and does show some wear on the barrel, safety, and sights.  But its honest wear, not neglect.
