Good working little shooter. Has been my bedroom weapon for some time now. Small, large capacity,extremely maneuverable and easy on the recoil with the added forend weight. If you'll notice I fabricated the fore end. It's a threaded extended barrel with a quad rail installed. I put a red/green dot sight on there. I used to have a small flashlight on the right and a laser on the bottom. Laser and flashlight not included. But you can easy add yours. 

Bottom Line a comfortable gun, very easy to handle, on target fast with the dot sight and minimal recoil since 9mm coming out of that is nothing at all. And it's like a swiss army knife has the ability to add anything you want to to the quad rails. hmmm........

Comes with 4 30rd mags (New never fired with those.) and 30rd of 9mm

Trade value: Looking for a glock 34 preferably. But ask anyways you never know. AR Uppers, Scopes for 3 gun,  Ar SS 18"" Barrel with rifle length gas, It never hurts to ask."

It took me a lot of time and money to make this weapon. I used the best parts from the best companies on the market. This rifle was designed as a all purpose range weapon for use in my security company, I just want something different now, and want this rifle to have a good home.

It is extremely accurate and fun to shoot. Its small but it still feels good in my hands which are somewhat large. It is a 380 single action. I replaced the plastic grips with Hogue rubber grips which made a huge difference. I still have the original grips included. It also has tritium night sights.

The original box. 100 FMJ .380 ACP ammo. 25 hollow point rounds. There is a little bit of wear on the shell ejector (not sure if thats the name for it) but it is in great condition.

Synopsis 
For the first time since the original King James Version rolled off the presses, see and experience an exact, page-by-page, digitally re-mastered replica of the original 1611 printing in an economically priced edition. This replication contains the lavishly illustrated genealogy of key biblical figures---from Adam and Eve to Jesus. Enjoy the beauty of decorative initials, the original classic font, and the complete preface entitled 'From the Translators to the Readers' found in the original. There are only two differences between this special 400th anniversary edition and the original 1611 KJV---it does not contain the deuterocanonical books and has been reduced from its massive 12' x 16' pulpit-sized folio to this manageable keepsake. Now you can embrace the elegance, majestic style, and rich cadence of the first printing of the 1611 King James Version Bible.

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. One 20 round magazine is included from the factory. The Barrel is18” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All Kel-Tec RFB barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) finished, because it is tougher and will last longer than chrome-lining. The bolts are now finished with Hardened Titanium Nitride to assist with smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. Forward Ejection. Fully Adjustable Gas Piston can be set for use with any ammunition or suppressor. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. This gun is absolutely NEW, UNTOUCHED AND UNHANDLED in Perfect Condition. It is, and always has been a very difficult to find rifle."

A lightweight pistol ideal for carrying all-day/every day, this 1911-style handgun is built around a lightweight aluminum frame machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. The Ultra Crimson Carry's steel slide and match grade steel 3'' bushingless bull barrel aids concealability while still delivering Kimber accuracy. One of the finest laser sights available, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, to help shooters of all levels learn the advantage of proper grip and trigger control immediately, helping them improve accuracy and reduce time between shots while training. Extended thumb safety and beavertail grip safety for fast positive action.

I've got four (4) boxes of 22lr Remington HP golden bullet 525 bulk packs that I am wanting to trade (2100 rounds of this). I also have 2 boxes of Winchester 555 Copper plated HP 22LR as well (1,110 rounds of this). These are brand new and are fresh. I would like to trade them for a cheap little 9mm, or 22lr pistol. I would consider other calibers as well, i just prefer the 22 or 9mm. I know its kind of an odd request, but i know these boxes are hard to find, and I have been wanting another ""knockaround"" gun for a while. No, Im not expecting glocks or springfields, but I wouldnt mind at all jimenez, lorcin, hi point, or others like that. I am willing to trade all or some or some plus cash on my end for them. It will really depend on the gun itself. I really want semi-autos, but would consider revolvers as well. 
My cell is REDACTED so please TEXT ONLY and we can try and make a deal
Before you ask, yes I am willing to sell for cash but would prefer trade. Mainly because if I sell them for cash I will have to sell for what they are currently going for on the market, which is unnecessarily high. But it is your call. Im reasonable on trades and price, so please be reasonable on offers of all kinds. I also have 9mm ammo i could trade instead or in addition if interested.

The rifle has seen light range use, as well as the magazines, and has functioned at 99% in the three years I've owned it. I've only experienced stove-piping over several rounds of reloaded frangible ammunition and never had any problems with UMC, Winchester, or any other makers of note. The trigger is crisp and firm, the action is smooth and consistent, and this little thing is a tack driver inside of 75 yards. I mean TIGHT. 
This little baby folds in half to become 18"" long by 6"" tall at the grip and locks for security if for instance you were to take it camping and needed to step away. 
It is infinitely customizable with at least three manufacturers making inexpensive fore-end kits allowing for optics, handles, lights, etc. and extremely versatile as it is built hardily out of reinforced polymer and hardened steel, and chambers the venerable .40 S&W pistol cartridge.
The Kel-Tec Sub2000 is the perfect sub-rifle for self defense, as it is extremely manageable and very consistent, but would be equally comfortable, and very useful, as a varmint rifle. According to 2013 TN Hunting Regulations, responsible hunters may utilize .40 caliber ammunition to hunt deer!
These rifles are going for 400 plus tax without the boon of extra, high-quality magazines. Maybe you can find a better deal, but this rifle is a tried and true piece of equipment."

This is my prized possession but i need to part ways with it. I have owned 2 PSLs and this one is in close to factory condition. I am the second owner of the rifle, the first owner said he never got a chance to shoot it besides the week he bought it because he worked on an airline and was always traveling. I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.
Deal comes with scope,3 mags 200+ rounds,sling,hard case.

 Features of LEUPOLD GOLDEN RING VX-7L 4.5-18x56mm LONG RANGE RIFLESCOPE:
•The Leupold Light Optimization Profile delivers the light transmission and light throughput benefits of a large objective, yet mounts like a riflescope with a much smaller objective lens for a better cheekweld and more comfortable shooting.
•The Leupold Xtended Twilight Lens System optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available.
•Low-profile SpeeDial adjustments smoothly slide up and open for adjustment.
•The finger-adjustable 1/4-MOA click adjustments are easy to zero.
•A more generous eyebox than you'll find even in premium European optics.
•Blackened lens edges reduce light diffusion, so more usable light reaches the shooter's eye, for a brighter image with higher resolution.
•Lead-free glass lenses offer the excellent optical properties such a precision instrument deserves, with greatly reduced weight. They are produced without the hazardous environmental byproducts common to standard glass production.
•Leupold DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on exterior lens surfaces provides the highest level of scratch resistance Leupold has ever offered.
•Leupold Dual Spring, 4x erector system is designed to withstand the most devastating recoil. It virtually eliminates erector system backlash and stress on the internal workings of the system, for longer life.
•Includes Leupold Alumina flip-back lens covers.
•Internally threaded, extreme fast-focus eyepiece with Leupold Alumina rubber eyepiece guard.
•Tactile power indicator identifies your magnification level with a touch.
•34mm maintube crafted from 6061-T6 aircraft quality aluminum alloy increases the body strength, and allows for the necessary windage and elevation adjustment travel.
•Comes with Satin Black 34mm PRW rings
•Available in Leupold exclusive satin black finish.

The few times I shot with the laser switched on I noticed that it blinks out briefly with each shot but comes back quick leading me to believe that the contacts could be a little stiffer.

There are some small dings and marks on it, but most of them have been touched up as they happened. The rifle only has about 150 rounds through it, and has mainly been a safe queen.

People either love or hate these pistols but it is what it is a good inexpensive pistol and they have a lifetime warranty to anyone who owns it at any time...warranty never runs out and you don't have to be the original buyer...no receipt ever required to get it serviced. 

I gave $179.00 + tax for my pistol and then gave $20.98 + tax for a box of 20 – 180 grain JHP Federal Personal Defense ammo. I then gave $24.00 for a kit from “Smith Thing Solutions” to replace the slide retaining pin with one that screws in and out with an Allen wrench.

I have somewhere around $230.00 invested. So it will take $250.00 to buy it.

Here’s the story; I bought this from a buddy for a $100.00 and thought I was getting a good deal! The sights were missing ($35.00 from CVA); the ram rod was missing ($25.00 at WalMart).  There are a couple of bad  places on the stock (but I was waiting till I got it lined out a shooting like I wanted before re-finishing the stock, but my surgery put a stop to that).

Then I bought bullets & sabots, (3 sizes) you get one unopened pack of 12 - 250 grain power point aerotip bullet’s, an opened pack of 10 – 300 grain bullet’s & sabots (Elk) and 11- bullet’s & sabots 250 grain (I think) along with a box of CCI percussion caps (might be 6 or 8 missing).

I did not like the mess raw powder made so I used Proxed powder pellets (one full box of 50 grain plus several more in the tubes).

There are two Frost knives that have fake damasks blades, I was hoping to replace the handles with deer horn and make sheaths from buckskin but it’s been 4 years since my heart surgery and there still new in box.

There is a Black Powder cleaning kit, and a powder horn. It is a real horn and could be made functional but since I use the pellets I’ve never fooled with it. There is a camo cover for the rifle and an old military pouch I use for a possible bag. 

I have somewhere around $160.00 in the rifle and $200.00 (?) in the accessories making a total of around $360.00 invested. 

Asking $300.00  or may trade to a short barrel 12 gage pump for home defense, a Hi-point 9mm carbine or make me an offer you never know. 

Can send more photos if interested.

I live in Berea KY so I can meet at the WalMart in Berea (exit 76) or the new mall in Richmond KY (exit 87). 

If the trade is to my advantage might meet at the WalMart in Winchester, KY if you are in that direction.   Thanks"

My guns are fully described as to condition(listed in %), function, and whether the gun is factory original or a parts kit remake. Ask the question, has the gun been re-welded form an original de-milled receiver? Is the gun built on a newly manufacture receiver? Is it an original factory gun or just a factory receiver with miss matched parts? This information is critical when selling a gun or for the buyer to know as well. Ask the questions that need to be asked so you pay the right price for a gun. That being said, I have a Factory original Colt M16A2. As of this posting, the ONLY true Post Sample Colt M16A2 on GB. It came out of Israel and is semi/full auto. It does have a lot of rack ware, but the gun has been shot very little. I rate the finish at 90% and internals at 97%. The gun runs like new and you can tell by the inside of the mag well that the gun hasn't been shot a lot. It would make a great range rental or PD demo gun. I am giving up my 07 this fall and will be able to transfer this to an 07 Manufacturer or 08 Importer with SOT under Part 479.105(f) of Title 27 WITHOUT a PD demo letter required.
