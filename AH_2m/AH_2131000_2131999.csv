The scope was purchased new in July of this year, and has seen fewer than 500 rounds since I got it. The scope was shipped with a defective electronic controller, causing the illumination to flicker or change brightness while firing. I sent it back to Leupold for service, and everything is now working properly. A note is included from their service center verifying operation, and upon request I still have the repair invoice.
The scope is still covered under Leupold's fully-transferable Tactical Optics warranty.

This scope is excellent, it is certainly the finest of its type in this price range. Very clear, and the combination of SPR Reticle and illumination makes it very quick on target. The mounts are very solid, the anodizing is attractive, and they have held zero flawlessly through 450+ rounds.

I am selling because this setup simply does not fit my rifle's primary purpose, and I don't foresee buying or building another gun to put it on in the near future.

Brand New in the Box direct from the factory IWI TAVOR in F.D.E. (flat dark earth) chambered in 5.56 NATO. Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Here it is the one that you want. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines."

I'm currently cleaning house a bit (see my other listings) but this one isn't one that I really want to sell, which is why the price is firm at $700.

This is a Magnum so it will take your 2 & 3/4 inch and 3 inch shotgun shells.  I've had it for a couple years and am downsizing to make room for new projects.  Bought it new, and took it out once.  Has less than 10 shells through her.  Looks great,  barely any wear.  Great for hunting, clay pigeons, plinking, and home defense.  The long barrel makes it super accurate.  Has real wooden fore end  and stock, Remington recoil absorbing butt pad, 4+1 magazine capacity, 28"" ribbed barrel, rem-choke, and is all original.  Color is matte black, with the brown wooden furniture.  Priced to sell, so is very fair considering.  Give me my asking price and I'll throw in a box of 25 Winchester super target bird shot and this DoskoSport carrying bag.  No low ballers, not desperate to get rid of it.  Won't last long at this price, so don't hesitate to contact me.  Not really looking for trades, but worst I can say is no.  Thanks for looking."

Description
We have become an optically-driven military. Modern optical systems produce the highest quality images, give protection from an enemy’s offensive lasers and allow troops to see and target at night and even into the thermal range. Unfortunately these same optics also have the ability to betray their own position by reflected light.

Being seen can mean being hit

Being detected because of reflections has resulted in the loss of personnel, the failure of missions... and even changed the course of battles. ARDs (Anti-Reflection Devices) use a high-tech honeycomb material and patented geometry to provide a low-cost, retrofittable and field practical way to hide reflections from optical surfaces... without loss of resolution and with minimal light loss. Tenebraex’s ARDs are used by U.S. Army, Navy, Marines and Special Forces.

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semiautomatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. 

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ button rifled barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, 

AR style magazine and flash suppressor. 

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m."

If purchasing out of NYS, shipping to your FFL should only be around $28.00 INCLUDING insurance. U pay only what I have to. Email me for exact shipping charges. KNOW your local state laws. PLEASE, NO trades and do not send low ball offers. I WILL ALSO INCLUDE (4) boxes of Federal Personal Defense Handgun 410 000 if purchasing locally. This is worth 70.00. Price is well within market value and is firm. Email with any other questions. I'm always online. Thanks for looking!"

Included with this is 2 extra magazines (all 3 are 10-round capacity), one flat magazine baseplate (all 3 mags currently have the extended baseplates) and original box/manual.

The pistol is in excellent shape, has never had a mechanical (FTF, misfeed, double feed, jam, etc.) during the ~500 rounds I've fired through it. There is a slight amount of holster wear on the slide, but is otherwise perfect cosmetically. No modifications have been made to the gun that I'm aware of, aside from the ambidextrous control lever, which is how it came to me.

I also have available:
- About 440 rounds of PMC/Federal brass-cased ball ammo
- 55 rounds of specialty personal defence ammo (20x Barnes Tac-X, 15x Magtech First Defense, 20x Hornady Critical Defense)
- 2 Holsters (one IWB, one OWB, both left handed)

Pictures are of the actual pistol, but identifying markings have been blurred for public listing. If you want a picture of something specific, just let me know.

The listed price is for the pistol, box/manual, 3 magazines, and flat mag base plate only. All of the additional items are available separately, and at far less than retail value. FFL transfer and any related fees are the responsibility of the buyer. Local cash transactions only."

Jacketed Hollow Point (1,225fps/M.E. 416 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Thursday, September 19, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=107

Tactical Short Barrel Lower Recoil Low Flash 357 Magnum Ammo - 125 gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (1,225fps/M.E. 416 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box

Typical full power 357 magnum loads offer several tactical problems for use in self defense and duty applications, especially when used in the shorter/lighter revolvers that are typical of concealed, defensive and duty carry. First, the muzzle flash can be blinding, especially from short barrels. Second, felt recoil can be a life-threatening drawback if fast follow-up shots are required. Third, the level of report can be deafening and cause permanent hearing loss, especially if fired indoors.

All three Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel loads address the above problems and make the 357 magnum ideal for concealed, defensive and duty carry in smaller revolvers.

Muzzle flash: These exciting new 357 magnum loads utilize a flash suppressed powder that will not blind you, should you need to drop the hammer in a low light situation. It is estimated that over 90% of all defensive civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light-that is when the criminal element is at work. Wouldn't it be horrible if you fired at an assailant, in the dark, to protect your family, only to find that you missed the bad guy and you are now blind due to your own muzzle flash? This is a scenario that has happened many times in the real world with the 357 magnum. Through the use of our non-canister, flash suppressed powder, the tactical problem of blinding muzzle flash is now greatly reduced with Buffalo Bore's new Tactical Short Barrel loads! 

Recoil: Felt recoil is exacerbated by the use of shorter barreled, smaller framed, lighter weight 357 revolvers, typically used for concealed and duty carry. The new Buffalo Bore Tactical Short Barrel 357 loads are not the normal full power ""barn burner"", 357 magnum loads we make and as such, felt recoil is substantially reduced, although they remain very powerful. Hence, deadly, and faster follow-up shots are more possible. 

Your ears: Most folks don't think of the level of ""report"" as being a problem during a life threatening/defensive shooting and that may be correct for the actual moment of conflict. However, to lose some of your hearing for the rest of your life, following the shooting incident, is unnecessary and undesirable. Full power 357 magnum ammunition is deafening, even more so when fired from short barrels and even worse if you are required to shoot from an enclosed area such as a vehicle or indoors. Buffalo Bore's Tactical Short Barrel 357 magnum loads are not as hard on your hearing as full power ammunition. Although the use of hearing protection is still desirable, if possible, when using this ammo. 

For those who wish to carry a 357 magnum revolver for potential ""conflict resolution"", these new Buffalo Bore loads put an end to the ""tactical"" draw backs associated with our regular 357 magnum ammo. These loads are great for use in longer barreled firearms too.

Special Information Note: The below velocities were obtained from my personal, real world, factory stock, over the counter, (NOT TEST BARRELS) 357 magnum, revolvers. Also, note that the 6 inch Python, is considerably slower than the 4 inch S&W. This has nothing to do with barrel length. It is most likely a combination of differences in chamber/throat dimensions, barrel -cylinder gap, barrel internals, and forcing cone dimensions in the Python, versus the S&W. If the Python and the S&W had the same dimensions in their chamber/throats, barrel cylinder gap and forcing cone, the longer barreled Python would give much faster speeds. We have found that all of our Python test revolvers are much slower than our late model S&W revolvers of equal or even shorter barrel length.

We could have reduced the recoil, flash and blast even more by ""watering down"" these loads further than we did, but then you wouldn't have a real 357 magnum in your hands. So we looked for and found a balance between very powerful, fight stopping ammo that recoils and flashes much less than ours and some other makers, full power 357 loads. If we were to ""water down"" this ""Tactical Short Barrel"" 357 ammo any more, we would simply not manufacture it and suggest that you use our 38 SPL+P ammunition.

None of these loads caused crimp/bullet jump (in five shots) in my 12 OZ. Scandium S&W Model 340, but they did generate considerable felt recoil.

Item 19G/20-125gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet @ 1,225 fps from a 2.5 inch S&W mod. 66 barrel. Designed to mushroom violently, yet hold together and penetrate deeply-roughly 12 to 14 inches in human tissue. 

S&W mod. 340PD 1-7/8 inch barrel - 1,109 fps (341 ft. lbs.)

WARNING - shooting this ammo out of revolvers weighing less than 16 OZ. produces tremendous felt recoil. We recommend our +P 38 SPL ammo for revolvers that weigh less than 16 OZ., if you are recoil sensitive."

It comes from the factory with a full quad rail that free-floats the barrel, Magpul folding sights, a Magpul 30-round magazine, and a 6-position telescoping stock. Although it does not have a match trigger, the trigger on this particular rifle has no noticeable creep and breaks very cleanly for a military spec trigger.

The Price is $8500, but will take part in FireArms and FireArms Only.
The car received hail damage as shown in the pictures, about 2 years ago while in Kentucky. I've always had the car maintained at Dyer Mazda in Vero Beach and has been garaged since I've owned it. I'm 65, so no Hot Rodding, just enjoyed its great handling, dependable car to drive. My back has been giving me trouble so selling the car to buy and more excess-able car.
I've priced the car very low for and 07 RX8 with only 34872 original miles, yes it does have the hail damage, but that doesn't take away from the way it drives. It is a 6 Speed and has Suicide Doors for the 2 rear seats that can accommodate adults for short trips, I've never used them but I have sat back their in my friends RX8. I replaced the Tires, and only have about 7k on them and the windows are fully Tinted and still under warranty, plus the engine of the car is still under warranty also, and the car was just serviced on 11/20/2013. Not sure what else to tell you about the car, other then I am a private owner and have driven the car regularly.
A little Update for RX maintenance, since I don't put much milage on the car, still under 35,000 miles. Felt it was not running 100% so the dealer suggested a New Catalytic Converter at just under $1600 and new Coils at $326, this has now been completed and ""NO"" increase in the Sale Price, just need to pay off a personal loan."
