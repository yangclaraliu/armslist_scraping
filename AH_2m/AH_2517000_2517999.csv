After doing a bit of research, I learned that EIG doesn't actually stand for anything. It is the last name of Saul Eig, a knife and gun importer who did business in the mid-twentieth century.

Saul Eig's business was originally named EIG Cutlery as he specialized in the importing and reselling of knives. Since he ran his import business in an era when guns were only minimally regulated, though, he was able to branch out and get into the gun trade. He would purchase cheap firearms from Italy, Japan, and other countries, stamp them with his mark, and resell them here in America. The imported guns were typically derringer-style or subcompact, semi-automatic pistols that were easy to find and inexpensive to buy.

Now their are some cons of this rifle however:
The dust covers do not fit that well. Also I made the handguard currently on the rifle out of sheet metal. The wood is a little beat up and the rifle is also a little beat up. I have not installed the scope mount yet, you'll have to do that. One of the dust covers is beat up. Everything is functional though

Prefer FTF deal with an Ohio resident but will ship for a flat fee of $35 to your FFL. Your FFL must accept it from an individual. 

FTF deal will go through my local gun shop so you will need an Ohio driver's license and be able to pass the instant background check. I am selling a lot of guns so they must go through a legal transfer so I don't run afoul of the ATF/firearms laws. The sale price (and shipping) is what you pay.

Prefer FTF deal with an Ohio resident but will ship for a flat fee of $35 to your FFL. Your FFL must accept it from an individual. 

FTF deal will go through my local gun shop so you will need an Ohio driver's license and be able to pass the instant background check. I am selling a lot of guns so they must go through a legal transfer so I don't run afoul of the ATF/firearms laws. The sale price (and shipping) is what you pay.

It all is in great condition and has in storage for the past 5 years.  I have hooked everything up and its still sounding great.  I originally spent about $2500.00 on all of this.

The Model 50 was originally produced by Belgium's Fabrique Nationale using a commercial 98 Mauser action and 22 inch chrome lined barrel from High Standard. The chrome-lined barrels were limited to Models 50 and 51. The rifle was advertised and sold through Sears and Roebuck Co. and each rifle's barrel was marked as such. All variations included a model number on the left side of the barrel just at the end of the forearm, and a code that corresponds to the date of manufacture. For example, mine is stamped 583.97. The rifles were only chambered in .270 Winchester and .30-06 Springfield. Mine is chambered in .30-06. Overall length is 43 inches, it has a healthy 13 3/4 length of pull, and the original model 50 was supplied with a no frills walnut stock without checkering. Sling swivel studs and a polymer butt plate were standard.  The bolt is the traditional controlled feed type with a one piece polished bolt body, one-piece firing pin, and a two-position short-throw 45 degree safety to accommodate the use of a scope. The bolt handle is consistent with the ""Second Pattern FN Action"" in that it sweeps back to allow clearance for a scope. The bolt head has the traditional two locking lugs and the rear safety lug. The extractor is large and prominent. Each bolt was electro penciled to the rifle using the last three digits of the serial number, which was located on the right side of the receiver. The bolts used on these FN Belgium made actions are of the highest quality and durability. The drilled and tapped receiver, hinged floorplate, trigger guard, and magazine follower are all made from milled steel. The floorplate has a button release for emptying the cartridges, and the trigger is grooved for a positive feel. The trigger mechanism on the Model 50 is heavy but there is minimal creep. I've talked with some folks who replace them with the Timney 98FN Sportman 101, which requires a little modification of the inletting and no safety modification. The barrel comes with open sights and is 22 inches long. It has a sporter contour that tapers to .5 inch diameter at the muzzle. All reports on the accuracy of J.C. Higgins Model 50s and subsequent variations have been favorable. In addition to its inherent accuracy, the Models 50 and 51 came with chrome lined barrels, thus adding to the useful service life of these rifles. Weight is 8 1/2 pounds bare and unloaded. The overriding consensus regarding the J.C. Higgins Model 50 is that it's a rifle worth holding on to if you have one, and worth seeking out if you do not. Prices are generally suppressed because of the department store association. Despite this, it is among the finest hunting rifles ever mass produced. This point is emphasized by the fact that these can be bought at bargain prices. Expect to pay between $200 and $400 depending on condition and how much the seller knows about this fine rifle. If one were to build such a gun today using the same FN action, the price would easily exceed $1000."

I'm from eastern oregon but will be in the area next weekend, I could meet around Portland but sandy area would be best."

Hornady's Critical DUTY ammunition is designed for reliability under harsh conditions, and for controlled expansion through barriers. The flexlock bullet design incorporates the flextip hollow point and interlock core retention band to produce a high mass retention bullet controlled expansion through barriers, without clogging the hollow point.

Flexlock bullet incorporates two revolutionary Hornady features: the patented Flex Tip that initiates consistent expansion every single time while preventing any clogging, and the heavy duty InterLock band that locks the jacket and core together.

Cannelured bullet with crimped case ensures no bullet setback during feeding.

InterLock band works to keep the bullet and core from separating for maximum weight retention and proven terminal performance through all FBI test barriers.

Core is made of high-antimony lead making it extremely tough, delivering controlled expansion for unparalleled terminal performance consistency through all FBI test barriers. It’s also more economical than similar bonded bullets.

Nickel plated cases resist corrosion and greatly enhance low-light chamber checks.

Critical DUTY Law enforcement and tactical professionals now have a truly advanced, 21st century handgun ammunition solution that delivers the most consistent and reliable urban barrier performance ever created!

A literally Brand New Glock 27 Gen 3 up for you today. Bought new in September 2013 and has had ONLY 100 rounds through it. Still has that factory “new” smell to it. No marks, scratches, wear, or any visible signs of use on it. I would give it a 97% condition. Has the colored yellow/green inlay which you don’t see that often.
It currently has an upgraded Lone Wolf barrel which prevents the wiggling of the bullet in the barrel and I still have the stock Glock barrel if you want to switch it out. Has an upgraded 3.5lb trigger, and a Gen 4 dual recoil spring. Added pinky extensions to both 9rd mags for comfort.

To sweeten the deal I’m also including a factory Glock Hi-Cap 22rd Mag, 50 rounds of Hollow Point Ammo, and a couple of new No-Touch ear plugs.
So pick this up now before this is gone, the total package is well worth what I’m asking for it. Would cost a lot more if you were to buy everything separately.

Package Includes:
- Upgraded Glock 27 Gen 3, 40 S&W
- 40 S&W Lone Wolf Barrel
- 2 x 9 rd Mag w/ Pinky Extensions
- 1 x 22 rd factory Glock Hi-Cap Mag
- Factory Glock Speed Loader
- Glock Case and Paperwork
- 50 rds of 40 S&W Hollow Point Ammo
- 5 x No-Touch Ear Plugs w/ Cord

Browning has stopped production of the .40 and gone back to the original 9mm design but the advantages of the .40, other than rarity, is a much better built slide and frame than the 9mm. The 9mms are great pistols but their frame and slide are the weak point of the original design and cannot handle any hotter loads of 9mm.
 If you are not familiar with the Hipower, they were designed after the 1911, and have been in production since as they were originally the rest of the world's request of a 1911 design but a higher capacity and shooting the then (and NOW strangely enough) desire for a 9mm variant.
 History lesson over. I'm asking $875 cash, $950 trade value for a pistol that will only appreciate in value. Retail was $1,100 for the standard model WHEN it was in production! I'm open to many trades but especially AKs, 1911s and an over/under (12, 16 or 20) shotgun (I'm open to lower end skeet guns like Yldiz; I want a shooter not a safe queen) .
