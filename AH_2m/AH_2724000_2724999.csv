- Romanian military spam can ammunition, guessing it has been sealed since about the 1970's, until I opened it about a month ago. The ammunition is fully sealed, and boat tailed, making this ammo more accurate than most. (Comparable to Golden Tiger 7.62x39) This stuff is pretty hard to come by, got lucky and found some through an accquaintance. This is the majority of the ammo. 

- Wolf copper washed steel cased ammunition, lacquer coated. Very small amount.

-TulAmmo steel cased, non-coated ammunition. Large amount.

Total, I have about 1,800 rounds if not a little more or a little less. I am only selling it all together. I'm asking about $550.00 for the whole deal, .50 caliber ammo cans and all. The only reason the price may seem high is because of the Romanian ammo. FTF only, E-Mail or (text preferred) at 1(716)-550-zero four zero eight."

- Outfitted with the AK100 TechSights peep sight system (directions and manuals for the sight is included). Original recoil spring assembly is also included along with the original rear leaf sight. paid $75 plus shipping for the upgraded sights.
- Official Polish military unissued checkered pistol grip, which was finished by myself. Purchased at RobertRTG. Comes with original polymer grip. - $50.00
- East German military standard AKM sling
- Tapco G2 trigger (Excellent trigger!)
- Tapco trigger retaining plate
- Also included will be a hard case, and the standard AK cleaning kit.
- Barrel is NOT chrome lined (chrome lined barrels actually affect accuracy negatively) and is obviously a stamped receiver. I suggest cleaning the gas piston using Slip2000.  

The gun is basically brand new, the gas tube retainer and lower handguard retainers are still very stiff. purchased at Castle Keep over in the Clearwater area. I polished the bolt carrier myself, and refinished the wood myself as well. Good looker, and a good shooter. Shot 200 rounds through it. Unfortunately, I do not have the box and manual in Florida. But if it is really that serious, I can probably arrange to have them shipped back to me to give to the potential buyer. I can provide any info needed to the first time AK buyer.

I can also include ammunition on request."

eupold mounts are every bit as rugged and dependable as the Leupold optics they're intended to secure. With a huge variety of mounting systems, for nearly every type of firearm under the sun, you're sure to find the perfect match for you firearm, and your style of shooting. The Leupold Integral Mounting Systems (IMS) family quickly and easily eliminates the two most common issues faced when mounting standard rifle scopes to AR-style rifles; scope height and eye relief. Each aluminum IMS cantilever design mounts directly to the firearm's Mil-Spec 1913/Picatinny to raise the scope and push it forward, eliminating the need for risers or specialized optics with shortened eye relief. The Mark 6 Mount comes with integral rings and is designed specifically for the Leupold Mark 6 Tactical Rifle Scope. All Leupold IMS products are tested to endure the rigors of the field and are covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee."

These were made in kodensha japan in the factory where winchester 101's were made. Incredible shotgun. Could only find one for sale online right now (at 700 and is not all original; the one I own is all original) Nikkos don't pop up often for sale. 

The second Nikko is the N.T.S. (Nikko trap shotgun). 29"" rib vent barrels both full choke. This gun is absolutely incredible. Tiger stiped stock and forearm, engraving on absolutely very portion and jeweling on internals to include extractors. Although the 512 was made where the Winchester 101's were this is essentially is a 101 with better wood and parts. Looking online there isn't another one for sale period. This is truely a collector piece and quite rare. 

Neither gun has import marks making them early models. 512 is from early 70's and N.T.S. Most likely from early 60's from research but it's tough as the Nikko company did not keep the same records other companies and the factory was demolished in the early 80's.

Model Mle-m-16. This Bethierfrench battle rifle was made between 1917 and 1928. I do not know how to ascertain the actual year. This rifle is serial number 24130  and the numbers match on the bolt, trigger guard, and stock. I did not see the serial number on the barrel or receiver and have learned since I took the pics,that it  is probably under the top forearm. The metal condition of this is very good. The wood parts are in very nice shape. The finish has crinkling that would be typical of a very old varnish. we cannot say if it has been refinished or not but if it was it was an ancient job.. The bore has strong enough rifling but is a frosty bore and slightly dark. This rifle still has the clearing rod.  Please see the pics for more detail and if you have questions after that contact me.

Springfield XD-S 9mm 4"" Single Stack, Black. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™provides the power of a 9mm or a .45 ACP in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

I have literally only fired this one time. Never have a chance to go shoot. I have the box, all paperwork the original grips an extra mag and a nice little holster included. Also have lots of 45 ammo if you want to pay more.

However, today i recieved a sig 1911 and dont need both so i am looking to either sell this one or trade for a nice 9mm. No i am not selling or trading the sig.

This one has the “.22 WMR” stamp on the slide.
This one has the set screws in the front sight.

I've put maybe 200 rounds through it. Had two or three failures to feed with the cheap Winchester white box ammo, no failures with the ammo recommended by the manufacturer.

It came in a crappy cardboard box which I threw away, but I can include a Walther plastic case if you don't low-ball me on the price.

I can also supply some ammo for it, if you offer a reasonable price based on current market value, not based on what it sold for two years ago and may never sell for again.

I'm on the fence about selling it, and I am not desperate for cash, so I will not let anyone ""take it off my hands"" for peanuts.

I'm looking for a no-hassle sale with a reasonable person who knows what he wants and doesn't screw around. If that's you, I'm willing to drive a bit to meet you halfway to make the deal.

For my own protection and peace of mind, I'll need you to have a CPL and WA driver's license. I will take a picture of these at the time of sale, but I won't send in any paperwork to the state. If that doesn't work for you, we can't make a deal.

This is not one of the early models that had feed and ejection issues - it's a good one.
I've only had a few failures, and that was with the cheap Winchester XXX stuff, mainly due to the square nose jamming on the edge of the chamber.
This rifle will cycle subsonic 40gr rounds just fine with or without a suppressor attached, and the bulk pack Federal 32gr all day.

Extras Include:
NCStar BiPod
UTG Foldable foregrip
Barska 3x9x42IR scope
Adjustable iron sights
Two 50-round Black Dog drum magazines
Ten 25-round magazines
Three 10-round magazines
Butt pad
The ammo that is currently in the magazines (380 rounds)

If you pay close to my asking price, which I think is fair, I will include a UTG covert carry bag (see photo). If you offer me a low price, I'll start removing things like the bag, the ammo, the magazines, and the scope, which I will sell separately if needed. I'd prefer a package deal and a buyer with a fair attitude, but I will split it up if I have to.

I can also supply some additional ammo for it, if you offer a reasonable price based on current market value, not based on what it sold for two years ago and may never sell for again.

I'm on the fence about selling it, and I am not desperate for cash, so I will not let anyone ""take it off my hands"" for peanuts.

I'm looking for a no-hassle sale with a reasonable person who knows what he wants and doesn't screw around. If that's you, I'm willing to drive a bit to meet you halfway to make the deal.

For my own protection and peace of mind, I'll need you to have a CPL and WA driver's license. I will take a picture of these at the time of sale, but I won't send in any paperwork to the state. If that doesn't work for you, we can't make a deal."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

Review:  The buzz about the SIG SAUER® Mosquito, is that–this scaled down, rimfire version of the company’s popular P226® reduces the noise, recoil and expense of centerfire shooting but keeps the accuracy, precision and exhilaration the same. The polymer frame, blowback-operated pistol is offered in a wide range of configurations.  MSRP	 $449.00
