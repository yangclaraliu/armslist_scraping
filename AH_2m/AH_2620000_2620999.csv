The next generation of The world‚Äôs most advanced Autoloader.

The lightest, softest-shooting 12-gauge semi-auto we've ever built, the Model 105 CTi II transforms each shot to a fluid, effortless motion. There are a number of proprietary technologies that launch it to the forefront of firearm design, and it starts with the receiver. Namely, the industry's only skeletonized titanium shotgun receiver

It's wrapped with a stout carbon-fiber shield to create the ultimate fusion of toughness and reduced weight. The receiver is also home to the Remington-exclusive semi-automatic bottom feed and eject mechanism. Our ‚ÄúDouble- Down‚Äù system produces no peripheral distraction from ejecting shells ‚Äì a feature trap, skeet and sporting clays shooters have raved about since day one. The simplified gas system has very few moving parts, requires less cleaning and there's virtually nothing to wear out or replace. Along with reducing felt recoil, the overbored barrel enhances pattern consistency.¬†

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users. Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating ‚Äúpusher‚Äù rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components."

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users. Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating ‚Äúpusher‚Äù rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

Here is a P226R DAK in 40 caliber. Second owner since acquired in 2005. And since 2005, I've put <1000 rounds through her. With it comes original grips, 2 magazines and a cool custom spray painted case, with the egg crate foam in it, if you want it. The grips on the gun are Hogue G10 Piranha grips. FYI magazine release is on the right side of the gun, as I am a lefty. Also, the night sights aren't as bright as they used to but still easy to pick up in the dark.

I will NOT ship. Meet face to face. 

Will need to see WA DL to make sure you're over 21, will need to see your good guy card (or current Active military ID if you don't have a CPL) for peace of mind and a Bill of sale for both our records.

This particular mosin has all matching numbers and was made in Tula in 1939. That's what the stamping on the receiver indicates. Tula was much closer to Germany than say Izhevsk. Tula was captured by the Nazis and did not produce anything from late 1941-1943. There  aren't as many of these in existence.

This is the ""standard"" model of the B-series pistols chambered in 9mm. They are famed for their build quality, accuracy and great hand-feel.

This particular gun is in pretty good shape. The only areas of concern are the grip frame, which has a nice patina on the front and back, and the left side wood panel. It has a small, seemingly stable crack near the screw, visible in the photos. It's been there since I got the gun, and hasn't gotten worse over hundreds of rounds, so I don't think it's something to worry much about. It would also be easily repaired with a dab of wood glue for peace of mind.

The bluing on the top back half of the slide is showing very light surface rust that was challenging to pick up with the camera, and is equally hard to see with the eye. The pictures below are an accurate representation of the condition of the gun.

The front sight itself is completely intact, but a bit of the white has been worn off. It's minor and can be seen in the second-to-last photo. It certainly doesn't affect the gun's performance at the range - thanks to the fixed barrel design and Luger grip angle, these pistols are extremely accurate and easy to shoot well.

While I'd say the cosmetic condition of the gun is around 85-90% (mostly because of the grip patina), the function is flawless on this example."

It has beautiful wooden grips.  This tiny tot carries 8 rounds; 7 rounds in the magazine, and one in the chamber.  So, put in a loaded clip, and one in the pipe, flip the safety on, and be armed by Armi T. ...
---no, this doesn't mean your in the army. But it could mean that you have the Armi right where you want it,  in a place where the sun doesn't shine...in your pocket!:  SO, go forth armed with the Armi in your back pocket.  If the army doesn't like it, it can kiss your ... ammo!  You'll be fine as long as you and your pistol aren't loaded at the same time at the same place. 

Warning!  The surgeon General has determined that shooting yourself through your pocket can be hazardous to your health.  Yes, a bullet in the butt could be a source of great embarrassment when you have to explain to your pastor why you kept grimacing wincing and shifting in your seat throughout the sermon. Hard pews aren't friendly toa bullet bites, I imagine.

If this bit of word play offends anyone please know that is not the intent.   I don't mean to be a pain in the rear, guys.  I prefer smiles, not piles!.  That being said, next time that person won't stop being a pain in the butt, just nick-name the culprit ‚ÄúHemorrhoid‚Äù until he or she get's their together.  He/she may not improve, but you will experience immediate relief as your piles turn to smiles. 
What? You don't  want to call anyone a hemorrhoid?  No problem; just wrap a tube of preparation-H in nice gift-wrapping paper and address it to them with a note. If the problem is at work maybe a HEMEROIDD OF THE MONTH trophy could be passed to a deserving recipient on the last business day of the month.  

Too negative?  Then perhaps you'll fell better doing something nice for yourself, like buying this 25 caliber personal pocket or purse cannon . It packs small but plays BIG!  :)


If you text questions instead of email you'll get a much quicker response.  I have limited access to the net.

If you don't know about these guns you should research them.  They are great rifles, not a budget AK like a WASR-10.

It's in great shape.  It runs FLAWLESSLY and I've never had a single issue with it nor would I expect to have one.  It's very accurate and very nice to shoot.  I HATE to sell it but I need to downsize my collection.

I'm located in Statesboro but I go home to Madison GA every few weeks and could arrange a meeting near Atlanta.  

The gun comes with 3 30 round mags, 1 5 round mag, and 1 40 round mag.  They all feed flawlessly.  Has a tapco G2 trigger installed from the factory as well as a factory polished bolt and bolt carrier.  I can also include 7.62x39 steel cased non-corrosive ammo if you add more cash.  Hollowpoint and FMJ.  I have about 1,800 rounds right now.


Cash price is $800 with everything you see.

As for trades, I'm looking for .357 and .44 revolvers PLUS CASH.  I will not trade straight, you must add cash.  And a lot of cash if it's a taurus, rossi, charter arms, etc.  I'm very interested in taurus ultra lights and poly protectors.   Just keep in mind their retail price and my AK's price when offering your revolver.

Has had about 20 rounds through it, then cleaned and stashed in the safe. A head turner for sure, to say the least. Only minor issue with the gun is the mag wont drop straight out, have to give it a little help. Im sure this can be taken care of quite easily, and it does not affect function in any way.

The serial number puts it at a 1966 manufacture. It is one of the more rare R-106's, predating the more common R-107's, but as far as form fit and function they are pretty much the same gun. These pistols are a great piece of Americana, the model was largely designed in answer for an inexpensive, high capacity, reliable, plinking revolver to be sold by the iconic Sears and Roebuck. These were the glory days of Hi-Standard, pre-1968 when Hi-Standard sold out to the Leisure Group, these guns were crafted for the discriminating target shooter and plinker alike. Unfortunately, like so many classic firearms manufacturers, today's Hi-Standard pistols are nothing more than a name, and are not half the gun that originally afforded that name. This gun is in beautiful condition; it still has the original presentation box, albeit with some wear and a small tear in one corner which extends a bit down the top. The gun has likely never seen a holster, there are a couple minor areas of surface rust, on the outer perimeter of the muzzle and just forward of the barrel stamp. This rust is not in any way affecting the crown of the bore, and I chose not to address it with steel wool and touch up bluing as this would likely only diminish the collectability of the pistol. The chambers and bore are immaculate, no rust or pitting evident. Minor turn marks on the cylinder, and good sharp edges on the hand, star, doghouse etc... Never been closed with the extractor extended, these 106's came with the spring loaded extractors so this was much less common of an occurrence. Sights are crisp and finish is in overall great shape for a gun of this year."

864,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2620864,For Sale:  GBMP1 Fixed Blade Knife by HTM Knives,"Jacksboro, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 200,"Listed On: Sunday, February 16, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This knife is as new, unused, unsharpened (still has sharp factory edge), and has not been carried.  Description from HTM's website: The GBMP1 was designed by Master Sergeant Grady Burrell. This knife was tested and exceeded the standards set by ‚ÄúMasters Proven‚Äù for fixed blade edged weapons. Master Proven is a group of Senior Military retirees that review products for Military and Law Enforcement personal. As a boots on the ground solider, Grady's vision was to build a low profile, very well balanced knife while he was on a overseas Military Tour. He deigned this knife as a tough every day carry for all around survival purposes. ""When designing a knife the balance is a critical component of the overall design when building a purpose driven, edged weapon for fight or flight situations"" Grady said. Our GBMP1 sheath was built by First Spear who has the 6/9TM technology that they use on the knife sheaths. The 6/9‚Ñ¢ Modular Pocket Technology is not only completely backward compatible with legacy MOLLE/PALS style load carriage or armor carrier platforms, but also offers significant weight reduction over traditional MOLLE/PALS pockets. Due to the flexible nature of the attachment straps and tighter tolerances when compared to traditional MOLLE/PALS, 6/9‚Ñ¢ pockets actually mount closer to the body and conform tighter to the platform. Already adopted by Professional Users within the joint US Special Operations Forces community, this system provides many advantages over the traditional MOLLE/PALS system and can further help facilitate transition into the 6/12‚Ñ¢ Modular Pocket Technology where the ultimate in weight savings, signature management and tight fit can be achieved. Specifications: First Spear sheath made in the USA. Clip Point Blade; plain edge (no serrations). DLC Black Blade finish. 154 CM Blade Steel 58-61 RC Hardness. Blade Length 4 Inches. Blade Thickness 1/8"". 3D Carved G10 With Multi Grip tm handle. Lifetime Warranty. MADE IN THE USA.  Add $6.99 for insured shipping.
