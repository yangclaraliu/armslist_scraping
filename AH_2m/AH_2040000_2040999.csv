My winter carry piece. Approximately 250 rounds through it, I bought it new and have owned it for about a year.
What's Gen4 mean in terms of Steyr handguns? It's the latest generation. Good extractor, roll-pin under the rear sight, and other improvements.

Comes with 3 10-round magazines, case, and keys for disassembly.

People either really like the trapezoidal sights or dislike them. I REALLY like them. I've had noticeably better accuracy in both initial and follow-up shots than I have had with my Glock-19 (which I also recently just sold). Overall this handgun is much more ergonomic to me. I recently purchased a Steyr L9, which I won't be selling anytime soon, but I don't need another CCW handgun besides my Kahr. 

Asking $440 + transfer fee. Transfer can take place at Ark Tactical, Firing Line, or other place within SE Aurora/Aurora that will do it. That is an extremely good price for one of these.

Comes w/ extendable Blackhawk bipod as well as the original 5-rd mag plus two 20-round magpul mags, and one DPMS mag.  A grippy aftermarket pistol grip is currently attached; the original grip is also included.  Included are 50 live rounds, a thousand  bullets (Nosler and Sierra) and primers, a nice sling and fore-end grip.  The previous owner said that he bought it new and put no more than 100 rds through it; I put 10 rds through it. A carry case is included too.  It's a very nice gun ready to take hunting or just go have fun. 

Remington says the following about the gun: ""For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.""  I couldn't have said it better.

At the base of this AR platform rifle is Colt's popular 6920 law enforcement carbine with a Grey Cerakote finish, proven to be effectively mobile during tactical deployment and traditional patrol. With a fully retracted buttstock, the carbine measures only 30.5 inches and weighs in at only 6.8 pounds. Tried and true, this carbine boasts proven advantages like a safe, semi-automatic rate of fire for potent firepower capability and speed of target acquisition. The advantage of the LE6920MP is the addition of Magpul's American-made accessories as standard equipment. The Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) additions are cost effective products engineered to enhance weapon performance and usability. Magpul accessories on the Colt LE6920MP platform include MOE hand guard, second-generation rear back-up sight (MBUS), MOE-K hand grip, MOE trigger guard, MOE carbine stock, and one 30-round Magpul polymer magazines (PMAG).

Gun History: Received this gun on a trade from the original owner who is in a Army Competition Shooting Team. He said he lazer bore sighted this rifle in at 100 yards, then shot 3 rounds at 100 yards, 3 rounds at 200 yards, and 4 rounds at 300 yards. So rifle only has 10 rounds down the barrel. I have not shot any rounds thru this rifle. Must see to appreciate the wood stock. The gloss finish is in perfect condition. Beautifull gun, I just wont ever shoot it, so I want to sell.

The 1st is a Kimber Ultra Raptor in stainless steel. It has 3 Kimber 8 round stainless mags, and a leather iwb custom holster. It has around 200 rounds through it, and is in mint condition. The 2nd gun is a Sig Sauer P220R with Night Sights, Hogue Grips, and 3 8 round factory mags. Not sure of the round count because I'm not the original owner, but it has been well taken maintained, and is in great shape. The 3rd gun is the most expensive. It is a Glock 27 Gen.4 with about $1,350.00 in parts and gunsmith labor. If you want a stock Glock this isn't for you, and if you don't think guns should be modified this isn't for you, but I didn't just order parts, and throw them on the gun. It is by far more accurate, better feel, less recoil, and 1000x better trigger than a factory Glock. It is just as reliable as a factory Glock, and is an amazing carry gun. It has a Zev Tech black on black Fulcrum trigger pad, trigger bar, and ejector housing, which is set up with a 3.0 lb. self defense trigger pull, but can be adjusted to 2 lbs. up too 6 lbs.I also have the pre travel and over travel set up for self defense so it isn't a hair trigger, but it can be adjusted as well to have no pre travel or over travel, but i would not use it for self defense or a carry gun if you choose to set it up with no travel in the trigger. that is competition settings. It also reduces the travel reset of the trigger by 50%. This trigger is super crisp, and breaks better than my Kimber 1911 trigger. By far the bet trigger you can put on a glock. It has a 3.5 Ghost Evo trigger connecter, or I can install the Zev Tech V4 race connector, but will come with both. It has a lightning Strike titanium polished safety plunger with a reduced power plunger spring, or I can install the Zev Tech polished safety plunger, but again it will come with both. I also have 3 standard power springs for the safety plungers. It has a Zev Tech polished, skeletonized, stainless striker pin, with a 6 lb. firing pin spring, but I also have a 4 lb. and 5 lb. firing pin spring for it. ( I highly recommend the 6 lb. spring for a self defense set up.) it has a tungsten recoil assembly with a 16lb. double spring captured, that is 5x heavier than the stock polymer recoil spring, and 2x heavier than a stainless steel recoil assembly, which helps tremendously by reducing lock time by 58% and reducing muzzle flip and felt recoil dramatically. It has a 6lb. Trigger spring, and I have a 5 lb. trigger spring for it as well. It has a KKM Precision stainless match grade barrel that was match fitted by a Master Glock Armorer. It still has enough play to digest all ammo, but locks up tighter for better accuracy. It has a Vickers Tactical Tangodown Mag release, and slide catch, and +1 Pearce Grip Extensions on all 3 mags to make them 10 round mags. It also has marine spring cups for better reliability. It makes it easier to shoot in harsh conditions, and an I-Tac owb button release holster. I have all the factory parts I replaced I.e. barrel, trigger assembly, guide rod etc. It was worth every penny I spent on it, but I'm ready to build something else. I can sen pics of any of the guns if interested."

For sale is my Smith & Wesson SD40VE pistol chambered in .40S&W. Capacity is 14+1 rounds. I bought this a few months ago and have only put about 60 rounds through it, so the break-in period is started for you. It’s a nice pistol, it shoots well and I really like the grip.

Since this is my only .40, I’ll be including all my .40SW ammo as well – 190 rounds. This includes 90 rounds of 165g FMJ for target practice. Also included is 100 rounds 180g of Federal HST Tactical (LE). This self-defense ammo isn’t cheap stuff (especially in 50-round boxes, when you can find them). If you’re looking for good a home-defense pistol, this will get you going right away.

Pistol comes with (2) 14-round magazines, pistol lock, original box and all original paperwork.  Pistol is in like-new condition, clean and lubed.

Price is $400 cash firm for the gun and ammo together. The ammo stays with the gun, I’m not interested in selling it separately.

Update: I may be interested in limited trade options. I want to pull at least $100 cash out of this, so if you have a trade worth $300 or under, in good condition and can add the cash difference, I may be willing to consider it if it's the right gun. What I would be looking for: .22lr semi auto pistol such as Ruger MKII or MKIII (including the newer 22/45 models). In rifles, I'd be interested in Ruger 10/22's (including takedown model), Marlin 795 or Marlin 60.

Transaction will be face to face. I’m in the Oregon City area, work in Portland and willing to meet part way in the general area, depending on the location. Somewhere between Portland and OC is ideal. ODL and current Oregon CHL are required as is a signed Bill of Sale.

Sale to Oregon residents only.

Nicknamed the ""Devil's Round"" by the Afghans, this weapon and round quickly became popular with elite Special Forces units around the world and still is to this day.

Las Vegas, NV - September, 2009 Arsenal, Inc introduces its own AK-74 rifle chambered in 5.45X39. Combining 21 century technology with original Mil-Spec design features, Arsenal has succeeded in producing America's first ever AK-74 built on an original Russian Kalashnikov platform. Bringing the flat shooting, superior ballistic characteristics of the5.45X39 round together with the world's most reliable battle rifle ever made, Arsenal is sure to re-invent history with the addition of this rifle to its product line.

Each SGL31 will come standard with Arsenal's own AK-74 muzzle brake that uses modern day CNC technology to improve upon an already highly effective brake. Also, every SGL31 will have Arsenal's upper and lower handguards that are said to be the world's most effective heat dissipating AK handguards on the market due to its stainless steel heat shield. The SGL31 features a hammer forged chrome lined barrel that is built to stand not only the test of time but against any environment or situation encountered. And, with Arsenal's exclusive two stage trigger design, the SGL31 provides a clean and crisp pull when shooting. Available with optional accessories, like the KV-04S scope mount and the four-sided aluminum picatinny rail, the battle tested and battle proven design of the AK-74 becomes the battle rifle of the future in the form of the Arsenal SGL31. Combining these features and many more, like the different stock lengths and colors, the SGL31 sets the standard as the most reliable and accurate battle rifle ever. 

Starting out as a small manufacturer and importer on the west coast, Arsenal, Inc. developed a reputation for building and importing only the highest quality parts. Then, when Arsenal, Inc moved to Las Vegas, NV they transferred that same passion and attention to detail spirit into manufacturing and importing firearms.

Works great, hold 8 shells. It's been converted to fire .410 bore shells, that are way easier to get then the original 11mmX60 rimmed, .43 Mauser shells. The only thing they seems to have done, was add a piece to the bolt face to hold the slightly smaller 410 shell rims. I think this was done by Bannerman Arsenal many years ago. This makes it a great turkey gun and being pre-1898, no FFL stuff to deal with, easy to reload for, with smokeless or black powder. the only thing missing from it is the rear sight. BUT being a shotgun, the 1000+ yard original was kinda a waste. and the sling swivel on the trigger guard. Sorry for the bad pictures, all I have is an iPod camera.  This one was made by Spandue Armory and is serial number 57xx and is dated 1888. The butt plate is marked with the unit 3GGR over R 447, Stock has usual dings and small marks, nothing serious and no cracks.  Any questions please ask.

This gun has about 150 rounds through it, and has never had a single malfunction. It looks and functions like new, and is incredibly accurate. Included are two 8 round magazines, foam taurus case, a galco hybrid style (like a crossbreed) in the waistband holster for comfortable concealed carry, as well as a paddle retention blackhawk holster. These two holsters cost about $90 together. 

I really don't want to sell this gun, but money is tight. This gun shoots just as good as my other 1911s that cost twice as much. Because it is a Taurus, it will also come with their lifetime warranty. If you research the taurus 1911, you will see it comes with alot of features you only see at much higher price points, like checkered 30-lpi trigger guard, mainspring housing, and frontstrap, ambidextrous safety, beavertail grip safety with memory pad, target hammer, skeleton trigger, polished throat and feedramp, lowered and flared ejection port, custom internal extractor, extended magazine release, and beveled magazine well. Do your research, I think you will find this to be a great gun and a very fair price.

Asking $650 obo.

I will only sell face to face and am not interested in any trades. Must be 21 years old with valid TN drivers license and sign bill of sale. I have my carry permit and would prefer to sell to someone who does as well. Feel free to email me with any questions or for more pics."

This rifle will not jam. I have dirtied her up pretty bad and she will fire and feed any round no matter what. She does have some scratches from carry and competition use. She groups at just shy of 1moa with 62gr penetrators. She is far more than the sum of her parts.

Chargemaster Combo Scale/Disp Description

 The ChargeMaster Combo features the ChargeMaster 1500 Scale and ChargeMaster Dispenser, preassembled to form an unmatched combination of speed and accuracy. There is no longer a need for timely calibration to the type of powder being used. Simply fill the 1 lb+ capacity powder hopper with smokeless powder, enter the desired charge and press the dispense button. Average dispensing time is under 30 seconds for a 60 grain extruded powder charge. Dispensing can be done in grains or grams mode. Accurately weighs and dispenses all extruded (stick), ball (spherical) and flake smokeless powder from 2.0 to 300 grains to +/- 0.1 grain. You can store up to 30 of your favorite loads in memory for fast easy recall. The front to back layout allows easy access to the scale pan by right or left handed users. 
The clear cover eliminates fluctuations in weighing caused by air currents without obscuring your view of the charge being dispensed. The powder drain feature allows for convenient and easy emptying of the powder hopper. Power to the Dispenser is provided by the connection to the ChargeMaster 1500 scale so there is only one power cord to manage."

Absolutely stunning weapon, I understand that it's been nickel plated, and I understand probably better then you do the difference between a beat up shot out original Rand or Colt vs this weapon, however to see it in person and to appreciate the incredibly professional job that was done  sixty one years ago by an artisan makes this weapon one unto it's own.
