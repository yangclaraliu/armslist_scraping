The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

 Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

 Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

 Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

Specifications and Features:
 -Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction
 -Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec 'STANAG 4179' platforms
 -Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding
 -Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability
 -Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, black-oxide coated (MIL-DTL-13924D)
 -Anti-glare translucent MagLevel windows on both sides of the body along with a painted Indicator on the spring allows for easy determination of rounds remaining
 -Over-travel insertion stop on the spine
 -Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling
 -Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking
 -Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches
-Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to maximize feed lip life, minimize debris intrusion and for additional protection in storage and transit!!!

The 39-2's were built from 1971 to 1983 and this one was made in the 1971 or 1972.  These pistols have a steel slide with an alloy frame.  They hold 8 rounds in a single stack magazine.  It is a double/single action pistol that will not fire with the magazine removed.  The safety partially blocks the firing pin and also de-cocks the hammer.  The rear sight is adjustable.  These pistols are VERY accurate and extremely well built.  The blue finish is great.  There are a few places on the frame that have the black finish worn a little thin, most likely some holster wear.  This is the same pistol that was carried by the US Navy SEALS during the 1960's and 1970's so you know they are quality built.  This pistol is complete with the original box, protective paper, manual and cleaning kit.  Asking $850 for it or best reasonable cash offer.  Not really looking for a trade unless you have a factory target pistol in .45acp, .38 Special Wadcutter."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

 Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

 Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

 Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

Specifications and Features:
 -Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction
 -Modified dimensions allow for wider compatibility with non Colt-spec 'STANAG 4179' platforms
 -Constant-curve internal geometry for smooth feeding
 -Anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability
 -Long life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, black-oxide coated (MIL-DTL-13924D)
 -Anti-glare translucent MagLevel windows on both sides of the body along with a painted Indicator on the spring allows for easy determination of rounds remaining
 -Over-travel insertion stop on the spine
 -Ribbed gripping surface and new aggressive front and rear texture for positive magazine handling
 -Paint pen dot matrix panels on the bottom of the body to allow for identification marking
 -Flared floorplate aids magazine handling and disassembly yet is slim enough for use with many double and triple pouches
-Pop-off Impact/Dust Cover to maximize feed lip life, minimize debris intrusion and for additional protection in storage and transit!!!
 -Made in U.S.A.

If you arent familiar with Kahr's they are basically slim single stack Glocks.  Shoots well and has a very smooth, crisp trigger, I'm just wanting something with a shorter grip that I can pocket carry.

I'd like to trade for an M&P Shield in .40, or a Kahr CM40.  Might also consider a gen 2 Taurus 740 slim plus cash.  Its a bit ddifferent than the others I'm looking for but I would also consider a Ruger SR40c.

For those that are interested I also have a ported barrel for it which helps with muzzle flip on it.  For the right trade or additional $ I can add it to the deal.

If not interested in trades ill sell the gun and both mags for $350, the gun mags and ported barrel for $450.  Prices are FIRM, the mags run $40 a piece and the ported barrel is $150 from Kahr, so you'd be getting a good package deal for them.

The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed.

236,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2518236,For Sale:  DuraCoat Tactical Camouflaging and Sandblasting,"Richlands, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, January 3, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Offering the utmost attention to detail and professionalism for all your DuraCoat and sandblasting needs. I guarantee you will be happy with the finished product. And I will treat and care for your gear like it is my own throughout the process.

DuraCoat is a two part epoxy paint, first developed and put into use to aid special forces in camouflaging their gear increasing their survivability while also protecting their weapons and gear.  Here is a link to DuraCoat's website so you can get an idea of their product.  http://www.lauerweaponry.com. The coating is extremely durable after a full cure and will eliminate rust forever on the surface it is applied to. Finishes available include matte, satin, and gloss. Simply wipe with a damp cloth if you need to. There are various patterns and colors available and you can apply it on any metal, plastic, or rubber surface. The main difference between DuraCoat and CeraKote is that DuraCoat is flexible and does not require extreme heat to cure, this makes it a much better choice for applying to composite components on weapons and gear. 

So what can be DuraCoated?
Rifles and all external surfaces to include scopes, rings, bases, bipods, lights etc. Logos power settings, etc can be taped off to avoid losing any markings. 
Shotguns 
Stocks and stock sets
Binoculars
Cameras
Range Finders
Calls
Magazines
Flashlights
Grips
Bipods
Lasers
Ammo (yes some people do this, mostly when presenting a gift of the same color scheme)
GPS units
And the list goes on....

Sandblasting can be done as well for any of your restoration needs. I can blast, prime and apply any coating you like to breathe life back into old items and make them look new again. 

My Experience:
I have been painting helicopters and pretty much anything you could think of for the past 16 years professionally. This is a hobby of mine as I enjoy customizing and camouflaging my gear to blend in while hunting. Make your gear one of a kind, make it stand out or blend perfectly with the outdoors while protecting it as well and rest assured that I will do an excellent job. Feel free to email me and I will contact you within 24 hours. Thank you for your time.
Will trade my services for gear, guns, ammo, etc."

Remington Sportsman 78 bolt action rifle chambered in 30-06.
This gun is blued with a Remington Glossy finished, Walnut, checkered stock. Typically, the ""Sportsman"" model guns came from Remington with plain, hardwood, Birch stocks. However, this gun is the typical Glossy stock, and pressed in checkering of older Remington rifles and shotguns.

I have it back and from what I've read, was actually upgraded quite a bit. Authorities on his handgun are quite impressed with it's performance after being modified. I have all paperwork showing it has been upgraded. Comes with original case and all contents listed above, plus 2 extended magazines. Please do not hesitate to ask any questions. I'd be happy to answer. Thank you for looking!

First off, this entire setup is as new as anything you will buy brand new, it has maybe 10-15 minutes of use in my backyard and in the house just playing with it.  I would be more than happy meeting anyone in a dark location so they can give this a shot.

I am selling a like new ArmaSight Sparq Night Vision Sight, Armasight AIM Pro Red Dot, Picatinni Mount and the necessary attachments to use the night vision sight with your current scope.  Thats right, you can turn your scope into night vision.

I purchased this on a whim with the dream that someday I would be able to go Hog Hunting being this is Texas and all. I have all but given up on the idea of Hog Hunting as no one seems willing to let me tag along without paying BIG BUCKS to do so.  I have only been in Texas for about 6 months and just dont know a lot of people here so I am selling this fulling loaded Night Vision Sight.  It has never been mounted on a gun, it was only used in my back yard and in my house to see how well it worked and to see how well the red dot worked with the sight.  For the price, I am blown away by how well this sight actually works.  This sight is getting absolute rave reviews based on its abilities  and the price point.  It is considered a Generation Core Sight.  Most people are saying it works as well as any Gen 2 night vision sight they have ever used and say it does as well as the $2000 sights.

With this setup, you will be able to use the night vision sight and have a white dot sight for aiming, just like any red dot out there, except this is for night.  The AIM Pro also doubles as a daytime Red Sight and can be used with any sight, scope or magnifier.  

The night vision sight has a built in IR Light on it as well. 

Here is everything you are getting in this package.

Armasight Sparq w/case-$608

AIM PRO w/case-Retail $503

QRM Quick Release Picatinny Mount Adapter, BNIB-$152

Armasight Scope Adaptor Mount-BNIB-$205.00



The only trades I will consider are for a high end long range scope, it must be worth $1000-$1200 and be in perfect condition.  I not offering junk and I wont even consider junk.  I will also consider a Remington 700 in .308, but it must be a full package that includes the gun, a nice scope, aftermarket stock, bipod, etc.  These 700's equiped as described have been selling between $900 and $1200 all day on Texas Gun Trader.  No, I will not take your stock Remington 700, sorry.

NO OTHER TRADES WILL BE CONSIDERED SO PLEASE DONT ASK.

MY CASH PRICE IS FIRM AT $850, I have much more invested than that and I dont need to sell it so please keep your lowball offers to yourself."

Here's the scoop. This was a sold/traded but I have no idea what happened to the deal. It just faded I reckon. I passed up several suitable offers on the pending trade but I like to give the benefit of the doubt that sometimes bites one in the ass. So, I decided to just start over. That said. What I want is a Henry large caliber lever action. I will either trade the Garand for the right one, or sell outright and just order what I want. Cash price is easy, no barter, no hassle. As you can see by the ""bullet test"", it is not shot out and has plenty meat in the 1945 dated Springfield barrel.  Either sell, or no sell. $900 cash firm. Prices are rising on the Garands and I will either sell it for $900, or just keep it until I find what I want, or price goes up further. I have no problem either way. Or trade for the right Henry lever action. You are welcome to offer other trades, but I really want a Henry. Believe it or not, I had offers to trade for a Mosin Nagant. No, I will not trade for a Mosin Nagant, or SKS. Fine rifles, but not in trade for a Garand (sorry). It is, what it is. No games.."

I'm asking $150 for everything and am open to trades -however I prefer cash and only want to see if there is something really tempting out there -so please don't be offended if I say 'no thanks'. 

The only reason I'm looking to part with this kit is that I fire left handed and this was the only time I've gotten fouling/gas etc. in the face while firing an AR. I thought it'd be fun to plink with, but I'd rather shoot 5.56/.223 or use a dedicated .22 that won't spray me. 

I'm pretty free this weekend and will be able to text or email pics later on, so please leave a valid email address or cell number for a quick response.

Here's the scoop. This was a sold/traded but I have no idea what happened to the deal. It just faded I reckon. I passed up several suitable offers on the pending trade but I like to give the benefit of the doubt that sometimes bites one in the ass. So, I decided to just start over. That said. What I want is a Henry large caliber lever action. I will either trade the Garand for the right one, or sell outright and just order what I want. Cash price is easy, no barter, no hassle. As you can see by the ""bullet test"", it is not shot out and has plenty meat in the 1945 dated Springfield barrel. Either sell, or no sell. $900 cash firm. Prices are rising on the Garands and I will either sell it for $900, or just keep it until I find what I want, or price goes up further. I have no problem either way. Or trade for the right Henry lever action. You are welcome to offer other trades, but I really want a Henry. Believe it or not, I had offers to trade for a Mosin Nagant. No, I will not trade for a Mosin Nagant, or SKS. Fine rifles, but not in trade for a Garand (sorry). It is, what it is. No games.."

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.


Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty.
