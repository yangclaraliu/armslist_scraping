This is the top of the line in AK's and is a milled Bulgarian. See Below;
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

You can look at them on my photobucket album at this link.

The pictures are in the slideshow are in reverse.(so first one is the very bottom picture)

http://s1309.photobucket.com/user/mhemling33/slideshow/FF3


Where do I start with describing this light..... A car HID headlight on average is around 35W, This flashlight runs at 40W and is a little bigger then a soda can. I That might put things into perspective for you.

If you need a serious flashlight this is for you!

Fire-foxes are known by fellow flashlight enthusiasts as one of the best HID flashlights out there. Its power/size ratio is almost unbelievable when you look at other lights out there.

It has a runtime of about 60 minutes total and it does get hot. Because of it's size it is going to get hot, when it reaches a certain temperature it will automatically switch down from 40w to 24w which is still extremely bright.

You will be receiving 4 x Panasonic NCR18650B 3400mah batteries and an itellecharger I4. These one of the best lithium batteries and chargers currently in the market. 

I have taken some photos of what you are getting and I also try to compare the output to other lights you might recognize. I compare it with a 20V Dewalt LED work light and a black Cree flashlight with an X-ML T6 LED. 








Fire-Foxes 3, 20V Dewalt LED Worklight, Cree flashlight w/ X-ML T6 



Now for photos of their outputs I put my camera in manual mode to make sure that the same setting were being used with each light. This allows you to see the true difference between the lights.

Here is you baseline picture (no light)


This is the Cree Flashlight w/ an X-ML T6 LED




This is the 20V Dewalt LED worklight



Now here is the Fire-Foxes 3 HID





Here is the Spec Sheet



Now for the $$$ talk ;) I would really like to trade this over selling it.
I am asking $330 for the light, batteries, and charger if you meet me in the Harford county/baltimore county area or $345 shipped. It is in absolute perfect condition (I babied this thing) and has maybe 3-4 hours runtime total at most.

I am also willing to do trades for firearms/parts/accessories/ammo. Just let me know what you have and i'll say yes or no!

you can email/text me with offers and questions.

Medium in very good lightly used shape with the data card in the back it comes with the Chocolate chip and 3 color desert and covers. 75.00 OBO 

 One Canadian Military PASGT equivalent, it is medium and looks to be in new condition from the looks of it. 75.00 OBO 

 One Improved Outer Tactical Vest with all 4 hard armor E-SAPI plates(front, back, and sides). 700.00 Or Best Reasonable Offer or trade.

 The list of components:

 Soft armor panel inserts
 Four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates)
 Collar
 Deltoid and Auxiliary protector system (DAPs)
 The groin protector is NOT included

 This is a small vest with the expansion system built in it fits my 210 pound frame easily. 
 A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment.[5] The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to a casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor.

 The IOTV takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. It has a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. A back pad in the lower back area of the vest is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. The back pad does not provide ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear plates E-SAPI plates will provide protection to armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified. This is a huge improvement over the PASGT vest, and the Vietnam era fragmentation vest (which was made of nylon). Both only offered protection against fragmentation."

I decided to turn my DMR into a lightweight carbine.  I put maybe 300-600 rounds down this rifle with this scope.  It's really a great scope... I just feel like if I'm going to look down a scope to take my shots I would rather play with my .308.

I bought this weapon after arriving back from deployment, with the intention of practicing marksmanship fundementals and becoming a better sharpshooter.

So I'm trying to sell this weapon within the next 30 days. 

I've shot maybe 150 rounds total (probably less) on it. So its pretty much new. The weapon has been talen care of (IE it's clean and has been kept in its case when not in use). Asking for $670 to buy right away/send me your best offer.

I had the gun at the range last weekend and im very impressed. it shoots and feeds flawlessly. the blueing is worn  to a nice patina and there is no rust. the barrel looks very good. it has the ballard style rifleing not the micro groove barrel. I was running factory federal ammo through it and it shot under a 2 inch group at 50 yards standing free hand. and at 100 yards it was shooting 2"" high and still a 2"" group which surprised me. I love this gun for short range hunting!! once you fire a .35 rem you will want one.  the stock has its scratches but for its age is pretty good. it is a classic that comes up quick and shoots very well. it will make a great addition to any gun collection."

Grouse Hunters:  Ithaca 37 Featherweight 20 Ga. in 95% Condition!,"Hamburg, Buffalo, New York",$ 495,"Listed On: Thursday, August 22, 2013",Shotguns,Ithaca                                                                                ,20 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"This is a great opportunity to pick up a legendary grouse gun. Nothing fancy about it:  just a near-mint example of an Ithaca 37.

I own the big three of American pumpguns--the Remington Wingmaster, the Winchester Model 12, and the Ithaca 37. For sheer handling ease, pointability, reliability, and overall fit and finish, the Ithaca is the gun that I always reach for when I'm headed to the grouse tangles. It points like an extension of my arm, and no other pump gun shucks more smoothly and faster. I've never had one fail to feed, fire, or eject.

And this 37, in 20, is an extraordinarily clean featherweight in near perfect cosmetic and mechanical shape. Comes with a 28-inch barrel, choked modified. Straight-grain American black walnut is completely scratch and crack free; metal and bluing are likewise in excellent shape, with crisp roll-stamped engraving on both sides of the receiver and just the slightest hint of bluing loss evident on the sharp profiles of the bottom of the receiver and trigger guard. Ithaca embossed black plastic buttplate and gripcap. Weighs in at just slightly  over six pounds. And one of the best features is a little one that I always look for:  the screws on the receiver are untouched, so Bubba has never been inside.

Clearly, this was a gun that was carried more than shot, and apparently not carried in typical upland terrain, with no visible wear to any moving parts, and a bore that's mirror-bright.

Serial number dates it to 1976, the prime of Ithaca's production and well before labor, quality-control and bankruptcy issues began to set in in the 1980s. And, of course, this is a post-855,000 SN gun, which means it will take any 20 ga Ithaca 37 interchangeable barrel without fitting by a gunsmith and headspace adjustment. If you've been shopping pumpguns, you know The ""new"" Ithaca gun company is now headquartered in Ohio, and they are selling guns identical to this one--starting at $759 and going up to $839. Quite frankly, this one's every bit as good as the new ones--maybe better; I know it's lighter--and I'm offering it for about 60% of that new starting MSRP.

I have another beautiful Ithaca 37 in 20, which is why this one can go, but if I do decide to keep it, I'll probably have the choke opened up to IC and make it my dedicated grouse and woodcock gun. You could also have screw-in chokes installed; I know a couple of good local 'smiths who could do it for you. And, of course, fully interchangeable barrels for this gun show up regularly on Ebay and Gunbroker.

Ithaca 37s this nice don't come around all that often. If you have a soft spot for American pumpguns, you owe it to yourself to own an Ithaca 37--and this is one that will make you glad you paid a little more for one in exceptional, unmolested shape. Contact me today to arrange a time to see it. Also, my FFL is only 10 minutes away and will process a transfer to you for $10. 

I am firm on the price, but I will entertain face-to-face cash offers from potential buyers serious enough to actually inspect and handle this gun. Don't bother replying with an offer on a gun you've never seen; it's an insult and waste of time for both of us. Also, I have additional photos I'd be happy to send, and I can take more if you specify a particular area you'd like to see. They're all hi res, so blow them up to really get a good look at the impeccable condition of this gun.

I will entertain offers or trades, plus or minus some cash, for a vintage SxS double in 16 or 20 (Savage Fox B?); a centerfire rolling block (Ruger No. 1) or bolt gun in a deer caliber, especially a 30-40 Krag or sporterized Mauser in 7x57, 6.5x55, or 308; a Mossberg SSi-One barrel or complete gun in .270 or 308; or a .22 target rifle.

As always, thanks for looking."

I am looking to sell a pair of '70s vintage handguns.  The longer barrelled one is a Mark I, the shorter barrelled one is a Standard model.  The Standard model predates the ""read owners manual"" stuff, so the gun is clean of any of that PC BS but it does show evidence of a repair.  Both retain the majority of their finish, with only a couple of high spots rubbed down, and the grip areas show normal very slight oxidation.  Bores are bright and shiny.  I have never fired either one so I don't know how well they run or how accurate they still are, but the rifling and crowns look fine in both.  $300 each, or $550 for the pair.  Both come with an aftermarket case, and one used magazine, and 100 rounds of CCI Mini-Mag.  I also have one new magazine I will include with the Mark I.

Permits will be required for the sale, and I have a simple bill of sale we will both get a copy of.  No trades and I would prefer a FTF in the Jacksonville area."

There is hardly any flaws in the stock it has a small chip behind the sling bar on the butstock and two small divits on the handgaurd. They barley show up in the pics and thats because they are small and hard to see. The stock serial # is about 250 off the rifles # i dont know why that would be. If it was swapped after it was made or has always been that way. The metal numbers all match. The bluing is in pretty good shape with wear on the high spots and around the muzzle where the bayo attached.

Both these Pistols are in excellent condition.  THE BAR STO THREADED BARRELS ARE EXTRA THE PISTOLS COME WITH THE FACTORY BARRELS NOT IN THE PICS[/span]  The info and prices are listed below the pistol info.  I like these alot but I need to pay some debt off so I am selling a few things. NO TRADES.  I travel to Norman often.

XDm 9mm 4.5 Bitone with Dawson Precision Adjustable Night sights.  Both front and rear are Tritium Night SIghts.  The trigger has had a trigger Job by Springer Precision.  The trigger face was also rounded/smoothed by Springer Precision.  Measured from about the middle of the trigger where my finger usually rests it breaks at 4.5lbs (measures about 4lbs from the very tip), but what is really nice is the takeup and reset are much shorter.  The factory barrel that it comes with has less than 100rds through it.  It also comes with the orginal trigger parts that Springer replaces when they do their work, the original rear sight, the box, manual, 2-19rd mags, and all the XD gear.  Also it will come with one package of 3 PRP striker retaining pins.  

XDm .45 .45 with Dawson Precision Adjustable Night Sights.  The front is a Tritium sight but the rear is a black contrast sight.  I did scuff one side of the front sight up as can be seen in the pics.  It's not bad and can be touched up fairly easily if desired.  The trigger is a PRP Ultimate match trigger kit.  It is very crisp and breaks at 4lbs measured from the center of the trigger where my fingure rests (measures 3.5lbs from the very tip).  The reset and takeup are very short.  This is my favorite non 1911 trigger by far.  It also comes with the original sights, the original trigger parts, 2-13rd mags, the xd gear, box, manual, 3 PRP striker retaining pins.  The factory barrel has less than 100rds through it.  I am throwing in a Serpa holster with this. 

Both barrels are Bar Sto match extended threaded barrels.  9mm is threaded 1/2X28 .45 is .578X28  I would estimate each barrel has about 500rds through them. These barrels were $300 from Springer Precision ($215 plus $85 for threading).  IMHO Bar Sto is about the best you can get.    The 9mm barrel comes with a stainless bead blast finished thread protector.  The .45 barrel comes with a black oxide finished thread protector.  I will not sell them seperate until my pistols sell first. 
PRICE IS $175 EACH on top of the pistol price

Secant Ogive Design

Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting.

The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy."

This AR15 is made from a Gas Piston PWS [complete] upper.  There are the top of the line when it comes to Gas Piston ARs.
This is the upper: http://primaryweapons.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=442&idcategory=44

You can not legally own a smaller rifle in WA state than this. 16"" overall length. 14.5"" barrel with a pinned and welded brake for a 16"" OAL. Since SBRs are 100% illegal in WA (can't even get a tax-stamp for them here) this is as short as you can go without the 'pistol' nonesense.

Chambered in .223 Wylde -- it'll shoot .223 and 5.56 without a simple issue. This upper is absolutely incredible.

Lower is from Spike's Tactical with a Geissele trigger.
I am the second owner. Original owner had this made by professional gunsmiths at West Coast Armory in Bellevue. He fired it one time. I have since put exactly 110 rounds down her. She shoots light and incredibly accurate.
Included is a Condor bag (rifle is so short I have to extend the stock all the way for both internal velcro straps to fit!), 4 Gen3 PMAGS, and I'll toss in 30 rounds.
