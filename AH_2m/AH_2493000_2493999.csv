This is new factory ammo from federal… not reloads sold as new as some others have done. I no longer have a need for this ammo as I now distance shoot with another caliber. This ammo goes anywhere from $33 to $44 a box depending on where you buy it. If you have bought this ammo before you know what I’m talking about and if not… take a look online for the best price. I was only able to find two places that had it in stock online and no store local that had it for a reasonable price. The only two places I did find that had it were selling it for $39 and $44 for a box of 20. Online I found AmmoMan at $1.75 per round and MidwayUSA at $1.65 per round. 

I am selling this ammo for $1.57 a round or $220 for all seven boxes. No tax… no shipping… just $31.42 a box. I paid more for some boxes than I did others but my average after the ammo crunch was around $1.65 a round. This is the best ammo you can find for accuracy. It is what most LE agencies use and is the round that most others are compared to. The price is firm.

It is a Midwest Industries rail that is still being sold now. It is not the Gen2 with the rail section that goes over the delta ring (didn’t want that one as any rail on a delta ring tends to move and would mess with the zero…). 

I had this on the rifle for a while and when I sold it the guy had all sorts of parts he already bought to put on so I pulled it off and put it in the safe. This is a 2 piece carbine length quad rail that fits any carbine size rifle with a delta ring (the cone shaped ring in front of the receiver that holds the fore end on). It still sells for around $120 on Amazon and eBay. This is not one of the cheap Chinese knock-offs that you see at gun shows or online for $50, this is a Made in America Midwest Industries quality rail. This is what comes with the quad rail, a $20 Magpul RVG grip and $30 in Blackhawk ladder style protective rail covers.

This thing is in virtually new condition with no scratches or dinged up rail sections. You could put it on a table with other new ones and you could not tell the difference. I am willing to sell this with or without all of the attached equipment. I am asking $100 for all of the stuff listed above or $80 for the rail alone. This price is more than fair for what you are getting so please don’t send any lowball offers as I will put it back in the safe before I just give it away. 

If you are interested I live in the Raleigh/Clayton area but I also travel for a living so travel between Winston-Salem and Wilmington on a regular basis so pickup should be easy. If you are interested please let me know and thanks for looking."

I bought this new for $450 (before the X series came out) and would like to recovery some of the money I have in it. I am selling this now because I have switched optics and have no reason to keep it. However, I will not take any lowball offers and will just put it back in the safe before I give it away.

I purchased this sight a year or so back to use in Night Shoots at PSR37. I don’t use the laser option very often and wanted the max lumens so I upgraded to the 600 lumen version. It is in great shape and still puts out 300 lumens of light. The laser is adjustable and works in concert with the light very well. It will attach to any type Picitinny rail and has four inserts for a perfect fit to Glock, Springfield, Beretta or any pistol you may have as well as the 1913 Rail that you see on AR15 rifles. This works great on the bottom rail of a handguard on any rifle.

It comes with the light and the four most popular rail mount adapters. The Glock (Fits Glock, S&W, Sig and Springfield Armory), 90TWO (Fits Beretta and all other rails that the Glock does not) and a 29 (I have no idea what that fits but here it is).

This light/laser still sells for $250 on Amazon and eBay and much more on some of the bigger sporting goods / gun sites. It is in great condition but has obviously been used. The only marks on the sight are on the locking screw. I used a quarter before I learned it took a nickel to tighten so there are some small scratches on the inside as you can see from the picture. I am offering this for $175 and will not take any lowball offers. I still like it and will just toss it back in the safe before I give it away.

Patented friction reducing cam is the next generation design in fire control systems with an optimized cam that results in a smooth, non-stacking trigger pull.

High-Strength stainless steel cylinder is extensively fluted (reducing weight) and features an Ionbond Diamondblack™ finish for excellent durability.
Grip Peg allows a variety of grip styles to be installed, leaving ample room for recoil cushioning. Standard model has a Hogue® Tamer™ grip, which is highly effective at reducing felt recoil - LCR also available with Crimson Trace® Lasergrips®.
LCRx™ model features an external hammer that allows it to be fired in single-action mode.
Crimson Trace® models allow for fast and positive target acquisition, and offer the advantage of a laser sighting system in a more compact grip. Note: Some speed loaders may not be compatible with Crimson Trace® models.

292,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2493292,For Sale:  Streamlight PolyTac Flashlight and Rail Adapter,"Raleigh/Clayton, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 50,"Listed On: Monday, January 6, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling this Streamlight Polytac 88850 Flashlight with a tactical offset rail adapter. This is a slick little setup that took me a while to figure out the best way to mount a flashlight on an AR15. From the pic you can see that it is mounted on the top rail of the quad at the end. It sits right beside the front sight post so there is no shadow in front of the shooter. I went through quite a few variations to find the right seat for the light so it is in the 11 o’clock position (natural for the right handed shooter to activate with the left thumb). The mount fits any AR type rail and is easily put on with a thumb adjusted screw. This light is bright. And when I say bright I mean… don’t accidently shine it in someones face... They will not be able to see for a while… It in an LED, not Xenon bulb, that takes two CR123 batteries and has the tail cap push button for momentary or click for “ON”. Again… this is an LED and not Xenon so you don’t need to worry about destroying the bulb when you have it mounted on an AR (Xenon bulbs sometimes break when on AR’s while shooting). They are selling this exact setup now with the Xenon bulb for $49. This is the brighter 88850 LED with a mount included. I paid $47 for the light alone without tax at a gun show and $16 for the offset mount. I no longer have a need for it since I went with a 600 lumen light/laser combo so I am willing to sell it for $50. You would be hard pressed to find the light alone selling for that in a gun store and definitely not one with a mount. So no shipping, no tax and it is yours for $50.

I bought this scope because of the price a few years ago to hunt with on a .270 Savage that I knew was probably going to get scraped, dropped, wet and muddy. Luckily it did not but I didn’t want to spend $300 on a scope that might take a swim. The scope works great and is very clear in low light. It has a reticle I think is called multi-x. It has thick lines right up to the middle and then it goes very thin to a nice crosshair. I was truly impressed on the clarity of this scope, its ability to hold a dead zero for years on end and that it had finger adjustable windage and elevation that I could ACTUALLY ADJUST WITH MY FINGERS. I sold the rifle but decided to keep the scope and maybe use it on another rifle but after a few years of it just sitting there… I think it’s time to sell it. It comes with butler creek flip up lens covers and a set of Stainless Steel rings. It does not have a scratch on it and the glass looks as good now as the day I bought it. This thing truly looks good and is a great scope for the money. I think I paid something like $79 when it was new, $20 for the rings and $20 for the flip up butler creek lens covers. I would like to sell it for $60 and I think that’s a fair price for what you are getting. This would be perfect for that first time hunter, a rifle you plan on being rough with or just a good scope for cheap.

Please do not send any lowball offers for this scope as I still like it quite a bit and would throw it back in the safe for another few years rather than just give it away as it’s worth every penny of $60.

Star Model BM 9mm 
This is a colt commander style 1911 9mm and is a gooc conceal carry although is heavy as it is all metal.


cz83 value is 330 about
star bm value is 300
So 630. 
I will do some gunbroker and gunsameraica for listings

They both shoot nice and I like both of them. have only had them a few days.


Has one magazine it came with. I shot this on the 26th and had a lot of fun with it. This pistol i just got a few days ago. I took it apart and cleaned and frog lubricated it. The pistol has wear as you would expect from an imported firearm. 


Email me with offers and cell number to contact with.
Local cash only please. We would meet at Scheels as that is the side of town that I am on. drivers and buyers permit required to show me.

This cz83 pistol in .32 acp 7.65 browning make a great concel carry pistol. I still even have the rest of the 50 round box of ammo I will gift you. I think there is around half of it in the box. It has one magazine. 

I would rather sell both of these at the same time, but will separate. 


The other pistol is  Star model BM 9mm made in Spain. I have as well cleaned and frog lubricated this one. It shoots great. Has a nice trigger action on it and is built very solid.
Both of these are all metal construction and are in nice condition.

The cz83 .32 acp has a date stamp of 1994.
The Star BM if memory serves me is 1996 but do not hold me to it. I will have to think and look. I thought i had determined 96 sticks in my mind for some reason.

Listing is set at 660 but as always cash talks and sales continue like they always do. I buy and sell often just so i can try new things, do reviews on them. Shoot them a while and resell them to buy other items.

Please email me with a cell number to call and discuss. if any other questions ask. I will image these as i can."

I took the action out of the rifle to put in an AR15 Clone and have had it sitting in the closet for a few years. The barrel and stock are in brand new condition. I fired maybe 100 to 200 rounds through the original barrel and then changed it to the AR Clone with a bull barrel. They are in great, almost new, condition and would make any action look like a new gun.

To be clear, I am only selling a barrel, stock and barrel band. There is no action to this rifle so there is no FFL transfer required. The barrel is standard tapered and the stock is walnut I believe. I have attached a picture so you can see what you are buying. I have seen the barrels alone going for $40-$50 and the factory wood stocks anywhere from $20-$80. If you don’t believe me just go to Amazon, eBay and other Armslist pages. The cheapest I have seen the entire rifles selling for is $220 and most of the time those are the plastic stock models. I am asking only $60 for both the stock and barrel. Take a look at the pics and if you are interested and see them in person you will know this is a deal. Again, This is for a standard factory tapered barrel (sights attached), factory wood stock and barrel band only.

Pistol cartridge lever-actions have had attention of the American public since the days of the Old West when having a rifle and pistol that shoot the same caliber just made sense.

There are numerous variations-rifles, carbines, standard loop, oversized loop-including Rossi's Model '92 hybrid-the Ranch Hand. The Ranch Hand is available in three popular pistol rounds- .38 Spl./.357 Mag., .44 Mag. and .45 Colt.

The Ranch Hand's 12-inch barrel complies with federal regulations, and features a gold-bead front sight with an adjustable buckhorn rear sight and an oversized loop lever.

347,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2493347,For Sale:  Smith & Wesson Leather Holster B44 62,"Raleigh/Clayton, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina",$ 25,"Listed On: Friday, December 27, 2013",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is for a vintage Smith & Wesson B44 62 Leather Pancake Style Holster. The markings on this holster are B44 62. I had to do a lot of research on the internet to figure out what exactly this thing was made for and the B44 represents that it is a black holster model 44 which is the pancake style with a thumb break retention strap. The 62 means that it was designed to fit a “J” frame revolver with a 2 inch barrel. It is in incredibly good shape and the leather not dried out at all and is very malleable. It does not look like it was used very much and just sat in his safe for years. I was a bit surprised at the quality of the construction and how clean the edges are. It looks to be very well made and of good grade of leather and kind of reminds me of the old school detective holsters where they carried small snubbie revolvers. I seriously can’t figure out why he might have had this unless it was a gun he had and sold before I got into guns with him. Since it seems to have no relation to anything he had or left us I feel comfortable selling it to someone who will appreciate it. During my research I found that these holsters were made in the 70’s and 80’s in a Smith & Wesson plant here in North Carolina. They have since moved to another factory but below is the explanation on the holster design:

--- The first two numbers are the model holster, in this case a #44 Pancake. The second two numbers are the frame size and barrel length. 62 is 2"" J frames, Charter Arms Undercover, Wesson 11 - 15 or any of the small H&R's. Most of the 62 codes will also take a Detective Special. A ""B"" in front of the numbers means black as opposed to russet. A ""W"" following the numbers means basket weave and a ""C"" means flower carved.--- 

I tried to research a lot of the auction sites to figure out a price for this and it was very difficult. If I were to compare it to a modern holster, the workmanship and style remind me of a Gould and Goodrich or Bianchi.  The only holsters I could find were going anywhere from $30 to $150. I’m sure there is something special about the higher priced ones that I just don’t know but I don’t see anything that rare about this one other than the cool factor. I am asking $25 for the holster. I understand holster fit is a very personal thing so if we do meet for you to look at it there will be no hard feelings if it just isn’t for your gun.

I could say this stock is new in box from the appearance and function and if I put it in your hands you would believe it. However, it has been used. I had it on an AR15 that I did not shoot often that has mostly sat in the safe for the past few years. I just sold that AR and the guy who bought it had another stock he already purchased so I pulled it off and put it back in the safe. I have no use for this and am looking to get $80. 

When I originally bought it I paid close to $120, which was the average sale price was then. When the EMOD came out they dropped the price to around $100 and still sell for that now. This stock has an angled check rest that makes the weld much easier to repeat and comfortable to your cheek. It also has two battery storage compartments running up the sides and a QD attachment point built in to the frame. It has a rubber butt pad that is slightly angled at the bottom which all but eliminates snagging when you are going from the ready position to fire.

If you do not have a commercial buffer tube but still want it let me know. I have one that I can sell you cheaper than you will find in a gun store. 

I think $80 is a more than fair price for the stock considering it is virtually new so please don’t send me a lowball offer. I will put it back in the safe before I just give it away.

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide. Retracting the slide is difficult due to the heavy spring required in this blow-back action. The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand."

The Custom II has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom II is ready for everything from duty carry to recreational shooting and personal defense.

The scope is a 1-4x24 Primary Arms.  The product code is ""PA14X"" on the Primary Arms site.  This scope has a battery powered illuminated recital.  It's a good scope, but what makes it great is the American Defense QD Auto Lock mount  The part name is ""AD-SCOUT-X SCOPE MOUNT"" and can be seen on the AD web site.  I can take it off and put it back on with the flip of a lever, and it returns exactly to zero!  I love it, and it's taken MANY deer and hogs.  But I recently bought a magnifier and the need for this package has passed.  They are both a couple years old and the mount has been clamped to this one scope the whole time...rock solid.

This is a very good combo, and I can totally still use it, so I'm placing the price at a fair point for both of us.  You wouldn't be sorry if you bought this!!!"

Called ""the AK of pistols"" because it goes bang every time. I'm not one to torture test my guns, but I have loaded with hp, and fmj rounds of diverse weights, and they've gone through like nothing. 
It's accurate. Minute of empty beer bottle at 15 yards. 
Downside is it's heavy. If you think having a blackjack after you shoot your 9 is a downside. And recoil is nothing. 
Ammo is a bit under .380, and it's a better round. The good thing is that prices for it have stayed the same, even throuought the scares. They've even gone down a bit."

Other competitors were the HK45 and the FN45.  One requirement to be eligible for the contract was that the pistol have a 1913 rail.  The military cancelled funding for the program before selecting a pistol, so Glock took the 21SFs that they had already made and sold them on the civilian market.  They didn't produce anymore of them and there wasn't a large amount of them sold because most people didn't even know it was available.  This pistol is in excellent shape.
