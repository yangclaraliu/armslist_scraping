2,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2288002,For Sale/Trade:  Vertical Bipod by GripPod Industries.,"Lake Mary Area, Flagstaff, Arizona",$ 45,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 16, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Grip-pod LE is a Vertical Foregrip system that easily attaches to any picatinny rail system. The heavy polymer clamps ensure a firm weld to the rail, providing a solid vertical grip. But wait there's more! by depressing the button located at the top of the grip, a heavy duty sping powered bi-pod deploys from the base of the grip, providing extra stability and keeping your rail from being damaged by that pile of rocks you would have other wise used as a rest. This grip-pod is made by GPSI (seen here http://www.grippod.com/gsp-le-law-enforcement). This particular model is set to the same durability standard as the military version, but is made from a lighter composite material for law enforcement . These things can be found at several retailers online for close to $100. Well not here! Right now you can get a Grip-pod of your very own for only $45.00. Call within the next 20 minutes and we'll double your order! No, wait that last part isn't true. I only have one to sell. $45/Trade possible."

I initially listed this as an iPhone 5 ""S"" Model until one of my fellow brother/sister in arms corrected me saying that it is an iPhone 5.  So thank you. I intended no misrepresentation (as my pics alone ""exposed"" my ""scam"" lol), it's just that like I had described it was the wife's phone and I am and always have been an Android user so I do not know much about these iPhones. So please do your own research on the iPhone 5 specs/features if considering. 

Wife wanted to make the jump from the Android OS to the new iPhone 5 and after spending a few hours (over the span of 3 weeks) attempting to learn the Apple OS, decided that she wanted to go back to a Droid.  Of course the store had a 15 day exchange/refund policy on the phone, but for some reason that only she (and perhaps other women know) it took her 21 days to make the OFFICIAL determination to go back to a Droid. 

Great...it was hard enough to find the iPhone 5 as it was considering the demand and that it is supposed be the ""top of the line"" iPhone model (with the ""S"" model going for a MUCH higher premium as I have seen prices from $849.00 and up for those, whereas the iPhone 5 can do 90% if not more ""stuff"" that the ""S"" model can....AND YOU DO NOT HAVE TO GIVE UP YOUR FINGERPRINT TO DO SO as the ""S"" ""FEATURE"" has...for your CONVENIENCE OF COURSE) as opposed to the 5 ""C"" and 4 ""S"", but buying the phone outright with NO CONTRACT/NO STRINGS set me back $650.00!!

You can set up service with the following carriers that support this phone:

AT&T 
Verizon
T-Mobile
Sprint

Specs?  Man there are WAY TOO MANY to list here. I highly recommend that should you be interested in this phone to some research on your own.  This phone does pretty much EVERYTHING (with the apps that are available, I really do mean EVERYTHING it's crazy).

This phone is LNIB WITHOUT A SINGLE BLEMISH OR SCRATCH! It is packaged and looks EXACTLY like it would be if you just walked out of the store with it, only you would be paying $100.00 LESS!"

NOT really interested in trades looking more for cash but if you have something as a partial trade maybe interested. First come first serve so let me.know what youd like to do. For quickest response Shoot me an email or  txt REDACTED and Ill txt you back asap. Thanks for looking

1954 laminated Tula arsenal SKS for sale. It is an all matching rifle from bolt carrier (literally - its EP'd and everything else stamped) to the trigger guard and stock. Metal finish is in excellent condition with only one scratch at the pin you rotate down to dissemble the rifle to clean it. Chrome lined barrel, with sharp lands. Crown is in excellent condition. 

Laminated stock is original and not refinished. Stock is in very good condition with one small ding smaller than the size of a pencil eraser. No cracks in the stock. Comes with the original sling for the rifle.

I had recently purchased a 4x scope with mount from another member to use on the rifle, but haven't had an opportunity to do so. This is gonna come with the rifle (As well as the unmolested original rear cover), I also have a few stripper clips I will give you as well. Since I've owned the rifle it's been shot 60 times and then sat in a temperature / humidity controlled safe. 

I looked on gunbroker and found that laminated Russians are listed for $650 and up, to not haggle with a sale and due to the fact I need cash to pay the bills I'm asking for $500 with the scope and $450 without. Please no trades at this time, I really need the cash.

When Colt’s patent on the AR-15 expired, many companies both in the USA and abroad started producing this fine rifle. One of these was a small company called Eagle Arms located in Coal Valley, Illinois. In Duncan Long’s “The Complete AR-/M16 Sourcebook” the author states: “The American company Eagle Arms carries several excellent versions of the AR-15 in its R series of EA-15 rifles. ….These rifles are very well made and surprisingly accurate. This young company appears to be one of the up and coming marketers of AR-15 style guns aimed at police and civilian customers.” It features a manganese phosphate finish with just a few light rubs, a 16 inch barrel with a 1:9 twist and an excellent bore and flash hider, a collapsible stock, a carry handle and an A2 fully adjustable rear sight.

Hamilton Jazzmaster Spirit of Liberty 

 The Jazzmaster Spirit of Liberty celebrates Andrew Hamilton, speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and a staunch campaigner for the freedom of speech. In 1892, the founders of the Hamilton Watch company chose to name their company in his honor. Continuing in that tradition, the Jazzmaster Spirit of Liberty is inscribed with HamiltonÂ’s famous words, Â“without liberty, life is a miseryÂ” on the dial. 



The Jazzmaster Spirit of Liberty of today draws inspiration from marine chronometers produced in the 1940s. Elegant blue hands add to the rich look of the watch, while a sleek black leather strap complements the smart Â“old paperÂ” and black dials. Each model is limited edition to 1892 pieces, the year the Hamilton Watch Company was founded 

The timepieces come in both a Black Dial and a White dial. The Spirit of Liberty retails for $1795.00 



The timepiece sits in a 42mm case, sapphire crystal and stainless steel case with a Lug width of 22mm. The Spirit of Liberty has the new H21 movement - which is unique and released this year to all newer Hamilton timpieces. The H21 has an increased accuracy in time keeping and boasts a 60 hour power reserve!

In 1958 S&W started using letters along with numbers in their serial numbers. It also does not have a model designation... just 44 magnum on the barrel. It is a 5 screw pinned barrel and recessed cylinder model. It has what are referred to as ""coke bottle"" factory grips or Diamond grips. The serial number is stamped on the frame under the grips and on the inside of the barrel shroud. For it being at least 50 years old its in pretty tight and decent shape. Bluing is probably 80 percent in my opinion. On the left side of the frame is a previous owners name and the year 1971 engraved. As S&W told me, even if I wanted them to refinish it they wouldn't, as it would destroy collector value. $999.00 cash or trade, and we can go from there."

The rifle is marked Winchester Model 425 and was made from the 50's until 1970. There is a adjustable trigger and the original factory sights function perfectly. This is a true target pellet rifle that could be used for small game hunting. I've tagged it as a 22 short because they don't offer a category for 5.5 or 22 pellet. Cash or will trade for fishing gear.

Gen 3 or better Night Vision System (NVS), like a PVS-14 / 7 or OPMOD, etc. It can be rail-mounted, helmet / binoc, or even handheld monocular (order of preference). I'm also open to something in FLIR / Thermal as well. Whatever it is, it needs to have some REAL life left in it, not some 10 year old, battle-scarred beater. For the right unit I'm willing to add boot. 

What I HAVE:
One of my AR's is a gorgeous LMT Defender 2000 that has had fewer that 500 rounds put through it (all top-shelf brass, no steel-case crap). I have a few high-end AR's but this is the only one that has been a virtual safe queen. There literally is not a single use mark on it, it looks brand new. It's an all-original LMT, purchased earlier this year, that I have tastefully upgraded with useful, high-end parts -- a Troy Battlesight rear flip-up BUIS (dead-on co-witness), a Troy Carbine-Length quad-rail, an ERGO grip, Spike's billet trigger guard, a Magul CTS buttstock and B.A.D. lever, a LaRue Tactical buffer tube and Tubb Precision spring, and an AIMPOINT PRO up top that co-witnesses with the Troy BUIS and standard front A2 sight post. I think I still have the original LMT box as well, but will have to confirm that.

At **today's** prices this rifle is easily over $2,000 to duplicate, using the best street prices.

This isn't some cheap Rock River, Bushmaster, Windham Walmart rifle or a Frankenbuild. No, this is a beautiful rifle, and is ready to be YOUR go-to battle rifle. If you're interested feel free to email or call. I'm in Northeast Alabama, and I have my own 150-yard rifle range if you want to come by and give her a test-drive. Just bring your NVS along, and we can talk turkey.

I'm NOT interested in selling rifle outright, unless you know someone who has a NVS and he's willing to do a 3-way deal.

The reason I'm selling it is due to the fact that I don't particularly like the short barrel 1911s and didn't really realize that until after I bought it.

The condition of the gun is excellent. I only shot about 100 rounds through it. It comes with three magazines as shown. The factory magazine for some reason is very hard to seat the first round correctly. In the picture below, I try to emphasis that the factory magazine can be seated with a round but just very difficult. You just have to push the guide down and back to load the first round, then you can load normally.

I'm listing it for $700 obo. I am willing to travel reasonably to meet you halfway but you have to be in the state of VA. The price is also negotiable. I am not willing to trade for anything at this time. I will have to see a driver license and a voters card/ccw permit to make the transaction."

I am selling my ARMALITE AR-15 & gear, although it’s been a blast I think I am ready to part ways as it collects dust more than its fired. I am the 2nd owner of the gun, previous owner never fired it, I have put 200-300rds down the pipe. The gun was done right, from the aluminum quad rail to the multi illuminated reticle with German glass and a side mount long distance green dot laser. I have spent a ton of money on it, money which I won’t get back, but no regrets. I am including several magazines – PMAGS – Law Enforcement Mags and a few .22 conversion kit mags. I also have the high end .22 conversion kit with it. I haven’t used but a magazine worth as I have an abundance of ammo, but it does work great with no jams, misfires of any kind. The .223 / 5.56 NATO round goes through the pipe like butter, dead accurate. If you’re looking for a badass rifle, and ton of accessories, look no more. I am also including a 100rd dual drum beta mag, clear front with storage case and graphite lube (this is brand new) I am also including 2000+rds of various ammo, 1000 of that being lake city green tip, the rest is mixed tracers, hollow points, hunting rounds, plastic ballistic tip, to armor piercers. The gun is immaculate, I don’t fire it as much as I should. I am willing to accept partial trades, as I would like to keep some cash for the kids Christmas this December. But also interested in glocks 40, .45 & 9mm, lower end smiths, revolvers ect. Maybe even an AK47 if done right, deer rifle with good optics, cars, trucks, apple laptop, or whatever as long as it is realistic. Don’t lowball me, I have a hell of a lot more than this in it. Asking 3000.00 Cash OBO. I am sure I am forgetting some things, but everything in the photo is included, Thanks & God bless.

It is made in the USA and a copy of the South African design.

* It is chambered in 410 shotshell , 45-70 government rounds, or .45 Long Colt.

* It is officially classified by the ATF as a pistol/revolver that’s why it has no stock or forward pistol grip. I guess in a way you could call it a revolver since the drum does not remove for reloading.

* It holds 12 rounds with a built in drum.

* These units are NOT listed as a destructive device. When the Street Sweeper became listed as a Destructive Device, Cobray used some of their tooling to create the LHC.

* The 45-70 pistols do have a grooved barrel and operates exactly like the 12 gauge units.

* This unit was completely refurbished. The main spring and trigger group were degreased and re- oiled to ensure a long service life. The unit looks and functions like new. Very few of these units exist and this is a wonderful addition to any firearm collection.

* Weighs about 12 pounds, has a 25 lbs trigger pull and can all be release in about 3 seconds.

* Very few of these are on the open market.

* These were made by Cobray, which also produced the Street Sweeper shotgun.

* If you”re wondering why Cobray chose that name (Ladies Home Companion), it’s because the Street Sweeper’s name was partially why it got targeted by politicians. Rather than choose something menacing, they went with something friendly."

This is a great firearm. Comes new unfired from the factory with factory hard case and all factory paper work. Comes with one 30 round magazine. From the factory: The Para Ordnance Tactical Target Upper Assembly features the DIGS (Delayed Impingement Gas System) which makes it the Smallest, Big Rifle in the World. PARA's Tactical Target Rifle (TTR) is the safest shooing, cleanest running rifle because of the DIGS. This revolutionary operating system takes zero time to master and you can instantly start hitting laser-straight shots from any position and you get back on target faster than with any other rifle. DIGS virtually eliminates felt recoil making you the best shot you can be. The Tactical Target Rifle''s gas system not only improves target acquisition but it also keeps the chamber area cleaner.
