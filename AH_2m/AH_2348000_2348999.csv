I bought this gun because i love lever actions and i love this gun but, my wife dont like the action and where i hunt i'm just not good enough shot for this gun with iron sights. I personally dont believe in scopes on a lever action. Most all of my shots hunting are past 100yds. This gun is plenty accurate enough for that and i can do it target practicing but i dont trust myself with it at those ranges. In the transaction im including a lee loader and some rounds. Some are factory and most are reloads. I do NOT overload my rounds. This gun is most accurate with the starting loads out of manuals. No a single load i have made up has been overpressured. The model 94 design will not take the abuse. I will include 100 primers and what i have left in 1 box of hornady 170gr flatnose which are the most accurate and almost all of box of hornady 160gr ftx bullets and will also include about 90 rds worth of leverevolution powder. I will also include some more brass that i have left but it needs full length sized first as it is not out of my gun. I want  around 450 for all of it but i will negotiate on price."

It is in like new condition with the original operator’s manual. The gun has fired very few rounds, probably less than 100. The action is a roller delayed blowback action which is also used by CETME and Heckler & Koch German military rifles. It produces very little barrel climb and recoil. It is quite reliable. The ejection port is out the bottom so it is totally ambidextrous. This model was made years ago, long before modern design plastic guns were in style. It was way ahead of its time in both design and function, to say nothing about the capacity. This unusual, rare gun can be part of your collection. It's sure to be a conversation piece. It's a trip to shoot. It is shown with the 50 round magazine attached.  Package includes the following:

Flash hider ($45)
Scope/laser mount ($90).
Shell catcher ($49) sling swivels.
50 round magazine ($99).

Everything besides the storage container and 2 of the 4 mags are unused. I recently sold my AR15, and therefore no longer have a need for these items. 

The ammo is excellent for home defense and/or hunting. I shot approx. 1200 round of this stuff thru my Colt M4 rifle before I sold it, and it cycled perfectly and was very accurate and dependable. I can say the same for the TAPCO mags as well, although the 4 that are included area essentially brand new. 

The AR15 scope mount is made from a single piece of aircraft aluminum, therefore it is very light and strong. It fits a 1"" scope and has 4 picatinny mounts for additional equipment (such as flashlights, lasers, etc.). It is brand new, unused, factory sealed. I can send additional information if needed. I paid about $60 for it a few mouths back and never installed it. Also come with an Allen key and other accessories.

The price for the entire package is $300. This is pretty much the cost buying just the ammo and getting everything else (approx. $165) for free. I am really not looking to separate this package. 

Must be at least 18 years of age. FTF only, no shipping. Willing to meet in the greater Akron area. Might consider trades for a semi-auto 9mm pistol."

Both loads are using high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated a flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the equivalent of +P+ 45 ACP ammo or as it is also known, 45 Super. These are very stout loads, but will not harm modern 45 ACP revolvers, nor will these loads harm any post war 45 ACP revolvers. Feel free to safely shoot these loads in any post war 45 ACP revolver that is in normal good operating condition.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun gives speeds almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 and 6.5 inch barrels. This is NOT a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel. Also, we are aware that the 1937 manufactured model 1917 we used as a test gun, (see below velocity chart) is not post war.

Item # 32A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 1031 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 945 FPS
S&W model 1917 (1937 Production) 5.5 inch bbl = 1043 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 1070 FPS

Item # 32A - was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot right through stick frame and drywall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 30 inches of penetration on live flesh and bone."

(Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor Defense feature a patent-bearing, gas piston system with a free-float barrel for increased accuracy. This is due to the piston's incorporation into the upper half of the forward rail system - so it never touches the barrel. Extremely close machine tolerances eliminate the need for piston rings. The B.E.A.R. offers a multi-position gas regulator with a removable gas tube. The piston's cyclical rate adjusts with a turn of the gas plug located in the front piston assembly. Because diminished heat reaches the upper, hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Due to superior design, the B.E.A.R. has no carrier tilt and low fouling of the chamber and action. The ejection port wiper prevents the entry of dust, sand and other debris by moving into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver. The spring loaded shield allows the bolt carrier to return to ready position. Being made of a highly durable, self-lubricating polymer helps the shield withstand temperature extremes. The original B.E.A.R. AR-15 carbine features a 16"" chrome-lined barrel from Green Mountain, button-broached with a 1:7 twist. It has a two-piece key-locked, highly-rigid quad-rail system made of aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy that seamlessly mounts to the upper receiver which is made from the same aircraft-grade 7075-T6 aluminum alloy. The upper and lower rails separate with the push of a button - no special tools required. The B.E.A.R. has an adjustable stock which goes from 36.25"" down to 32.5,"" and overall total weight is 7.05 lbs. These models include both the standard AR-15 rear charging handle and a forward, ambidextrous charging handle which is cleverly hidden in a recess on the receiver.

With a toolless field strip design, a B.E.A.R. requires nothing more than a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong.

The P-64 is a blowback operated, double-action pistol. Although designed from scratch by Polish engineers, the P-64 is very similar to German Walther PPK and is sometimes described erroneous in western literature as it's clone.

Frame and slide are made of steel and the finish is blue. The barrel is fixed to the frame with the recoil spring wound around it. The controls consist of a slide mounted safety lever and a magazine catch. The safety lever has two positions: up for ""fire"" and down for ""safe"" and decocks the hammer (if cocked) when put on safe. The safety mechanism allows the slide to be operated with safety on. Unlike the Walther, the P-64's magazine release is located at the bottom of the frame. The single-column magazines hold 6 rounds. The slides locks back when the last round from the magazine is fired but there is no external slide release. Double-action/Single Action. The sights are fixed.  A loaded-chamber indicator is located in the rear part of the slide, just above the hammer. Grips are checkered black plastic."

I have original receipt and all paper work that came with it. Due to my father's passing I have acquired a 9mm that was his and I have no need for 2 so I am looking to sell the one I just bought . I have a full box of Speer Gold Dot personal protection ammo that I also bought at Gander Mountain for  $30 and I have a brand new Fobus paddle holster to go with it that I paid $35 for. So that gives me  $415 invested in package. I will accept any reasonable offer or I will consider other guns that you may be interested in trading. I don't have a camera right now but I can text you a picture of anything you may want to see. Thank You

This is the nicest one I have ever seen, It rotates to allow you to pull gun esker. Nothing else like it on the market that I have seen. It also conceals better by being vertical. I think it fits a few guns but I bought it to use with my Springfield XD 40 Subcompact, Fits perfect!
Here's the info from their site:
Our holsters are designed to fit a 1 1/2"" belt, if you need a holster for a different belt size, please specify it in your order details.

Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iej2iWm8kyo&feature=player_embedded

The holster is made from quality hand-molded leather for a perfect fit. The rotating function provides a better cant of the holster for drawing after releasing the thumb break. Security is provided by a steel-reinforced thumb break.

This shoulder holster comes with a shoulder harness and is available in right and left-handed models, in black or brown.
Contains vertical shoulder holster and shoulder harness
Tipping function provides better cant for draw
Entire barrel is covered, open muzzle design
Hand-molded leather

Please note: 
All Falco holsters are hand-made and are available for a very wide range of pistols and revolvers. Each product is custom made for a specific gun model.

To guarantee the shortest handling time, we hold in stock over 1,500 pre-made holsters. However, since there are so many gun / holster / color combinations, many orders need to be custom produced and have a longer handling time (max. 25 – 35 business days). Thank you for your understanding.

If you are not satisfied with any Falco holster, we will exchange it for a new one or refund you the cost of product.

All new holsters have a tight fit until broken in (this can take one day of wearing)."

I've only fired 50 rounds at the range through this outstandingly well made semi-auto handgun. I cleaned it immediately after firing and it has been sitting well oiled in its case for several months. This pistol is in perfect condition and not a scratch on it. I am listing this pistol as used only because I fired 50 rounds through it. Comes with original Remington fitted plastic gun case, unused lock, 2 stock 8-round magazines, original paperwork and user manual all in perfect condition. Please ignore the date on the pictures.

I have a 1970 P-64 9mm makarov pistol for sale. It is in amazing condition and fires accurately and reliably. It eats anything from hornady critical defense ammo down to monarch steel case round nose. This gun comes with a total of three mags, two original soviet holsters, and two cleaning rods. I also have approximately 250 rds of ammo, including most of a box of hornady defensive ammo for carry.  This gun is dual action/single action and is basically a soviet copy of the walther ppk. There is nothing wrong with this gun, but i'm kinda looking to unload my red army collection. It does have CAI import marking on the left side of the slide but it doesn't detract from the quality of this gun. It still has the original springs as i prefer them to the wolff setup. 

I'm really wanting to sell it outright but i'll entertain trade offers. For questions email me or call/text me at REDACTED. I'd prefer to sell to a cwp holder but not necessary. 

I'm asking $375 or best offer for the complete setup with ammo"

I do have more of this ammunition if you would like up to 800 rounds. If so I can make a better deal on it. 
For sale is 600 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"".

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat.

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now.

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping.

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

This revolver is in great shape for a firearm of it's age and the nickle plating is intact. The hammer seems to have broken at some point and was brazed back together.

I took it in trade a while back and intended to do a restoration on it but just haven't had the time to do more than look at it. You can still see engraving on the sides and I think a molasses dip on the metal would bring it back amazingly. It is complete except for the ramrod which is just gone. I only have the gun itself, no accessories and nothing to make it go boom.

A good cleaning would help tremendously as it was used (literally) as a closet rod for the last 50 years.

Nice gun, this one has the heavier slide if you wanted to do the Sig .357 conversion. With it being the Inox model the gun won't oxidize easily giving it a long life of beauty. 
If you are interested I will meet you at a gun store of my choice, you can inspect the gun. You will pay me $100.00 deposit and if you don't pass the background I keep the deposit. After background is complete you pay me the rest and it's yours. The gun comes with 2 11 round magazines, and a black DeSantis holster."

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing."

The new SX-AR is a heavy barreled FNAR in a Mossy Oak camo finish but without the side rails and full length top rail (interestingly the bottom rail remains). It comes full circle, taking the tactical FNAR improvements back to the hunting market.

As stated in the title, I have 6,000 rounds I am selling in one package. At this time I am not interested in partial sales or trades, the price is cash only for the whole lot. 3,800 of it is Remington Thunderbolt 40 gr. lead round nose (This is sweet shooting ammo) and 2,200 of it is Remington Golden Bullet 36 gr. brass plated hp. I bought all of these during a similar ammo shortage at premium prices in the Fall of 2009. I am only selling because I was recently laid off and money is getting tight around the holidays, bad timing. So unfortunately it must go. Take advantage of a great (and quite frankly rare, considering the dismal state of ammo availability) opportunity to buy 6,000 rounds at once without online gouging or shipping costs. Willing to meet you in and around the Beaverton/ Tigard area. A perfect X-Mas or holiday gift for the .22 enthusiast or add to your own cache! 

As you can see in the photos, I have removed all from the original packaging and sorted them out into Ziploc bags of about 200 each. My idea was it is convenient for range trips and long term storage.

Let's get to the price. I'm asking $425 for everything. That is about 7 cents per round. I encourage you to see if you could find a similar price with this quantity and without shipping cost incurred from ordering online. I scoured it myself and came up with nothing, if you can even FIND 6k of .22lr available at all. I genuinely believe this to be a fair price all things considering, so I am relatively firm on that figure, but I will entertain other offers as necessary. 

I will try to respond to serious buyers as soon as I can. If I receive a lot of emails, I will just go down in order until I find a buyer, to be fair. If I don't reply by the end of the day its probably because I already sold it. 

Anyway, thanks for your interest and let me know if you want it!!"
