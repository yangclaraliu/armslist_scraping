Bought it originally used, so there is a scuff or two like you can see on the one grip but there is no rust on it and bore is very good. Has a Hougue grip on it and have re-painted the sights to be bright and prominent. Shoots very accurately, I think this is on account of the barrel being fixed to the frame instead of free floating. Very similar to the bersa thunder from what I've heard and makes a good carry gun. 
Trading because I got another 380 pistol recently and want to get a 9mm pistol to keep my collection varied in terms of caliber. Also have a decent amount of ammo so am will to trade some of it for 9mm ammo as well if wanted. My local shop I go to is ready, aim, fire and I believe they charge 40 per transfer, so willing to cover half. If you know of a local shop you prefer more let me know."

The back of the neck appears to be original play-wear. The repair was made in the mid 90's and has been played and is very stable. Multiple machines have been placed on the headstock, but the original screw holes and all other holes are in good shape and able to be utilized. Non-original nut, but broken original will be included. The holes for the tuners are warbled out a bit from the wrong machines being used at one time. $2,500

In the year 1902 the Model 1886, the strongest of the Winchester lever action rifles, was adapted to a new smokeless powder medium bore cartridge called the .33 Winchester (or .33 WCF, for ""Winchester Center Fire"").

It’s built as two pieces then linear welded so that the seems are stronger than the parent material.  It has a longer service life, as Nylon6 resists impacts and wear better than aluminum.  The integrated buffer tube, pistol grip and fixed stock give this design its strength.  The stock design also widens near the charging handle giving a solid repeatable cheekweld ideal for anyone who cares about marksmanship.

manufactured by Ceska Zbrojovka in the Czech Republic

From Milan trkulia

You asking the right person as I was right on middle of it, when the Colt Z 40 happened. 
Beside myself, another two persons you know very well, were instrumental in Colt Z or CZ .40 B project. It was Ira Kay and Kerby Smith. I will send you a copy of Ira Kay's e-mail from September 18th, 1997 describing chronology of the Colt/CZ relationship involving COLT Z/CZ.40 B projects.This is if I manage to find it.
Just remember, there was just one significant specification put forward by the Colt people - this pistol must bear exterior similarity with the the Colt 1911. It was just a verbal request, nothing was written down or signed on this design matter. We just shook the hands. That was it! All another work was left on the CZ engineers. Shape of the pistol was designed by the Industrial Architect Vojtech Anderle (also author of CZ 100 design), and all interior mechanism works on Colt Z .40 was done by Radek Hauerland, who also worked with me later on CZ 2075 RAMI project. Your statement is absolutely correct, the Colt Z 40/CZ.40B pistol mechanism was fully adopted from CZ 75 line of pistols. After CZ/Colt deal collapse, pistol was made by CZ for an another customers, but in limited numbers. When Radek Hauerland worked on trigger mechanism for COLT Z .40, he at the same time got ready SA/DA and Decocker versions of this pistols. Therefore it was easy to later produce all these trigger mechanism versions, and also the caliber conversion down from .40 to 9x19 was very easy to make. Beside the Colt Z.40 and CZ .40 B pistols, there was an another model based on COLT Z .40 design produced in 9 x 19 cal and called the CZ LE 9.

a very accurate pistol - recoil is very manageable for quick follow-up shots

I have added a fore grip with a lower accessory rail. Fires 223 rounds. The bonus to these PLR-16's is that a true AR-15 platform would have the bolt extend past the grip. These are made slightly more compact and aesthetically pleasing by making the bolt and blow back system end just before the grip, giving it a true pistol feel and look while still performing like an AR-15. This gun is tons of fun to fire, but has only had 50 rounds through it, has been well maintained and kept in a dry, temperate environment it's entire life. I have priced this at $900 because it comes with;
1- PLR-16 with added fore grip and lower accessory rail to accommodate your choice of two accessories, one on top and another under the front of the barrel.
3- high capacity 30 round banana clips, and a 10 round california clip.
1- custom made, tight fit, impact resistant travel case that was hand made and sells for $600 and can't be ordered from any store. They are custom ordered and built by hand to a tight custom fit, light weight yet adding enough protection to take an impact strong enough to destroy a gun in a normal case without so much as a scratch to the firearm.

The great part about the after market stock is that it has two positions for the butt stock. A slanted butt stock so u can look through the sites. And a straight butt stock for a scope. Also it is a adjustable stock so it fits longer people. ( witch is one of the reasons I bought it)
Comes with a Colt tactical case that is great for this gun.
There is no damage to this rifle and is very dependable.
I'll throw in a broken scope just because I don't know what's wrong with it. it maybe a simple fix.

Test fire date from factory is 6-23-13.  Here is the info from Glock's Website:

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Has a Leopold VX-3, 3.5-10x50mm illuminated duplex scope. The scope is awesome. Once it gets to low light conditions you can turn on the crosshairs and they light up. The brightness is adjustable between 1-8. It the clearest Leopold I've ever owned. I've got another on just like it on another rifle. Basically if you can see the target you can accurately shoot it because you can always see the crosshairs. Rifle shoots great. The dura touch stock absorbs most of the recoil. My 11yr old son can shoot it so it would make a great rifle for a preteen hunter.  I can include ammo for the right deal. I have a box of Hornady SST, about 30 Barnes triple shock and 30 assorted corlocks.  The rifle is in great shape. The only reason I'm selling it is because I've got another project in mind. I would like to get $1400 but I'll take  $1100. Serious offers will be considered.

It has a collapsible butt-stock, rail system on top right and bottom sides of for grip, Truglo Red dot sight mounted, the new pistol grip allows the allen key for the sights to stay in it, and a flash light with strobe function zip tied to it.  The safety has been cut to lock the bolt to the rear.  I painted the safety red for personal taste, but an easy correction if you think it makes it look like and airsoft gun.

Its a very fun gun as far as ak-47s and 223 rifles go.  Very reliable gun and was very accurate with its own iron sights at 200 yards, never got to test it further out.
