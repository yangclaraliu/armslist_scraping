Has a very nice light trigger, Wilson barrel, tired but nice mmc night sights(vials can be replace) The only things left that are para ordnance are the slide and frame.  All the internals are upgraded and top quality. 

It has use marks and is definitely not a safe queen.   I have several mags that I can part with depending on the deal.  

I don't need to sell this gun.  I don't carry it any longer and thought I would look for a trade or partial trade for something I might use.

It is now in an ATI camo stock, has an ATI bent bolt kit, ATI scope mount, and Tasco 3x9-40 scope. The gun comes as pictured, the bayonet lug is there but the bayonet is not (doesn't work with aftermarket stock). The finish on the top of the receiver and some of the barrel has worn off (as pictured) but doesn't effect operation. The bolt/receiver numbers do not match, but the bolt runs smooth. Trigger feels great. The bore is a little dark, but the rifling is strong (the usual for a nagant). Would make an excellent hunting/woods gun on the cheap.

It has been well maintained and cared for with cleaning after each time it has been out. The rifle has run flawlessly with not a single malfunction yet granted it is a low round count gun. It has been shot as a target rifle mostly but has also had 20 rounds through it quickly as a function check for operation at speed, not a hiccup.

    AMD Radeon 6770M 1 GB graphics processor

Apple has paved market trends for several years. With the discontinuation of Macbook Pro 17-inch, the market inches closer to slimmer and lighter mobile devices. Bigger notebooks are certainly cumbersome, but they hold certain advantages over its smaller counterparts.

Decided loading really isn't for me and going to try to recoup some of the money spent.

First, the loadmaster itself is in great condition, I have loaded at most 1,000 rounds with it flawlessly.  I did need to watch some of the video’s to get it tuned in properly, but once it was set it was ready to go.

This was purchased as a 223 kit, and then I bought everything needed to convert it to a 9mm and 45 (Small Rifle, Large Pistol, Small Pistol)

Accessories include everything pictured plus:

Case Collector
Primer Shield
Small Primer Feed
Large Primer Feed
Small Pistol Case Feed
Large Pistol Case Feed
Rifle Case Feed
2 extra turrets
Plates for 9mm, 45, and 223

All in all it’s a fantastic press and I am sad to see it go, I just don’t see the point in having a brand new press in my garage that I will never use.

For the dies I have:
The 223 kit that comes with the press
4 piece 9mm Kit
4 piece 45 kit
Universal decapper die


Basically, everything you need to load small rifle, and all pistol calibers. 

Due to the size and weight I would prefer to do this face to face, I can ship it but I am willing to bet shipping will be up near $50 – 75.  I would also have to dissemble it, and it is set to go right now.

There are 4 small Blemishes total.   I cracked one of the small pistol case feeders, it still works great, just the very end got stuck in the press, and I don’t really pay attention to the right side… crack.   Second, the ramp that the flipper rides on had a bur in it from the factory.  I had to sand it down a bit to make it smooth, overall it is now much better.   The 9mm decaping die has some scratches on the top of it from trying to remove the decapper.  It didn’t come with enough screws, so one of the holders on the bottom is lose and I used those screws to attach the 2nd bin.  Easy enough to switch back if you want it that way, I just find a bin on the left to be very easy.


Price is $325 OBO for everything.
Most of the stuff came from Amazon – I can provide receipts for just about all of it, minus a few things I grabbed from Ebay."

Hey everyone, 
I have up for sale a used taurus pt-22 22 lr pistol. It is a great little pistol and shoots good. Only thing is it doesnt like the cheap bulk ammo I had. So it liked to not feed the second round after the one put straight into the barrel. I am pretty sure it was the kind of ammo because when I ran 25 rounds of good stuff through it, it had zero issues. Either way, it is a fantastic little gun that is really ""pretty"" and shoots great. This is a great way to get a small little pistol to conceal and a great gun to take fishing as a snake popper. Would be fantastic for conceal or a backup. This is the less common black, gold, and rosewood model. This will come with one magazine, the gun, and possible ammunition for the right offer. This will be as is, so please message me with any questions you may have. Also, I think I am being pretty reasonable on price being as buds has the same one for 249 out of stock, and academy has the same thing with green palstic handle for 269. So please dont lowball me or waste our times. 
Any questions or for offers please text me at REDACTED and we can try to make a deal. I also have pictures on my phone that wont upload for some reason, so if they dont load here please just message me and I will shoot you some that way.

Possible trades include guns, large quantities of ammo, partial trades, certain ATT LTE smartphones. Honestly, just message me with what you have and worse I can say is no!"

849,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2285849,"For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES .45 ACP +P LEAD FREE - 185 GR. TAC-XP LOW FLASH (1,150 FPS) - 20 ROUND BOX","azusa, California, United States",$ 38,"Listed On: Friday, November 1, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=299

This load is a very high performance +P 45 acp load. The 185gr. hollow cavity Barnes all copper bullet mushrooms readily and still penetrates deeply for such a light bullet, while giving the low recoil and high velocity of a light bullet. This helps fast sight acquisition for quick/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 13 to 14 inches of penetration in flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a low flash powder which gives an important tactical advantage to the shooter as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Being blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As usual, Buffalo Bore tests and obtains our advertised velocities from real world over-the-counter firearms. We believe that the industry wide established practice of utilizing extra long test barrels to generate advertised velocities is dishonest and creates expectations that cannot be realized in real guns, in the real world, where it matters. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll actually obtain the velocities we advertise.

1193 fps -- Colt Series 90 Gold Cup, 5 inch
1183 fps -- H&K, USP Tactical, 5 inch
1158 fps -- Glock Model 21, 4.6 inch
1159 fps -- Colt series 80 Commander, 4.25 inch
1110 fps -- Glock model 30, 3.5 inch


In one of the above instances, you’ll note that a longer barrel gave velocities lower than one of the shorter barrels, showing that there is more to internal ballistics, than just barrel length.

This load reliably fed and exhibited very good accuracy in all test pistols."

This particular specimen is one of the very early ones that was most likely made for the local Israeli market but ended up being imported by Magnum Research. It maintains it's original name without the typical ""Baby Eagle"" nomenclature that is now common. It also has the frame mounted safety and appears to have polygonal barrel rifling, both found only on the first ones to come stateside. I believe this one came ashore around 1998. Please note that Armslist only allows me a manufacturer choice of Israeli Weapons Industries (IWI), this pistol was made by Israeli MILITARY Industries (IMI).

The pistol is built like a tank. It's fitted with 3-dot white sights. It's in remarkably good cosmetic condition. The action is super smooth with no slop, the trigger is one of the best factory triggers I've come across. I'm not the original owner so I have no idea of round count, it sure looks like it sat around more than it was fired. Only selling because I'm heavy 9mm handguns right now.

Sale includes pistol with two factory 10 round magazines and the original box.

I am including the scope and mount, which are an NC star illuminated reticle scope and Leopold see through mount.  They are easily removable and never need to be re-zeroed. I am including an Otis AR-15 cleaning kit, owners manual, and the original sling (if I can find it).  The gun is pretty much factory except for the front sight, and pistol grip with hidden compartment.  I have almost 1000 rounds to include with it, over 800 of which are Wolf 62 grain FMJ, which my gun shoots very well, and at least 80 hunting rounds 55 grain soft point.

This is the older Bushmaster, made before the company was sold and they started using cheaper parts.  It has never jammed, or had any issues with FTF, FTE, or anything.  It has worked flawlessly for every one of the probably 1200 or so rounds I have fired through it, and is very accurate. It has been cleaned after every time it has been fired, and there is not a scratch on it.  I take care of all my guns and they have been kept in my safe.  

I’m not interested in separating anything, as Id like to sell the ammo with the gun.

It's a fully machined gun so it cost over $500 to make and Ruger would have to sell it for over $1,000 and they did not know if there would be a high demand for a high quality but pricey 22 Long rifle. It will only go up in value and it's one of my favorite guns I have ever owned. It weights close to 15 lbs so it has some weight to it.

Machined (not cast) from 416-series stainless steel, coated in tough black oxide, the F2 compensator measures 1.00"" by 3.00"" (the largest dimensions possible under USPSA Limited and Tactical rules).  Threaded 1/2""-28, the F2 tapers to .750 for a smooth transition to the barrel.  This is, according to no less than Bevin Grams, Grams Engineering, ""...the best off-the-shelf compensator on the market today..."". In use around the world by competition shooters, police, and military, this compensator was designed by an expert in fluid dynamics to reduce or eliminate muzzle rise AND torquing, allowing fast splits on paper at full auto speeds!
