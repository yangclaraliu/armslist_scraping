I bought this a few years ago to add to my collection as a historical piece, and never even shot it, never found a military stock to replace the sporter version (and never really looked either).

Turns out, I tend to shoot my other rifles out of preference/habit, and this one just takes up space in the safe, so I am putting it up for sale.  
Not terribly interested in selling the ammo apart from the rifle.

There is no evidence of use other than extremely  slight scratching on the battery cover from when it was tightened after inserting the battery.  You have to look pretty hard to see it.

Very nice optic, and very solidly built, with a small 2 MOA red dot.      

The modular three-piece base offers four separate mounting heights for user- and weapon-specific customization: 18.5mm (.725 inches), 22mm (.875 inches), 36mm (1.425 inches), 40mm (1.575 inches). Digital rear-facing and side controls for power on/off, dot brightness and night vision mode. Aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum body. 

The versatile multi-height mount system of the SPARC accommodates rifles needing absolute or lower 1/3 co-witness heights and uses a standard Weaver or Picatinny base. The SPARC is also threaded to accept accessory ARD.

Risers and Shims: Combine in various ways to mount the SPARC at four different heights.
Battery Life: 6-hour auto-shutdown feature maximizes battery life. Typical battery life in normal mode of operation: 120 hours (maximum brightness), 3400 hours (minimum brightness). Typical battery life in night vision mode: 4200 hours (maximum brightness), 4600 hours (minimum brightness).

MATCH DESCRIPTION:

New in 2006, EAA introduced the Witness Elite “Match”. Destined to become a classic, the “Match” is produced in the Tanfoglio custom shop. Your “Match” incorporates many features of Tanfoglio’s competition guns into a streamlined, no nonsense, practical pistol. The “Match” serves equally well as a sport shooting pistol or defensive carry sidearm. It is an excellent alternative to those who prefer a single action pistol, but do not choose the 1911. The “Match” is loaded with the same high quality features you’ll find on other Elite series pistols. Custom features include a 4 3/4 ” match grade barrel, single action trigger with over travel stop, adjustable rear sights, interchangeable front sight posts, extended safety, extended magazine release, hart shaped hammer, and custom two tone finish. 

This gun is used but in excellent condition.  It comes with one magazine, the locking silver case and cleaning kit.  I will not ship this gun.  I am sorry."

I'm mobile and willing to do the majority if driving.  Let me know where you are and I'll let you know if it's too far...I'd rather not ship.

I also have 1,500 9mm tumbled and 1,000 40 S&W tumbled and deprimed.  I will take 1,000 .45 acp for the 2,500.

I have 22 tumbled and polished .45 Long Colt.

As you can see from the pictures there is some wear and tear, mostly the barrel hood and rail, but nothing other than slight cosmetic blemishes. This pistol has been carried and shot, but never neglected.

The only reason I'm selling is the trigger. I've never shot double action well and, although this is a superb trigger, I just can't seem to master it. It's frustrated me, but it is my limited capabilities. This pistol has exhibited typical Sig quality; it has never faltered or failed in any way and in the hands of a more experienced shooter it is extremely accurate. To hell and back reliability is almost an understatement."

Only the magazines are non-matching. It is chambered for 9mm and has a standard 4"" (100mm) barrel, fixed sights and walnut grips. The serial number appears on the front of the frame, on the left side of the receiver, on the side plate sear and trigger. The 1914 Model Luger is characterized by the short frame, the rear ""V"" cut fixed and front dovetailed sight, and the frame with the stock lug. It was produced from 1914 until 1918 for the German Military. 

The right side of the receiver displays all the Imperial Army acceptance stamps. Original grips are finely cut diamond shaped checkering made from walnut or in some cases beech wood. These grips are serial numbered to the gun. The inside of the gun is clean and well cared for. The exterior shows honest wear on the muzzle, barrel and high points on the sides. The barrel is shiny and shows distinct lands and grooves. This Luger shows characteristic holster wear on the side plate and front exposed edges of the rails and end of the barrel. I would rate it about 80% original finish. 

The Luger is accompanied by three magazines and a WWII issue holster with German military markings."

Pistol is date stamped with the letter I signifying that it was made in 1936 which is the year that the Spanish Civil War started. So it's quite likely that this pistol saw service in that war since it was a primary sidearm for both sides. 

Pistol is in very good to excellent condition with 90%+ of it's original blue metal finish. The grips are also in excellent shape with no cracks or chips. Bore is very good with no rust or pitting. All numbers match - lower frame, slide & barrel. 

The Astra 400 is an interesting, and unique pistol as it is able to chamber and safely fire a number of rounds including .38 ACP, 9mm Steyr, 9mm Browning Long and of course it's intended chambering - the 9mm Largo. There are also numerous reports of folks successfully shooting the standard 9mm Luger round although it's not a good practice because the shorter case length can cause head spacing issues.  

It should also be noted that the modern .38 Super and the Winchester 9x23 rounds will chamber and fire, however it unsafe to do so because these two cartridges operate at much higher pressures than this Astra was designed to handle. 

Another very unique feature is that this pistol comes with it's original issue holster which is ink stamped with the serial number of the pistol. I've collected military firearms for almost 37 years and can tell you that it's very unusual to see any pistol still with it's original holster almost 77 years after production. 

Pistol comes with it's original matching holster & shoulder strap, 3 original magazines, and 6 boxes (150 rounds) of Spanish Santa Barbara, brass case, non-corrosive hard ball ammo.  

Asking Price is $550 with pickup in the Brandon area. Buyer must be a Florida resident and at least 21 years old. 

Thanks for looking."

Is it pitted, scratched, cracked, or even broken???  Hmmmm....I may have just what you are looking for.

Here in this section I have listed 5 complete (I mean COMPLETE) AR15 carbine sets of furniture!  Carbine handguards, carbine M4 style adjustable buttstock, and grip.  Of course these are all stock type, but they are in AWESOME condition!  As for the buttstocks, they come in both COMMERCIAL and MIL-SPEC size, and of course there is different brands in there (BUSHMASTER, SMITH & WESSON, SPIKES, etc., etc.).  

CARBINE HANDGUARDS.......$10.00 per set
CARBINE adjustable buttstock.......$10.00 each
Pistol grip.............$5.00 each

OR, if you want all 3 items, I will let a COMPLETE set go for $20.00 each

I also have RIFLE handguards (round) at $20.00 each and these too are in AWESOME shape!  The TRIANGULAR type handguards (rifle) are also going for $20.00 per set and these too are in AWESOME shape!

As you can see in the pictures, there are various grips.  Standard pistol grips, ERGO grips, BLACKHAWK grips, and HOGUE grips (for the AR15), and these too are going for $5.00 each (except for the ERGO GRIP in the package).  This ERGO GRIP (in the package normally goes for $30.00 (on up) in your local gun shop, but here I will let it gor for $10.00.

This particular model features a 4"" barrel, beautiful stainless steel finish, factory rubber grips, a hi-viz front sight, and an adjustable rear sight. Double action is very smooth, Single action is light and crisp. Although barrel length is 4"", it measures 5.3"" from the firing pin so it is legal to hunt with in WI. It was built just over a year ago, so it was already drilled and tapped for a scope mount directly from S&W. Round count is at about 50, and it is easily in 100 percent condition. Very accurate for being a 4"". Will shoot reloads at 50 yards easily.

Nylon belt holster
HKS speedloader
Approximately 450 rounds of 158gr LSWC 38spl. reloads
Misc. 357 mag ammo, including over 1 1/2 boxes of Grizzly Cartridge ""heavy"" hunting loads

This has the rare 22"" barrel, with choke tube, FACTORY !!!

Manufactured in Japan, wWHICH IS A GOOD THING !!! Think about it,,,where/when do you think metal was better made, machines were better made and the manufacturing process held tighter tolerances, in 1958-70? Belgium or after that in Japan on newer machinery with better metals and tighter tolerances ??? There's a big debate on this, Belgium or Japan.......I'll take the Japan made all day, and so do most people now days, except collectors that don't want to shoot, they still collect Belgium for the limited supply of older guns, NOT because they're better made.

Gun is in great shape, has been used but very VERY well taken care of and handled.

It's basically a 4506 but in blued finish instead of stainless steel.  Only about 1200 were produced in the 1991/1992 time period.

This is a full-size, all steel gun.  The 3rd Gen autos are probably the most durable and reliable pistols ever made by S&W...or any other maker for that matter.

This gun is in EXCELLENT condition and includes:  2 original 8-round magazines, original box and owner's manual, original cleaning equipment and night sights.  The original sights will be included as well.  I'll also include an original S&W straight grip for you, too.

It appears that this gun has never been carried and has been fired very, very little.  Outwardly it looks like a brand new gun.  There is very minor finish wear only on the inside, mostly just from handling and operating the action.

This is a great collector piece or would make for a superb defensive gun.

Transfer will take place at Colorado Gun Broker in Bailey and buyer will pay transfer fee, if any.  I'll pay the $10 background check fee.

Don't waste my time or yours with low offers...you'll just be ignored."

It has an aftermarket side mount with dual rails, the top rail has a rubber coated norico 3x9 scope. The foregrip, flash suppressor and double hook trigger is all tapco. I have over 300 rounds of wolf hp and fmj, two magazines and ill throw in a hard case. The reason I am trading has nothing to do with the rifle, as an avid shooter I like to have variety and something new to try out.
