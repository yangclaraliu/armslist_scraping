DETAILS
Once upon a time, a ""dissipator"" AR was created by taking a 20"" rifle-length gas system upper and cutting the barrel down to 16"".  This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability.  The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition.   Advances in AR technology  have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks.  This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation.   We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version.  Our Premium Mid-length mock dissipator uses a  Chrome Moly Vanadium steel barrel that is chrome-lined for durability.

Barrel:  16"" mil-spec steel barrel, chrome lined and chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system with a low-profile gas block.   Medium profile barrel is proof tested, magnetic particle inspected, phosphate coated, and  finished off with a pinned F-marked front sight post in the Rifle position with sling swivel, rifle length handguards, and A2 flash hider.  Barrel is made for us by FN Manufacturing here in Columbia SC.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer."

Vz58 aren't aks. They are much smaller, lighter, softer shooting than a stamped AK but built on a stronger milled receiver and can be fed with stripper clips due to open top design. The czechs know their firearms and told the ussr pre cold war that they would not be converting to the ak47. The vz design was originally designed for a larger battle rifle round but shrunk to accomodate the ussr's desire for 7.62x39.

The P30 is one of the most modern police pistols of time. During its development, the most important requirements were flexibility, functionality and safety. Ergonomics of the grip have been improved by interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates. In combination with the ambidextrous operating controls, this pistol can be individually adapted to almost any user. No compromises have been made regarding safety. The P30 has a self decocking, double action hammer with a firing pin block safety that eliminates the need for a manual safety. Its advanced loaded chamber indicator, which is easily seen and felt, positively indicates a loaded chamber. Another feature is the open square notch rear sight with luminous contrast points (non-tritium), allowing an exact target acquisition even under poor lighting conditions. Variant 3 Double action/single action without ""SAFE position. Control lever (decocking lever) on left side of frame."

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for M4 carbines and M16A4 rifles flips up instantly at the touch of your thumb when primary sight fails or tactical situation makes iron sights preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for robustness, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly switch to one of eight range settings: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Adjust windage easily with grooved, A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver-style accessory rail on flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Regulates correctly with A2 front sight on any AR-15-style rifle or carbine; instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights."

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. 

Operation:
A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe' to 'Fire'.

FS: made in September of 1967 Revelations model 120 18 shot semi auto .22 LR. made for Western Auto by Marlin. This is essentially the same as a first generation model 60 with a very minor change or 2. Like the front bronze bead/blade sight rather than the hooded ramp found on the Marlin 60. From the research i have done, this model is less commonly encountered than the first model Marlin 60. I picked it up with the intent of keeping it, but the household finances say otherwise. So someone is going to get a damned fine rifle. 

21"" barrel, 40 1/2"" total length. Weight is only about 4lbs or so.This is in original non refinished condition. I have personally taken it completely down, cleaned, serviced and function checked for reliability. It is in my opinion 90% condition with only some very minor rust freckles here & there on the barrel, nothing drastic at all. The stock is more on the blond side of things and is also in very good plus condition. 

It is wearing a Weaver B4 scope with see through scope mounts, meaning you can use the scope or original iron sights as desired. I tried to get a shot of the 'peep through' feature, but it was tough to pull off one handed and work the camera at the same time...lol, but I think you will get the idea.

I took it out this morning and ran another 2 tubes for fun. The target pic below is the result. 50 yards, the left was the initial sight in with a stray round or 2 from my arm wiggle. The right is shooting as fast as my finger could pull the trigger. This is one hell of a nice shooter, smooth clean & crisp action. I hate to sell it but bills have to be paid.

I am not able to drive any more, so you will have to come out to Linn Creek to pick it up, where you will also have the opportunity to shoot it for yourself before you take it home.

Yours $200 with the scope. $175 without.

I have 10 detailed pics, message me to see them."

This is a brand new in box Glock 17 Generation 3 full size pistol chambered in 9x19mm. Designed for professionals, the GLOCK 17, in 9x19, is one of the most widely used law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 rounds in the standard magazine, and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers around the globe. With Glock's revolutionary ""Safe Action"" trigger system, the G17 9x19 pistol is safe, easy, and quick-just what you need in high-pressure situations. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case

 And here is how to install it (skip to about the 4th minute):
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvLt8-Wf7r0
 if for any reason you're concerned about how hard it might be to install I'll do it for you when we meet. just bring your rifle with a collapsible stock.

 I bought it and put it on my AR. I ran several clips through my rifle and had a blast but a) my gun is mainly home defense so full auto isn't exactly required and b) my wife wants me to unload some gun stuff to raise a little cash. So I took it right back off my rifle and put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box.

 It is in brand new condition with all the bits and pieces in the box including both parts in the original bubble wrap, paper work, and the allen wrench it came with.

 $300 for the stock and like I said, I'll install it for your on a collapsible stock rifle if you want me too. No shipping costs, no waiting on backorders. This stock is listed in the new ""assault weapons ban"" bill. Once that thing passes they won't be able to make these anymore."

Internet information:
Umarex USA has a new edition to its line of replica firearms with its .22 LR Uzi pistol and rifle.

The replica of the Israel Weapon Industries’ famous submachine gun is made by Carl Walther in Germany and comes in two variants: a rifle with a mock suppressor, and a pistol.

“The demand for .22 caliber guns continues to be strong,” said Richard Turner, vice president of sales and marketing for Umarex USA. “The addition of a .22 caliber UZI is a ‘natural’ add for us. It’s one of the most-recognized guns on the planet, yet few people have actually fired rounds through one. Shooting the UZI pistol is just pure, economical recreation with a ton of fun thrown in.”

Both feed rimfire cartridges in 20-round magazines. Both guns also feature grip safeties and adjustable sights.

The rifle features a folding stock, detachable sling swivel and the Uzi’s traditional handguard, which may be removed to reveal a Picatinny rail.

U.S. shipments are expected to arrive in mid-February, and additional inventory is expected this summer. The Uzi pistol will retail about $480, while the rifle will cost around $645.

532,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2232532,For Sale:  Racal Acoustics RAPTOR H-387/VRC Headset MBITR PTT SINCGARS RA5000/1/6400 ANR,"colorado springs, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, October 17, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Racal Acoustics RAPTOR H-387/VRC Headset MBITR PTT SINCGARS RA5000/1/6400 ANR

You're looking at a used working condition Racal Acoustics RAPTOR H-387/VRC Headset (model RA5000/1/6400) with a PTT (Push-to-Talk).  It can be used with AN/PRC-148 MBITR with the included coiled adapter cable.  The RA5000 Raptor headset has been designed specifically for use in tactical wheeled vehicles where highly intelligible communications are essential over extended periods of time.

The Active Noise Reduction (ANR) technology employed by the RA5000 Raptor is very effective at reducing the unwanted noise generated in these vehicles, especially when travelling at medium to high speeds.
Key Features
Passive and Active Noise Reduction. NRR greater than 22dB(A) 
Racal Acoustics Electronic Talk-Through (Single, internal 'AA' battery) 
Napeband 'around-the-neck' or Headband 'over-the-head' attachments 
Environmentally qualified to military standards 
Certified to operate in electromagnetic field strengths up to 50v/m 
Reversible noise cancelling microphone & switchbox 
Separate input for respirator microphone 
Compatible with a wide range of Vehicle Intercom Systems 

Benefits

The RA5000 Raptor Series of headsets are not simply an evolution in military headset design but are more of a paradigm shift in concept and approach.

The aspects of quality, highly intelligible speech for both received and transmitted communications, reliability and ruggedness were prerequisites for a new product design by Racal Acoustics. But for this product, military personnel (the end user) had specifically cited comfort and compatibility with existing equipment such as small arms and ballistic protective equipment as top priorities.

Each component within the headset is a new design, incorporating the vast experience that Racal has developed exclusively within the military communications arena.

The acoustic ear shells have been designed not only to be compatible with the Advance Combat Helmet (ACH) but to provide the highest achievable level of acoustic performance integrity. The benefit of this is that it has been possible to reduce the force which the headset clamps to the users head resulting in a much more comfortable experience.
