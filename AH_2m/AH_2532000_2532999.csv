In NV mode the red dot sight can only be seen with a NV device (GEN I-GEN IV), the real deal and works great with my Bushnell Gen I NV Mono (see pictures)!! In regular mode it has 20 brightness setting including auto-shut off of either 4 hours or 8 hours on AA Batteries or Lithium! 
This is a bad a** combo for your AR-15, AK47, PS90, FN FAL .308, M1A1, or any other weapon you choose to mount it to that has a rail. 
The Sight Mark 3x Magnifier is crisp and clear and brings your target closer for that far away shot. Flip the magnifier to the side and use the EOTech alone for those up close shots. 
This is the real deal in EOTech's for Military or Law Enforcement. The sight is used and shows some scrapes on the outer protective hood (does not affect it's operation)! Both work perfect!! I'm asking $550 OBO for both as a package deal (that is a savings of $110 from new!!!). I may consider cash with a partial trade depending on what you have to offer (see below). Price is OBO but within reason, if you want the best combat sight out there this is it!! I used one of these in Afghanistan and have depended my life on EOTech before...they work trust me and are well worth the price!! I have two and only need one now. Thanks for looking!"

Made in 1920 by Carl Gustaf, it has all matching parts. The bore is in very good+ condition; the stock disk is marked 2 and 3, but IMHO it reflects the condition of a ""2"" rated bore a lot more than a 3. Bore diameter is 6.50mm. Has a nice stock, a very minor ding from storage here and there but other than a couple of them its in awesome condition, same with the bluing. There is a small scratch towards the muzzle end of the rifle (not on the muzzle), but it's nothing serious, merely cosmetic. I have a sight guard for this rifle too and when its on it covers the mark. Outstanding shooter, had this out about a week ago pickin' off milk jugs at ~300 yards, which the rifle tackled with great ease. Haven't put this one on paper yet, but I can easily see it grouping at about 1.5"" no problem. This rifle (as with most swedes) has a nice solid, well-built feel and feels good to shoulder.

______________________________________
SpecterDR represents a revolution in optical sight design. The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MoA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has by far the largest field of view in the industry. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. SpecterDR is half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR offers the best single solution for both CQB and Long Range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

The Beretta Nano, made in the U.S.A., is the ultimate evolution of the micro-compact carry pistol. Its low profile snag-free design makes it simple to carry and draw from concealment, and it can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames. The magazine release button can be reversed to accommodate right or left-handed use, and the sights are user-adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench. The Nano frame is composed of fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer, and it is available in multiple colors.

500,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2532500,For Sale:  Springfield EMP 9mm (1911 style),"Western Cumberland County, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 950,"Listed On: Monday, January 6, 2014",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I received this EMP 9mm for Christmas from my dad, who bought a larger 1911 in 9mm.  He preferred the longer 5"" barrel of a full-size, and said I could try this and keep it if I liked it or sell it if I didn't like it.  It shoots great, and is really a high quality gun, but I, too, prefer the longer barrel of a full-size.  I don't plan to carry this gun, which is really what it's for, so I am selling it.

This is a very unique gun; Springfield Armory designed a 1911-style gun around a 9mm architecture.  It's not just a scaled-down 1911; it was designed as a 9mm from the ground-up.  That said, it has all of the ergonomics that 1911 fans know and love, like the ambidextrous thumb safety that allows carry in a cocked-and-locked fashion.  Magazine capacity is 9 rounds (plus one in the chamber).  The magazines are very high quality, made in Italy for Springfield by Mec-Gar.  Folks, this gun comes with THREE of those high quality Mec-Gar magazines.  Rounding out the gun's features, it's got a very classy look to it, with the cocobolo grips, stain stainless upper slide and blackened aluminum alloy frame.  Sights?  It's got you covered with Trijicon night sights front and rear, dovetailed into the slide.

6.5"" in length, 5"" in height, and weighing in at 26 oz, it would make an excellent carry gun for someone looking for a very high quality and reliable 9mm in the 1911 style.

This gun shows very well, and is flawless in every way I can tell.  My dad bought it last spring, and together, we have shot no more than a few hundred rounds through it.  As pictured, it comes as you'd find it new in a gun shop, with the manual, case, magazine clip for your belt, and a belt holster.  This retails new for at or around $1,400.  Looking to get $950, and I'm pretty firm on the price, given the condition of the gun.  It does NOT disappoint!

Contact via email for fast response (it goes straight to my phone).  Buyer will have to provide a North Carolina pistol purchase permit, or a copy of his/her concealed handgun permit, and will have to sign a Bill of Sale.  Face to face sales for NC residents preferred.  I will make all attempts to meet you somewhere ""in the middle"" if you live far away for the right price.  Out of state residents will need to provide valid FFL.

Thanks for looking."

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

I bought this new in 1992 for $649 before tax and shipping – I still have the receipt.  Serial Number 17505.  This was a limited production gun called the “Grand American.”.  I shot it at the range and took it on 1 hunt.  Cleaned, lubed and properly stored with anti-seize grease on all threaded parts of the action.  A true safe queen.  I’m not likely to hunt muzzle loading season again, so it is time for it to go to a new home to be used and enjoyed.  

No FFL is required since it is a muzzleloader.
Asking $595.  Sorry, but I’m not interested in trades.
I will ship within the lower 48 states for $30.

Looking to sell or trade for equal value my wife's pink and stainless 2-Tone GSG 1911 22lr.  Used on the range as a trainer/Plinker gun! It is an EXCELLENT trainer for the young ones or lady just getting into shooting. It's sat around for over a year but is very clean and in VERY good shape minus the Duracoat chipping. I'm the second owner and it has a total of roughly 600 rounds through it. It's just too big for my wife and she really doesn't enjoy it like I thought she would.

We bought it customized like it currently is. As I stated above, the pink is Duracoated and is chipping off and fading, and I believe the black parts were sanded down to the bare metal and polished. the custom work is OK. It's a decent (not great) looking gun that but functions great!

I also prefer complete packages with manuals, box, test targets and shells, if applicable. Like new condition only. Caliber isn't important. I'm not looking to drive all over Iowa and prefer to meet in the Des Moines area. Email me what you are interested in selling, and what you need for it. If it fits my criteria, good for both of us.

Its also a holiday, MLK Day....so you might be off work.

What is Lobby Day? Its a day where anyone can lobby their lawmakers for future laws they want passed, or don't want passed. It happens in Richmond at the General Assembly building. 

WHY???  For us gun owners we need to be there to lobby them for our 2nd amendment rights. Our new Governor has already said he is going to push for gun control. And remember, NYC Mayor Bloomberg gave $millions$ of his money to the Democratic campaign here in Va in November. And Bloomberg is about as anti-gun as anyone I've ever seen. He will want a return on his investment....our guns!!

SO WHAT CAN YOU DO?   Show up for Lobby Day. You don't have to give a speech or do anything uncomfortable. Mainly you just need to be seen. WE NEED NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THERE, AN OCEAN OF GUN OWNERS OUTSIDE OF THAT BUILDING. The VCDL will be there passing out GUNS SAVE LIVE stickers. Put a sticker on your shirt and be seen!!!!!!

We all need to be there!!!!!
