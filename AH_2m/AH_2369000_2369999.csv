The first one started off as a Norinco SKS,  I had the barrel cut down and recoil compensator installed prior to putting it in a SG Works Bullpup kit. The kit was Cerakoted in FDE. I have two 20 round Tapco Mags, Burris AR-332 Red Dot sight and not pictured a FDE Magpul Vertical grip.
Second SKS is a hard to find Norinco MC-5D which takes the standard AK-47 magazines. The rifle also has a rear peep sight and recoil pad/extender.
The third SKS is a Norinco Paratrooper, nothing special about the rifle other than it has a shorter barrel.
I would like to sell all three rifles at once and not break up the package. I am looking for $2000/OBO for the three as pictured, plus the vertical grip for the Bullpup, not pictured. I would be willing to trade for AR's. Email me with you have, not interested in anything other than AR's. Would have to meet face to face in the Columbia area, I am also leaving to go out of town on Tuesday and will be gone for a few weeks....so make your offers if interested."

I have owned this pistol since I have been of age to do so, it has never failed me once, not one single time. I would estimate I have 700-1000 rounds through it. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever and I never thought I would have to let it go.

Replaced the grip tape a few months ago, so it's nice and grippy again.
Comes with four magazines, one ten rounder it came with and three 12rd factory HK mags with finger rests I purchased new about three months ago (look these up, not cheap for real ones)
Also comes with a neat coyote double sided pistol case that holds six magazines as well as other attatchments and pockets for whatever. I think I got it from sportsmans or midway while getting other stuff, nothing fancy but does a nice job.
Original HK hard case included as well.
Comes with a bit over 500 rounds of .45 all brass, some winchester, some PMC, some Herter's, all factory.

The 42in Drago Coyote rifle case shown in the foreground is not included, was just a good backdrop, but could be sold if you have an extra $50.

my boxes start from the late 1800's to modern hard to find boxes, I have old powder cans and even dummy range mortars, so anything would be great to ad, I would love some dummy grenades to ad.  I have the pineapple and would love the baseball and broomhandle type to ad
I will thank anyone who helps me keep making this grow, in the end I will 
DONATE it to a firearm museum for display to make others see the way ammunition has change over the yrs and all the lost cal.s that where used that most people have never seen or even knew existed...

The gun has some mild holster wear in the parkerizing, mainly on the front of the slide, but it gives it some character.

The stock is an original Springfield Armoy pre-war finger groove stock with the ""S.A."" stamped on the front of the stock.  It also has the serif pre-war ""P"" proof mark behind the trigger guard.

The Nikko Stirling Target master is available in four variable zoom models that allow the user to adjust the magnification required to suit their needs. The main body of the scope is a 30 mm hard alloy tube that provides added strength and light transmission over one inch rifle scopes. The lenses are coated in our ETE Microlux coatings, which allow maximum light transmission to your eyes so you see the target faster, clearer and with more contrast. The Adjustments are Target style, to adjust simply pull out gently and turn to the desired setting. Push down again to lock. You can also return the dial setting to Zero with out special tools so you can be ready in the field to accurately compensate as required for both windage and elevation. Key Features: All Target master rifle scopes feature Side Parallax and focus adjustment. This is easily achieved in with the side adjustments compared to objective adjusting rifle scopes. Also located on the side is the switch for the illumination of the reticle. This looks much neater and allows quick adjustments in the field. Fast focus eyepieces allow you to adjust the scope to suit your eye strength.

General Winchester 1200 information 

The Winchester Model 1200 is a 20-inch, 12-gauge, manually operated, slide action shotgun. The slide action, also known as a pump-action, means that the shotgun has a moving bolt system which is operated by a ""wooden or composite slide called the fore-end"". The fore-end is located on the underside of the barrel and moves front to back. The weapon can hold a maximum of five rounds total with four in the tubular magazine and one in the chamber. It has a hammerless action which means that there is no external hammer spur. There is only a firing pin which strikes the primer on the shell to ignite the powder in the round. The Model 1200 is a takedown type of shotgun; meaning that it can be taken apart for easy storage and transportation.

It was made in the famous Soviet factory of TULA. Tula rifles are much harder to find than the Izhevsk ones because much less were made before and during WWII. This is a fabulous rifle with a barrel that has strong rifling and grooves. Overall, it is in excellent shape! This rifle will make a great shooter. Also, this rifle includes an original WWII bayonet and original WWII tool kit for the Mosin Nagant.  I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country to an FFL.

Gun comes with sling and 2 metal factory Buhsmaster 30 round mags. (Bushmaster 30 round Teflon coated mags - very good mags). 

The only modifications I have done to the rife is add the rubber gapper between the pistol grip and trigger guard. That can be removed if you don't like it. The other modification is a sling plate on the buffer tube to have a rear sling mount.

The only place I can find that still has these for sale is Atlantic Arms and they are out of stock. Like I said very desirable.   

Very nice gun! Thanks for looking and please shoot me a message if interested. Looking to do FTF, Lehigh Valley. Not interested in trades. This is a pistol, not a rifle. So for PA law pistols must be transfered."

Desert Eagle collector looking for people who are getting rid of or have thought of getting rid of their Desert Eagle .50. 
Interested only in the Mark XIX in .50 AE. Must be very good to new condition.
Magazines, barrels, parts, cases, holsters. Anything Desert Eagle XIX .50 I want it.
I know my DE's so no outrageous prices, willing to pay fair market values. If I wanted a over-priced DE I'd go on gunbroker.

In most cases I'm willing to pay 800-1200 for a complete DE XIX .50. With or without original case and accessories. In some cases I'm willing to pay more. All depends on what you have. I own many so I know the DE in and out.
I would buy .50ae ammo as well but being I reload it for .75c a round you will not get more than $1 round from me.

Just shoot me an email if you've thought about selling or trading your DE and I will provide my phone number and we can go from there.

649,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2369649,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T,"Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama",FREE,"Listed On: Saturday, November 23, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This 3.5-10x40 is the optic that the military uses on many of the MK12 Special Purpose Rifles (SPR). It is also the same optic that Marcus Luttrell was using during the 'Lone Survivor' event where he and a few other brave SEALs fought hundreds of Afghan assholes. 

The scope is in excellent condition with only the edges of the turrets shined a bit (barely noticeable) due to living and traveling in a soft case. It features an illuminated Tactical Milling Reticle that can be used as a ballistic reticle. It has been converted to .5 MOA adjustments from the Leupold custom shop and has a custom BDC turret that is calibrated to a 77 grain bullet at 2850 feet per second (determine the range and turn the elevation turret to the corresponding number). I have tested the BDC turret extensively and it is true to 600 yards which was the longest shot I could take until I recently secured a place with just over 1000 meters. Additionally, I have turrets for 62 grain 5.56, 168 grain 7.62, and the standard MOA turret.

The mount is a LaRue QD SPR mount that is also in very good condition. I have also tested the return to zero quality of this mount extensively and have never experienced a discernable shift even at 600 yards. LaRue claims that it will return to 1/10 of a MOA and after owning several of these mounts I know for a fact it is that good or better.

I am now shooting larger cartridges at greater distances and need more magnification. I'm going to have to sacrifice this Leupold to fund the high end optic for this application. After the work from the custom shop I have over $1700 in this optic and mount. I am open to offers but lowball offers will not get a response, don't waste your time. This is a face to face sale only in the North Alabama area, I will not ship. For the most part I'm interested in cash, however, I may consider a trade for ARs, AR uppers, or high end optics if something is offered that would compel me to sell something else."

702,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2369702,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T (Make Offer),"Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, November 23, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This 3.5-10x40 is the optic that the military uses on many of the MK12 Special Purpose Rifles (SPR). It is also the same optic that Marcus Luttrell was using during the 'Lone Survivor' event where he and a few other brave SEALs fought hundreds of Afghan assholes. 

The scope is in excellent condition with only the edges of the turrets shined a bit (barely noticeable) due to living and traveling in a soft case. It features an illuminated Tactical Milling Reticle that can be used as a ballistic reticle. It has been converted to .5 MOA adjustments from the Leupold custom shop and has a custom BDC turret that is calibrated to a 77 grain bullet at 2850 feet per second (determine the range and turn the elevation turret to the corresponding number). I have tested the BDC turret extensively and it is true to 600 yards which was the longest shot I could take until I recently secured a place with just over 1000 meters. Additionally, I have turrets for 62 grain 5.56, 168 grain 7.62, and the standard MOA turret.

The mount is a LaRue QD SPR mount that is also in very good condition. I have also tested the return to zero quality of this mount extensively and have never experienced a discernable shift even at 600 yards. LaRue claims that it will return to 1/10 of a MOA and after owning several of these mounts I know for a fact it is that good or better.

I am now shooting larger cartridges at greater distances and need more magnification. I'm going to have to sacrifice this Leupold to fund the high end optic for this application. After the work from the custom shop I have over $1700 in this optic and mount. I am open to offers but lowball offers will not get a response, don't waste your time. This is a face to face sale only in the North Alabama area, I will not ship. For the most part I'm interested in cash, however, I may consider a trade for ARs, AR uppers, or high end optics if something is offered that would compel me to sell something else."

It has an adjustable c-lect choke to adjust between cylinder bore, improved and full choke as well as a 24 inch ported barrel.This gun is incredible for hunting any tyoe of game animal or bird in the area. It handles like a very accurate rifle and the mossberg recoil pad makes shooting it comfortable and manageable.  Gun was manufactured in the late 50s so it has some wear on the stock from normal use, some blueing wearing off the barrel and such, coesmetic wear on some of the bolt, but overall is in very nice shape. Has the wear and tear on it that you would exoect from a 50 year old very well maintained firearm. Has beautiful sturdy wood furniture that still shines after all these years. Has been owned by the same man since new until i purchased it. I am asking $275 obo as this is a very rare and well taken care of firearm and is great to shoot. I will hate to see it go the gun is a dream in the woods. Will entertain trades for valuable items and other firearms. Thanks for your time.

Desperation; 8mm VK-98 Volksgewehr (Top Picture)In 1945, the last year of World War II, German ordinance began production of these pieces of crap.  With the Russians approaching from the east and the Yanks and Brits closing in from the west, the Germans began mass production of the Volksgewehr (people’s rifle) in a desperate attempt to defend the motherland.  The Volksgewehr was a simple bolt action rifle manufactered to be extremely cheap and easy to produce.  Unlike the venerable 98k Mauser, this rifle was stripped down to its most basic functional parts.  It had cheap, crude sights that could not be adjusted, notice how the front sight is roughly soldered to the muzzle.  The barrel was quickly and crudely machined, notice the visible tool marks.  The stock was left unfinished and often lacked butt plates.  It also lacked an internal magazine, being single shot only.  Due to Allied bombing many of the rifles were produced by cottage industry—In small shops, garages, even people’s homes and back yards.  The purpose of this gun was to arm the newly formed Volksturm (People’s Militia), recruited mostly from old men and children.  It was hoped that by mass producing these cheap rifles the Nazi’s could arm and mobilize the entire populace of Germany, and drive back the Allies through sheer numbers.Some models did have a box magazine, called the VG-1, but lacked a knob on the bolt. Very few were produced and they are extremely rare. (Bottom Picture)Also rare, VK-98 Models chambered in 7.92 Kurz, the shortened cartridge used for the Sturmgewehr 44 assualt rifle.Today there are few surviving examples of the Volksgewehr.  Allied soldiers did not take them as war trophies and most were used for scrap metal.Value: $2,000-$4,000.Chambered in 7.92 Kurz: $4,000-$7,000.VG-1 Value: $6,000-$12,000

The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold “dead-on” at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC’s unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting—yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.
Large exit pupils: Improved low light hunting at dawn or dusk, when the game is usually moving.
Precise, hand-turn 1/8-MOA click adjustments: Positive-click reticle adjustments get you zeroed-in quicker and maintain your setting even with heavy recoil.
Sunshade included: Accessory sunshade eliminates glare in particularly bright conditions and keeps dust and rain off of the objective lens on rainy days or in dusty environments.
Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed."
