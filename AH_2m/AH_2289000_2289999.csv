The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

Bull pup configuration.
Optimized ergonomic design.
30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
Detachable barrel.
Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
Equipped with a last round stopper.
All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing.
Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

This is a super easy way to save $$$ on ammo.  The Dillon 550B is an easy progressive press to use and can load most pistol and rifle calibers.  Has a lifetime no BS warranty.  These things don't come up for sale very often and do not depreciate more than 20%, ever.

Included is the 550B set up for .40 including dies, a 2nd tool head with powder measure, large and small primer systems, large powder bars for both measures, primer flip tray, bins etc.  Also included is a Dillon CV500 Tumbler in like new condition, and the Dillon media separator in like new condition.  Have all boxes including the one for the press.  Clean and rust free, but the powder measures are stained with the yellow tinge from letting them sit with powder in them.  

The press has a small list of bits and shits that are missing which amount to $38 to replace if Dillon doesn't comp them.  The only thing missing that would prevent one from loading immediately is the shell plate buttons ($1.40), and the washer and nut for the handle ($2.80 for both).  I have a full list of the missing parts with part #'s and prices available but it's stuff like the failsafe rod assy (has the old style powder measures with the return spring), the primer tube rod, the primer alarm battery cover etc.

"" My favorite gun is my Henry 22 pump! 


Thanks for making such a family-friendly collection of great rifles. You have a much better understanding of what people enjoy about shooting than do other firearm companies. Our Henry lever action is high quality, easy to use, accurate, and an absolute pleasure to handle. You have no competitors in value for the price.

Here is a photo of my wife at the range with the Henry I gave her for Christmas. As an immigrant from China, where individuals aren't allowed to own firearms, she has a special appreciation of our second amendment rights.





The Henry Pump Action  .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom's apple pie, a restored '57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. The Henry Pump , available in calibers .22LR, is one gun that is built for the ages. has scope and see-thur sights also trigger spur

The Izhmash Saiga 12ga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov (AK47) design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Models are available with side optic mounting rails, bead front sight, V notch rear sight or leaf rear sight. Included is a detachable five round magazine (larger magazines available upon request)."

This gun is 100% reliable. I have shot mainly light 1 oz.loads through it shooting Sporting Clays and doves. It is fast, accurate and deadly. The Crio barrels and chokes hold excellent patterns. This is not sales hype but my actual experience when using it. Clays are crushed and birds fall dead from the sky.

This is honestly one gun that will do it all for you. Ideal for turkey, geese, ducks, pheasants, partridge, grouse, woodcock all the way down to doves, just feed the gun the right ammo for the hunt and then watch as you drop your quarry time and again with ease and confidence. Your hunting buddies are going to be very jealous of you!

The slug barrel is a smooth bore with iron sights and a scope rail mount. Great for home defense, 3 gun, whitetails and wild boar.


I have always transported the gun to and from the field in a padded case and after each outing I ran a bore snake through the barrel and wiped down the surfaces and cleaned the action. 

I am selling it because I have other guns on my wish list. Willing to consider partial trade for a Remington 1100 Special Field or 11-87 Upland Special in excellent condition.

Desert Eagle Technical Data

General Features

Desert Eagle Mark XIX Cut-away
The Picatinny rail located on the barrel runs from the chamber area to right behind the front sight allowing the use of scope rings (optional) and aftermarket optics.

The Desert Eagle Pistol is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol with a rotating three lug bolt for positive lock-up.
The barrel is locked in place, assuring a high degree of accuracy.
The polygonal rifling reduces barrel wear, is easy to clean and very accurate.
Anatomically formed grip, ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting.
The Desert Eagle Pistol fires standard factory ammunition.
The Desert Eagle Pistol has an automatic slide lock that holds the slide open after the last round is fired.
Safety

The safety is ambidextrous — it can be operated by right-handed and left-handed shooters.
When the safety is on, the firing pin is blocked, disconnecting the trigger bar from the sear at the same time. Extensive testing has shown the Desert Eagle is safe from accidental firing with safety engaged.

Construction

Desert Eagle Pistols are manufactured on the latest CNC (computer numerical controlled) machines to exacting specifications and tight tolerances or precision-cast and machined from high-quality carbon steel.

Also, almost all aftermarket accessories designed for M1911-styles can be added, whether it be specialized custom grips, added sights, tactical enhancements, or other customizations.

Product Description Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment. I had to shoot this to see what all of the rave is about. Very impressed, shot excellent with 50 rounds,great recoil compared to other pocket 380's. As new/ excellent condition. Product Specs Capacity: 6+1 Rounds Weight: 8.8 Ounces Width: .750"" Barrel Length: 2.80"" Firing Mechanism: Striker Fire

Bought this PT-809 new earlier this year and have put approximately 500 rounds through it. I registered it through Taurus so it has the transferable lifetime warranty (http://www.taurususa.com/repair-policy.cfm). 17+1 comes with everything pictured. Thoroughly cleaned and re oiled after every use and only shows a little wear outside of the chamber at the top where the slide comes back over when fired (pictured). Never holstered and always kept in the case or lined safe. Other than that it is a great gun and very accurate. Also includes the following ammo. Buyer must have valid drivers license, and since the gun is registered to me, be willing to sign a Firearm Bill of sale (pictured). This is for my records only and will not disclose the info to anybody unless legally compelled. Call or text REDACTED or reply to this post. The price is firm, cash only and no trades.

 AGD Tac One with Longbow Shroud and Stock, plus 88/4500 tank with new Ninja Reg.
 This has been my primary marker for 3 years now and i absolutely love it. But its time to try something new. 
 First the bad. This gun is not a bag queen and has seen quite a few games.
 The original Feedneck pulled the threads from the body and i replaced it with a CCM feedneck that had to be tig welded into the body, works perfectly. Secondly, i bought a Tac one because i wanted the longbow stock, i did not know they made a longbow compatible and non compatible tac one. This one was a non compatible. I made the mounts myself to use the longbow, it has been on their for three years, can be removed and is rock solid. 
 The Good? this gun is awesome, shoots amazingly straight and consistent, it has been tuned to allow fully mechanical bounce firing. The tank was tested on 1/13. 
 no barrel or hopper. 
 Trades. Looking for a Pump gun and smaller tank.
 Cash $500 obo."

I have an excellent condition Rokon Trailbreaker or sale or trade. This has less than 20 hours on it, and is ready to roll. New battery and fresh transmission oil. Starts right up. Pre-wired for a battery tender. Also includes hitch mounted carrier. This allows you to transport this bike without a trailer. Carrier is for a 2"" receiver.

Options:
Camo Package
Brush Guards for hands
Gun Boot

If you do not know about these vehicles, google Rokon Trailbreaker. These are some of the most capable vehicles out there. As far as I know, this is the only 2 wheel drive motorcycle in production.

These things run about $9000 new. I am willing to let this cream puff go for $5500 cash or trade. Please only serious shoppers. No joy rides.

Perfect for hunting, property maintenance, bug outs, etc. 

Below is from their website:
Trail-Breaker. The name synonymous with off-road transportation for 50 years has proven its worth as an American classic. Years and years of unforgettable trips to the out back have given Rokon riders a lifetime of memories. Trail-Breakers have climbed up high peaks including the Chilean Andes, gone through mud bogs where 4-wheelers never leave, traversed slippery snow fields and even provided safe passage for explorers through the treacherous Darien Gap. Users include the US Special Forces in Desert Storm, the US Forest Service, some 25 states Fish and Game officers, countless big game hunters, and even treasure seekers. They count on Trail-Breakers because they go anywhere and do it with unparalleled ROKON reliability.

 Why? Each Trail-Breaker has patented dual wheel drive, a high ground clearance (15 in.) lightweight (218 lbs.) and wide tractor type tires (8 x 12 x 25"").

 Versatile? You bet. Mount pumps, generators, sidecars, gun boots and 50 other accessories. You can turn your Trail-Breaker into a plow horse or mountain goat. And they even float by virtue of hollow 12-inch aluminum drum wheels. Drum like in you can store up to 2.5 gallons of fuel or water in each wheel. Narrow enough to fit down a row crop or tight tree stands. Tough enough to climb over rocks, fallen trees or other obstacles.

Rokon Trail-Breaker Fishing Scene How? Operate for up to 9 hours on one fill up of the almost 3 gallon tank and run its classic work horse four stroke Kohler engine where ever you need to Trail-Breaker is automatic and is operated by hands only. No shifting necessary with your feet. It's balanced enough to climb steep slopes at speeds of only 0.5 mph. It will also carry two people aboard.

 Reliable? Most Trail-Breakers ever built are still running. And the ones built today are even better because they have solid state ignition, sealed gear cases, improved frame design, better comfort and get this, they are now even quiet. The Trail-Breaker uses a Kohler 4 stroke 208 cc overhead valve 7 hp engine.  ROKON has learned from a rich history of riding and listening to owners. This lead us to incorporate changes that will make Trail-Breakers last even longer. Easy to repair and maintain. A simple thing like the same bearing appears 18 times on the machine. Standard American nuts, bolts and chain make repairs a cinch and easy for you to do the work. Parts are widely available and manuals easy to follow. After all, if you start simple and rugged, it should be easy to maintain.

 Trail-Breaker is a trusted and long serving name in off road transportation. We remain dedicated to quality so you can count on a successful trip wherever you go. And now with the latest  Kohler engine, ROKONS have incredible power and performance to go with quiet running operations."
