This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR and .22 Magnum rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason.

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer

Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories

It is marked ""Bridgeport Conn."" on the barrel and is an older model.  The bluing is very good with a few minor scratches and a small scrape on the butt.  It is very concealable and would fit in most any jacket pocket so that one could be ready without being obvious.  It is always reliable and requires very little knowledge to use.  There can be no dropped magazines, failure to feed, failure to eject, failure to remove safety, etc. that can occur with automatics.  It handles reloads of varying power, .38 shotshells, wadcutters, low power loads with ease.  There is a lot of hullabaloo right now about super quality import automatic pistols, mostly spoken by people who make guns a hobby, like me.  We concern ourselves with magazine capacity, accuracy and tight target groups.  In reality however, FBI shooting statistics indicate most shootings occur at zero to seven yards with little or no aiming.  Practice and weapon reliability are more important than all other factors in civilian shootings.  The FBI recently realized this and is revising their training.  This weapon is accurate and will do the job if you want to protect yourself.  If, however, it is your intention to enter into combat in the open with numerous well armed opponents on a frequent basis, or if you wish to compete, you will want a full size, high-capacity, semi-automatic pistol.  I have better guns and a couple that are worse.  This one is adequate and effective at a reasonable price.  It is probably all the self-protection I ever needed but I got a little carried away.  If you want to know what my bottom is it is the very reasonable price I listed."

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system."

Chambered in 9x19 Luger/Parabellum. Feeds pretty much any kind of bullet. Operates like an Mp5 with a delayed roller blowback system. Quick takedown using a single crosspin like an HK. Ejects out the bottom and has ambi controls for the safety, so it's lefty friendly. It has the optional muzzle brake which takes recoil extremely well. These are rare guns common in old early 90s Sci-Fi flicks like Total Recall, The Crow, Timecop, ect, so they're very collectable plus they make awesome shooters. 100 round mags make them the ultimate undead dispatching weapon. I will include one 50 round magazine with the gun, but I also have extra 100 round magazines if you would like to purchase some with the gun.

These 9mm Hungarian made Browning Hi-Power clones were imported by Kassnar Imports in the late 80s. Finish is about 85% with some slight wear but deep, original blue still intact. 

The PJK-9HP is fully modeled on the BHP -- it is NOT a S&W design -- so all parts are interchangeable with the Browning.

This pistol is in fine working condition and comes with two original factory maple and Hogue wraparound grips (pictured). Also comes with original box (quite beat up) as well as one factory 13 and one Mecgar 15 round magazine. A nice looking gun to add to any hi-power collection.

This gun factory WAS ALL Black (besides the hammer)Everything Shiny you see, I did. I've completely disassembled this gun, De-Blued the Slide, Trigger, Safety's, Barrel, magazine release, beavertail, and lower the part of rear grip. Cleaned and sanded every part with up too 1500 grit. (Which is so NOT Fun!) Then I Polished the crap out of every part. Lol. All in all I probably have like 30+ hours in this gun.

It is rated to handle .38 ammunition up to the +P (high power) level.  It has a light alloy frame with a stainless steel cylinder and barrel.  It has a hammer spur, which I like, that allows the shooter to fire single action for more precise aimed fire.  Double action is smooth and consistent, allowing the weapon to be fired with only a pull of the trigger. It is very concealable and would fit in most any jacket pocket so that one could be ready without being obvious. It is always reliable and requires very little knowledge to use. There can be no dropped magazines, failure to feed, failure to eject, etc. that can occur with automatics. It handles reloads, shotshells, wadcutters, low power loads, high power loads with ease. There is a lot of hullabaloo right now about super quality, high-capacity import automatics, mostly spoken by people who make guns a hobby, like me. We concern ourselves with magazine capacity, accuracy and tight target groups. In reality however, FBI shooting statistics indicate most shootings occur at zero to seven yards with little or no aiming. Practice and weapon reliability are more important than all other factors in civilian shootings. The FBI recently realized this and is revising their training. Choosing a weapon is always a compromise of quality, price, personal suitability and actual intended use.  One does not need a $1000 gun for self defense. This is a high quality revolver that is accurate and will do the job if you want to protect yourself. If, however, it is your intention to enter into combat in the open with numerous well armed opponents on a frequent basis, or if you wish to compete, then you will want a full size, high-capacity, semi-automatic pistol.  This will include the like-new Galco IWB holster."

UBR-A-BK
The UBR Invictus is a rechargeable ultra-high-output LED flashlight with selectable light levels, strobe and SOS modes, and the ability to run on either the included rechargeable lithium-ion battery or two 123A lithium batteries using the included battery magazine. At maximum output the UBR generates 800 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a precision Turbohead TIR lens into a high-intensity, far-reaching beam suitable for spotlight/searchlight applications, yet still providing significant peripheral illumination. The UBR’s selector ring has eleven settings — with eight levels of light from 5 to 800 lumens, a strobe mode, an SOS beacon mode, and a disable setting to prevent accidental activation during transport, storage, or stealth ops. 

The UBR features an innovative 4-function tailcap that operates as follows: For momentary-on activation at any selector ring setting, including strobe and SOS modes, partially press the tailcap switch straight down. For constant-on activation at any setting, including strobe and SOS modes, partially push the tailcap switch sideways. For maximum light output at any setting, except strobe and SOS modes, fully press the tailcap switch straight down for momentary-on or fully push it sideways for constant on; this is our MaxBlast ™ feature. MaxBlast does not function at the strobe or SOS settings – only strobe and SOS will be activated at those settings. 

The UBR also features a 3-color LED indicator (“fuel-gauge”) that tells you the battery-charge level. 

Charging is easy: connect the charger to a 120V outlet, or into a 12-volt cigarette lighter/accessory socket when using the DC adapter, then plug the charging cord into the UBR’s charging socket—no removing the battery and no special charging cradle needed. 

Constructed from rugged aerospace aluminum and finished in Mil-Spec hard anodizing for extreme durability, the UBR Invictus is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture. 

The predecessor of the UBR Invictus, the UB3T Invictus, has most of the same features but is non-rechargeable and is powered by three 123A batteries. 

Another ultra high-output rechargeable flashlight with similar features is the UNR Commander.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

The GSG 5 is an identical replication of the MP 5, except one great thing: Its a 22 cal. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG 5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. You'll be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux suppressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies.   Item G-34272-1

The E2L Outdoorsman — now with 125 lumens of maximum output — is a compact, dual-output, extended-runtime flashlight featuring a virtually indestructible power-regulated LED emitter and a precision Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens. 

The E2L has a click-type pushbutton tailcap switch — press for momentary on, press until it clicks for constant-on. The switch is also used to select the light output level: press or click for a 5-lumen ultra long-runtime low beam that's perfect for reading a map, performing tasks inside a tent, or navigating around a campsite without degrading your dark-adapted vision. Release and press again within two seconds, or click again within two seconds, for a powerful 125-lumen high beam to reach deep into the dark. 

The E2L's high-strength steel clip keeps the light securely stowed in a pocket or pack and provides quick and easy hands-free illumination when clipped to a hat brim or bill. Machined from aerospace aluminum and finished with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for resistance to abrasion and corrosion, the E2L is O-ring and gasket sealed, making it waterproof to a depth of one meter. 

Due to its dual-output feature, extended runtimes, and the 10-year shelf life of 123A batteries, the E2L is not only the perfect choice for outdoor activities, it’s also an excellent choice for emergency/EMT personnel and as a disaster/survival kit light. 

For a smaller version of this flashlight, see our one-battery E1L Outdoorsman.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger Mini Thirty rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

These are hard to find locally rifles. Looking for .308 rifle of some sort, but will entertain all offers.  I know what these go for, and the mags, therefore no lowballing.

Also have an Ozark leather right side IWB holster, two 12 round magazines and one 10 round magazine, have 3 boxes of ammo, 1 Winchester white box and 2 Blazer. Minus 2 rounds from the Winchester to top off the 10 round mag I keep for home defense. Now the gun itself, It was purchased second hand from a soldier about to leave on deployment 2 months after he bought it in 2012. If I recall correctly, he said he put about 100 rounds through it, I have only put about 300 rounds(I refuse to pay price gouged rates for ammo.) so it just spends the days sitting on my night stand, gets cleaned and oiled around once a month regardless and well taken care of.

EDIT: Shot 2 mags so one of those boxes of blazers only has 29 rounds now instead of 50. Also forgot to mention previously, I placed this ad up for a friend so responses may be delayed since he works and I can't show him the messages right away, I try to update him within a day of receiving it though.

EDIT 2: Finally decided to sell, price is firm at 450, or 475 if we can't meet locally and I have to travel past Burgaw(No ride, will have to pay someone some gas to take me). Price includes the gun with original 12 round mag, box and stuff(originally paid $500) plus the extra 10 and 12 round mag($40 each mag), the Ozark holster(another $50), and the remaining ammo($50).

I am looking to sell (preferably) or trade my Ruger GP-161 (model 1704) with attached Burris 2x-20 long eye relief handgun scope. I would also like to include 645 rounds of .357 Mag ammunition. The gun has about 100 rounds through it and is in 99.9% condition. I purchased it new in January 2007.

The full list is:

-GP100 (model GP161 #1704) w/adjustable sights
-B-Square Revolver Mount - Ruger GP 100 Rib Mount 6"" non ported, Blue 42973
-Burris Zee Signature 1"" Rifle Scope Mount Rings for Weaver Style bases
-Burris 200228 2x20mm Posi-Lock Handgun Scope - Plex Reticle, Matte Black Finish
-Wolff Reduced Power Revolver Spring pack for GP100
-Original case
-Manual

The B Square mount installed with no issues and is fully removable and if you want to restore to the original factory adjustable iron sights. I also have a Wolff reduced power spring set for this gun which makes the trigger much lighter and crisper. I have ALL original components, case and manual.

The Burris scope is mounted with Burris Signature rings which use plastic inner rings to lock into the scope without marring it in anyway. The scope itself is the POSILOCK version which locks down the reticle against any harsh recoil. (The weight of the gun keeps the recoil mild anyway)

I also have 645 rounds of .357Mag ammo:

250 rounds Federal Classic 357B 125gr Hi-Shok JHP
205 rounds American Eagle AE357A 158gr Jacketed SP
100 rounds Federal Fusion 158gr F357FS1
50 rounds Remington CoreLokt 165gr RH357MA
40 rounds Federal Premium 180gr Castcore P357J

This is a great close-in deer hunting setup and includes everything you need to head straight to the range or field.

Specs on the gun can be found here:

http://www.ruger.com/products/gp100/specSheets/1704.html

Only difference is this gun has the nice rosewood grips that they replaced with a cheaper all rubber grip.

Comes with TWO MAGAZINES

Is this the smallest 9mm Parabellum aka 9mm luger ever made? This neat little pistol measures 5.6 x 4 inches and was made in the USA. For the size of a 380 or a Makarov you can have a 9mm Parabellum. If you've shot a plastic 380 you know how bad the recoil is on plastic guns.  At 24oz this is a heavier gun made in highly desirable Stainless Steel which helps stifle the recoil despite its compact size and with proper care it will last far longer than any plastic or alloy gun.

This is a rare collectible in its original box with paperwork. The box is worn but the pistol is in excellent shape with no pitting or holster wear. It looks just about like new. 

This gun has the reliable Euro-style mag release on the bottom like the old Berettas had but unlike them the release works VERY SMOOTHLY making for quick and easy release."

Bob Serva is the man who got Dan Wesson into 1911s and when CZ bought the company he left with the top gunsmiths to start Fusion Firearms. Every pistol is a full custom as there is no assembly line and everything is made to order. This gun has an ambi safety, Wilson Combat extended mag release and and all the trimmings. There is no writing on the gun other than the frame brand and sn so this makes the wording on a Les Baer look excessive. The gun was coated at the factory and has brown vz grips that you will never drop the pistol with. Trigger is set at a crisp 3.5lbs and has just had a new wilson combat bulletproof sear and disconnecter put in. This gun has less than 500 rounds through it and is not even broken in yet. At 10 yards I have shot thumbtacks weak handed with it. Has one mag included and I will include some more if I dig around and find it. One small nick on finish that can be recoated or finished. I am asking 3k or best offer as this is easily a 3300 buck pistol and has outshot wilson combats and nighthawks. I may trade for something interesting, would love a Czechmate since I am a CZ guy or some high end Dan Wesson Elite series pistols. Open to other trades but no basic 1911s or kimbers or paras. Springfield FBI may be considered with some cash or some other guns as I am a CZ nut. Only rifle I would consider is a favor and some cash or something else.
