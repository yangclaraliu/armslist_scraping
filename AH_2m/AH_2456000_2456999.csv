Used only a couple times almost brand new paid over $1500 but will sacrifice for $950. Only mark on gun is on sling stud, a new one is $11.00.
The Xtrema was released in mid-2004, to answer the call from hunters and target shooters for a complete do-all shotgun. Beretta’s goal was to produce a shotgun that could reliably fire 2¾” loaded with light target loads all the way through the 3½” super magnum round without any modification or settings to be dealt with. They decided to take the AL391-Xtrema, and update it to fit their needs. They also wanted to add as many recoil reduction features as possible to the shotgun to increase follow-up shot accuracy while target shooting and hunting

The A391 had several features that were designed to increase accuracy and reliability. For one, Beretta decided to strip away as many o-rings and springs as possible for less chance of wear, and also to make easier for the weapon to be field stripped without the accidental loss of parts. They chose to go with a gas-operated action instead of inertia-driven action.
Another advantage is in the over-bored barrel design, which reduces muzzle jump and also improves shot-patterns.
Beretta also redesigned their stock choke system by increasing the length of the choke inside the barrel for a more gradual constriction, without having to add to the length of the barrel like after-market choke tubes do.
They then also chose to take the time-proven technology of hydraulic shock absorption from car-manufactures and put it in the gun’s stock for up to 44% felt recoil reduction at the shoulder.
Beretta also saw the need for the gun to be protected from the elements so as to protect the gun in harsh hunting conditions such as water-fowl hunting, where salt spray can damage a gun within hours. Beretta’s answer to this need was to coat the gun’s working parts in a micro-thin membrane which completely protects the metal (which are not made from stainless steel, chromium, or aluminum) from corrosion while out in the field.
Other improvements include an extra long barrel tang (the part of the barrel that fits into the receiver, and is actually behind the chamber) to more accurately fix the barrel to the receiver in order to increase accuracy when using slugs with a scope fixed to the receiver.
Stock spacers are also available to change the length of pull without major modification."

I bought it several years ago and now since I have all but quit deer hunting, I have no need for it. While it is a BIGGG gun, it is not as brutal to shoot as I first imagined--it's a hand full for sure but managageable. It also has with it, a box of ammo with 14 ready to go rounds(375 grain cast bullets with 6 fired brass), a set of Lee loading dies, a box of 50 Hornady brass(never fired), about 25 515gr lubed cast gas checked bullets and a box of 50 350gr Speer HP jacketed bullets.

The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire.  The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform.  This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452.  Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation.  

The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.

This is a Type 56 SKS - manufactured at Jianshe Arsenal in late 1956 (has the '26' triangle factory code, serial number is 244,xxx). All numbers match except for the receiver cover (serial is 80,xxx). This is an early production rifle with all milled parts (instead of the stamped junk the Chinese produced after the mid 60s) and is in great shape. The bore is a little dark, but the rifling is strong. There's no pitting or rust. This rifle is a great shooter. 

There's some damage to the stock at the bayonet cut on the left side - see the photo below.

I also have 200 rounds of 123-grain Wolf steel case ammo for an extra $60.

Check my other listing for a Tapco Intrafuse stock I also have. If you want the rifle, stock, and ammo, we can work a deal.

Only legal buyers, you will need a valid Ohio drivers license.

Diamondback Firearms DB380HP 380 ACP 2.8"" 6+1 Pink Poly Grip & Frame/Blk Slide

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380, a micro compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""Zero-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a stainless steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine, and real windage adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. a steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for acrisp, smooth, five pound DAO trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA(Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier thanever. The slide barrel and internal parts are all hard coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

What you get, a ""pre-ban"" polytech AKS-47. Fires 7.62x39 ammo. From factory 386. Honestly it's the nicest ak I've ever handled. I still have all the parts from the way it came from the factory if you don't like the modifications i've made (they do make it much easier to shoot though)

It has a vltor m4 style collapsible tube with magpul MOE stock, has a mounting point for a burris fast fire that allows for cowitness of irons, a midwest industries quadrail, with Magpul RVG front grip, and a bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight, also has a PWS muzzle brake (kicks less now that my AR with an A2 style birdcage on it)

Also comes with everything needed to return it to the original state wood and spiker bayonet. And 4 chinese mags, and 1 no name mag, also comes with all my 7.62x39 ammo, I think that it's right around 1k of ammo. It's a 90 % full chinese tuna can, and probably another couple of hundred loose rounds, and some hollow point hunting rounds.

I'm asking $1400 for it, which after some research i believe to be a fair price. I won't ship it, face to face only and i'll need to see a drivers license and get a bill of sale signed. (just a CYOA thing) 

round count is unknown but I'm guessing it's at least 1 to 2k rounds, but it's an ak and still runs flawless.

ps i selected norinco as the manufacter as there was not an option for polytech same factories though pretty much."

Comes also with an inexpensive Mike's soft holster that works better than I thought it would.  Makes a good IWB and appendix carry.
Preferred : Trade straight across for a Shield 9MM for her in same condition with all factory stuff.
Might also consider a S&W M&P 40C or Glock 27 if LNIB with all factory stuff with a small bit of cash from me, or you can purchase the Shield 40 for $475.00 cash.  Then I get to buy her a Shield 9MM.

In case you havent noticed, there have been a few scammers out there lately. They are generally trying to sell semi-auto rifles or other high priced items. Here are a few things to look out for or ways to identify a scam:

1) The seller has a live.com email account. At least most of the scammers of interacted with here.
2) Copy and Paste the whole (or part of the) description into google search. The scammers are using bidding sites (like gunbroker) and using the descriptions verbatim. And often using the exact pictures from the bidding site.
3) The lister doesnt seem to know that Maryland just banned the item(s)
4) There are 2 or 3 items like this listed back to back
5) The seller will ask you to wire them money.

If you come across these scams, mark them as such to protect your brothers in arms."

What you are looking at is a Beretta M9 manufactured in early 1999.  This is a hard to find example of Beretta's famous US Military issued handgun.

This pistol is basically an unissued Military M9 that was sold to civilians prior the year 2000.  It features all the factory proof marks and also has serialized parts, factory metal guide rod, factory metal trigger, etc.

Here is a link that will describe in better detail what I am talking about.  This is NOT the same commercial M9 you can buy in the stores today.

http://militaryarms.blogspot.com/2012/05/civilian-m9-pistol.html

With this pistol I am including the original US Military nylon green holster that came with it along with (5) 15 round Beretta magazines and (2) 30 round Beretta magazines.  It currently has Hogue rubber grips that will come along with the factory original Beretta grips.  I will also throw in a snap cap for the new owner as well to practice dry firing.

I've been on here for a long time and I've had nothing but successful and enjoyable transactions.  I'm completely honest in my listing and I would rate this gun at 92% cosmetically and 100% mechanically.  It has some VERY minor holster wear from being shot.  This gun has had an exact round count of 1800 rounds through it which is nothing if you know this firearm.  Always lubed and cleaned after every outing.

Must be 21+ with a valid Illinois FOID."

BRAND NEW Traditions/Thompson Center Buckstalker 50 Cal Muzzle loader

Up for sale is my Traditions/Thompson Center 50 Cal Muzzle-loader!
This is a BRAND NEW gun! It has NEVER been fired.Still in the box! The only reason I am selling it is that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis and it has become so chronic I simply can’t go through the motions of loading it with any proficiency. It is just too cumbersome for me given the current state of how bad my hands have become disabled right now I’m sorry to say.
Other than MY problems, this gun has none. It is a first rate well-made firearm that will make a perfect gift to yourself or some other lucky person.The weight isn’t bad at all. The removable breech plug and the easy load system of this piece make it very desirable. I read at least 20-30 reviews on this gun before I purchased it and everyone that owns one had nothing but high praises for it. It is manufactured by Traditions inc by Thompson Center/Smith &Wesson so be advised it is manufactured by a great company and is very well made.

THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT GIFT ITEM FOR SOMEONE SINCE IT IS BRAND SPANKING NEW AND STILL IN THE ORIGINAL BOX!

I have $322.00 invested in it and my price is just $150.00!! I believe that to be a more than fair price for a Brand New Gun that has never been fired and still in the box.

(current retail of $1685.00) As it turns out, the return policy on Marital Bliss does not include a refund. 
I bought it new from the fine folks at Shooters Connection earlier this year. It's awesome. Pure 1911 awesome, inspired by Saint John Moses Browning himself. 

This 1911 is hand fit, the slide to frame fit is every bit as well done as a Brown or a Wilson. The bushing fit is perfect, no binding or stiction, but no slop either. 
It has a number of very nice features: 30LPI checking on the front strap, high cut beavertail grip safety with knuckle relief, and see that beautifully undercut trigger guard? All those features make this a very soft shooting, easily controllable gun. 

In addition to those features from the factory, the magwell has been professionally opened and blended on a mill by the incomparable Allen Moore (Indy area gunsmith who is a wizard on the mill - $100) This makes for speedy, smooth and consistent reloads. The mag glides in like ..well.....use your imagination. The slide also has a nice, conservative bevel on the bottom corners, as you can see in the photo. 

The slide stop has been upgraded to a forged tool steel unit from EGW. The grips are VZ Operators ($70) The factory STI cocobolo grips will be included. You'll also get both an EGW tool steel single sided safety ($60, pictured) and the OEM ambi safety. 

The trigger is currently set at 2.25lbs. You can easily go lighter. You can slap it like Ike slapped Tina and still get great hits. Between the top shelf fitting and the orgasmic trigger, this pistol is extremely accurate. The ignition system has the best of everything. Inifnity triglide trigger with short flat insert. EGW hard sear. Koening hammer, titanium strut and cap, Dawson hyperdrive firing pin. Its got a 21lb mainspring, so it will set off anything, and has about as fast a lock time as a 1911 is going to get. 

It's won me quite a few matches, as well as earned me my USPSA M card and a spot on the Top 20 Sandbagger list in SSTK. 

The gun will come with both the OEM dual springs recoilmaster system, as well as a 1 piece full length guide rod ($30) You'll get the factory mag release button, along with the Dawson Cam-lock extended button shown. Also the factory box, magazine, and bushing wrench. Factory mag as well. 

The gun was cerakoted recently, and looks really, really good. 

There is some wear in the magwell from dryfire practice. There's nothing wrong with the gun aside from that, and frankly I'd rather sell my right nut. Unfortunately, the market for that particular item isn't great, and the package is an absolute pain to split up. 

I'm asking $1500. If you ask what my bottom dollar is, it's $1700. I'm in the Muncie area, and would like to keep it reasonably close. (reasonably close = 30-45 minute drive) I'm willing to ship if you're not a resident of this picturesque area of the country and willing to pay for it. 

When/if gun sells, buyer will have first dibs on 10 Tripp mags, 2 Wilson ETMs, a DAA PDR and/or a Blade-tech holster. Not to be a Richard about it, but I wont be separating those until the gun is sold. Please dont ask. 

TRADES - I'm not really looking for any gun trades at the moment. Cash is King. Small pistol primers, Montana Gold/Zero/Precision delta 9mm jacketed projectiles, and VV N320, N330, N340 or Bullseye powder might be dukes or barons. I get fuzzy on the royal chain of command below princes, but you get the idea."
