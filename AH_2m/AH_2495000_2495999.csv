I'm particularly interested in trying out a S&W Shield or a Walther PPS.  I'm not looking to sell, I'm just looking to switch it up and try something new.  

My Nano is black and has been carried on and off.  It doesn't really show and holster wear yet to speak of.  I haven't shot it a ton... probably only ~200 rounds as I tend to shoot my full frame guns more often at the range.  It has Talon grips installed.  I have (3) 6 round mags and (1) 8 round mag for it.  Depending on the trade, I could include other extras I have with it like Trijicon night sights, a White Hat IWB holster & extra single stack 9mm holster (these kydex can be converted to other guns, so unless you have a specific holster to come with your trade I'd likely keep them and convert them to whatever I trade for).  

Please don't contact me with offers unless it's a single stack, striker fired 9 or 40.  I'm also not really interested in Rugers or Kahrs or Keltecs (have had them already).  I also have the case and everything that originally came in it.

It shoots 55, 60, 75, 80, and for deer 100 grain and 105. I can find only 2 imperfections on the rifle. One on the left mid stock. I belive it can be rubbed out. In addition there is a small nick in the black floor plate. The white spacers are bright white like new. It can be covered with a careful hand.  I have another 6mm and use if for deer in Michigan. I love that round. It has a Simmons 6x 18x scope with adjustments for distance. It looks new. I am setting the price at $950. I have more pics if you would like a close look.

Pistol cartridge lever-actions have had attention of the American public since the days of the Old West when having a rifle and pistol that shoot the same caliber just made sense.

There are numerous variations-rifles, carbines, standard loop, oversized loop-including Rossi's Model '92 hybrid-the Ranch Hand. The Ranch Hand is available in three popular pistol rounds- .38 Spl./.357 Mag., .44 Mag. and .45 Colt.

The Ranch Hand's 12-inch barrel complies with federal regulations, and features a gold-bead front sight with an adjustable buckhorn rear sight and an oversized loop lever.

[This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.]"

Easy fix for someone, i just don't do 1911's anymore and don't want to put the money into it.
Needs grip bushings, grip screws, and grips, and probably needs to have new springs all over. it's got some wear, and comes without magazines. Not interested in trades, only cash. I'm in Moore Co. and would prefer face to face. Feel free to ask questions.

a perfect condition vintage Browning firearm in a Same as New and Unfired 
condition is a Browning BDA 380. chambered in .380acp. Manufactured in 1979 
by Beretta for Browning Arms Company who imported and sold the pistols within
the U.S.A.

First produced in 1977 and discontinued in 1997. Resurrected I believe
in 2000 and produced possibly through 2009 with most being in a bright
nickel finish. The newest production years is only a guess and based on
the fact I have owned several with two that had serial number date codes
of 2000 and 2009.

This BDA .380's bright blued finish is virtually flawless and looks as
new as the day it was manufactured. Note the Browning ""B"" Medallion on
the wood grips which was commonly used up through 1985 and then
discontinued and replaced by the well known ""Buckmark"" logo. The pistol
comes in the original Styrofoam box with factory outer box and has its
original 13 round magazine along with a factory supplied bore brush (Not
seen in photos and located in a cavity on backside of Styrofoam box) as
well as the owners manual.

If you are a collector of Browning firearms and wish to have a pristine
addition to your stable, I believe you would be hard pressed to find a
superior specimen.

Asking $695.00, cash only transaction - NO TRADES AT THIS TIME.

Here's a recent auction sale - http://www.gunauction.com/buy/12247717
Note that the auction sale did not include the original factory packaging.

Private party sale, no sales tax or transfer fee.

Must be 18, Arizona resident and legally able to possess a firearm.

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights."

I am starting with the items that do not need a FFL dealer transfer - such as this gun.
I don't think people in NJ can buy an Antique gun w/o a FFL licensed dealer receiving the gun (according to other listinggs I have seen).

About this gun - This is a .31 caliber percussion pepperbox. I was told by someone who reviewed all of the guns (who is a antique gun restoration expert) that this little gun is a great collector's gun - for those who like pepperboxes or antique guns.

It is a six shot gun. The barrel fully rotates and cycles. I took a video showing the timing and the action. Numbers on inner workings, walnut grips, and other identifiying pieces all match (as seen in photos). I have not had it restored. It was lubricated in Eezox and wiped down. It was stored in a box for a long time. My grandfather said it was his wife's father's gun. Most of the guns I have to sell are from her father's gun collection. I've researched these guns and those selling them. It seems most people are trying to buff and make them shine. I'll let the buyer do what they want. The original patina on handle, barrel and trigger still exist. The inner workings look clean. 

It is a fun little gun to show people and definitely unique. I considered buying it myself...but I have my own toys that I was told by my wife...I don't need anymore.

From what I have seen for shipping I would have to do FEDEX or UPS Top Priority mail. So I am assuming $20 for shipping. I am willing to entertain reasonable offers. 

If you want additional pictures and the video...I'd be happy to email. 
Will accept check or money order. Will have to wait for check to clear before I will ship. I'm not business so I don't do returns."

This is a screw build (assembled with machine screws instead of rivets), so please do your research.  The barrel was removed from the front trunnion prior to removing the old rivets and tapping the trunnions.

I've had no issues with it, but I just don't shoot the AK much anymore.

Also included are a WW2 Era Double Pouch, oil can, and field adjustment tool. I also will include an rifle case which needs a new zipper, but is rate in that its actually long enough to fit a Mosin Nagant. I should also have a few stripper clips for those who'd rather not load one round at a time. 

I was my first firearm, but circumstances and a possible move mean it's time for it to find a new home, hopefully with someone who appreciates its history, would hate to see it bubba'd.  As I'll be traveling more in the coming year am open to considering a trade for a netbook or laptop.
