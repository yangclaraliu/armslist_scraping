Detailed pictures are also at this link. It ONLY has the very few rounds that were required to write the review through it. I meant to keep it as a sample, but my safe is overflowing, so I would like to let it go.

The price as shown on the link above (yes, the factory tag is still on, and yes, I do have the box/papers!), including Tasco 3x9 scope and rings is $150 + tax. This is cheaper than the cheapest online price I was able to find ($150 + transfer and shipping, with no scope). I think this is a pretty good deal.

I will throw in 325rd of Federal AutoMatch ammunition for $15 (+tax) more if you buy this rifle.

This is sold as a demo gun, so you will have full warranty from Savage on it. There will be NICS check (free), and taxes, as I am a dealer.

FAQ - PLEASE READ! I am not going to respond to questions that are covered here!

Q. I am interested in your gun. Is it still available?

Finish is beautiful overall great gun. It would include 1 box 230 grain ball ammo and 2 8 round magazines. Now there is 1 issue and 1 issue only with this gun. It will need to either be sent back to the manufacturer or a local gunsmith or maybe dyi. It has an issue with the mag release. It doesn't hold the mag up far enough to feed properly. The mags don't fall out or anything of that nature, rounds will sometimes nosedive due to this issue. If you know 1911's this really is not a major issue. You could do what I do if you choose not to fix, which is apply pressure with the weak hand palm to the base of the mag and it functions 100%. Just letting everyone know so there is no confusion. Now back to the gun, cimmaron is basically rock island armory, both armscor made in the Philippines. Brand new from gunbroker, cheaper than dirt and a few other retailers the nickel version goes from $550-680, buy it online pay for an ffl and shipping its minimum $600-700+. I'm asking $500 trade value. It should be less than $50 to repair to 100%. I have photos to provide via email. Lastly, I will ONLY do business through an ffl mine at my expense or yours at your expense. Sorry no exceptions. Also I'd like to stay local to southern NH, Amherst, Milford Nashua area."

235,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2965235,For Sale:  Heckler and Koch HK45,"Springdale, Fayetteville, Arkansas",$ 950,"Listed On: Saturday, August 16, 2014",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"HK45 in Like New Condition.  Comes in box w/two 10 Rd mags.  Only comes w/medium backstrap.  Call or text 47nine-two3six-3seven21.

The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull.

Extensively tested and operationally proven, the HK45 Series is a new paradigm for Heckler & Koch handgun design and is currently being assembled from U.S. and German made components at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire.

Key features and system characteristics:
Integral MIL STD 1913 (Picatinny) rail molded into the polymer frame dust cover for mounting lights, laser aimers, and other accessories
Ergonomic grip profiles with user replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the weapon to suit individual operator hand size and shooting preference
HK45 grip-to-slide angle matches Model 1911’s profile
Common high-capacity metal magazines with a capacity of 10 rounds (for both HK45 and HK45 Compact models).

The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

It is not some old police trade in, but a commercial model that came with the ghost sight/tritium front option and an 18"" cylinder choke barrel. The tritium is pretty much faded at this point. If you are unfamiliar with the 1201FP, it uses an inertia style action very similar to the Benelli M1 Super 90. VERY fast shooter. They were commercial cousins back in the day. This one includes the original factory stock, a new Choate pistol grip style (with much more comfortable recoil pad), box and instructions. Original owner claimed six rounds through it. I'll claim five more. Just don't get out with a tactical shotgun and it's gathering dust. Asking $800 for everything. Compare that to a new Remington or Mossberg semi-auto combat shotgun.

Read online reviews to see that CZ owners also rave about Canik pistols!

I am the original owner and have taken this to the range just once test-firing about 30 rounds of defensive JHP from one magazine to see how it handles (the other mag never inserted in the pistol). New Hogue wraparound grips installed afterward but not fired subsequently. Included are two original hi-cap Mec-Gar magazines, original carry case, and all paperwork with everything that came from the factory.

Absolutely no wear on outer finish or internal mechanics. Truly a handsome auto-pistol with a proven history for reliability and ease of use. Lightweight alloy frame feels wonderfully balanced when carrying a full 16 rounds. You can feel the quality in your hand.

Please make me your very best offer & where you are and I'll respond if it's doable. DO include your local phone number if you expect a reply.  Private bill-of-sale transaction with a legal AZ firearm owner -no tax, no shipping. 

If you are reading this ad, the Canik will still be available for you to buy. Ad will be pulled immediately so no need to ask if it sold. I am in Bisbee but go to Tucson on business.  Feel free to contact me with your best-offer (and include your contact number).

precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many
features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use
with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was
chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all
lighting conditions, without failure prone batteries.

XD gear has hardly been used (went through all backstraps only once to test fit, picked largest and rest have not been molested since). Mag loader was never used as I purchased a speed loader instead. I did switch the fiber optic insert to the green, originally red. Has all the original paperwork that comes with it behind the top foam insert. Only reason I'm selling it is to purchase a CCW, and since I purchased an AR, it doesnt get much attention anymore at the range. Last time it was fired was on 4/9/14 to ensure everything was still working properly (150 rounds), had been quite a while prior to that from last time being fired. Would prefer local FTF deal, but I suppose FFL shipping isnt out of the question. Pictures show the wear on the barrel from the slide."

Gauge:  12

Fires:  2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

Magazine Capacity:  5 + 1

Barrel length:  18.5""

Condition:  Like new.

This is a home defense model with an 18.5"" Barrel, which is perfect for home defense.

I bought this two weeks ago however I must sell it.

This is a private sale, I have the box and manual for it.

Shotgun has had 30 shells fired through it, all ejected with no problem.  This is essentially a Remington 870 Clone and works just like one. 
I fully stripped and cleaned it already, so you don't have to worry about that.  These will accept most 870 parts and upgrades.

You can spend $400-500 for a Remington or Mossberg or save money and get a Pardner Pump.

I take only cash, and will meet you at a public parking lot in the Johnson City/Jonesborough area.

$270 is about what you'll pay with taxes and background check, so I'm passing the savings over to you.

This will still have a warranty since it's only 2 weeks old.


I can send more pictures upon request, I also have a Weaver Rail that I did not install which I will throw in.  This shotgun is already pre-tapped so you just need to screw it on."
