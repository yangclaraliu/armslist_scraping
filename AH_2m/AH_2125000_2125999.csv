There is a bit of discoloration around the crest on the receiver, but that is common on Soviet weapons due to the bluing they used. Otherwise, the bluing is 99% and there is absolutely no wear on the rifle other than a couple of tiny knicks in the wood from storage. This is the original SKS rifle many others were to follow and are quite uncommon in the US. Not interested in trading, face to face greatly preferred to shipping. Thanks for looking!"

This PF-9 has the flat dark earth frame with a blued slide. 

The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. 

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

 The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Fayetteville. Give me a call @ 479-445-six4eight0 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged to an FFL near you for $25.00. Check us out on Facebook @ www.facebook.com/thearmsroomnwa Thanks for looking and have a good day."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

This is one of the nicest ar pistols you will see, and best handling i have ever seen.

M 1943 - factory and year. M indicates the Maltby royal ordnance factory in Maltby, England. year 1943. 

A G - serial number prefix. A G was the first prefix used early in 1943. A also indicates the gun was assembled using some non-standard parts from contractors. This means it was hand crafted and unique, so it will most likely have very little compatibility with standard rifles of the same model. G is a simple reference letter.

Approximation -  This rifle was produced in February of 1943 at the Maltby royal ordnance factory. It was assembled by hand using the best parts available. The overall finish and appearance of the gun was secondary to the performance. It is one of a kind and shoots great. It may have been used in battle in 1943-1945."

I recently have had many people tell me they can buy a Cabelas special AR-15 for only $800.  So I went and looked.  The AR they sell is Bushmaster with a plastic lower and upper.  No magazine and no sights whatsoever and a 1/2 size stock.  If you aren’t really ever going to shoot it, and you want an expensive wall ornament, then that is ideal. With tax, FFL fee and only one magazine you are around $950 for a plastic gun and cheap parts.   This one is top of the line and fully upgradeable, plus, you can own it today!  NO background check, No FFL fees, and No waiting 6-12 weeks for shipping if you bought directly from the manufacturer…

The upper is a flat top, optics ready upper made by Palmetto State Armory.  It has a chrome lined barrel stamped 5.56 NATO (it has a 1:7 twist).  I added a quad rail, flashlight, and laser to the front.  Both the flashlight and laser have pressure switches, but I have the regular push button on the flashlight. I've also added a flash hider to the barrel and a badger latch to the charging handle. It has a 6 position mil spec stock and is set up for a sling with front and rear sling mounts. I've never put a sling on it, but I have an OD green sling that I'll throw in with the sale. I've also got a hard case that I'll include with the sale. The AR comes with a brand new, still in the wrapper black pmag.

The rifle was test fired, then put in the safe and hasn't moved. I've got another rifle that I use as my primary AR, so I've decided to sell this one. I've got about $1000 in this set up, but listing at $875 for quick sale.  Let me know if you have any questions or need additional pictures."

Walther P38 9mm Luger in great condition. It comes with one 8 round magazine. All matching numbers except for the magazine. I have shot around 50 rounds of Winchester white box through it and it functions flawlessly. This is a very accurate gun. Blueing is a little worn in places, but overall it is still in great condition. After WW2, from 1945 to 1957 no P38s were produced for the German military. However, when the newly formed ""Bundeswehr"" (German Defense Force) announced it wanted the P38 as its official service pistol, Walther resumed production of the P38 and the first ones were delivered to the West German military in June 1957. This particular gun was produced October 1957 (10/57 stamped) for the Bundeswehr. It bears the eagle markings and ""BW"" stamp.

2. $400. Russian Makarov. 9x18 Makarov. It comes with one 8 round magazine and 150rds of 9x18 ammo. IJ70-18A Made in Russia by IMEZ. IMEZ stands for Izhevskii Mechanicheskii Zavod or Izhevsk Mechanical Factory located in the city of Izhevsk near the Ural Mountains. They produce the Makarov, PSM, various shotguns, airguns, artificial pacemakers for the heart, oil drilling equipment. It is a goverment, state owned enterprise, but has the right to close its own business contracts and deals without govermental interferance.
Baikal is a foreign trade organization this is similar to North China Industries (NORINCO). This was a govermental organization that was used to market Soviet goods abroad. These days Baikal is hardly active in any trade with the US, largely because of the Bill Clinton imposed ""voluntary trade restrictions."" IMEZ used the grips with Baikal on it because...well, it was all they had.... Baikal also traded autos, trucks, various other consumer goods. Not only guns and ammo.

Information on the Busmaster 450...

BIG BORE PERFORMANCE FOR THE AR PLATFORM.
Nicknamed ""The Thumper,"" the 450 Bushmaster is the most radical cartridge ever chambered in production AR-15 type firearms. Hornady brings big bore performance to the most popular semi-automatic rifle in America — opening a whole new world of hunting to the battle-proven platform.

Hornady engineers worked closely with the Bushmaster design team building the cartridge to wring every last ounce of performance from the AR-15 without sacrificing any strength or reliability./

Well suited to hunt any North American game, the 450 Bushmaster will quickly become a favorite of bear country guides. By simply switching uppers, shooters can go from the prairie dog towns of South Dakota to bear country in the north woods!

The 450 Bushmaster fires Hornady’s 0.452” 250 gr. SST-ML featuring Hornady’s Flex Tip™ technology.
The overall cartridge matches the 223 Remington at 2.250”, but uses a specially designed magazine.
The SST’s sleek profile makes for surprisingly flat trajectories and tremendous downrange energy.
Put it all together, and you have a cartridge that gives your AR series rifle a serious attitude adjustment!"

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 rifle for target sports, hunting or personal defense. Smith & Wesson was able to offer this rifle at such an incredible value by changing some features. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time with exceptional accuracy performance. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dust cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, MagPul MBus rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. The perfect platform for a first-time AR-15 Build. The M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for!
