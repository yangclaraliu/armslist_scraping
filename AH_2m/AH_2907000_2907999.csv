If you want to shoot long range, this is a great gun for it.  The 300WM round is nearly twice the size of a standard 308 round.  The 300 Win Mag rounds are typically less than $2/round - not $5-10/round like 338 Lapua and 50 BMG.  You wil have the same accuracy, and can shoot all day at the discounted ammo price.  If you haven't checked it out yet, the new Long Shot Range will be a great place to visit with this rifle.

I am asking $1800 OBRO for the rifle, scope base and magazines.  I will throw in the $100 Harris bipod for $60.  Total package price is $1860 - a smokin deal for a ready to go package for shooting long range. A new one with no accessories, no scope rail and one magazine is $3400.  This i half price!

Please reach out to me with any questions or reasonable offers.  Thanks for looking!

FYI - there is no scope - I took my US Optics off and will be keeping it."

The Smith & Wesson Model 60, the world's first stainless steel revolver, was a success from its introduction in 1965. Praised by both law enforcement and sportsmen, the Model 60 was a stainless steel version of the Chiefs Special®; and began the era of stainless steel handgun production. The Model 60 is the perfect choice for those seeking a small frame, all-steel revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance.

The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads.  Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

165,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2907165,For Sale/Trade:  1966 Ford Thunderbird,"Oro Valley, Tucson, Arizona","$ 7,500","Listed On: Saturday, April 5, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello,

I am relocating to Montana for work on short notice. As such, I am forced to sell my T-bird, as I will not have room for it where I am headed. 

The car is pretty much a factory original 390 4-barrel A/C car. 

Pretty much meaning I've replaced the front ball joints(01/13), tires (02/13), re-cored and replaced the radiator (04/14), and the previous owner removed the A/C compressor and lost it.

It has one minor issue, that causes a major problem, that being a pinhole leak in the expansion tank. A new one can be found at the link below. I tried to fix it last weekend before I had to leave town while I was installing the radiator but ran out of time. The tank can be repaired, for probably less than $100.00 if you were to take it to a shop, and probably for less than $50.00 if you were to do it yourself. The major problem caused by the leak of course is that you can't hold coolant for long in the pressurized tank.
http://www.macsautoparts.com/ford_thunderbird/ford-thunderbird-expansion-tank-filler-neck-on-left-side-1965-66.html

Aside from that issue, the car starts on the first turn of the key every time, and it runs like a champ. It has power windows, door locks, seats, and steering. The original AM radio, and sequential turn signals that work perfectly. Paint and chrome are in pretty good condition too. It's been a FUN daily driver, and city cruiser, it gets thumbs ups and cheers from people on the road all the time. I will miss it. 

You can see for yourself, the car's value ranges from $5,300 to $12,000 as a base model; however, with the engine being the 390/335 HP V8 Engine 4 barrel model, it gets a value bump of 30%, to a range of $6,900-$16,700. 
http://www.nadaguides.com/Classic-Cars/1966/Ford/Thunderbird/2-Door-Hardtop/Values

If you were to replace the missing A/C parts overall value goes up another 10%.
http://www.nadaguides.com/Classic-Cars/1966/Ford/Thunderbird/2-Door-Hardtop/Values

All that being said, needing to sell it, and understanding that it needs some work to get it back on the road properly, I am willing to take around $7,500, I'm also willing to accept reasonable cash + trade offers. The title is clean, from NV, and a bill of sale will be provided at the sale. 

Let me know if you have any questions or fair offers."

Shotgun","Derby, Wichita, Kansas",$ 800,"Listed On: Saturday, April 5, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is one remarkable used, but not abused, collectable double barrel shotgun. Manufactured in 1902, its Damascus barrels are embellished with a beautiful pattern and the receiver has a fine case hardened finish. The action is flawless and it locks up tight.The bore is excellent. This gun is being sold on consignment. It has not been cleaned and should sparkle when it is. It has some usual wear scratches and a chip in the rear of the stock and butt plate, but will look great in a collector's cabinet. I appraise this gun at $1200, when cleaned up. The listed price makes it affordable to have a fine piece of history and an investment. As this gun is 112 years old, one should consult a gunsmith before even considering to fire it. Plus the Damascus barrels may not be able to withstand modern loads.
Owner will consider trading for a  Sig Sauer P938.

Bullets & Beans is a small, home-based FFL, started because I was fed up with gun shop prices, transfer fees, and 'take it or leave it' attitudes. As I run out of my house, my low overhead allows me to sell, accessories, and build/modify firearms at reasonable prices and all transfers are $20. I am always willing to provide information or a price check, just email me what you are looking for and I will get back to you in a couple days (as I do this part-time) with a price and availability. I can also provide a price check if you need a bargaining chip for a new gun at a local shop."

Bullets & Beans is a small, home-based FFL, started because I was fed up with gun shop prices, transfer fees, and 'take it or leave it' attitudes. As I run out of my house, my low overhead allows me to sell, accessories, and build/modify firearms at reasonable prices and all transfers are $20. I am always willing to provide information or a price check, just email me what you are looking for and I will get back to you in a couple days (as I do this part-time) with a price and availability."

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR

This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't
be bought at WalMart they have to be custom made which the price reflects"

I have an early import model PSL/ROMAK 3 I am willing to part with. I am the second owner but the only one to have fired it, I had to clean enough cosmoline off the thing to grease two tractors.  Being an early model it has the bolt hold open and it was assembled by people not drunken monkeys, so no obviously canted sights and everything fits snug and true. It comes with 4 great fitting 10 round mags a consistent QD 8 power PSOP scope with AA powered illuminated, ballistic calibrated, ranging reticle with a new green bulb and a new extra bulb if I can find the little SOB. All matching serial numbers, trunnion, top cover, bolt, bolt carrier, gas tube, trigger group, safety(minus the rear sight, beats me.).  And a sealed 440rd tin of Hungarian lps Light ball that consistently grouped sub 2moa and one can opener. 
Trunnion lugs are in very good shape, the rifle has had less than 750 rounds of only light ball or my light hand loads through it.  It has very nice/strong 4 groove rifling and no visible throat erosion or bore corrosion.  
It has been modified properly in the following. Polished and re-crowned the chrome lined barrel and chamber. Trigger modified to two stage combat weight, not some redneck “super-ultra-match trigger“. Recoil spring modification that is removable. Removable recoil buffer added. Hammer and trigger pin retention plate added. Firing pin modified to prevent slam fires on Federal gold metal match/soft primers while keeping it strong and centered in the firing pin channel. Safety modified for ease of use without being lose as a two dollar whor.., lady of the night. The only blemish to this rifle is there was a crack in the gas tube furniture(wood) but it is now fixed and I reinforced it with fiberglass, some very light gas tube pitting from military use and a scratch by the muzzle.

It is also for sale on an auction website with a $500.00 starting price.  It can be purchased here face to face as long as there are no bids on it there. Pick up in High Ridge Mo. Shipping to your FFl is available for an extra $30.00 .He's not looking for any trades. Only selling it to fund a deep sea fishing trip.  Here's the details : Its a Serbian M59/66A1 (Yugo) and numbers matching in Excellent condition. It has the factory flip up night sights in addition to the standard sights. It's very nice. According to the serial number, it was produced in 1973. It was purchased this past year from Cabelas and while we were there, picked up a New Tapco 6 position adj. stock with a blade bayonet cutout and SAW pistol grip and bipod. The Tapco stock alone cost a hundred bucks at Cabelas. The rifle came smothered in cosmoline. I personally disassmbled it and thoroughly cleaned it and put it back together in the new tapco stock. The original stock appears to be laminated but if its not, it has a real nice grain pattern to it and its in fantastic condition with no dents or scratches that I can see. (its still covered with cosmoline so its wrapped in plastic wrap). It has the factory 10 round clip. It has the blade bayonett, and it has a bag with all kinds of goodies that looks like a sling, cleaning kit, ammo pouches, oil can and a rope thats weighted on the ends with lead. I finally just fired 2 boxes of Tula thru it today (03-29-2014)to verify it has no issues and re-cleaned it. Imported by C.A.I Georgia Vt.--------"

No need to get into a lengthy description of detail about the RAMI because I am sure everyone knows about it but if you do not, feel free to ask. 
 
All I have done is give it a good cleaning to get the factory packing grease off of it and put it in the safe.
Flawless looking and a Great feeling pistol with the 10 round mag as shown and with the 14 round extended mag that also comes with it. A lot of good looking fire power in such a small work of art.

I know that the de-cocker CZ'S are more popular and harder to come by than the safety models but I prefer the safety models.

     Retail on this weapon would be well over asking price, but liquidating a couple prized weapons to assist in purchase of land, and will let this one go for $5,500. I can take ANY type of payment (Credit Cards add a 3% charge over purchase price though), but cash or check or money order would not incur tax charges. Just ask if you'd like any further information or pictures...this is literally the flagship of T.1.T.U.S.'s line of weapons that shoots very accurately over 1200 meters (shooter dependent of course), and is an incredible weapon system that can be upgraded even further before or after purchase with accessories such as a N.V.D. or F.L.I.R. systems.

Used but in excellent condition Sig Sauer P-226 S4 Suppressor Series handgun chambered in 9mm (9x19 luger, para. This is a very rare and limited edition Sig P226. It was a distributor exclusive for RSR a few years ago. What makes this handgun very special is that it came from the factory with suppressor sized Sig Night Sights (rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable) and even better and impossible to find - a factory threaded Sig barrel, threaded in 1/2x28 for us Americans. All Sig threaded barrels are all metric so that is what makes this piece so unique. Night sights are very bright and short of a little finish wear on the barrel, I can't seem to find any other cosmetic issues with this piece. She was mostly a safe queen. Threads on the barrel are clean and not buggered up. Includes factory thread protector.

Includes the original case, owner’s manual, lock, and 3 Sig Sauer 15 round magazines.

This is a great and reliable pistol, and the only reason it is being sold is because I need the money to go towards my truck. You will not be disappointed in this Sig."
