Argentine Model 1909 DWM $2550
All serial numbers are matching,all parts are original each marked with unique Argentinian Mauser symbols that I am not familiar with but look quite exotic,mirror mint bore, gunsmith gauged as never fired or likely less then 50 rounds or so, literally almost no handling marks anywhere on stock,perfect everything,smooth action,very prominent and bright Argentinian national crest. This rifle has not been sanded,sporterized,refinished,repaired or altered in anyway then when it came off factory floor production 100+ years ago guaranteed. Highest quality Mauser variant ever made as agreed by all Collector's, a high point of artisan craftsmanship.Chambered for accurate 7.65x53mm Argentine. No import mark defacing pre-1964 import. This specific rifle made out of exotic West African Mahogany as I am told from my research and local expert woodworker (not from walnut as I incorrectly originally assumed, I am not an expert of different woods.), which was the luxury wood import into Europe around 1907, around time this rifle was made. This is not the cheap,low quality,plentiful 1891 or cavalry model Argentinian Mauser. As good of condition as a 100+ year old rifle can be found in 2014 I guarantee it, best condition Mauser rifle I have seen in all my time. Excellent addition to collection best condition Mauser I have come across. USPS MO.

These rifles hardly been used, so finding one like this with the original box and accessories is getting harder and harder.  It will definitely be a nice piece in someone's collection. The rifle appears to be unfired. It's in as perfect a shape as it can be after 20 years. The finish is as close to perfect as you can get. What appears to be all the factory accessories are there including the original manual and scope. All-in-all, a great package. This package comes with the rare factory SVD buttstock instead of the usual Tiger thumbhole stocks. Very few were shipped to the States like this. The rifle is ready for a new home, don't miss this opportunity. 


For those who do not already know, these Tiger rifles are the ""friendly, sporting"" version of the infamous Russian Dragunov SVD sniper rifle. They have the exact same receiver and all parts interchange with the original rifle. Simply add a flashhider and a military stock set and you're very close to the original SVD rifle. The barrel is four inches shorter than the full military version, but this has little-to-no impact on the accuracy or range of the weapon. With no more of these ever coming into the country, this is a great piece to own."

It is an original Series 1 gun so no Schwartz safety like the current versions. I am the original owner and would estimate that the gun has had maybe 400 rds fired through it. 

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim. The only change from factory is that i replaced the gray plastic mainspring housing with a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have the factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included.

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured.

Depending on the deal offered i have a set of blue and black Carbon Creation carbon fiber flat bottomed grips for a magwell , a extended 10rd ProMag magazine and a Galco black leather OWB holster that can be worked in.

Precision of Kansas City, Missouri and was used to test longevity of barrel steels. 
It takes the already over-bored parent case of a .30-378 Weatherby, and ""super sizes"" it, making it one of the fastest 30 caliber offerings available.
As with Ackley's chamber designs, there is no turning of necks or prepping of brass.  Simply load a .30-378 Weatherby Magnum case to 90%, and fireform.
To date, the best fire forming load uses Retumbo, Remington 9 1/2 Large Rifle Magnum Primers, Weatherby Brass, and the 155 grain Lapua Scenar. 
It will launch a 155 gr. Lapua Scenar at over 4000 fps with ease.  Maximum loads in 30-inch and longer barrels will produce velocities in excess of 4,100 fps.  
A rifle producing these velocities only needs 16 MOA or 4 MILs of adjustment to reach 1000 yards on target. The .300 12 Egg Magnum 
was named afterChris Matthews of Long Shot Rifles, who was an employee of GAPrecision, and a big proponent of the overbored cartridges.
At the time of this writing, GA Precision was the only known holder of a .300 12  Egg Magnum Reamer..."

The only manual input is wind calculation. Essentially you lock on to your target with the Tag button, the TP persistently tracks your target as it moves, then when you pull the trigger the rifle won't fire until you're on target, then the XactSystem guides your shot on target. The ballistic computer in the TP scope accounts for all range and environmental factors, and it adjusts the reticle position accordingly to hit the tagged target.
It comes as a complete firing system in a custom hard case with 200 rounds of XactShot ammo, plus an iPad pre-loaded with Tracking Point apps and all the batteries, chargers, mags, cleaning supplies, and instructions you need"

Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail"

Manufacturer description:
The powerful blowback effect of this CO2 pistol makes for very realistic shooting.
One special feature is the magazine with two 8-shot cylinders. After emptying one cylinder, the shooter just has to take out the magazine and turn it around to get eight more shots. This works for BBs as well as 4.5 mm pellets. The Px4 Storm can take both kinds of ammunition. The safety slide for decocking is another important detail.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

I am looking to sell or trade my entire Traditions Vortek/Leupold UltimateSlam muzzleloader and black powder setup which has seen virtually no use. I have fired the gun about 40 times with zero problems and most of the stuff below is in sealed packages or 99% full/unused. All the powders are full.

The Vortek represents the top of the line for Traditions muzzle loaders and this Leupold UltimateSlam combo is no longer sold. The scope came mounted from the factory and carries Leupold’s unconditional lifetime warranty. I have the manual and DVD from the muzzleloader.

This is a total package that contains everything you need for next muzzle loader season. You can't find this Leupold combination any more, probably was too expensive for Cabela's to make money.

The full list is below, everything from primers to powder to cleaners to bullets and sabots. You won’t need to buy a single extra accessory! Save yourself the HAZMAT fees, shipping fees, time and a lot of money!

I am looking for $850 for this entire lot. I believe that is a great deal for you but if you disagree please feel free to make an offer or suggest a trade. The Blackhorn 209 powder alone is $34 each before hazmat and shipping. There is several hundred dollars worth of ammo, powder, primers and accessories, along with the rifle and scope that are in mint condition. The Leupold scope new is $300.

If you are interested but can't take the powders/primers (i.e. a different state) please contact me and we'll work out another price, including shipping.

The original description of the combo, From Cabela’s, is below, along with a link to the product page.

Traditions™ Vortek™ Ultra Light Muzzleloader/Leupold® Ultimate Slam® Scope Combo – Cerakote/Realtree AP™

Extend your effective shooting range beyond 200 yards with this ultralight black-powder rifle. The 150-grain magnum load produces reliable and consistent groups at long ranges. By succeeding where other muzzleloaders fail, the award-winning Vortek has instantly emerged as one of the most sought-after muzzleloaders in the industry. Remarkably, these rifles weigh in at just 6.25 lbs. and exhibit the rugged durability you demand for hunting in extreme conditions. The drop-out trigger assembly promotes fast, easy cleaning by simply removing one screw. Factory-set at 4 lbs. of pull, the trigger spoils you with its crisp, creep-free action. The Hogue® overmolded buttstock and forearm ensure a secure grip on wet days with superior balance in the shooting position. Accelerator Breech Plug™ removes quickly and easily. 
Scoped combo includes: factory-installed and boresighted Leupold Ultimate Slam 3-9x40 muzzleloader scope with Sabot Ballistics Reticle (SABR).
Available: .50 caliber. 
Barrel length: 28"".
Overall length: 44"".
