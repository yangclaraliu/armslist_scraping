Its in pretty good shape.  Maybe 200 rounds through it.  This is part of the latest generation of M&P's so it has the enhanced reset and sear as part of the factory package.  It comes with three magazines, all with the pinkey rest.  Also comes with the original box, backstraps, and normal goodies. 

Also, it has a rubberized Talon grip on it, but part of it did not adhere very well and I cut it off to keep it from pulling the rest of it off.  The grip still works very well, and if you dont want it on, it is easily removed and cleaned off the grip."

The gun comes with case, aftermarket wood grips, 2 high quality mags. I did have the the trigger done to make it a nice smooth crisp pull and the ramp polished when I got it. So i know what i have done to it and what the gun is worth. Im looking to trade this gun only due to the fact it sits more than it is used and would rather someone shoot it than sit.

268,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2461268,For Sale:  CZ P-01 NIB,"Cuyahoga Falls, Akron, Ohio",$ 600,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 12, 2014",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"The P-01 9mm was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ's Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!

For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public.

FTF in NE Ohio preferred. Must be 21 and able to own a firearm. OH ID required.

It is a 50th anniversary Ruger .357 revolver commemorating the golden anniversary of the FBI National Academy. If you know what the academy is then you know that select individuals from local and state agencies can be chosen to attend by their employing agency. 

I bought this gun from the Deputy Chief of one of our local police depts in 2007. It has been a safe queen ever since. I have never fired it but can't say for sure that it never has been fired. It is is good to excellent condition, with a couple wear marks on the frame and a nick or two in the wooden grip. The glass topped presentation case is not perfect either. This pistol has the FBI academy seal on the top of the frame, as well as on the right side of the frame. Also says ""FBI national academy"" along the backstrap. It was made in 1985, as the academy was founded in 1935. So yes, this gun is around 29 years old. If I had to guess, I'd say it is a Redhawk revolver but don't quote me on that. Please study the pics. See below for trade info...

The rifle bears a resemblance to the Colt M16 family of firearms but is chambered in .22 LR. As they are two entirely different firearms, there is no interchangeability of parts.

There are some prominent differences between the two. For example, the carry handle on the M16 22 is considerably smaller and moved farther forward along the body of the rifle than the Colt, and the stock of the Armscor model is made of wood as opposed to plastic. There is also a model with a collapsible stock (designated M1600R). The rifle was conceived out of want of an M16-like rifle in .22 caliber. This is a reasonably accurate semi-automatic rifle for plinking.

As compared to the Colt M16 the M1600 has very much less recoil making it easy to handle. This rifle is suitable for hunting small game. The rifle was originally manufactured by a company known as Squires Bingham Co.

My father bought this rifle new years ago, I shot it a ton when I was much younger and still enjoy shooting it now. Being winter and with heat and xmas right around the corner I could use a bit of extra cash.

First introduced in 2000, nearly 300,000 CompM2 sights are now in use by many Armed Forces including elite Special Forces around the world. The CompM2, also known as the M68/CCO (when used by US forces), is the standard sight for the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as well as the armed forces of many NATO countries. Due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision device (NVD), the CompM2 is ready for use around the clock. The CompM2 holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, the CompM2 is completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2,5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use the CompM2.

I just received my second Kel Tec KSG from an order a long time ago.  It is black without optics or sights as expected.  The price is not negotiable and it is for sale until I remove the ad.  If you are a serious buyer I suggest calling and paying via CC as the first to pay will own this.  Price is $1000 cash out the door. Credit card add 4%. Free shipping unless KY resident then add $25 to cover shipping/tax combination.  Doubtful to see another for a while as these are like unicorns. No trades.
