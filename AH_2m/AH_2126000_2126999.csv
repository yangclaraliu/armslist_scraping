This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 rifle for target sports, hunting or personal defense. Smith & Wesson was able to offer this rifle at such an incredible value by changing some features. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:9R twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time with exceptional accuracy performance. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dust cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, MagPul MBus rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. The perfect platform for a first-time AR-15 Build. The M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for!

I ordered this rifle a long time ago and while I waited, I found something else that better suits my needs.  I'm gonna shoot this one soon if someone doesn't take it off my hands.  It's pretty awesome.

MSRP is $2172 then add 9.75% TN sales tax and $10 background gets you $2,393.77

My price is only $2050 and I've got to be firm on that.  That's real cheap for this rifle.

Because this factory Ceracoted Flat Dark Earth version is so rare, most dealers are getting full MSRP.  My price is $343.77 under what you'd pay at the LGS.  I got a little bit of a deal, and whoever buys this is getting a deal.

I'd prefer the rifle go to a CCP, LEO or card carrying NRA member.

For $250 more, you can get my 5 brand new 308 pmags and 100 rounds of Magtech 308.

If you need to trade something for credit, that's fine, just realize that I can not give you top retail $$ for your trade.  Also, the maximum credit I'm willing to give is $1000.  I like anything Sig, Glock, Pump action shotguns, and ammo.

They combine the optical performance of the most precise range scopes with the practicality of scopes engineered for the the most rugged field conditions.

RainGuard, the revolutionary new lens coating developed by Bushnell, is now available on Bushnell Elite 4200 riflescopes. RainGuard is a special water repellent coating on which condensation forms in much smaller droplets when the scope is exposed to rain, fog, or snow. These droplets result in a much clearer and more usable view. Water actually sheets off of RainGuard coated lenses much more readily than from a standard coating. Now the hunter will not miss the shot of a lifetime because he accidently breathed on his scope eyepiece while aiming.

Originally purchased this pistol for my wife, the pistol has only been functioned tested, with match ball ammo. Had hoped that my wife could use this for bulls eye competition shooting, but because of the rail, the barrel is considered weighted, so ordered her a Les Baer Match Pistol. She carries a smaller .45 for her conceal carry. This pistol needs a new home.

Other info: Thinning out my collection. Up for sale or trade is a Springfield 1911a1 mil spec in 45acp. It has probably 1k rounds through it and has always functioned flawlessly, never any problems. 

The good: The previous owner had a very sweet trigger job done to it, breaks very light and is crisp. Has a HiViz fiber sight in red on the front, standard GI rear, I may have a set of white dots for the rear if I can find them. It also has a full length guide rod. Comes with three standard mags, one new power 10rd mag, set of Hogue rubber grips, tow sets of laminated wood grips (light and dark), a pearce rubber grip to fit under the wood grips, a standard springfield case and a custom springfield armory wooden display case. 

The bad: When I traded the gun it was duracoated a few different colors and the plunger tube needed to be restaked. I took it to a shop and had the tube restaked and the gun stripped and duracoated black, there are a few spots under the safety and around plunger that that are starting to chip, it is not too noticeable and functions fine. The safety has a small hangup and is a little rough to engage but again works and functions fine. I have not taken anytime to take apart and clean and refit, which should be all it needs. 

Overall is a very good gun, both looking and functioning, and comes with some nice accessories. $550 which is fair, or I am open to any gun related trades so send me some offers, can add cash on top for any nice trades as well.

This is a warning calling out the person who has the ad selling the FNP 45. I typically would never waste my time creating an ad about someone but I just don't want this to happen to anyone else, what happened to me today. I know we have all been roasted on here from someone bailing on a deal or whatever the case may but I feel this has to be put out there as this guy has zero integrity and no respect for what the essence of a business deal is..... We made a deal that was locked in around 11 this morning . I drove about an hour from home specifically for this deal. The guy claimed he could only meet me at 4:30 when he got off work. I was going to Canterbury for the day and specifically waited for 4 hours in the cities until he got done with work. I killed time at the mall of america and then drove all the way to Minneapolis to proceed and wait for this guy in the parking lot..... 430 came along and he said he was still a half hour out..so I continued to wait even longer as he said he was coming. Then around 440 he tells me he got a call from another person who offered him more money so he was going to meet him instead ......... He left.me ha.gong yet again and then stood me up completely ...... Althouggh apparently his other deal fell through he joked around and said if I felt like waiting some more he would go ahead ans sell it to me......Although we already had a deal locked in. So after waiting till a little after five I left as I realized this was a joke ! No integrity or respect. His exact words ........""Money talks and bulkshit walks...the other guy offered.me more so I had tollook into it...."" No you didn't jerk as you had already made a deal with a stand up guy who was waiting for you! So fellas....please proceed with caution if you respond to this ad... 

His name is Alex Riser and his number is 6128759948
So I just don't want this to happen to another stand up guy who really was just trying to make a good deal. I know this happens a lot to good guys and it's unfortunate that you have assholes like this even doing business on here when they have no clue what good business is. May Karma allow this guy to sit on his gun for another several months"

A fantastic looking gun that would benefit from further research. We have not lettered the gun, but the engraving is early Colt style, and certainly Colt quality. At bare minimum, this gun was embellished at the period by a master engraver. Of course if the gun were to come back as having any of this work done by Colt, it's value will be substantial. The gun features full scroll coverage engraving, with approx. 80% of a period re-nickel finish. The cylinder, hammer, backstrap, triggerguard, trigger, ejector housing, and screws retain approx. 80% period Gold finish, with minor flaking due to age. Interestingly, the triggerguard and backstrap serial numbers do not match the frame, however they are relatively close in numbers and the work was all done at the same time. Again, a factory letter may help explain things. The grips look to be rare Mommoth Ivory, as opposed to African Elephant Ivory. They have much more of a marbled grain, and exhibit a deep, mellow patina. They are smooth with no chips or cracks. They fit the gun ok along the triggerguard and butt, but are a little low along the backstrap. Clear markings throughout, including the correct two-line barrel address and patent dates. The ""41 COLT"" marking on the barrel however is very faint. The action works very well and is strong. The bore has fair rifling, with notable blackpowder frosting, especially toward the breech. Overall this is a perfect representation of a classic, highly embellished Peacemaker, and further research may yield some very interesting and valuable information. FFL or C&R required.

From the manufacturer:
TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. NEW to this lineup is our new SIG551-A1, chambered for the widely used 5.56 x 45mm NATO caliber using Swiss Polymer magazines. The SIG551-A1 features a distinctive swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features six-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:7”. The SIG551-A1 measures 36.1” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 5.56 x 45mm NATO, the SIG551-A1 sets a new standard for dependable operation and function."

This one is simply perfect, the gentleman I bought this from recognized right away what he had and put it away stating he was the original owner and it was unfired. In looking it over I tend to agree with this assessment, no detractions can be found. What makes this example unique is the simple fact it is roll marked as a ‘Mustang’. The barrels are different lengths so there is simply no way someone switched the slides and called it as such. I also possess a Colt Factory archive letter for this one as well. This gun also comes complete with the Factory correct box as well as all paperwork, ships insured. You can look a lifetime and never find another, here is your chance.

At 15 Million Volts the VTS-880 mini stun gun really pack a punch! Just test firing this unit into the air is often enough to stop an attacker. As the bright electric current pulsates between the test prongs and creates an intimidating electric sound, an attacker with any sense at all will be stopped in his tracks. If the sight and the sound doesn't  stop him, a jolt from this stun gun most certainly will bring an attacker down in just 2 seconds! When an attacker is touched by the stun gun it will disrupt the message the brain sends to the voluntary muscles. Simply touching an attacker will deliver a high voltage shock causing loss of balance and muscle control, confusion, and disoriantation bringing him to his knees and making him incapable of further aggresive activity. Full recovery takes about five to ten minutes and there is no permanent harm.

The scope does come with additional BDC turrets for Lake city M118LR for 16 and 20 inch barrels, Hornady 75, and Green tip, still included new in bag.

The scope was part of a trade. The previous owner purchased it new, tested it on his AR, and then it ended up in the safe. 
It is in like new condition.
New versions of this scope seem to retail north of $2500"
