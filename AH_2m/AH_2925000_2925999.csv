If you have one of these that you would be willing to part with, please contact me and let's negotiate. I have several firearms that would be available for trade or I can pay cash. Your call!"

Make: Heckler & Koch
Model: Mark 23
Location: Mokena
Price: $1900 (Will Ship on buyers dime)

Other: Got this Mk23 a few weeks back...  I have wanted one of these for years and I just do not have a use for it.  Its literally the only pistol in the world that would survive a trip hell and back.  The pistol comes as it did from HK... Its gorgeous (and BIG just a bit smaller than a DE).  There are a few small scratches on the pistol but, nothing that is a big deal.  Looks like 95% or better.

It comes with the very rare camo carry case from HK. 

More detail from HK: The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns ‚Äî yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP

Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile

For those looking to pack some real punch in a revolver configuration, the Raging Bull is a potent package offering impressive firepower with the mighty 454 Casull cartridge. With hotter loads exiting the muzzle at nearly 2000 fps with around 2000 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle, the .454 Casull is an impressive cartridge. This is a VERY POTENT handgun!
 To give you a comparison of how powerful it really is, the venerable .357 Magnum has around 500 ft*lbs of energy at the muzzle. The Taurus Raging Bull 454 really is like holding the power of a raging bull in your hands! Capable of releasing 5 of these powerful rounds in a matter of seconds makes the Raging Bull a formidable weapon. To help keep all this firepower under control, the Taurus Raging Bull comes with rubber cushioned grips, a heavy frame, and porting at the top of the barrel to help minimize recoil. Eight ports (four on each side of the front sight) vent gas upwards to help minimize the kick up of the Raging Bull. The rust resistant stainless steel matte finish helps ensure good looks for the life of this revolver."

 Technically; about 100 of these were produced by Remington Arms between 1919-21, but 1922 was the Remy Model 24's big debut. This is basically the same gun as the Browning SA-22 that was made in Belgium by Fabrique Nationale (FN) until the 1970's & is still produced in Japan for Browning today, (Note: Late models may be slightly radioactive)- & parts (for the 'most part') interchange.
  These little take-down, take anywhere guns were designed by the Master himself- John Moses Browning. As we all know; JMB  held patent to most of Winchesters best lever guns, & pistols from the ubiquitous Model 1911 to tiny pocket pistols, plus plenty of fire belching machine guns to boot. To this day; It's still considered impolite to hold even a small battle without at least few Browning patents being involved.
  This was one of the most elegant, graceful, & handiest long guns ever created, (they really don't seem 'long' at all). Most Model 24s were chambered in .22 long rifle, but a few were made in .22 short, for the recoil & noise sensitive. 
 Actually; the .22 short versions were known as 'Gallery Guns'- & many were employed at shooting galleries from seaside attractions like Atlantic City, to traveling carnivals, & county fairs across America. For many decades, (back in pre-liberal times when kids actually learned to shoot in the school gym)- before chewed up Pop-Tarts & pointed fingers became 'dangerous weapons', & 'zero tolerance' reigned supreme- the Model 24 was 'Queen of the Midway'.
 Most of these little gal's were rode hard & put away damp. This one is no exception, but at 92 years of age she's earned her 'patina' by golly! If this gun could only talk, it might groan a little, but I bet it has some amazing tales to tell. Like how she lost a piece of her Schnabel forearm and had to have another piece of walnut grafted in from a kindly donor Remington, or how every time she was dragged to another engagement miles away, a little more of her factory bluing stayed behind, until finally she just decided to 'go with it' and became proud of her road-weary looks, dammit!
Like Keith Richards' Telecaster...(or old Kieth Himself, for that matter).
 This little gun still loves to go out plinking & have fun, but reserves the right to be slightly cantankerous at times. I did run some 'high velocity' (yeah, right) .22 short thru her & she ran flawlessly...so maybe she's just a tad 'ammo sensitive' like most .22 autos.
It would also look great hanging on the wall & will give your lair an aura of mystery & danger- particularly if you tell all yer friends that ,""Yup- this here was John Dillinger's favorite squirrel rifle"". It really does have a lot of History behind it, especially for a 'Civilian' gun.
 I picked it up in the Wild West- and it looked right at home there too. In fact; it very well  may have just been there all along....but that's another story. 
Don't let my humble description scare you away, it's still a very solid (& elegant!) little rifle, and as early a Model 24 as you are likely to find. I'm asking $250 in increasingly worthless Fed Notes or might just trade for a High Standard Sentinel .22 revolver....unless you have a better idea..... Silver?"

It comes with a Leupold VX-III 2.5-8x32mm Handgun Scope, rings and mount. I bought the revolver brand new last fall and I bought the scope, rings and mount used a few months ago.

I am only selling this to raise money for a project, so the price is FIRM.

Two each (6 inch and 10 inch) in each designated Caliber with an additional 10 inch 50AE barrel. (Total of 3 barrels in 50AE). Originally included two 440 Barrels (pictured) which have been sold separately. These barrels are preferable to the new DE ""picatinny"" railed barrels for the experienced operator and DE collector.

Please notice the custom fitted MP5 TYPE Forearm which fits all the long barrels, including the DE laser when the laser is mounted with the long barrels. The MP5 fore-grip is ""quick"" off and on as needed. The strong RED laser is extremely rare, brand new in the box, fits the pistol frame with any mounted barrel, and was custom made for the Desert Eagle as shown.

The package includes Ammo> 50AE (20x6 Boxes Hornady XMP and 80 rounds FMJ, 200 total rounds in 50AE), and several boxes high quality ""Silver Tipped"" FMJ 44 Magnum Ammo. Custom $250 ""Cross Shoulder"" or ""over the Shoulder"" Black Leather Quick Draw Holster (you can aim and shoot the DE from the holster without having to draw the weapon!) with a separate custom made tactical DE leg holster.

A heavy duty two layer dual key lockable aluminum ""strong box"" holds barrels and accessories. High end BOYT Black Waterproof Case with sheepskin lining (as shown) customized for the DE Pistol and Mags. Six Magazines, two in each caliber are included with the package.

This is the Ultimate DE Collection that took over 5 years to build and complete and is EXTREMELY RARE and one of a kind. The individual items, along with the design and fabrication of the MP5 fore-grip, add up to considerably more than my price.

This Package will be transferred through my Colorado FFL and is not intended as, advertised as, or should be interpreted as a ""Private Sale Offering"" in Colorado

This investment grade package is meant for someone who can really appreciate it ... and what it took to make it happen. Not really meant for the bargain shopper looking for a desperate seller (although I have reduced the price), this collection is indeed just what it is, and the only complete one like it that I have ever seen in over 25 years as a DE collector"

A single action sear and hammer have been added in order to obtain traditional DA/SA functionality. This modification allows this originally DAO model to function similarly to a 96F DA/SA gun, minus the safety decocker (the original bobbed DAO hammer is included in this package.) 

Mechanically the function is flawless. Since I have owned it I have shot no less than 500 rounds through it without a single malfunction. No visible cracks can be found on the slide or locking block. Being that this was originally a DAO gun, the trigger pull is much more pleasant in double action than on a 96F or 92FS. This package also includes a 9MM conversion barrel which has been used on a couple of occasions also without malfunction. 

Cosmetically the gun is in decent condition. It was a duty gun before I bought it and had a lot of holster wear, scratches and dings. It has since been refinished with a very durable epoxy based paint, but there are some visible dings and scratches in the metal beneath the new finish. It was originally equipped with Trijicon night sights, but they went too dim to use, so I had the lamps removed from the sights in preparation to have fresh ones installed. I never got around to it, so the sights simply have three holes drilled through them waiting to receive either some new tritium lamps or some fiber-optic dots. 

Included in the package are as follows.


The original DAO hammer.
The original pair of rubber grips.
A 9mm conversion Barrel.
One .40S&W 11 round factory magazine.
Two CheckMate M9 9MM 15 round GI magazines.
One Remora IWB holster with high sweat shield.
One Safariland ALS OWB Level II retention holster (The best holster I've ever used) w/ paddle and belt loop mounting hardware.
One Blackhawk CQC non retention OWB holster w/ paddle and belt loop mounting hardware.


For this complete Beretta package, equipped with everything you need to start shooting and carrying either .40S&W or 9mm, I am asking $425. 

I am willing to hear offers, but I feel as though this package is offering a whole lot of value at that price for a really fine shooter. Thanks for looking!"

Gun is 5.56 Nato or .223. This thing is awesome. I have kids and bills to pay and wish I could keep it. This gun is a piston driven, and is the preferred set up of the special operations guys (same system used to eliminate Bin Laden). You get Sig sturdiness and boring reliability, and while this thing will eat anything, it has only been fed 500 rounds of high quality Federal brand ammo, no steel cased russian ammo here! Not a single failure to anything, fail to fire, load, eject, nothing. Pull the trigger and it goes boom. There literally isn't even a scratch on this gun, despite it being almost a year old now.


I'll tell you why I bought this gun, just go to youtube and watch this video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFZ3yUMH5IA

It is the Sig516 torture test. Basically they drag it through mud snow ice sand and water and it fires every time. Mine has been equally reliable even though I treat it like one of my children.

Here is what I have, I will sell the lot, or you can pick and choose, and I will sell everything else on the side. 

Rifle -$1300 (MSRP is $1650) if you buy it, I will include the Sig Sauer hard case, 6 30 round Pmags (4 black and 2 FDE), 6 Ranger plates and dust covers (these are for attaching the mags to a MOLLE system), and the two black Magpul rail covers. On the gun now is the Magpul STR stock in Flat Dark Earth (FDE). If you wanted a black stock, grip, and rail covers, I would do that at no extra cost but the stock would be Moe rather than STR. The rifle does include Magpul ASAP sling mount, and rail sling mount. I installed them but haven't ever used them or owned a sling.

Eotech -$300 You can buy this new for $425 or with my rifle for $300. It's a good deal. It is less than 3 months old and used twice. Mint condition, comes with hard case.

Sig Sauer tac bag - $85 if you buy the rifle. You can get it new from Sig for 135 or new from Boise Gun co for 115. It is sweet, and practically brand new.

Ammo 1300 rounds - $500 if you buy my rifle. That would make this 10 plus cents per round less than you can get it online, and 15 cents a round less than walmart's best deal on the same Federal brand ammo. The PMC cannot be bought but look around, it's a sweet price. 

Or, the package deal: I am fond the of the bag, and plan to get another AR in a few years when I can afford it. I would sell the Rifle, EoTech, and Ammo for $2000. Or $2050.00 with the bag.

How this would work. I would prefer to deal in person, but I may be willing to ship depending on the circumstances. It is up to you to know your local gun laws and how they apply to you. You will be required to sign a bill of sale that you will get a copy of. Cash only. I can get more pictures if you are serious. If you pay for your own ammo I would be willing to meet you at the range in Nampa to give it test drive after a $200 non-refundable deposit. Gun runs flawlessly. I just cleaned it, and it is ready to go. It probably didn't need to be clean but I am kind of picky like that. Please let me know if there are any questions.

 	Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

I got this in a trade so the round count is unknown. The rifling is very sharp I don't think it's been shot much at all. It did not need a new spring set, I just did it to freshen it up. It is a highly sought after series 70 with out the firing pin safty.

I built this intending my Uncle would buy it from me. He burst a disk in his back, so he can no longer afford it (said my aunt, lol)

852,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2925852,For Sale:  Original Marlin Model 1895 .45-70 NOT A REMINGTON,"Santa Fe, Nm, New Mexico, United States",$ 525,"Listed On: Thursday, April 10, 2014",Rifles,Marlin                                                                                ,45-70 Government                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I bought this rifle a couple of months ago from a local ATF agent (a very good guy actually) based in Albuquerque. He had picked it up because his nephew had drawn for a buffalo ""hunt""  here. He sighted the rifle in, and his nephew shot the buffalo. Then he put the rifle in his safe, and there it sat until I got it from him.

 When I got it, I zeroed it with the factory sights, and some regular 400 grain factory Remington ammo. Then installed the Williams peep sight, and did the same thing. Then I also put it in my safe. Total rounds fired were 20, and in the foreseeable future that is about it as well. So I see no need to keep it when someone else might enjoy it more.

 Now to the rifle itself. This appears to be an early 1990s Model 1895. It is still a Marlin with a nice walnut stock and finish, not one of the half-finished fencepost died-hardwood stocks that Remington is putting on them nowadays. The action is smooth as silk and there is no rust, pitting, etc. The rifle was very accurate when sighted in, and I shot cloverleaf groups with it at 100 yards with the peep sight installed. It looks almost new. There are a couple of very, very, VERY light handling marks on it. The Williams sight is on it and works great, but you can take it off if you don't want to use it. I will include the original filler screws of course. If you want, The screw-in fine sight aperture is also included, but I used it as a ghost ring so it isn't in the picture. The front sight hood is also included. I took it off when I installed the Williams.

Another 'extra"" is also on it. You may notice that the silly crossbolt safety isn't on this rifle. That is because it has had the conversion done by a local custom gunsmith who used to make these kits. The bluing on it is perfectly matched, and it just looks like an action screw right now. This is completely reversible, and I will include the original safety as well. Just unscrew the filler, pull it out, and then reinstall the safety as normal. Marlin and Winchester made lever actions for a hundred years without them, so I still don't quite understand why they had to change, except for fear of lawyers. This type of conversion is unobtrusive, and frankly I had to look twice even after the seller showed me to notice it was not original to the rifle. It's one of my favorite features on it. And again, it is reversible in about 30 seconds with a flat screwdriver.

The trigger and action are extremely smooth, and it feeds perfectly. There are NO issues wth this rifle that need to be explained away. it is made the way they used to be made, and not the cheap way they do now. the .45-70 in normal factory loads is very mild, but still with great killing power. this one killed a buffalo after all. but the recoil on it is much less than a .30-30. if you want, the action on the 1895 is strong enough to take some very heavy loads indeed, and that is why they are so popular in Alaska for bears. 

I have had no problem buying ammo for it, and places like Sportsmans Warehouse and Ron Petersons have it in stock.

Contact me through Armslist with your phone number and I'll give you a call to set up a time to see it. You will not be disappointed.. This rifle can be shipped within this state to New Mexico residents  without using an FFL. If you are too far away  to drive up and see it. shipping would be $25 if you choose that option."

Rifle is in excellent condition and functions without problem. Accuracy is good with any mil surp but really shines with match grade ammunition in 168.

This loaded model has a great 2 stage trigger for precision with a national match barrel. Bolt is the desirable USGI TRW. Also added to the weapon is the difficult to acquire Advanced Armament Blackout suppressor mount. I believe I have 6 or 7 usgi m14 magazines and a five and ten rounder should you wish to hunt in places that have capacity restrictions.

The Troy chassis is a great addition to the m14 platform. It provides an excellent solution to mounting optics and other accessories, as well as giving the shooter an adjustable stock for length of pull and cheek rest height.
