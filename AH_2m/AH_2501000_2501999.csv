If this gun could talk there’s no telling what it would say! Underwood M1 Carbine made between July 1943 and March 1944.   It comes with a 15 and a 30 round magazines, a reproduction bayonet with sheath and 150 rounds (2 boxes of 50 and 50 loose rounds) of .30 Carbine ammo. It has a Saginaw recoil plate on it.  There are NO import marks on it.  This rifle has been a safe queen too long and I need to sell it to someone that will appreciate it and use it, (and maybe to finance another gun) :-D.   This rifle is in outstanding shape.

   You can go to the web site below (copy and paste) for the background and history of the M1 Carbine.   This rifle had inspection and rebuild at the Red River  Arsenal (not to be confused with  Rock River Arms  ) as per the RRA stamp on the (Winchester) stock.

  http://www.bavarianm1carbines.com/manufacturers.ht ml

The U.S. M1 Carbine's history is like no other rifle in the history of the United States. From June 1942 through August 1945 ten primary contractors and dozens of subcontractors, established manufacturing facilities, tooled up, and produced over six million M1 carbines. Eight of these ten had no gun manufacturing experience.

 $800 and is pretty firm as these are becoming harder and harder to find and this is an outstanding example of the WWII/Korean War M1 Carbine and I don’t need to sell it. Call REDACTED (no text please) or reply to this post  Sorry, not interested in trades."

The stock is length-adjustable and folds to the right, most unusual is its two-position comb; a rarity on a rifle of any type!  The build is ‘TactiCOOL’ to say the least with a 15” Picatinny rail on top with three more on the forend at 3, 6 and 9 o’clock. So lights, lasers and handles are not a problem. There is a shorter section under the barrel too. The safety and mag release button are both ambidextrous and located above the pistol grip and in front of the trigger guard accordingly. Likewise the cocking handle offers three positions and can be located left or right to suit, which is a most practical feature.
 Removable iron sights are included and clamp to the top rail. Different is the fact they flip up to deploy yet when folded down there’s a more basic pistol-type blade and U-notch included. The rear is windage-adjustable and the front post can be corrected for elevation by screwing up/down; as the M16. The apparently medium-weight barrel is 16” long .

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

This rifle is chambered in 7.62x39.  Rifle is basically new with only 60 rounds through the barrel. This is an excellent and reliable shooter built on the sturdiest receiver of any AK I've shot.  Fit and finish on this OPAP is excellent and blows my previously owned WASR and SAR1 out of the water.  The sights are perfect on this rifle and the receiver hardly has a scratch on it.

I am selling this due to an upcoming PCS and I need to lighten my load.  This rifle will be on sale for only 1 week and then it comes with me.

My price is firm as everywhere I've looked the Yugo OPAPs are sold out currently.  I am not looking to profit off of this rifle, just break even for what I paid.

Rifle comes with 1 steel magazine, original owners manual, and original certificate from the zastava factory in serbia.

Buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale and show valid TN drivers license or mil orders bringing you here.  We'll meet in a public place that we both agree on.

There is a good review of OPAPs on youtube that explains this rifle in detail.  Bottom line is if you dont have a SHTF rifle then this will check that block.

Turns out the wife did not like the his and her shotguns I got us for Christmas.  Apparently if you are 5'3"" and 110 lbs, shooting slugs is not pleasant.  Although, she did not mind shooting the bird shot.   I bought the guns brand new at a gun store two weeks ago.  The gun comes with the stock sling and original box.  The forward grip and red dot are NOT included.  I shot 15 rounds through the black KSG and the green is still unfired.
The price is $1200 or trade for equal or greater value rare weapons.  I do not want standard Glocks, Springfields, Rugers, etc.  I am open to AR-10s, lever action .308, or very high quality hunting rifle.  I am only selling because the wife is not happy.  I am happy to keep both so please do not waste my time with low ball offers or ridiculous trades.  Anyone who knows the KSG, knows they do not pop up every day and sell for much more in guns stores.

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

KEY FEATURES:

Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably
Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels
28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes
Sling swivel studs built-in

Has Weaver 1 piece base, redfield 2 piece bases, see through rings/bases, and hammer spur that will come with the rifle. There was one spot of poor bluing on the barrel that I covered with oxpho blu to protect it. Gun has no rust and a pristine bore. 

The Weaver v3 is an option that will cost you. Honestly, I really like the v3 and would just assume keep it ,but money talks. 



I have 170 rounds of .30-30 that I will include. Most of it is 170 grain Federal. There are 58 rounds of Pri Partizan 170 grain. You will also get all 60 odd rounds of brass if so desired. All ammo is factory new. No reloads. .30-30 is pretty rare these days so I feel my asking price is reasonable. 


Price: I figure Rifle ($350) +all parts and rings($ 25) + and ammo( $160)= $535. If you want the v3 we can talk. 

Rifle MUST go through a local 01 FFL as per NYS law. I prefer KJS in Bainbridge. I would also be willing to do Losies in Oneonta or a reputable dealer in the Binghamton area. That's my range. I will not drive farther than Oneonta or Binghamton to meet you. 

I have only fired 60 rounds or less through it. I assume no responsibility if the rifle doesn't function perfectly. As far as I know it should be ok. Selling as is.

The radical SpeedBead System handles many of the factors that make wingshooters miss, and turns poor shooters into good shooters and good shooters into great ones. With the SpeedBead System, both the target and the red dot remain in focus. The optics and their position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right, up/down head position for an accurate shot. The innovative mount puts the center of the optic directly in line with the ventilated rib, so altering your shooting style is not necessary. And with 3-1/2 inches to 4-1/2 inches of eye relief, there is absolutely no worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your hand gripping the shotgun. Should the common CR-2032 five year battery ever fail, you can revert to your front bead without visual obstruction. For a better view on rising targets, there are 1/8 and 1/4 risers available. Windage tool included."

Using artificial environment and wipe technology along with a proprietary mono-baffle stack, the Poseidon features a unique design that helps to seal in the end-user’s ablative medium of choice until the suppressor is used; thus eliminating a major downside of wet suppressors. In other words, your ablative medium won’t run out in your pocket! As an added selling point, the Thompson Machine Poseidon is also a true multi-caliber suppressor, and is very quiet on .22lr, .25acp, .32acp, 9×18mm, and .380acp host weapons. The Poseidon easily and fully disassembles for cleaning, and includes the necessary take-down tools at no extra charge. The Poseidon 45ACP has  a .578x28 thread pattern insert. We can only transfer directly to MO residents. Out of state purchasers must have an SOT dealer in their state take delivery from us so that the can then transfer directly to you. We are a Thompson Machine stocking dealer in Eastern MO, just south of St Louis. We also have Zephyr L, WASP, QMF-2 [45ACP], and ISIS 22 units in stock for immediate transfer. The Poseidon .45 ia a special purpose suppressors. It is designed to be hearing-safe when wet and wiped in the smallest package possible. They will cycle on most hosts, but, depending on ammo, how broken in the gun is, etc, the end user may have to use a reduced weight recoil spring. We almost always have a stocking order pending so if you want one that we don't have right now, there is a good chance it is coming. Let us know, we will check for you. ***Suppressor only.

This is a Sig Sauer 1911, .22 caliber pistol. It is an extremely fun gun to shoot and is incredibly accurate. I am the original owner of this firearm and have fired less than 300 rounds through it. The pistol is a great target gun that can drill in a tight groups for those who are experienced shooters or it can make a great training firearm for those who are new to the sport. It has very light recoil, which is great for new shooters. Also, the firearm has many interchangeable parts with the regular .45 1911 making it an ideal choice for someone who wishes to train shooting the 1911 platform without spending the cost of the more expensive .45 rounds. The firearm is in “like new” condition as I am the original owner and have not fired many rounds through it. Honestly, I really do not want to sell this pistol but sadly I recently got let go from my employment and need some cash to get by. Let my lose be your gain. Lastly, before I forget, I have also polished the barrel and rails of this firearm (as I do with all my pistols) that has given it a great luxurious look as well as improved the functionality of the pistol by making the slide smoother to the frame and have removed the magazine disconnect feature on this firearm (can put it back in if you like) as I do not like them. The firearm will come with everything that came with it from the factory; case, lock, magazine, ect. It really is a fantastic firearm that is great fun to train with or target shoot with. I am asking $400 for the whole package and will even throw in some free .22 ammo with the purchase as long as you don’t haggle me :). Again thank you for looking at this firearm. You can reach me either through my e-mail associated through this listing or by calling (nine five one) 310- zero two zero four. Need to go through an FFL dealer to purchase. I hope to hear from you soon.
