However current examples on the market have little to no accuracy and limited frangibility. DRT is the first company to figure out how to stabilize the bullet in flight to achieve high accuracy and full dispersion of the powdered core in the wound cavity creating extensive Terminal Ballistics. DRT lead-free projectile is a revolutionary round. The bullet breaks apart on contact with a solid surface. The handgun ammunition is made to be an all-purpose round, disintegrating into a cloud of dust on steel but yet is effective on an organic target. It is a target and a carry round. Our round can be fired by law enforcement officers without any fear of ricochet or pass through, or fear of injury or death to innocent bystanders from ricochet or pass through.

I believe it has the same measurements as the RC (Regular Carbine) 20 inch barrel and I believe 38 inches overall length. It holds 6 rounds plus one in the chamber. The bluing is in pretty good shape no deep scratches or gouges. The wood has no deep scratches or cracks and is in ok shape as well. It comes with 3/4 of a box of rounds and also comes with original mount for a scope  and brand new Butler Creek Sling. All in all a lot of gun for the money!

Since I bought it in 2012, I have shot approximately 125 rounds (probably less than 30 of them were actually .375 magnum and the rest were .38 special) through the pistol. This handgun is regarded as one of the best made revolvers and has been featured in the AMC show The Walking Dead. It is the blued edition and features the 6"" barrel and has an adjustable rear sight aperture. I have shot a number of revolvers and I am a firm believer in that this is by far the best revolver I have ever shot. I have been able to accurately shoot one inch targets from up to 25 yards away with ease and the action is absolutely excellent. I am selling this pistol because I recently moved to Chicago and I no longer have a need for it. Unfortunately the gun laws in Illinois are much more strict than Indiana and I don't really have the use to hold on to it anymore. Aesthetically the pistol is in excellent condition with a few scratches near the front of the barrel (probably from a holster from a previous owner). I come from a military background and I have taken care of this weapon with the same standards as a military issue pistol or rifle. Mechanically the pistol functions absolutely perfect and the accuracy, as previously stated, is amazing. 
The handgun is currently located at my parents' house in northwest Indiana and I am open to meeting anywhere within the area. I would prefer cash for payment and I am asking $1300 OBO.

The goal was to design a twenty-caliber cartridge with super long-range performance, but on a modest case design to minimize recoil and noise. Todd also selected the time proven and readily available top quality 223 case to base his Tactical 20 on (most shooters call it the 20 TAC today). Todd designed the 20 TAC with the accuracy proven 30-degree shoulder and the proper neck length to accommodate a wide range of bullets that he knew would be available down the road. The 20 TAC is one of the early twenty caliber cartridges that Todd has designed and it soon “blew the 20 caliber door wide open”! With 30 to 40 grain bullets, it is one of the most accurate and efficient 20 calibers available today. With the high B.C. 40 grain bullets, it has less bullet drop and wind drift than the 220 Swift! And does it with less than 25 grains of powder compared to the 220 Swift using 39 grains of powder!  I have some ammo and I have the die and bullets for reloaders."

As you can see from the pics it has an aftermarket stock, which is solid and feels well built. The stock looks new and has a great, pebbled texture. It also has a milled dust cover-mounted scope base (see pics). The factory sights are usable since the base has a see-through design. The bayonet lug is still there. It comes with a 30-round mag (pictured) and the factory 10-round box which can be re installed easily if desired.

The gun is clean and has been oiled regularly. I don't have any ammo or other parts besides what you see in the pictures. Please email with any reasonable offers. I'll remove the ad as soon as it's sold, so if you see it, it's available.

I want to sell or trade it for pretty much anything gun related.

It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. MSRP OVER $500.

I offer a service which allows you to capture a snapshot of your inventory for record keeping purposes.   The information gathered on your collection can range from a single line record to multiple lines of detailed information of each firearm or accessory.   An example might be: Make, model, finish, serial number, caliber, purchase price, value price, custom work completed, etc.   

I take a photo of each firearm, compile a line item document, and produce you a record of all inventory in the form of a hard copy file, or can create a CD/DVD of your inventory.   

NOTE: I AM NOT affiliated with ANY agency, government organization, or force.  The data gathered for your collection will NOT be retained in any way, shape, or form.  

I have created several portfolios for many people as security against fire, flood, theft, or Trust allocations.   Generally, it's much easier to capture a snapshot of your investment and place a copy in your safe or safety deposit box than it is to buy a safe for every lot of investment.  

Precious metals, jewelry, automobiles, heirlooms, collectables can all be added to your record.   Depending on the portfolio request, I can provide the service and creation of document for a flat fee of $45.00

I travel to you, or meet in your specified location.

This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

If he has all my personal details he can just watch my house, call to check if I am home and rob me of my guns and valuables if he knows I am not there. All this while I am waiting for his check to arrive in the mail. Or maybe some other scam.

This is a wonder to shoot. The gun is in great shape other than minimal wear mark from being shot. The gun has has about 200 rounds down the pipe, cleaned, and put into the safe. The Elite ll comes with two ten round magazines with rubber bumpers allowing them to drop free safely onto concrete. I will also include a leather OWB slide holster. The only thing missing is the orignal box. I recently moved to new house and cannot find it. New boxes can be had from Beretta for about 15$. 

These are no longer manufactured and are very hard to come by. They have sold for as much as 1550.00 on gunbroker. This option replaced the Elite I option in 2001 and includes the same features as the original Elite plus removable Novak type sights, extended magazine release catch, checkered front/rear grip strap, thicker (than Elite I) skeletonized hammer, and lighter D-spring. This option is available only with the stainless G-Model slide, also with front serrations. The stainless barrel for the Elite II has a target crown. The elite ll has hogue wrap-around grips installed.

The thicker slide makes shooting the .40 S&W much lighter and allows for faster follow up shots. All factory accesories for the Beretta 96 will work if anything needs replaced in the future. The gun is sale as well as trade. Trying to see what is out there these days. I am interested in lots of things EXCEPT, single- action revolvers, bows, and electronics. I prefer Sigs, 1911's, H&K, and have always had my eye on a KelTec KSG. I will consider just about anything, but don't offer me an LCP and ask for a straight trade. If you have any questions feel free to ask. I answer email immediately, or can be reached by text. Please no calls.

It is the compact model. It is an all steel Browning pistol design very much like the 1911A1 Colt we all love. The weight reduces felt recoil and adds to durability. Feel is very similar to a 1911. Among the differences, it lacks the grip safety and removeable backstrap. It breaks down for cleaning like a Colt. It comes in the original box with manual, paperwork and four magazines (not clips). I read on a Star sight that the Colt 3 1/2"" holster is a good fit. I would call it Very Good to Excellent with very good real bluing and the occasional minor scratch. There is also a small bare spot as pictured near the right muzzle (cold blue?). It is an excellent pistol I've had for years. Google it for info. I'm trying to standardize by guns to mostly S&W and would trade for compact 1911, Shield 9mm, LC9, or 300 Blk upper (not necessarily S&W) with cash or ammo if needed. I don't need to sell or trade, however, and know it will only gain in value in my safe so avoid silly offers."

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun.

The only reason I'm selling it is because my agency recently changed the rules on back up guns, stating that they now have to be the same calibre as our duty ammo, so I'm going to have to buy one in .40. 

This is the first sub-compact that I've been able to shoot as well as my duty pistol.  It's as accurate as my duty gun too.  

-Still ranks among the smallest 9mm sub-compacts available.
-Only 300 rounds fired through it.
-Comes with Carrying Case, Instruction Manual, 1 magazine, and 2 backstraps.

We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.
