***This rifle has NEVER been fired and should be broken in as recommended by Weatherby.

*TWO BOX BARREL BREAK-IN
This barrel break-in procedure requires two boxes of ammunition to complete. Start out by shooting one round at a time, cleaning the barrel thoroughly after each round and allowing it to cool. This process should be followed for a total of ten rounds.

Then take the remaining thirty rounds and shoot ten three shot groups, cleaning the barrel thoroughly after each group and allowing it to cool completely before firing the next group. Once ten, three shot groups have been fired the barrel is adequately broken in. At this point the rifle can be sighted in and used.

Factory New - Generation 2 Model

Right Hand Stock

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide the ability to Slide Fire safely, offering a new element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! 

The SSAR-15 is designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. There are no permanent modifications necessary to install the SSAR-15.

Simply remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided interface block. The SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by simply sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install the SSAR-15 are provided. 

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to bump fire, the SSAR-15's radical design enables the shooter to fire and AR-15 as quickly as desired without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike traditional bump firing. The SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly hold their firearm and maintain complete control at all times. In addition, as a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round, the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction.

In principal the SSAR-15 functions similar to the Gatlin system. When operating a Gatlin system the shooter operates a crank in a circular motion to activate the firing mechanism. Every 1/5 rotation of the crank will discharge a round. The shooter will then continue forward another 1/5 of a rotation to fire the next round, and so on. With the SSAR-15 the shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward to discharge a round. To discharge the next round the operator must again move the upper assembly forward. As with the Gatlin system, an AR-15 equipped with the SSAR-15 will never fire automatically.

MADE IN THE USA

Right Hand Configuration

Constructed of Premium Reinforced High Strength Polymer

Compatible with Mil-Spec and Commercial Buffer Tubes

Winter Trigger Guards and some Sling Plates may not be compatible.

INCLUDES: SSAR-15, Interface Block, Hex Key, Instructions and BATFE Approval Letter."

Raccoon hunting with dogs is one of them. Coon hunting has been a tradition since the beginning, and while not as popular as it once was, is still a major part of many lives.

The Tree Dog Encyclopedia by John Wick which was privately published in 1985 is probably one of the finest books on the subject of tracking and treeing dogs in print. The book starts with an in-depth description of the recognized breeds of dogs used in this sport, i.e. Black and Tan, Bluetick, English, Plott Hound, Red Bone and Treeing Walker. Mixed breeds, or that is breeds that are not officially recognized are also covered in this section of the book.

There are then chapters covering almost all areas of this sport from breeding, training, care, hunting, buying, shipping, bench shows, medical problems, dog dangers, lost dogs, tracking lost dogs, old dogs, housing and general husbandry. The entire work is infused with practical common sense and the knowledge of years of experience from the author's point of view.

Special attention should be paid to the sections of the book dealing with training. The author presents several different techniques, for different dogs and different situations. He gives very sound advice. I personally do not agree with all the methods suggested here, but each has their own way of doing things and I certainly cannot fault the validity of any of the author's statements.

There is also a very good index of terms for those that may not be familiar with the handling of these fine animals. The book is filled with very nice black and white photographs of various breeds of dogs, both hunting and bench. There is also a delightful and helpful chapter on hunting with mules, something that is becoming more and more popular.

This is a very well written book with clear and concise instructions and comments. The reader should be warned though that this is not a book on how to train the family pet. These are working dogs; actually, very expensive working dogs and the training methods and care instructions are designed for such.

Primary Arms MD-06 Micro red dot sight with 1 battery, rubber bikini lens covers, and optional QD riser mount included. This is a quality red dot optic and has never been used or even mounted on anything. It is brand new in the box. Primary Arms sells the exact same one with the QD riser mount in a bundle for $148. Link and specs are listed below. Their red dots have excellent reviews and they are very popular, and well known for good clear glass, holding their zero, and being great quality sights for the price. Check out the reviews for yourself. They are pretty much considered the best bang for your buck when it comes to red dots like these. The riser is a cam-lever style quick detach mount designed to co-witness with standard AR15 back up sights, but this would also work great on an AK, Ruger 10/22, M&P15-22, or anything at all with a standard picatinny rail on it. It is an awesome red dot for the price and with this QD riser will mount easily on any rail and weighs only 4 ounces.

Takes a CR2032 battery which are available cheap and easy to find almost anywhere. It has an On/Off switch and enhanced battery life - it is rated 1000 hours use at medium brightness setting on 1 battery. The first $125 cash gets the package, price is FIRM, and please include a phone number in your reply. ONLY replies that include a phone number to contact you on will be responded to.

    I am an FFL, so valid IL FOID, background check, 24 hour wait for long guns and 72 hour wait for handguns is required.
    Once we settle on the product and price via email, the mandatory wait starts (since we have it on record). 
    After the mandatory waiting period, you can come and fill out the form 4473 and pay for the firearm.
    As long as the background check clears you can take the firearm with you that day.
Shipping:
    I can only ship to your local gun shop/FFL. Lower receivers are $15 pistols are $25 and rifles are $30 to ship.
    You can pay via money order, credit card over the phone, or bank transfer.

We made arrangements to meet the next day at 1030 am. At 9 am I began messaging and calling and got no answer and I was not going to drive 30 minutes to meet someone who was not answering me. So finally about 230 he messages saying he wld come to me to complete the deal and that he was about 25 minutes out. Of course 2 hours later still no show no longer answering my messages or calls or emails. Point of this is be careful if a person says they have certain items and when they show up don't have the items they said they did use cause on or even postpone the deal. This is the third time this has happened to me and trust me I learned and just wanted to pass along my experience.

Long Eye Relief
See your buck, target your buck. It’s easy with Revenge’s generous eye relief and Rapid Target Acquisition eyepiece. No more searching for the visual sweet spot when the shot is on the line.

Illuminator Lens System
Quality lenses can make or break a hunt. Our Illuminator Lens System gives you the clearest image for the cleanest shot. So take a deep breath and squeeze the trigger with complete confidence. If you’re on the mark, get out your knife. Premium lens glass and coatings delivery exceptional light transmission in the low-light, blue wavelengths that dominate at dawn and dusk, when game is most active.

Accu-Trac Adjustments
Precision, stainless steel, 1/4 moa finger-click windage and elevation adjustments let you quickly and easily zero your rifle on the range, and confidently correct for windage or elevation in the field. When combined with Redfield’s exclusive AccuPlex, you can quickly zero and place shots right on the money, even at long range.

100% Waterproof / Fogproof
These scopes are built to take anything Mother Nature can dish out: driving rain, sleet, ice and snow are no match for the rugged, airtight Revenge. Nitrogen processed maintubes stay bone-dry so the elements won’t dampen your hunt.

Impact Tested Reliability
Every scope we design gets put through its paces. Our tests dish it out to make sure every scope is tough as nails, fully waterproof and ready to hunt before they ever get to you.

Accu-Ranger Reticle
As one of the first with bullet drop compensation, Redfield’s original Accu-Ranger pioneered the reticles we take for granted today. The new Accu-Ranger blends precise holdover points hunters need with a bold center that naturally leads the eye for fast shot placement at close quarters. 

The reticle comes with precise aiming points that work with most popular hunting loads. For many standard cartridges simply sight in at 200 yards with the center crosshair, and the remaining hold points are dialed in up to 500 yards. The bottom of the circle intersects the vertical crosshair at the 300-yard aim point, the dot is your hold for 400 yards, and the bottom post provides a 500-yard aiming point. For faster, magnum-caliber rifles shooting light bullets, you can sight in at 300 yards and have hold points for 400, 500, and 600 yards.

Redfield Warranty
We build our Redfield riflescopes, sights, binoculars, spotting scopes and laser rangefinders to do their jobs. Day after day. Season after season. It’s what you expect for your hard earned money. If you ever have an issue, the last thing you need is backpedaling and passing the buck. That’s where our “No Excuses” Warranties come in. If you have a problem with your Redfield product, we will make it right. No Hassle, no excuses. That’s the Redfield way.

The furniture is all original Romanian military, solid front, laminate rear, this is completely un-messed with.

The SAR series was banned from importation in 2003, so they are rare, and hard to find now, further I had a smith re-add the bayonet lug, thread the barrel, and install correct pattern slant break, plunger, and spring, all Romanian military parts were used.

The SAR is unique as being the only correct patterned stamped Receiver AK to feature BOTH Y dimples, which makes it the most correct AK clone on the market, and also makes it ideal as a host for an NFA (full auto) conversion if you have your SOT License.  It also features a factory optics rail.

This is NOT to be confused with the garbage WASR's, this is a completely different model, and unlike the WASR's is actually good.

The Kobra sight also has not been imported in a number of years, and is even harder to find than the rifle, it also is the type which uses common AA batteries.

I have pictures, but I'm having some technical issues so I will have to text them to you if you want to see them.

Note: The manufacturer is Cugir, but that was not in the drop down menu, so I selected the importer instead."

It's very clean & in like new condition. I've not had a single stovepipe or any cycling problems with the action using several different types of ammo. This is the most popular .22 rifle in the world for a reason. It's lightweight, reliable, rugged & fun! It also has more after-market parts & upgrades available than most firearms too. So you can make this rifle as customized as you want for not much $.

Included with the rifle is the following: the original box, gun lock & owners manual; picatinny rail installed on the receiver; three (3) 10 round magazines; one Trimag magazine coupler; 50 rounds of Remington .22LR target ammo; a ProMag tactical barrel band (as well as the original barrel band); a rail mounted swivel sling stud; & I've installed a sling stud in the stock as well.

I prefer a local sale. With the ridiculous SAFE act now in place, a sale will have to go through an FFL holder. I'm happy to meet anywhere in the Buffalo area.

It has never been fired, except from the factory, and I've never even chambered a round in it, only properly lubed it.  It comes with the Glock case, and everything that comes with it from the factory, gun lock, speed loader, two 15 round mags, cleaning rod/brush, factory fired brass, and paperwork.  I am interested in a straight trade for a brand new Glock 23 in ODG or FDE gen 3 or 4, or a brand new Glock 23 gen 4, also interested in a brand new Springfield XD .40 4"" bi tone model, also interested in AR 15s.  If it is a real nice AR 15 I have a two week old Samsung Galaxy S4 Black Mist 16gb on Verizon that is in mint condition with no scratches whatsoever.  Comes with factory box and all accessories, trade value of both Glock and phone would be $1,000.  If interested give me a call or text at REDACTED, can text any time day or night."
