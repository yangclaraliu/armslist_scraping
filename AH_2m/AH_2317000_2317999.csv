The PIT BULL makes you safer in TWO ways:  a bright LED flashlight & 11 million volt stun gun will change the bad guy's mind.  Both functions work off the same pair of switches.  A master switch protects you and your little ones from your new toy.

This unit is very discreet; there is no indication when viewing this flashlight that it is also a powerful stun gun.  The stun gun prongs feature are built in to the rim of the flashlight and are smooth to the touch.  Your attacker will not see it coming.

Seven inch aluminum body, nylon holster with a belt loop included for those wanting to carry it on their belt. It also fits well in a pocket, purse and glove box.  Real estate agents and other professionals love this model; folks that need a bright light and added security.

Each package contains a PIT BULL, an AC charging cord, a nylon carrier, an operational manual, and a lifetime warranty.  This flashlight / stun gun is made of aluminum so it can take abuse, unlike the more common plastic models.  Each PIT BULL I sell has been tested.  

Even if you carry a concealed firearm, you must always have a flashlight for low level light confrontation.  It might as well function two ways to protect.

This gun has been shot very very little in its lifetime, the ejector rod has no bluing worn off and where the hammer strikes the firing pin the bluing is barely worn. You won't find one in nicer mechanical condition unless it's NIB
the 78 Diamondback is an easy 99% and one of the nicest examples I've ever came across. Both were bought by the same gentleman new in 1978. These are two great examples for the serious colt snake guy.

This is one of the sought after HK stamped shotguns and is capable of ""ghost loading"".  The shotgun is in very good condition and runs and shoots perfectly.  This particular shotgun was used briefly by it's previous owner as a 3-Gun Competition gun and has had several professional upgrades including the extended tubye magazine to increase capacity .  This shotgun does have some marring on the barrel and magazine where there was a barrel clamp.  I had intended to put a new one on to hide the marring and so I could add a weapon light but I never got around to it.

This is a great opportunity for anyone who wants to get into 3-Gun Competition and start out with a high end shotgun that's already had performance parts added or for the home owner who wants one of the best shotguns made for home defense which this model also excels at.

I bought it to use as a home defense gun but I've decided I prefer using a handgun so I'm letting this one go which isn't easy.  Despite not having much use for this gun it's awesome to shoot and gets lots of ""ooh's and ahhhh's"" from strangers when it comes out at the range.  These don't come up for sale very often so take advantage of it!  Comes with a stainless Light Modified choke tube, a black Improved Cylinder choke tube and a choke wrench.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Why are HKs more expensive?

1. Most are designed, built and tested to NATO MIL specs (ACC-225), not commercial specs. NATO specs includes tests not conducted by many commercial makers such as drop tests, obstructed bore tests, extreme temps, ice, static sand, OTB, elevated/depressed, etc.

2. All (100%) of HK firearms are test fired and zeroed at the factory. In some companies only a % are tested.

3. HK materials (steel, barrel, etc.) are of the highest quality available and it shows in long-term or worst case scenarios. The superior barrel performance is a good example, though you may never see it in casual use.

4. HK pistols are not assembled by armorers’ students and then sold to customers. Some companies have been known to do so.

5. The average German worker is paid at a far higher rate than the equivalent US worker. Part of the reasons why includes the mandatory training they must receive and tests they must pass before receiving the position. The cost of living in Germany is also higher and HK contributes to a substantial “Pensioner Fund” for its retirees. Many also work at the same company for decades and not uncommon are 40 year employees!) and therefore rise high on the pay scale for their extensive hard-earned skill and experience.

6. HK barrels are made by a cold hammer forged process using a material that is unique to HK guns. Many barrels get special HK-unique steps added such as a tapered, poly, hybrid poly bore profile or induction hardening and all long-gun barrels are straightened. As an example, Stelite liners are not used in HK MG barrels – they are simply not needed and perform as well or better.

7. Compare the polymer molding and machining of say an HK P30 and a SIG P229. It is RARE to see machining marks on an HK.

8. HK rigorously tests their products to destruction in a ""Firing Lab"" manned with very senior test personnel before the design is frozen. This reduces the incidence of post-release issues. HK also takes and test its products at remote environmental test facilities to include desert (Yuma Proving Grounds, Saudi Arabia), arctic (Norway, Alaska), jungle (Brunei, Panama). That costs BIG bucks but pays off in hard core performance.

9. HK guns are imported for the most part (or the parts used to assemble them in NH) are imported. That results in mandatory FET, freight and exchange rate subsidies being added and passed on to the customer. HK as a German gun maker and importer they also have to comply with stringent export controls and that too costs money, which gets passed along in sale prices.

10. The cost of the production tooling (and materials) used by HK to produce, assemble and QA product is high as it includes QA tests and steps not conducted by many other makers. HK cut its teeth as a mass producer and still today builds the production tooling with that in mind – high volumes with a lot of automation. That tooling and gauging costs money as does the high hourly rates of the skilled workers and the additional time required to conduct it.

11. 10-20% of HK’s annual operating budget is spent on its extensive “Technique” departments to include Design, Prototype Fabrication and the Firing Lab. These are the highest paid, most skilled workers at HK and that costs money as well. They are best of breed and always have many more projects up in the air then you might think, or know of (Phased Plasma Rifle in the 80 watt Range).

12. HK places itself purposely in the “higher end” of the market. Like BMW and Mercedes HK knows it rates are higher and always will be compared to say Colt, S&W, Beretta, etc. So they go after superior performance and quality at a higher price point to fewer purchasers versus a cheaper, lower quality product to more buyers.

13. @ 15% of HK annual revenue is reinvested in new products, and infrastructure. While that may not seem like a lot it is and the state of the factory at in Oberndorf shows it. Look at the state of their competitors factories. There are few that compare to HK GmbH in the eyes of those who have been to many others. HK spends the revenue it makes off of both commercial and Government sales on new product so in a way the US commercial buyer who purchases an HK45 pistol helps fund the development of the MG4 LMG or XM25.

14. HK builds much of the weapon parts in house to maintain quality control. While cheaper subs are available one loses some control in doing so. HK’s goal has always been to minimize cost but maintain quality and to do so it keeps many items in house that in many others companies go to the higher bidder (magazines, small piece parts, etc.). HK also has some of the very best MIM and molding capabilities and can thus up the quality of their product by using their own, superior product.

15. Like HK, HK’s subs are of a higher quality for the same reasons and with the same end results. You buy the very best frame mold in Germany, it will cost you but the end product is superior.

16. Interchangeable parts – very few HK parts are not fully interchangeable without hand fitting. Even in a gun like the GMG, there are no parts that require hand fitting. This requires that each and every raw material and finished part, and each tool that fabricates the part, is dimensionally and exactly the same and maintained the same at all time by constant checks by skilled personnel with high dollar measuring devices and gauges. Again something you may never see but it insures when you replace a part it both fits and works w/o modifications.

17. HK has voluntarily developed, tested and included in their product unique features like USP firing mode modularity, MK23 barrel O-rings, special high performance finishes, unique G36/HK416 gas systems, drop-in LEM trigger systems, side-loading 40mm grenade launchers, GMG’s with extruded aluminum receivers and HK211’s with Ti receivers, unique cartridges for things like MP7 and P46, etc. HK also makes over 100 models of HK firearms currently and 1000’s of modular variants for users the world over speaking many languages, which costs money to build, inventory, document and record these countless production variations."

 I am looking for an oldie but goodie from around the mid 70's. When my hubby was a child he was given a Stevens & Fox Savage brand, crack barrel, single shot, youth model, 20 gauge shotgun, by his dad as his first weapon. He loved it very much. When we were newlyweds he lost his job temporarily and had to pawn it. We were never able to get it back. He talks about it to this day and wishes terribly that he never had pawned it. If anyone out there has one for sale or knows where I can get one for a very reasonable price for a Christmas present, please let me know. He would be like that little boy again if he opened up one on Christmas morning.

I have up for trade a Burris XTR 1-4x24 scope. The XTR is a true one power scope, so it can be aimed rapidly with two eyes open, very similar to a red dot sight. It has extremely sturdy construction, and it is built like a tank. This scope shows only very slight rings on the tube (it is probably impossible to see them in the pictures) where it was mounted to a PEPR mount. The glass is very clear and the illumination works great. The scope also includes Butler Creek lens caps. 

Also for trade is the Burris 30 mm PEPR mount that came with the scope. This mount is in excellent condition. The only sign of wear is a nick on one of the Picatinny railed top sections. 

I would like to trade for an ACOG TA11, TA31, or TA33. I would add extra cash to even the deal. I also have a Burris Fastfire III that I might consider trading."

if you have something to trade i will only trade with if you have a valid Florida License and a valid Florida carry permit. no criminals or retards. ask yourself if you are retarded before responding to me or going out of your house that day. you can save lives. the boxes that hold the rounds are called magazines, not clips. if i get another person asking how many clips anything comes with i think you should jump off a bridge. 

for those of you who arent aware, glock is not an american gun. it is probably the one most seen in america because WE ARE GUN CRAZY. gotta get my guns. hate to say it but god made it that way with the austrians. it is an astrian gun. forged and built under the biggest balled auistrian in existence, other than Arnold Swartzee, by a tool and knife maker. 

now, this glock 17 fires the lightening fast round known to the dinosaurs as extinction but to us humans the 9mm. thank you to the germnas! for not only WWI, WWII but the 9mm round. the least they could do was give us that. making that projectile fire faster than a guy breaking into your home and shitting his pants once you pull out this puppy for protection is the freaking striker fire system. NO HAMMERS! sorry carpenters keep looking. The only safety this weapon uses to master is the one youll use on your girls clit stick. thats right a trigger safety! may be the scariest shit know to man or the smartest thing ever created to make life that much easier. more time to do man shit.

BUT WAIT THERES MORE! this mind blowing piece of engineering is made of the smelted down plastic from the toys  no one buys from the dying kids in sweatshops that no ones knows about. and.... STEEL. but somehow.... this combination is fucking indestructible. im still baffled to this day. now. what can possibly get even more crazy than what youve already read? comes with a sun burning tac light on it. thats right all you sleepless zombies. all the stupid shit you do with guns during the day, even better, now you can do them at night! but this is no ordinary light ohhhhhh nooooooo. if you arent ready for this next part back step a page and keep on looking my friends. 

THIS is SO powerfull that if you have a retard break in your house and is about to some retarded shit you pull this baby out in the dark, flash the light and point it at him. you wont have to fire one shot. just call the fire department, why you ask? the light is so bright it will melt his eyeballs right out of his skull. now is that the manliest shit you've ever heard of? i think so. now grab a beer and your mouse and keep reading.

this gun will literally fire through the shit and keep going until you're dead or run out of ammo. and if you run out of ammo you might as well be dead because having no ammo sucks huge hairy balls. so stock up ammo and get ready to throw what ever you can at this pistol and get ready for the time of your life, for it will NEVER be the same again. a few examples of what she can go through:
- shit, piss, and corruption
-mud
-sand
-gas
-fire
-dragons breath fire
-water
-salty water
-stagnant mosquito egg filled water
-dust

Firearm is in mint condition. 50 rounds fired 
through. Its all black. no scratches. includes with it is the box and papers, 
and the two magazines it came with. well maintained, cleaned and kept. 

if you have something to trade i will only trade with if you have a valid 
Florida License and a valid Florida carry permit. no criminals or retards. ask 
yourself if you are retarded before responding to me or going out of your house 
that day. you can save lives. the boxes that hold the rounds are called 
magazines, not clips. if i get another person asking how many clips anything 
comes with i think you should jump off a bridge. 

for those of you who arent aware, glock is not an american gun. it is probably 
the one most seen in america because WE ARE GUN CRAZY. gotta get my guns. hate 
to say it but god made it that way with the austrians. it is an astrian gun. 
forged and built under the biggest balled auistrian in existence, other than 
Arnold Swartzee, by a tool and knife maker. 

now, this glock 17 fires the lightening fast round known to the dinosaurs as 
extinction but to us humans the 9mm. thank you to the germnas! for not only WWI, 
WWII but the 9mm round. the least they could do was give us that. making that 
projectile fire faster than a guy breaking into your home and shitting his pants 
once you pull out this puppy for protection is the freaking striker fire system. 
NO HAMMERS! sorry carpenters keep looking. The only safety this weapon uses to 
master is the one youll use on your girls clit stick. thats right a trigger 
safety! may be the scariest shit know to man or the smartest thing ever created 
to make life that much easier. more time to do man shit.

BUT WAIT THERES MORE! this mind blowing piece of engineering is made of the 
smelted down plastic from the toys no one buys from the dying kids in sweatshops 
that no ones knows about. and.... STEEL. but somehow.... this combination is 
fucking indestructible. im still baffled to this day. now. what can possibly get 
even more crazy than what youve already read? comes with a sun burning tac light 
on it. thats right all you sleepless zombies. all the stupid shit you do with 
guns during the day, even better, now you can do them at night! but this is no 
ordinary light ohhhhhh nooooooo. if you arent ready for this next part back step 
a page and keep on looking my friends. 

THIS is SO powerful that if you have a retard break in your house and is about 
to some retarded shit you pull this baby out in the dark, flash the light and 
point it at him. you wont have to fire one shot. just call the fire department, 
why you ask? the light is so bright it will melt his eyeballs right out of his 
skull. now is that the manliest shit you've ever heard of? i think so. now grab 
a beer and your mouse and keep reading.

this gun will literally fire through the shit and keep going until you're dead 
or run out of ammo. and if you run out of ammo you might as well be dead because 
having no ammo sucks huge hairy balls. so stock up ammo and get ready to throw 
what ever you can at this pistol and get ready for the time of your life, for it 
will NEVER be the same again. a few examples of what she can go through:
- shit, piss, and corruption
-mud
-sand
-gas
-fire
-dragons breath fire
-water
-salty water
-stagnant mosquito egg filled water

and many many many more things you could possibly throw in at on it.

if you are still reading or interested i am too. im looking to trade my piece of

This is the rare edition of the M&P15-T before they replaced a number of components with cheaper ones. The most notable differences are that this model has the Troy folding/adjustable steel sights and not cheap plastic ones (like later models). This rifle also has the chrome lined chamber/barrel unlike later models. This is the top of the line riffle that Smith & Wesson offers and mine is in immaculate condition.

DESCRIPTION: This is a very beautiful old Belgium made Browning produced during Nazi control. It is a German Occupational Army pistol with matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel. It also has the appropriate Nazi Eagle over Swastika proof marks and designation of AaW140. A great piece of history with matching serial numbers. I have shot this pistol and it shoots like a dream. What a conversation piece!

BROWNING HISTORIAN: After contacting Glen, the Browning historian it was determined this exact pistol was produced for the German Occupational Army between 1940-1944. By the serial number and the Alpha suffix, the best info we can determine this was made approximately in 1941. With limited records, it is difficult to determine the exact date. If this pistol could talk I bet it would have some great stories to tell!

PROOF MARKINGS: The frame is marked with the German Eagle over swastika, the WaA140 acceptance mark, the front left side of the trigger guard is marked “H” and the right side has the serial number “18072a”. The barrel is marked with an “Eagle” and “18072a”. The bottom of the frame next to the magazine well is marked “3” and “5”, and what appears to be a triangle. These are difficult to see, however if they are important, please request more details and we can try to view it with a jewelers loops.

SERIAL AND DATING: Belgium Browning manufactured approximately in 1941, a very low serial number with an ""alpha"" suffix. The “18072a” serial number is the lowest serial number I have viewed on Gunbroker or anywhere else!


GRIPS: Original walnut grips in good condition. No cracks. Checkering still present and in good condition.


BARREL: Approximately 4 3/4"" barrel with good bore and rifling.

ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was test fired and worked well for me.

MAGAZINE: Not certain if this is the original magazine.

HISTORY: FN commissioned John Browning to design a new military sidearm conforming to this specification. Browning had previously sold the rights to his successful M1911 U.S. Army automatic pistol to Colt's Patent Firearms, and was therefore forced to design an entirely new pistol while working around the M1911 patents. Browning built two different prototypes for the project in Utah and filed the patent for this pistol in the United States on June 28, 1923 and granted on February 22, 1927.[5][6] One was a simple blowback design, while the other was operated with a locked-breech recoil system. Both prototypes utilized the new staggered magazine design (by designer Dieudonné Saive) to increase capacity without unduly increasing the pistol's grip size or magazine length. By 1931, the Hi-Power design incorporated a shortened 13-round magazine, a curved rear grip strap, and a barrel bushing that was integral to the slide assembly. By 1934, the Hi-Power design was complete and ready to be produced. It was first adopted by Belgium for military.

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2317998,For Sale:  Connecticut Valley Arms 50 caliber muzzle loader,"Berea, KY, Lexington, Kentucky",$ 250,"Listed On: Sunday, November 10, 2013",Muzzle,Connecticut Valley Arms                                                                                ,50 Black Powder                                                                                ,no type,Muzzle Loader,"I have a Hawkins style 50 caliber muzzle loader made by Connecticut Valley Arms; this rifle has the wooden stock not nylon, with quick disconnect sling swivel studs mounted (there are a couple of places on the stock that needs re-finishing).

 This was my first Black power rifle and at $100.00 and thought I was getting a good deal! But the sights were missing ($35.00 from CVA); the ram rod was missing ($25.00 at WalMart).  That put me having $160.00 in it right off the bat, then I had to buy powder and bullets

Several of my buddies had muzzle loaders and I just did not like the raw powder (it spilt everywhere) and having to lube the patch before inserting the ball, forget it.
I found some 250 grain bullets & sabots (I think) at WalMart, these were new to the market at the time and I believe I gave $21.00 or $22.00 for them. After shooting the rifle a couple of times I was impressed and went back and bought two more packs of bullets & sabots, the 12 pack of 250 grain power point aerotip bullets is still un-opened. There is also 10 – 300 grain bullet’s & sabots (My wife’s uncle has seen Elk on his farm and I was hoping to use these to harvest one). There are several powder pellets still in tubes that came with some of the bullets plus I bought a new box of Proxen 50 grain Proxed powder pellets ($30.00). 

The first couple of times I trided to shoot the rifle I had a misfire, the rifle came with #11 percussion caps and it turned out that they were not hot enough to ignite the pellets reliability. So I bought bigger / hotter # 10 nipples, there is one on the rifle and two new ones still in the pack, along with a new box of CCI percussion caps (might be 6 or 8 missing).

There is also a Thompsons Black Powder cleaning and a powder horn.
To carry all the accessories I have an old military pouch I use for a possible bag, for the rifle there is a zippered camo rifle carrying case made by Allen Co.
Back to the powder horn; it is a real powder horn but because I use the powder pellets and I’ve just never fooled with it so for now it’s for looks only.  Also for looks are two knives ($22.00 each from Smokey Mt. Knife Works) these knives have fake Damascus blades and plastic handles. I had hoped to make new handles and sheaths from dear hide and horns.

I have $160.00 in the rifle, the bullets, powder, sights & cleaning kit, knives etc. I’m guessing I have around $250.00 / $260.00 in the accessories, making a total investment of around $420.00 (max) in the rifle.

Asking $300.00

ATT: I found a firearm I would like, but the guy wants cash! If I can sale by 11/15 /2013 I’ll take $250.00 cash"
