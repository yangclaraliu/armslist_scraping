Its feed ramp has been polished, has the carry clip installed, and comes with two 7rnd mags and one 10rnd mag with grip extension. Also has a soft carry case and comes with about 110 rnds of ammo, about 45 being hornaday hollowpoints. This is a really nice concealed piece, weighing in at just over 6oz unloaded.

Pretty open to any other firearms if it catches my interest so feel free to message me on here or text REDACTED with offers. First pic shows everything, second shows the P32 in a front pocket of the tightest jeans I have (I dont wear them ever due to that fact) to show that it only looks like a pocket knife at a glance.

If you are on the northern side of Indy and want to just but the rifle I will give you the info and we can trade directly (the rifle is only $275 so it saves ya the $10)"

I was stationed in Baumholder Germany for four years. During this time I met a ww2 german vet who found this mg34 in a field just out side of town. He said there was a lot of heavy fighting there. THIS GUN DOES NOT AND WILL NEVER FIRE. This is considered a battle field relic. The gun is heavy. I would say 45 pounds. The flash suppresser still unscrews. The feed tray is in bad shape and comes off. All the guts are rusted to the point that they are un-usable or restorable. The wooden butt stock is also gone. The bi-pod still moves freely. The gun measures at 44 inch. This is a real gun from a real battle field. Who knows the stories it could tell. Please look at the pics carefully. What you see is what you get. I do not have any paper work on it. If you want I can show you my military orders to Baumholder Germany. I also have the aerial site for it. There are no markings on the gun. Someone did paint it green to stop it from rusting. Very cool piece of history just for show. Email with questions. Low ball offers will be ignored. $1000 OBO

If you put your gun up for sale or trade there is no reason to be an ass about what you want for it. With poor salesmanship and piss poor manners your angry adds make me find other sellers.

Think about stuff before you post it. Be polite and respectful and you just may get my hard earned cash. If you are selling a weapon on here it usually means that the gun shops are not going to give you what you want. So make the prices resonable. If you have to have big cash because you put so much time and extra parts in then don't sell it. Keep it or keep your ego out of the sell. Good luck!"

296,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2405296,For Sale:  Weatherby Vanguard Series 2,"Ellensburg, Washington, United States",$ 399,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 3, 2013",Rifles,Weatherby                                                                                ,300 Winchester Short Magnum                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Accurate & Affordable. The Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 Blued Synthetic represents a clear improvement over its predecessor and, given its affordable price, should prove to be just as successful. While the Vanguard Series 2 Blued varies from its predecessor in small and important ways, the basic features remain unchanged. Take the bolt, for example. Like the original’s, the Weatherby Vanguard S2 one-piece bolt has dual-opposed locking lugs with an M16-style extractor and a plunger-type ejector. Fluting on the bolt body reduces surface area and provides debris a place to migrate, preventing the bolt from binding, while three ports enable gas to escape in the event of a ruptured case or pierced primer. Knurling on the rearward-sweeping bolt handle enhances purchase. Additionally, the Weatherby Vanguard S2 bolt has a fully enclosed shroud and a cocking indicator. Staying true to the original Blued Synthetic concept, the S2 Vanguard still retains its 24"" #2 contour hammer forged barrel.

The Weatherby Vanguard S2's redesigned polymer Monte Carlo-style stock has strategically placed rubberized “Griptonite” inserts at the fore-end and pistol grip for sure handling, particularly in wet conditions or when the hands are moist. The slight palm swell is also a nice touch. The Series 2 Blued is equipped with a three-position action-mounted safety; the rearmost position is “safe”; the middle position enables the bolt to be cycled for unloading while still in the “safe” mode; and fully forward allows the rifle to be fired. Perhaps the most noteworthy change is the Weatherby's newly designed 2-stage match trigger, which is factory preset at slightly more than 3 pounds, yet can be adjusted down to 2 pounds, 8 ounces.

Sub-MOA Accuracy Guaranty: ensures .99"" or less groups at 100 yards with premium ammunition

MVF-515 (Red) -SOLD
MVF-515 (Green) -SOLD
MVF-600 -SOLD

These have never been mounted on a rifle, come in original box, and I’ll throw in a fresh set of batteries. If you are looking at this ad, you already know the significance and capabilities of each of these foregrips. If not, a quick Google search will give you more info than I ever could. Bottom line is that each of these are designed to be mounted on your AR-style rifle, and each offers a laser and flashlight than can be instinctively activated as you hold the weapon. The ambidextrous activation switches allow you to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Prior to finalizing any purchase I’ll verify with you that everything is in working order, if requested.

I'm open to cash offers for each MVF individually, or will combine two or more for a discounted price. I'm also looking for trade offers that are roughly equal to the cash value of each MVF (or combined cash value of multiple MVFs). If you have several AR-type rifles and have been thinking about trading one, this is your chance to get a great deal. Trading an AR valued at $1200 will get you all three MVFs (which equates to a $100 discount plus one free).

The free-floating barrel and M.O.A. Trigger System contributes to exceptional accuracy, Controlled Round Feed continues to make the Model 70 the most reliable and smoothest cycling action in the industry.

At first glance, the Model 70 Ultimate Shadow, with its flowing lines and integrated, rubberized, oval-dot gripping surfaces on the pistol grip and fore-end looks very different from other composite rifles. When you pick it up, you'll know why. The stock immediately gives you a comfortable, secure hold even when wet or cold. It feels tight in your hands and gives you better control from any shooting angle. The Ultimate Shadow is also lightweight. You can carry it into remote, rugged country without worrying about any extra weight, or dinging up the rifle when the hike gets rough. The free-floating barrel and M.O.A. Trigger System contributes to exceptional accuracy and its classic, Controlled Round Feed action continues to make the Ultimate Shadow's receiver the most reliable and smoothest cycling in the industry.

The free-floating barrel and M.O.A. Trigger System contributes to exceptional accuracy, Controlled Round Feed continues to make the Model 70 the most reliable and smoothest cycling action in the industry.

At first glance, the Model 70 Ultimate Shadow, with its flowing lines and integrated, rubberized, oval-dot gripping surfaces on the pistol grip and fore-end looks very different from other composite rifles. When you pick it up, you'll know why. The stock immediately gives you a comfortable, secure hold even when wet or cold. It feels tight in your hands and gives you better control from any shooting angle. The Ultimate Shadow is also lightweight. You can carry it into remote, rugged country without worrying about any extra weight, or dinging up the rifle when the hike gets rough. The free-floating barrel and M.O.A. Trigger System contributes to exceptional accuracy and its classic, Controlled Round Feed action continues to make the Ultimate Shadow's receiver the most reliable and smoothest cycling in the industry.

One of our experienced gunsmiths owed this rifle and took great care of it. There has been a total of 23 hand loaded rounds through this rifle. Before this rifle was ever shot the trigger was replaced and worked over to make a clean crisp break. The stock was replaced with an ultimate sniper stock and topped with the included high power scope. This rifle was sitting in a safe and he decided it was time to move onto another rifle. When this rifle was being shot it was able to produce one raged hole at 100 yards.

This exclusive NIB conversion kit from Bullpup Unlimited takes the factory Remington 870 “bird gun” and over 10” of unbalanced length making it the optimal choice for home defense! The reduced length balances the weight better, making a tighter fit into the shoulder pocket so that women and younger/ smaller shooters feel more comfortable and can manage the firearm with more accuracy and efficiency.

870 Tactical BullPup Advantages
•	Tighter shoulder control means faster sight picture and target acquisition helping you find and hit your target faster and easier.
•	Compact design and shorter overall weapon length helps you tactically move and shoot and reduces accidental weapon ""bumps"".

Adding $50 in stocks and rails doesn't make it any more valuable either. Once a gun is in the possession of a private party its used, you are not a dealer nor do you have any overhead and your time has no value to anyone but yourself and I wish I could say I feel bad you paid more due to ignorance and paranoia or maybe you are just trying to take advantage of honest people.

Wood may be of new production on Service Grade Garands. Bores will be generally good with only minor imperfections. The barrel crown may be nicked, but the muzzle will gauge ""3 or less"" and the throat erosion will gauge less than 5."

I bought it stock and have put a lot of work into it. The rims are Matte Black as well as all the decals and Hyundai logos. The tail lights have been blacked out giving the outside a sick look especially when riding around at night. On the inside I have customized the dash area installing a 7 in touch screen GPS. I relocated the original LCD display screen that came in the vehicle from the factory above the stick shift so you can still see the outside temperature, radio station, and name when you receive or make a call thru the Bluetooth. The car is equipped with xm radio, Bluetooth, aux input for thumb drives filled with music as well as many other features. The combination of interior and exterior modifications makes this genesis a one of a kind in Tampa. No one else has the same color scheme as well as navigation placement which will turn some heads for sure. As a bonus I am throwing in an extra indash GPS as a replacement if ever needed, new factory floor mats still in the plastic, and a unopened factory paint touch up pen allowing you to fix minor blemishes without having to pay costly dealer fees. I am asking $19,900 considering it still has the remainder of the 60K bumper to bumper and 100K powertrain warranty this is a STEAL!!! Any questions or offers please call/txt/ or email me back.
