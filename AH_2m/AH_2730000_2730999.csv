I know from talking to him the gun was built by a gunsmith in Gainsville Tx but other than that I do not know the history. The rifle is built on a Mauser action, has a 3lb crisp trigger pull, a heavy taper barrel and the barrel is free floated.  The muzzle crown is crisp with no damage and the overall bluing is in very good condition. No rust!  As you can see, it has a custom thumb hole walnut stock (he was a huge fan of thumb holes) with a very nice elk carved in the cheek piece. He told me one time he had sighted it in with a box of ammo and took it to the field one time before his health began failing. I cannot swear to the round count but the bore is in excellent condition. 
The scope is what I believe a fist generation Redfield Widefield range estimation scope. The glass is crystal clear and the tube has a couple of wear marks.

Super fun gun to shoot, but i think i'd like to check out an AK-47 or SKS, but am open to lots of different trades. I'm asking for a bit less than what i have into it, I have an excel spread sheet if you would like to see. 

Here is the list:

LOWER: 
SSA stripped lower
PSA LPK - Magpul edition
Phase 5 Buffer tube
Tactical Link EBAD lever

Upper:
Aero Precision blem stripped upper
ICE arms BCG - Nib coated
SSA 7.62x39mm 16"" barrel cut down to 11"" - carbine gas system
Diamondhead VRS-T 10.25"" free float barrel
YHM Muzzle brake/ compensator
YHM low profile gas block and tube. 
Model 1 7.62x39mm Bolt and enhanced firing pin
Magpul BUIS

I think that's all.  I will include two 8 rd mags and two 28 round mags. Due to the size of the round and the need for it to fit into the mag well of an  AR-15 lower, the mag sizes won't hold your standard 30 or 10 rounds. 

With all that said, I'm interested in some trades plus cash on your end if necessary. 

I'd like an AK-47, SKS, mosin nagant, remington 700 in .308 with a barrel at least 22"" long. 

If interested, I'd be willing to just sell the upper for $750 with the mags and you can put it on your pistol lower. 

I will need to see WA ID or DL and a good guy card (CPL, WAC membership, etc). I will want a record of sale for my files only and can provide you with one as well.

Do to my hectic work schedule I will not be able to travel far, so local pickup is best around the Youngstown area.

These Russian gems should do nothing but raise in value being at any moment they can become illegal to import. I'll only deal with Ohio residence with a valid I.D. that are legally allowed to own firearms. CCW's will take priority.

426,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2730426,For Sale:  HSGI Tactical Chest harness/rig with map case. OD- green,"Matthews, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 100,"Listed On: Sunday, February 23, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Asking $200 for the rig.

This vest is designed to carry a LOT of stuff. It is worn on the chest, with the tradition cross straps in the back. The adjustable shoulder/ back straps have buckles on each side where it can be detached form the vest. It also has an adjustable waist-strap that is removable as well. The left shoulder strap has a D-ring mounted on it. I removed the D-ring from the other side because it hindered a proper shouldering of a weapon.

It has 4 large magazine pouches on the front. These are large enough to hold 3x m16 magazines each. They will also hold smoke grenades, pistols, as well as lots of other magazines in different calibers including ak-47 and .308 mags. There are adjustable velcro straps that can be raised or lowered for taller magazines, and there is also an adjustable bungee-cord type retainment cord that can be tightened or loosened depending on how much retention you want. They can be closed with either velcro, buckles, or neither.

The four magazine pouches are attached to a big map case that takes up the whole front side of the vest. This map case has a see-through plastic case to store a map in. It also has a compass pouch and pen slots as well as an administrative pouch behind that. There  are also velcro linings that, if opened, yield extra storage space within the map pouch. The map case pouch is secured with two zippers and a buckle on the top. There is also a strand of the loop-side velcro that runs horizontally above the mag pouches under the buckle. I have attached two pistol magazine pouches (that open to the right and left) to the velcro.

On each side of the vest are 4 columns and 4 rows of webbing (with a space in-between each row). I will also include at least 1 (2 if I can find the other) Blackhawk large sustainment pouch (OD Green) that fits perfectly on the side webbing of the best. This has a mesh bottom and a zipper along the top. There is also molle (3 colums and 4 rows) on the front of this pouch. This pouch will hold a canteen (and there is plenty of room to spare). 

On each side of the vest, there are also two zippers along the top that open up into the main interior pocket of the vest. This main interior pocket runs the whole length of the vest un-interrupted and can be used to store extra supplies or whatever. 

There are also four plastic points along the bottom of the vest to attach a tactical belt if desired.

The back of the vest (part that touches your chest) is also completely lined with molle.

I have made a few, minor alteration to the vest:
1- the d-ring mentioned above has been removed from the right strap
2- in each magazine pouch, there was a strap separating each magazine. I removed those and burnt off the extra material. Structurally and functionally, it has only been an improvement.

Overall, it is in superb condition. I have only used it at the range a few times. It is not dirty, there are no fraying materials or any part of the vest that is in danger of breaking. Even the alterations I made have been secured with a lighter to where they will not degrade the integrity of the vest. I have had it for a few years, but it mainly sits in my closet as a ""go-vest."" I bought it to keep lots of mags, water, food, survival equipment, etc in for a bug-out scenario. If you want, it can also be set up to be a good hunting rig with your maps, binos in the sustainment pouch, extra food, etc. Various other tactical applications will work with this vest. It does work with backpacks, but the hip-pads may get in the way of the bottom back strap of the vest.

This is a great buy as it is a basically new vest for a good price. I am selling because I want to buy a smaller rig and apply some of the money I may make to ammo and weapon upgrades.

Please email me/ contact me with any questions you may have! If the pictures I upload do not suffice, I would be happy to send you more, or even a video if you are seriously considering the purchase.

Thanks!"

12 "" barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN using their proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system. The barrel has an A2 style profile, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, and Mp and HP tested. The upper is and is finished off with an 11"" PSA SQR free-float quad rail, low profile gas block, and A2 flash hider.

 Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

This is my EDC but doesn't have any holster wear since I haven't been carrying it long. 300 rounds fired through it without any issues whatsoever. This is my baby, but I found a new EDC that fits my daily life better. With it comes 4 10rd mags, and each mag has another mag base to make it more low profile. Also I have two Rami 2075 extended mags (each holds 9rds of .40 S&W) that fit the P-06 and fit flush so it doesn't print as much (pictured in the third image). An extra set of wood grain grips also come with it, a black leather IWB Crossbreed Holster (that alone takes nearly a month to get shipped to you), and 20 rounds of Hollow Point Defensive ammo. Night sights are already installed on the gun. This gun is extremely accurate, perfect compact size, 100% reliable, and is very balanced which helps with the recoil. Very smooth trigger and has a decocker so you can carry one in the chamber and not worry about your mechanical safety failing.

The price is very fair for all that comes with it. The gun is $600+, all the mags equal about $215-$240, $60 grips, $65 holster, and $30 in defensive ammo. Add it up and you can see how much of a discount is involved.

Face to Face cash buy or trade only.  Price isn't set in stone but keep it in the same ballpark please! Thanks for checking out the post.

500 rd case - 7.62x39 Russian Surplus de-milled with non-magnetic bullet - range ammo - read description

This ammo was 1970's manufacture Russian surplus imported for a government contract which never worked out and the importer had to de-mil this ammo by removing the steel core bullet and replacing it with a lead core bullet so it could legally be sold to the consumer market. They used a non-magnetic 124 grain Berry's bullet to replace the original steel core projectile. We test fired some of this ammo and the blunter projectile did lead to 1-2 jams per 30 round magazine in a Chinese Mak-90. We do not guarantee that this ammo will feed flawlessly, if you buy this ammo expect some jams and minor feeding issues with some rounds. We have also had the occasional report that this ammo is not as accurate as some of the other types on the market, so do not expect it to be. That said, it is the lowest cost ammo for those of you who are required to use non-magnetic projectiles at your range. This ammo is corrosive primed, copper washed steel case."
