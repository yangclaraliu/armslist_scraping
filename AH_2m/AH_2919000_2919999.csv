This rifle is one heck of a tack driver with 168gr and 178gr pills. Put your favorite scope and muzzle brake on it, and its a turn-key long range setup. 

The only reason I'm looking to trade or sell this is because it hasn't seen much use due to the overlap with my other LR setup. Scope, bipods, and suppressors not included. I also have some 308 brass and projectiles available if needed.

Thanks!

For those of you who have been shooting AR's for a while, you know what that means as far as quality.  For those newer to the game, 2004 is before Bushmaster was bought out, retooled, and restaffed resulting in inferior quality rifles.  This era of Bushmaster is when they were better than about anything out there and still are.  Old timers in my training group have frequently asked to buy this rifle but I don't really like them.

I have shot everything from 40 grain to 77 grain out of this and have never had a misfire or jam on the rifle that wasn't due to bad feed lips or bad primers.  This particular model is a heavy barrel with a 74 style comp on it that makes the recoil almost nothing.  

Because these are older pictures they are inaccurate.  The rifle does come with the factory carry handle and 4x scope.  It does NOT come with the ACOG.  The Magpul grip in front does not come with the gun, it now comes with an upgraded BCM gunfighter grip. 

The only appreciable wear on the gun is around where the buffer tube and upper receiver meet (from a lot of sling mounts banging around).

Remember; this is not a DPMS or value brand AR.  This rifle is a work horse and will last generations.  If you don't believe me, ask a gunsmith who has lots of AR experience and they will confirm how good pre-buyout Bushmasters are."

No filing out holes or slots. They are already correct. It is made out of the correct material thickness.

No machining required, just grind and fit your front and rear section smooth and weld together(or cut repair section to proper length to fit your front and rear section). If you have an IMI Micro Uzi kit this section will match up perfectly. If you have a full auto SMG kit you will need to weld up the cutouts for the bolt feet under the trunnion before welding the sections together. All full auto features on your parts kit (bolt,lower,sear,etc) will need to be converted to semi auto configuration to be legal.

This is a Belknap Hardware from Louisville, Kentucky.  I do not know a ton about this shotgun. From the research I have done I am guessing it was produced in the late 20’s or early 30’s. Based on features and pictures I have seen I thinking it is a Crescent Victor Series. The gun was a gift from my grandpa when they moved out of there house into a town house. It has been sitting in the rafters of my parents house for the last 10 years or so and I decided it was time to sell it to someone that can enjoy it. As of right now I do not feel that it is condition to fire. The hammer does not stay cocked correctly one bump will release the hammer there is an adjustment screw but I am not sure what exactly it adjusts. I think this could be a simple fix but I have not investigated. The barrel is slightly pitted but nothing major. There is some slight damage right in the middle of the barrel but I was not able to get a good picture of it. Could be someone clamped it in a vise at some time. My dad remembers that my great grandfather refinished the stock when he was a kid 30ish years ago. The stock has some nicks in it. I will take any pictures that a person would like the best I can. I tried to do the best I can to describe the gun I have more pictures available if requested.

UltiMAK M1-B-- A rock-solid platform for your premium optics. With the increasing popularity of the AK based rifles in three gun competitions, the need for a handy, light, completely reliable high speed sighting system has resulted in the UltiMAK M1-B optic mount. Its Picatinny style rail is positioned well below the iron sight axis, making this the lowest optic mount available for the AK. With a tubular sight mounted low, you will be able to use your optic without a comb riser and still use your regular hold. The system allows for co witnessing (the ability to use your iron sights right through a 1x sight as a back-up sighting system) when used with a tubular reflex sight. This heavy duty mount replaces the original steel gas tube and upper handguard, so it adds less than one ounce to the weight of the rifle, making it by far the lightest optic mount installation in the world. The forward positioning of the optic gives you faster, easier and more natural targeting while maintaining your full field of view. Multiple target or moving target engagements, with both eyes open, become second nature."

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion."

Want to sell this face to face as I am uncertain about shipping legally and feel there are many Bloombergistas on the site trying to entrap and harass sellers.  Now the facts.  Shot a .22lr in gun recently, first time in a decade.  It chambered and fired but now I recall it doesn't like .22lr rounds.  Hit the bull but very difficult to extract.  Requires bullying bolt back with rod or such.  Fires shorts with no difficulty.  Accordingly, I have discounted from $190 to $100.  I do not have the time or motivation to sort it out or to discuss it over numerous emails.  This is a rifle made from 1909 to 1936 by Remington.  It has been used a lot and still works.  Its been sitting in my safe for about 5 decades with little use so I decided to sell it.  I bought it for plinking when I was in the Army in Colorado.  It is a break down model.  Serial #576220 it looks like. Buttplate is missing.  Two screws on left side are missing.  Couple of vise marks on barrel.  One inch long split in stock by trigger guard.  Although I don't think it is much of a collector piece, I saw one very much like it for $350 at a gun show.  The bargains at gun shows are often not such bargains sometimes.  I'll go with my price for a while.  I can be more generous in trades.  Not in need of anything.  Not hard up."

The SCAR Rifle System achieves complete ergonomic compatibility along with 99% parts commonality between platforms in the same caliber. The SCAR enhances individual officer effectiveness and simplifies mission capabilities, logistic support, reduces training time and minimizes armorer service downtime. The SCAR's free floating barrels are quickly interchangeable by loosening six captive screws. All major windage and elevation adjustments are made at the permanently-attached front sight. Both US Government and manufacturer's testing prove that when a SCAR barrel is removed and then reinstalled, it will return within one minute of angle (1 MOA) to the previously established zero.

If you spell the rev-o-noc backwards it spells Con-O-Ver. These guns were manufactured by Marlin and some by Ithaca. I believe this one to be a Marlin.  I believe it was built in 1906 or 1907. I would consider this gun to be non-firing and unsafe for shooting, due to age and internet also stated Marlin put out a warning that these guns were prone to hang firing and unsafe to shoot.

These pistols were only made for a short period of time i.e. 1970 to 1977. This pistol features a 4.25"" barrel with a very shiny bore, a tight lock up, and the original black grips. This pistol has wear to the high areas and has been carried in a holster resulting in a loss of the blueing on the left side of the barrel. The color case hardening is still visible, but shows speckles as well as light pitting on the frame. According to Colt's Proof House, this pistol was manufactured in 1975. I purchased this revolver from the estate of the original owner and have not fired this weapon. While this revolver does show use, this offering it is a magnificent opportunity to own one of the finest single action revolvers and actually not feel guilty about shooting it.

Ammo and pouch alone are worth over $250. This is not one of the rifles recently ""made up"" by Gibbs Rifle Co. for the movie ""The Last Samurai"", this is the real deal with an original stock and finish.  The Germans used these in their colonial units in Africa in WWI's East Africa campaign where they ran circles around the British, Belgian and Portuguese forces, and also in WWII when they were pulled out of storage and used by Volksstrum units at the end of the war.  The earlier version is known as the ""Howth"" rifle in Ireland because of their use in the 1916 Easter uprising.
Bore is shiny with good rifling.  It was last fired about 10 years ago.  I have owned this rifle for 40 years and before that it hung on the wall of a sporting goods store for at least 20 years, so it is an early import (not import marked).

this is a smith and wesson mod 629-6, classic. I am looking to trade or sell this fine hand cannon. the cylinder locks up tight, no play, and the bore is bright and shiny. Timing is right on point, and this is a fantastic shooting N frame. The trigger and hammer are color case hardened, and this is an eye catching piece, for both the back woods or range, this is a great piece to add in to a smith collection or safe.
