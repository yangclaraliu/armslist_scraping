Zeiss 20X60 S Image Stabilization Binoculars 526000 are powerful stabilizer binoculars that produce a high resolution and image quality. These Zeiss Binoculars feature a mechanical imageimage stabilization that permits a steady image by compensating shakes / tremors of the binocular caused by the hands. This image stabilizer by Zeiss is easily activated with a press of a button, and works noiselessly and without batteries. In addition to the image stabilization is the binocular's high quality performance and construction, the essence of Zeiss Binoculars. The Zeiss 20x60S Binocular features a high 20x magnification that allows for an up close and personal view of an object. Combining with the large magnification is a large 60mm lens, which lets more light through the binocular for bright images even in twilight conditions. The Zeiss 20 x 60 S Image Stabilization Waterproof Binoculars also features Zeiss' high-quality construction. These binoculars have a rugged metal housing with black rubber armoring, making the binocular durable and waterproof. Rubber eyepieces are attached to the body for a comfortable observation, with or without eyeglasses. These features of the Zeiss 20X60 S Image Stabilization Binoculars make it a powerful binocular that allows for a stable image under high magnifications and low-light conditions."

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.

Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition

It gets the same precision fit as these pistols, too. Add in the same national match stainless steel barrel and bushing, and you have a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag. The Range Officer is topped with a fully-adjustable rear target sight, so you have maximum flexibility. The beavertail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing allow the pistol to sit in your hand comfortably for long periods of time at the range. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. It all adds up to a pistol that will let you seriously compete in a variety of matches.

A 1911 chambered in 9mm makes for a very pleasurable shooting experience. An accurate 1911 in 9mm is even more enjoyable."

Bullet weight is 173 gr and velocity is 2550 fps.  BC .494  This was early on in the production cycle of this ammo.  The manufacturers components were very new and the tolerances were very tight.  This is the same ammo used by snipers and taken to compete for the military's marksmanship competitions.  The ammo can is matching the ammo with the same year and lot number which is 12055.  Only one of the 20 round boxes have been opened.  All rounds and boxes are there.  This ammo should be of interest to the competitive shooter due to the consistency of being the same lot.  This batch was well before the change to general brass and much before the drop in quality due to aging equipment.  This would be great ammo for a match grade M14.  I will ship but the buyer will be responsible for this shipping cost.

Rear leaf springs and shocks, front shocks. Front brakes, rotors, pads, and calipers, flushed lines. All four tires are Goodyear wrangler duratracs with 95+% tread, I paid $900 for the set new. New SFI installed 2 years ago. New radiator two years ago. Three out of four U joints have been replaced. Transmission front pump and torque converter replaced (both reman.). New trans pan, draincock type, went on with the front pump.

Needs:
Transmission cooler lines. Battery (the one in the pictures is from a different truck). Mostly small stuff. The interior isn't great, and the A/C system is intact but doesn't hold pressure for long. The hood release cable assembly needs to be replaced. Will need to be towed away. This truck has been parked for almost a year. 

I have more projects than I have time, $1500 or best reasonable offer, KBB value is $2400 in present condition. Interested in trades for quality firearms, or possibly a cheap motorcycle. Motorcycle would have to have a title, be street legal, and need little to no work. For sale as is, where is. Clean title in hand."

These guns have a lot of history and shoot big fireballs and for $250obo that's a deal. The mosin is a 1936 made rifle chambered in the same 7.62x54r and is another cool rifle that has a lot of history behind it. It was made as a sniper rifle so attaching a scope would be no big deal and I'm looking for $200obo. Trades are welcome and if you want them both we can work something out.

Springfield XDM 4.5"" Standard
4.5"" XDM 9mm W/ Black Finish
The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

I recently bought a new red dot green dot scope with several adjustment and put on it so i havent sighted it in yet but with irons at 75 yards is very accurate.

As you can see, I traded the long slide for a standard length slide and barrel and have put 300-400 rounds through it. I do not know the total round count. Shoots like a champ, and is pretty accurate. The frame stayed the same so it has the Pro Series trigger, which is just a lighter pull. All the factory stuff is there...... box, 2 mags, and back straps. I have purchased a stainless guide rod and 13 lb spring for lighter hand loads, and a Raven Concealment Vanguard 2 so it can be worn IWB.    Must fill out bill of sale.  Contact me through this website if you're interested.  Please, no low ball offers and I'm only interested in the trade listed.  If you see this ad up, I still have this pistol.  I'll take it down when it's gone."

Jungle Carbine in 303 British.  This rifle is in excellent shape.  The metal is like new, and the stock is beautifully figured hardwood.  This rifle could easily rate 98 or 99% condition.  I have fired about 10rnds through it, and it was dead on accurate.

To give a little background, Gibbs Rifle Co. is well known for restoring or modifying military surplus rifles.  This rifle was called the Quest Extreme Jungle Carbine and started out as an excellent-like new Enfield rifle.  They shortened the barrel to make it similar to the famous Enfield Jungle Carbines used in the Pacific Theater in WWII.  They also did a matte nickel finish on the metal for corrosion resistance in harsh environments.

This rifle would be a perfect brush gun for hunting deer or hogs.  It is also just a nice gun to shoot and appreciate.  It is built like a brick shit house and has the quality that you can't find anymore in guns.  It also holds 10 rnds of the heavy hitting 303 British in the magazine.  That is a lot of firepower in a compact package.

There are NO plastic parts or even aluminum for that matter.  This a steel and wood gun that can be depended upon, not some plastic molded, disposable product.  It hits your shoulder hard, but it hits the target harder.  This gun was made in a time when men only got in touch with their feminine side when they reached over and grabbed their woman in bed.  

Let me know if you have any questions.  I don't need the money, I'm just don't shoot this gun enough, so low ball offers will be waste of time."

I have for sale my Smith and Wesson M&P 9c. I have had it for just over a year now, it has had less than 1000 rounds through it, and it is in perfect condition. It comes with the box, additional palm swells, and both of the 12-round magazines. 
With it I am selling the holsters I have that go with it. They include: an Uncle Mike's just basic holster, a Fobus holster with rotor-paddle, and a Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster.
I would like to sell all of this together rather than parting it out. I'm pricing it all out at $525 firm. The gun itself is worth at least $450, and the Fobus holster retails for about $40 and the Crossbreed holster retails for about $70. I'm not only offering a significant discount on all these items, but the ease of buying them all at once and avoiding wait times on ordering holsters separately.
Buyer will undergo background check, per the stupid new law, cost of which will be covered by the buyer. Buyer will also sign a bill of sale for the pistol.

Well, that's my 2 cents now here is a little from browning...

Originally designed by Bruce Browning, this is the Browning Autoloading Rifle that started it all. Featuring fine Walnut, a precision machined ordinance steel receiver and a hammer forged barrel, this magnificent BAR will make autoloading enthusiasts out of the most skeptical riflemen. Classic in looks and contemporary in performance, the BAR MK II Safari is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet.

•Hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy.
•The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
•Patented BOSS® device available on certain models of the BAR MK II Safari model allows your to dial-in barrel harmonics to maximize accuracy with your favorite load.
•Scroll-engraved ordinance steel receiver on the BAR MK II Safari is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
•Gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel.
•Seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges.
•Strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration.
•Buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability.
•Bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves.
•BAR MK II Safari is equipped with a traditional detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading, in the field or on the range.
•Magazine capacity on the BAR MK II Safari is 3 rounds in WSM calibers, 4 rounds in traditional magnum calibers and 5 rounds in standard calibers.
•Trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod.
•Generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.
•Richly blued steel finish is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
•Charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard.
•Crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
•Walnut stock on the BAR MK II Safari has cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end to improve your grip, and a beautiful deep gloss finish that brings out every nuance of the warm grain of the wood.
•Traditional recoil pad on the BAR MK II Safari greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching.
•Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling."

Up for sale is a mid 1940's production Colt 1911 chambered in 38 Super, its a rare older production Colt, low digit serial number. It is a Supermatch model, when gun is disassembled it has all the correct markings for a Supermatch, ie:  stamping on barrel, hallmark on barrel lug, etc..  now for the not so good

Gun was chromed by previous owner and in doing so marred/eliminated practically all markings on the slide, (left side of slide has visible markings right side is barely visible but under magnification you can see the SUPERMATCH logo) in ruining the finish he also ruined the value of the gun otherwise  this Colt would be worth upwards of $4000 

I had the gun re-blued-parkerized by a professional gunsmith, installed a 3.5 trigger pull, extended beavertail, competition trigger and hammer.  All work done by Keith Rainbow of Rainbow Sports out of Oklahoma City 

I have all the original parts that was removed from the gun it will go to the new owner, (cant find the original grips)  these guns are hard to find especially a Supermatch model (you can check serial no with colt registry to verify its a Supermatch model) It comes with approx. 150 rounds, 2 factory Colt magazines, 1 Colt magazine (unmarked)

I am asking $800 or offer will not separate anything, sold as a package the gun is worth more as parts to someone who is restoring a similar Colt. Please email me if interested, possible trade (prefer glocks or compact ruger) straight cash deal is preffered, stupid offers and emails are simply ignored 

This is a great piece of Colt history, thanks for looking"

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?
