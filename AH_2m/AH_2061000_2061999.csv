45ACP+P ammo is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 ACP ammo and can be fired in any 45 acp firearm that is in normal operating condition. However, the greater pressures and power of the +P ammo will give you greater slide velocity and if you are going to shoot more than a box or two of +P ammo, you should consider replacing your recoil spring with a Wolf Spring that gives roughly 4 to 6 lbs more spring weight than factory stock springs. A shock buffer might also be a good addition although it is not too necessary if you use the stronger spring.


The below velocities were fired from my personal Colt Gold Cup 1911 (5 inch)


1. 45185-----------1180 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. 45200-----------1078 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. 45230-------------979 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. 45230FMJ------981 fps (230gr. Fmj-FLAT NOSE)
5. 45255------------960 fps  (255gr. HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)


As always, with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give real world data and results. Laboratory test barrels tell you little about what kind of speed you can expect from your stock firearm.

All our 45 ACP+P loads utilize flash suppressed powders so that you will not be blinded by your own gunfire should you need to fire in the dark when the criminal element is at work.


The three JHP loads are design for defense against humans, while the two non-expanding loads are designed to shoot through large shoulder bones or the skull on a black bear. These non-expanding bullets also work well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

This is a rare serial number to have because it is one of the last M1s ever made at the end of WWII. This is a fabulous rifle that gauges about a 2 on muzzle wear. The barrel has strong rifling and grooves and is shiny! That is just about a brand new wear rating on this rifle barrel. The stock on this rifle is a walnut stock with no dings and dents. This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept an Arkansas concealed weapons license number which would eliminate DLN and date of birth.

This rifle comes in its original government box with all original government paperwork, plastic, bolt and front and rear sights.  The sights sell for around $150 alone on this rifle as they are US Government target sights.  The barrel has strong rifling and grooves and is shiny!  The stock on this rifle is a walnut stock with no dings and dents but does have two small scratches.  One scratch is toward the front of the wood on the left side and the other near the trigger group on the left side. This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept an Arkansas concealed weapons license number which would eliminate DLN and date of birth. Thank you!"

Kahr Arms CW4543 CW45 45 ACP 3.64"" 6+1 Black Poly Grip & Frame/SS

The Kahr CW45 has the combination of features that makes it the best
concealed carry pistol in the market. It has the ideal combination of
stopping power and shooting comfort, and is smaller, slimmer and lighter
than competitive brands. The CW45's natural point of aim and low felt
recoil make them the ideal guns to shoot and carry. With the introduction
of new manufacturing processes in the production of the CW45, the Kahr
pistol represents an unrivaled value.

To see pic. Click on listings by this user above this listing. 

Mine is new in box, unfired. No issues with it. Comes with all normal stuff and 2 mags. 

I prefer the Glock OD or FDE color.......the one I really want is like the desert sand color GEN 4, but I am open to any Gen 4. 

Might possibly consider a Gen 3 if the right deal. 

Mine is stock so yours does not need to have Night Sights but if it has a trigger job done by gunsmith, that would be great.


If yours has extras like trigger job, extra mags, extended slide release, pinky extensions, we should be able to work something out to make up difference if price is realistic with ammo trade on my side, cant do cash. 

Must be FL Resident and legal age, no felons......prefer cwp and FTF only near Clermont............please look it up b4 emailing me.


Im only able to drive 10-15 minutes to do this which would be the edge of Clermont. 

I prefer New with box gun, but possibly open to a very lightly used one.  

I would also consider trading toward an inexpensive AR. 
By inexpensive I mean under $1200 based on walmart pricing. 

I prefer Spikes, Colt, Sig, Bush, Windham, but open to see what you have. I have a few other guns I could trade and a bunch of ammo I can trade to even up the deal. 

Mostly 9mm ammo and 22lr. I cant add cash!  

Upper and lower must be same manufacturer please.

Model A1041. Competition grade rifle.
These are very rare and hard to find because people keep them, but I am wanting a nice handgun, mostly for home protection.
High Standard has been at the top for competition guns since 1952, many people used them in the Olympics because of their durability and accuracy. Longer barrel, 22”, light weight and very well balanced. Vented receiver, helps when shooting a lot of rounds and keeps the receiver cleaner. It also has another unique feature, it doesn't feed another round in the chamber until you release the trigger forward, but it will feed them as fast as you can pull the trigger, with no ftf or fte.
This rifle is in excellent condition and will shoot 22longs, shorts and 22long rifle, any brand. It has been kept clean inside and out.
Comes with 2,125rds of good ammo, new Bushnell 4X32 scope and new case.
Sell for $395.00 or prefer handgun trade with ammo. Please, I will not separate, package deal. Will sell fast, I will not ship or hold, first one with cash or trade gets it.

It is designed to fit over the rear sight block in order to allow for continued use of the original fixed/iron sights up to 100 meters.

The Mount is rigid steel construction with Black Oxide finish.

It's in great shape and easily moved to any Mosin Nagant 91/30.  

This will include all mounting hardware, instructions and the punch/drill bit that came with the kit.  Interested parties can go to Brass Stacker's website to find out if it will fit your rifle (and to see pictures).  Scope and rings are NOT included.

My asking price is $325, but first offer reasonably close to that will take it.  

The sale will include everything in the picture, except the plant napkins and napkin holder. There are 35 slugs, and some random shot as well. If you can find them for sale online or in stores that's almost a $50 value

I only shot it a few times, both with bird shot and slugs, it did just fine. That action is clean and smooth. I took it in trade from somebody a while back. I am not looking for any trades, I need the cash. 

Shoot me an email with offers or questions. Include a phone number and let me know if email, text or call is best.

Sale terms:

I will create two one page, identical bills of sale with my name and the buyers name and DL#'s, stating that I sold it to you on whatever date for our agreed upon price. I'll note the SN# and we will both sign each copy for our records. 

Sales will be face to face at a neutral location, and cash only.

If you will agree to these terms, please let me know, if not, do not contact me. I will deliver or meet a reasonable distance, for those not in Tucson that wish to buy. I'll go to Picacho for those up north, and probably Vail or near Vail for those down south."

It was cleaned after each shooting. It is the only polymer gun to be considered a single action only because of the trigger reset. This gun was manufactured for about 2 years because of the mag release. It is a hard gun to get a hold of and will only go up in price due to how few there are out there.  Specs are listed below. 

The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ.[9] When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs. The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state.[3][10]
Due to its trigger characteristics the PPQ pistol is marketed by Walther in Germany as a special forces pistol and not as a police duty pistol. According to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police (Technische Richtlinie Pistolen im Kaliber 9mm x 19, Revision January 2008) for obtaining a German Police duty pistol certification a first shot trigger pull of ≥30 N (6.7 lbf), a trigger travel of ≥10 mm (0.4 in) and a trigger reset of ≥4 mm (0.2 in) are required.[3][11]
Ergonomics and fully ambidextrous controls were a key focus in the design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large) to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm.[3] The injection molded grip frame contains four steel guide rails for the slide: two at the rear of the frame, and the remaining pair above the front of the trigger guard.[10] The trigger guard itself is squared off at the front and textured. The polymer grip has a texturized 'HI-GRIP' non-slip surface on the sides and both the front and rear backstraps and a slightly funneled magazine well to aid magazine insertion. The hollow cross pin that secures the lower end of the backstrap was designed to function as a loophole for attachment of a lanyard. Under the dust cover the grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching accessories, such as a tactical light or laser pointer.[3]
The slide and other metal parts of the pistol are Tenifer treated (a nitriding process also used on Glock pistols). The Tenifer finish is between 0.04 mm (0.002 in) and 0.05 mm (0.002 in) in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.[12] The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating and a 99% resistance to salt water corrosion (which meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications),[13] making the PPQ particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol concealed as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.[12]
PPQ pistols are delivered in a polymer pistol case containing; the pistol, three backstraps of different sizes, two magazines, magazine loader, instruction manual, warranty papers, factory test target showing five shots fired at 15 m (16 yd) distance and an envelope with the case of the proof round fired during the proof test at the C.I.P. accredited Beschussamt Ulm (Proof House Ulm).[9]
Barrel[edit source]
The PPQ pistol's barrel is rifled with traditional lands and grooves to stabilize the bullet in flight.
Safety[edit source]
The PPQ features three internal safeties (trigger safety, firing pin safety and disconnector safety) of which the external integrated trigger safety inner lever mechanism contained within the trigger serves as an additional passive drop safety.[10] The pistol has a loaded chamber indicator in the form of an extractor on the right side of the slide that gets recessed in the slide when a cartridge is present in the chamber. When the extractor is recessed a red coloured indicator at the end of the extractor also becomes visible.[9]"

Burris FastFire Red-Dot Reflex Sight ( 4 MOA Dot Reticle) The FastFire dramatically increases speed and accuracy. It simplifies the act of aiming, eliminating the need to focus on and align the front sight, rear sight and target. With the FastFire, the aiming red dot and target are always in focus and properly aligned for the ultimate in accuracy. The FastFire II provides the only fully waterproof unit in its product category. The FastFire sight is very small, mounts very low, and weighs a mere 1.6 ounces. And it has repeatedly proven it’s toughness on the slides of high power semi-autos, on slug guns, on shotguns and on high power rifles. The FastFire housing is made of metal for strength and durability. It’s lenses are precision ground and polished to exacting geometries to virtually eliminate parallax and to provide a very clear crisp sight picture. It is fully windage and elevation adjustable and lockable. It features both an on/off switch and a light sensor that automatically adjusts the dot’s brightness to the available light. The included plastic hood covers the light sensor and puts the unit in sleep mode when the on/off switch is set to “on.” FastFire is powered by a lithium CR2032 battery, which is commonly available and long lasting because of the highly efficient electronics and the battery-saver mode. A battery can last as long as five years. The Picatinny Mount allows mounting on just about any rifle."

The string of the bow travels down the center of the rest. Also attached to the rest is an arrow holding spring to keep the arrow in place at all times before the shot. The release is a dual caliper model with a pistol grip handle and trigger. When the bow is drawn the release, rest, string and arrow are all in equal motion. At release only the string and arrow move forward. The rest is mounted to the bow using an aluminum fixture equipped with five rollers. These rollers allow the rest to be drawn with no noise. The attachment fixture is also hinged to allow the bow to be placed in the stored/resting position.

Featuring a reversible charging handle and ambi safety and magazine release, the SCAR 17-S is built for any shooter or any position.

The specs are:


The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions.

This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!

The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with
70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case.

The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter.

This SAIGA 12 comes with:
     -2 5rd metal factory magazines
     -8 round SureFire magzine
     -5 point adjustable stock with rubber shoulder pad
     -Pistol grip
     -quick detach bi-rail
     -Bushnell Trophy red/green dot (new)
     -Best Auto Gas regulator available
     -Vented barrel shroud

The Saiga 12 is gently used, excellent like new condition.  I have the box, tools, paperwork, etc.  Extremely well made and this Saiga cycles all types of ammo (low brass, high brass, slugs, etc).  If you are looking for a gun that will get you noticed at the shooting range, this is it.  Everytime I bring this out people always come over to check it out.  NO TRADES, PRICE IS FIRM."
