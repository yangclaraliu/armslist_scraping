The trigger is a double/single with LS mounted decocker in typical sig fashion.  It has night sights but the front is dead and the rear is not terribly bright.  Also they were previously beaten in with a punch only the front shows signs of damage.  Blade is still straight and only one side is rolled up a bit (I own a sight pusher for this reason).  Anyway it was blasted down and cerakoted light sand which is almost a yellowish bone color, looks pretty cool.  I already have a 40 P229 so this one is for sale or trade.  Does not have a box or papers.  All Laws will be followed must have a valid CCW or Paper Permit.  Price is firm that is why it is so low."

Up for sale is quite possibly the most functional AR15 I have seen in a very long time. When I built this, weight was a constant consideration. Not only did I strive to use quality components but I made sure everything was put together exactly how it is supposed to be. The result of such focus is a very tastefully built and lightweight rifle. 

She has only had 50 rounds or so through her so the rifle and components are in new condition.

Here are the build specs:
- Standard spec bolt and carrier (158 carpenter steel, the way it should be!)
- Standard trigger kit
- Bravo Company **Chrome-Lined** 16"" barrel (1:7 twist)
- BCM Charging Handle
- Magpul MOE Milspec Stock
- SAA gas block
- SAA Lower (manufactured by Aero Precision)
- Aero Precision Upper
- Midwest Industries Rail (free-floating of course, very lightweight)
- A2 Flash-hider
- Magpul BUIS are not going with the rifle, I borrowed them from a buddy and they will be returned.
- One 30rnd PMAG will be included

This is a really nice rifle that I am selling to help fund Christmas and a few other things on my plate. I will not require a CPL like the other guys on this site. It is not required for a private sale in this state. However I would like us to fill out a bill of sale for our records only. You will get a copy and so will I.

If you have any questions about the rifle don't hesitate to contact me via email or at 206-371-38sixsix.

BPS. A solid steel reputation for durability and dependability.
Few firearms ever earn the level of respect the Browning BPS boasts. The BPS has a solid reputation for long-lasting durability and an uncanny ability to keep on working in spite of what Mother Nature does to stop it. This shouldn’t come as a surprise because the BPS has what most other pump shotguns don’t — features like rigid dual machined steel action bars, a forged and machined steel receiver, a convenient top-tang safety and bottom ejection for ambidextrous operation, and legendary Browning balance and handling. That’s why the BPS continues to be the pump shotgun serious shotgunners like you can always rely on.

This revolver was commissioned by the American Historical Foundation and is based on a Uberti Single Action revolver that has been elaborately hand engraved and silver plated, just like the original. Chambered for the .45 Colt cartridge and wearing a 4-3/4"" barrel, this is a fully functional firearm, not just a work of art. The imitation ivory grips have special medallions indicating the years of Patton's birth and passing. The right panel is scrimshawed with the General's initials, just like the original. Condition is perfect with the exception of some slight tarnish to the silver in the protected spots which would easily polish bright if desired. There is no rust, pitting, or handling wear. The revolver was zip-tied at the factory and remains so...never cocked. It comes in a very high quality glass sided display case that allows the gun to be displayed on a shelf or table top and viewed from either side."

I had another IOTV that was in really poor shape so I decided to put the IIIA myth to rest. At 15 yards, I shot the soft armor with 9mm FMJ and HP, 40 the same, 45 the same, 10mm the same, and 44 mag the same. The soft armor defeated it all.

I shot the plates with 223, 308, and 30-06 with everything from FMJ to black tip AP 7.62 ammunition. After 30 plus rounds, the plates were in rough shape, but NOTHINH went through.

Elevated Yankee Hill front and rear plain metal sights were put on and a Lone Wolf threaded barrel will come with this gun (suppressor will not be included).  Original barrel will come with the package.  I found a company, probably Chinese, that copied the insight tech. (LED) pistol light and that will also come with this package look up insight tech. M3 if you want a better picture.  
     Items that don't come with this package: Box, cleaning rod, 9mm ammo, ammo loader.
     This pistol has wear on the right side of the slide. If looks are important to you I suggest that you find a different pistol.  However, Glock's proprietary metal treatment still protects the areas that are worn.
     On the other hand, if you are looking for a gun that comes set-up to mount a suppressor on it, has a flashlight, has some stippling on it, and has been modified for comfort and G19 magazines, you are in the right place.  Thanks for your interest.

It has seen exactly 1,144 rounds.  I have professionally maintained this pistol according to Glock specs, and it has performed flawlessly with all types of ammunition.  The only wear on the pistol is on the barrel where it contacts the end of the slide, as seen in the pictures.  The bore and feed ramp are excellent.  Function is 100%

(Funny how I see so many ""low round count"" guns on here.  What that means to me is either: A - Unknown round count, B - The person owns guns just to own them, or   C - Bullshit.)

The action was originally a vz-24. The crest is still left intact on top of the receiver; im not going to squawk the word ""rare"" all over like others, but this was very uncommon due to the Israelis commonly buffed of the original markings and replaced it with their own. There is a buff mark on the side of the receiver where the Israelis implemented their serial number system. The action, bolt, and barrel serials match. The barrel, bore, and action are in excellent condition. The action is one of the tightest I have felt. The stock does not match, the stocks were made of beech wood, hence why the stock isnt the prettiest. Likely replaced by the Israelis. The stock is very smooth with only a few nicks and dings from use. The stock hardware; barrel bands, and but plate are loosing their finish as you can see, a common occurrence.
