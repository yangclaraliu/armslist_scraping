I stand behind the products I sell, not just as a retailer, but as a active member of our gun community so I know how much it means to be able to depend on a product when you need it most. I am also a consumer of the same products I make available to you.

  THE RED DOT YOU WILL RECEIVE WILL BE BRAND NEW & FACTORY SEALED... the one I used to conduct field tests is for demo purposes and will not be sold.

  I ran this optic on one of my personal rifles and have been absolutely impressed with it. First time out with it, I zeroed in at 50 yds. Off the bench with sandbags I drove about 120 tacks down range with an average grouping of 3""-3.5""(Nothing impressive, but great for me). Next was a run-n-gun drill simulating CQB no more than 25 yds target distance with use of hard cover and barricades. Official IDPA targets were used, 120 rounds, all on paper except for 8. We then dismounted the optic, remounted it on the same rail space and drove 120 more tacks off the bench with an average grouping of 3""-4"" but that might have been because my heart rate was way up at that point. After reviewing all the results this red dot passed my test and maintained zero even after the run-n-gun and remounting it.

  In my honest opinion, I don't think you can find a better optic at this price point. I really like the crispness of the red dot. I have 3 Aimpoint red dot sights(1 comp4, and 2 PRO's) and this red dot is just as crisp as my comp4 and actually looks better than my PRO's. From my own experience this optic provides the operator with lightning fast target acquisition and best serves its purpose in CQ situations of 100 yds or less. 

It doesn't matter if your using a rifle or a shotgun, this RDS is made to withstand high recoil and maintain zero after repeated fire. Built to withstand the elements, made of high strength aluminum alloy, this waterproof micro red dot features a multi-coated objective lens eliminates glare providing a highly visible reticle even in the brightest conditions. Featuring a riser mount with QD locking cam for operators who want to co-witness with iron sights.. Intensity of the 3.5 moa dot has 11 level adjustment settings for proper contrast against full range of background light. Windage and elevation is adjustable with 1moa click value.

Extend the working life of your AK or AK type action i.e Seiga,etc. by using our 2 sided recoil buffer. We've sold thousands of these over the past 7 years with hundreds of return buyers. No special tools are needed to install the Key Hole/Dual Sided buffers. Make sure the firearm is unloaded! Step 1. Remove the receiver dust cover. Step 2. Take the recoil assembly out of the firearm. Step 3. insert the recoil assembly through the buffer. Step 4. Re-install the recoil assembly and Step 5. Replace the dust cover. Done! Less than 60 seconds to protect your investment. These are the only buffers that can be reversed to increase the life span of the buffer. Now you have 4 recoil buffers! Each side should give you protection for 500 to 750 rounds.

Extend the working life of your AK or AK type action i.e Seiga,etc. by using our 2 sided recoil buffer. We've sold thousands of these over the past 7 years with hundreds of return buyers. No special tools are needed to install the Key Hole/Dual Sided buffers. Make sure the firearm is unloaded! Step 1. Remove the receiver dust cover. Step 2. Take the recoil assembly out of the firearm. Step 3. insert the recoil assembly through the buffer. Step 4. Re-install the recoil assembly and Step 5. Replace the dust cover. Done! Less than 60 seconds to protect your investment. These are the only buffers that can be reversed to increase the life span of the buffer. Now you have12 recoil buffers! Each side should give you protection for 500 to 750 rounds.

Well reviewed by many, including gun blast.com. Free floating barrel, which is cold hammer-forged -unheard of in this price range. Trigger is really nice; light and crisp and adjustable from 2.5 to about 5 lbs. Scope mount is suitable for Weaver or Picatinny scope rings (I used Burris Tactical rings; worked perfect). I took it out only two days. The break in was tedious, swiping the barrel frequently while shooting. Included is the soft case pictured and Ruger's cheek pad which is adjustable in height and has a pouch for allen wrenches and lens cloth. Sadly, I just need the cash meaning no trades of any sort. This rifle, case and cheek pad would run you over $400 at any local gun store. I have several boxes of ammo if you are interested.  We can talk about that if you need some. I need a copy of your license and conceal carry permit or a pistol purchase permit for this sale.  Also available for sale is a Weaver brand scope, mil dot reticle with 1/10 mil adjustments. Lifetime warranty; have all paperwork. It was mounted on this scope. Adjustable zoom 3-10X. 
Milk jug shot at the farthest tree line, on top of the hill,  from the distance shown where the rifle is at the 4 wheeler. Used that Weaver scope and this rifle and no LRF. Only mil dots on scope, my mil dot master slide rule and information on the ballistics of the bullet -all at 580 yards.

The GSG-AK47 is not only a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate, but it actually bears the name “Kalashnikov.”
GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly. 
The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, but not really at the expense of an unfamiliar rifle with awkward controls and an uncertain reliability aspect. 
Fortunately for those who of us who like military rifles, all these issues were not a factor with the GSG-AK47. 
The look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. 
From the first time it is handled and shouldered the comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle.
The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential is surprisingly good. 
Whether it is for low-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun. 
I think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection."

For those not familiar with these - you have no idea what you are missing.  This 9mm carbine has the recoil - if you call it that - of a 22.  A great CQB weapon with a 20 or 30 round capacity. I love this gun so much  - I have 3 - so selling one to make some room in my safe for a couple of new toys I have on order.  The barrel unscrews making this a great gun to transport - 22 inches.  Has a 16 3/8 barrel.  Gun comes with 1 - 20 rd mag and 3 - 30 rd mags.  I used to have 2 colt 9mm carbines and got rid of them as soon as I found these.  An all around better carbine then the colt.  There you are paying for the name - here you are paying for one of the best carbines I have ever shot.  I will try and post additional pictures in the future.  Price is $800.  I am listing 4 rifles but will only be selling 2.  don't ned the cash - just need the room.  drop me an email with your phone and best time to call --thanks for looking

I have a  very nice, well taken care of  mid to late 70s production 870 Wingmaster, bluing is pretty good I'd say 88-90% there's a few typical areas of wear and a couple spots and small scratches on the receiver, nothing too ugly, no rusting at all, bores are clean.  I would like to trade for a a smith and wesson revolver most preferably one without an internal lock. 
I'd really like a 3inch nickel model 60, a model 36 or a model 29 with 5""and under barrel, but I will entertain all smith and wesson no lock revolver trades, with cash on my end if needed.

The 870 comes with:
1 18.5"" improved cylinder barrel
1 30"" fixed full choke barrel with vent rib (this is the original barrel that came with the gun)
The wooden furniture was taken off an 870 police and the butt stock has a lim saver recoil pad
It will also come with a custom made and fitted wooden birdshead pistol grip with stud for sling attachment 
I'll also throw in an uncle mikes buttstock shell holder, an extra vintage forend and a trigger lock.
Awesome good looking setup for hunting, clays, home defense and fun in an 870, only selling because I have identical setups
Available to meet in the aforementioned counties.

Some bluing wear on receiver and bolt.  There is no slop in any of the moving parts.  It is a superb firing weapon.   besides the bayonet - grenade launcher, sling and mag 

When I purchased this at a gun show years ago, the dealer had 15 - 20 of these on his table.  I went through them all and took the best one.  This is not one a someone picked up from his dealer sitting on a shelf and only had the choice of one rifle to look at.

I have fired about 60 rounds through her without a single problem.

I own multiples of it, but my safe is getting full and I still have others I love too, so...
This is a ""D"" code serial number gun so that breaks down as a 1947 gun.
I am offering it as cash sale or as a trade option gun..seeing what the market will trade.
These guns are known as the longest continually produced guns in the world, and for good reason..,they are great little shooters, and they just work..all the look and feel of the old days gone by when we all had a .22 and took it everywhere we went..
This gun has nice walnut wood, in above average condition and this is a First variation gun that was made from 1946-1950. These First variation guns are the most valuable of the 1st thru 3rd variation guns, with values listed between $500-$650 for guns between 90-95%..I honestly don't see  hardly any of these at the big shows anymore, it is unusual to see more than 1 of them in a 1000 table show these days. Some shows I don't see any. Some shows I see old originals for sale at $2500, and fancy redone ones being offered at $3500...If you want one of those, I will fix you up too.. The age of these guns means that most are gone, in collections, or that folks are still shooting them daily and won't let go of em'. Lot's of folks are simply keeping them for their future generations to get..
This gun is a great gun to add to a collection as a shooter, or as a gun to redo and make a safe queen out of. All parts are fully functional, and the bluing is mostly intact on the receiver and the tang, with thinning showing on the barrel. I don't want to say it's museum quality because it isn't, and I don't have it priced like one that is either, so all things are relative. It is the second oldest one I have , and if I don't find another gun guy to adopt it, I will probably take it apart and have it re-done and put it away for my grandson to inherit some day. It just isn't easy to find these original 1st variation guns anymore, and Im hoping someone would rather have it and shoot it than put it in a safe to sit. I am of the opinion that these were made for shooting, but the older I get, the more I understand the safe queen admiration thing too...,so, let's see what happens. 
I am wide open to things I like and will trade for ,so if you have thoughts in mind, just fire away...I am anxious to hear what the market has to offer either way..

2-3/4 Full Choke 30"" vent rib barrel. The stock was lengthened by 1"" inch and is now overall 13-1/2 with the original Remington pad. The wood is amazing and even the add on extension is nicely matched. Wiped with silicone cloth for photos but bluing is 98% all day long and looks nice. Usual wear in areas that you would expect. Double beaded on ventilated rib. Barrel stamped CC brings this model to April of 1982. Look at the pictures. They show great care has been taken. I rescued it from an auction where a few guys wanted to strip this for parts. I just couldn't see this piece broken apart.

Shipping will be $40 to your FFL unless you carry one. I will accept eBay after speaking with you or personal check after funds have cleared. Money order or cash if local works too"

I have added enough american made parts on it so that it is 922RR compliant. If you don't know about that law it wouldn't hurt to do some research. A good portion of the imported rifles sold on here are not compliant, so know what your buying. 

This following parts on this rifle are us made parts:
Receiver
Barrel
Pistol Grip
Muzzle Break
Handguard
Trigger, Hammer and Sear

This means that the buyer may legally use high capacity magazines without breaking the law. 

The paint on it is scuffed in a few of the spots but this of course does not alter the performance of the rifle in anyway shape or form.

The picture shows only 4 mags but it will come 4 30 round mags and 1 40 round magazines. 5 in Total. 

If the buyer buys this rifle I also have 400 rounds of factory ammunition that I well sell for an additional 100.00 This only applies to the buyer of the rifle though.

My price is firm and pick up is a must.
Please don't bother me with spam. 
Buyer must have an ID and be willing to sign a bill of sale and be atleast 18.

The compact revolver weighs in at one and three-quarters pounds, which is lighter than the full-sized Judge, and only a couple of ounces heaver than the UltraLite, but more compact than either. The Public defender is a much more concealable revolver than its full-sized brethren, hiding well in a belt or shoulder holster. The sights consist of a square notch in the frame for the rear, and a fiber optic front dovetailed into the barrel rib. The bobbed hammer is grooved to facilitate thumb-cocking the weapon for single action fire, and has the Taurus Security System key lock at the rear of the hammer.  The cylinder holds five shots, and can be loaded with any standard .45 Colt or 2 ½ inch .410 shotshell load.   The single action and double action trigger pull weights measured four pounds, ten ounces and ten pounds, eight ounces, respectively.  The single action pull is very crisp, and the double action is smooth and even throughout its travel.""

IL Residents:
The price is pre-tax. 7% sales tax will be added to the sale unless the description describes the item as OTD (out the door)

After the mandatory waiting period, you can come and fill out the form 4473 and pay for the firearm.
As long as the background check clears you can take the firearm with you that day.

It is not import marked. All parts are matching except the magazine, which is an unnumbered fxo mag from WWII. It comes with one magazine and an epf 41 holster, also from WWII. According to the gentleman I got this from, it came back from Europe with this holster and magazine, though he did not give me any details on who brought it back, other than the GI was his uncle. The holster has a name scratched in the back which appears to be ""CROCKETT.""

The gun is in very good condition. It appears to have seen police service between the wars, as it has the sear block safety added. Also, the unit marking on the grip strap has been ground off, though you can still see ghosts of it on the inner surface of the grip strap with the magazine and grips removed. Has arsenal installed bolt hold open.  It is possible this gun saw military service in WWI, police service during the wars, then was put back into military service during WWII. The bore has strong rifling with light to moderate pitting scattered in it, but it is still a very shootable bore.  I have shot the gun and it is accurate and was 100% reliable with Fiocchi ammo, which is pretty close to the original German military specs.

The holster is in good solid shape with tight stitching. The strap has some cracking and wear, but it is still pliable, fully intact, and usable. There is no tool in the pouch. The pull strap is fully intact. It is a nice holster.

This gun is ANIB-bought at Christmas time. 50 rounds fired-has the night sights,box, holster, paper, etc. It came with a 6 round magazine- so I purchased (2) 7 round magazines with extensions.
$599.00 Cash-firm. No trades at this Time-THX
