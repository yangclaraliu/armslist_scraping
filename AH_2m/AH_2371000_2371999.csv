FEATURES: 19"" Threaded Barrel, Shoots 2 3/4""-3"" Magnum sheels, Black Synthetic Stock and Forearm, 5 rd detachable magazine (uses standard Saiga and copy mags and drums), and side mount optic mount. CONDITION: Like New with all the factory accessories, paperwork, and box. Test fired under 25rds, works flawlessly. This unit has 4 gas ports and they are lined up perfectly (some of these units only have 1, 2, or 3 gas ports and may not be aligned properly so they won't shoot light loads like target loads) this one has no problem with the light test loads I fired (varying brands).

These are highly sought after shotguns, checkout the Youtube videos on these if you aren't familiar with them, they shoot with a very light recoil and are a lot of fun! They have been hard to find and are commonly selling on Gunbroker for $900 without the accessories. Accessories are BRAND NEW, never used and retail for over $150.

Gas Piston operation ensures outstanding reliability and cleanliness. The barrel is Stainless Steel, Match Grade and hand lapped, turned to a proprietary contour and then wound in Carbon Fiber, resulting in a lightweight barrel with the accuracy of a target bull barrel. Christensen Carbon Fiber barrels are three times stiffer than steel barrel of equal weight. The Christensen Arms patented carbon layup process produces a barrel shell that has zero thermal expansion coefficient, which brings shot after shot consistency. There is a Titanium bird cage-style flash hider with defense point serrations. This rifle has a Timney trigger system Made in the USA with a pull weight of 3 pounds.

The lower receiver is a precision milled 7075-T6 aluminum forging, and the upper receiver is an eye catching proprietary 7075-T6 aluminum billet design with heavy walls and top mounted Picatinny rail for easy and secure installation of optics. The bolt carrier group's nickel boron coating acts as a protective finish and polishes the receiver each time it cycles. Oversized takedown pins are installed for easy cleaning or receiver changes. A MagPul ACS stock is installed, as is a comfortable Hogue pistol grip. The Handguard is a proprietary Carbon Fiber design with top and bottom mounted rails.

I bought it new last month and have put less than two boxes of shells through it. It has an 18.5 in barrel, 5+1 shell capacity, integral recoil pad, and can chamber 3 inch magnum shells.  Will come with a stock shell holder and 35-40 shells of 00 buckshot.  Makes a good self defense/tactical style shotgun, though I have taken it out hunting as well and mossberg barrels are easily changed for different needs.

I'm wanting to get into long range target shooting, so I'm looking to trade for a bolt action rifle.  Specifically I'm wanting something in .223/5.56, .308/7.62, or .17HMR.  These are the ONLY calibers I'm interested in, but otherwise I'm not picky and it doesnt need to be anything fancy, though it would be nice if it already has a scope on it.

FTF in Wichita area only, however I will be in the Winfield-Wellington area on Friday (11/29) if you're in that area.

I bought it new last month and have put less than two boxes of shells through it. It has an 18.5 in barrel, 5+1 shell capacity, integral recoil pad, and can chamber 3 inch magnum shells. Will come with a stock shell holder and 35-40 shells of 00 buckshot. Makes a good self defense/tactical style shotgun, though I have taken it out hunting as well and mossberg barrels are easily changed for different needs.

I'm wanting to get into long range target shooting, so I'm looking to trade for a bolt action rifle. Specifically I'm wanting something in .223/5.56, .308/7.62, or .17HMR. These are the ONLY calibers I'm interested in, but otherwise I'm not picky and it doesnt need to be anything fancy, though it would be nice if it already has a scope on it.

Looking to trade only, the Mossberg is fun to play around with and I don't need to get rid of it, so I'm not interested in selling.

It has the 2.25"" barrel, with an exposed hammer. 
The revolver has been fired a total of 5 times, my girlfriend didn't like the recoil so I got her a Sig P238 instead.
The grips on it are Badger Boot grips, they were $95. The front sight is a Meprolight Night sight, $85 plus $15 install at the local gun shop. The Galco holster was $100 plus tax and shipping, and the revolver itself was $549.99 plus tax out at independence firearms.

I also have.  3 speed loaders that were $15 each.

So the pistol was $595 after tax, the speed loaders were $45 together, plus $295 for the holster, grips, and night sight... So that's $935 all together.


I'm not trying to screw anyone at all on the price, l know that I have a whole lot more in this thing than I could ever imagine getting back...  I just wanted to itemize everything for you on the gun.


This revolver is absolutely flawless, I'm just looking for something a little different I guess.

Product Description:
Don’t let the stunning appearance of the BAR LongTrac fool you. Underneath the attractive exterior is a rugged and powerful autoloading rifle capable of delivering magnum-level power with pinpoint accuracy. From its satin nickel receiver finish and hammer-forged barrel to its multi-lug bolt and oil finished Grade II select Walnut stock, the BAR LongTrac is ready to put rounds right on target and meat on the table. The BAR LongTrac is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet.

The hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy.
The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
The satin nickel plated aircraft grade alloy receiver on the BAR LongTrac model is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
The BAR is a gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel.
The seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges.
The strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration.
The buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability.
The bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves.
The floorplate on the BAR LongTrac model is hinged, allowing access to the detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading.
Magazine capacity on the BAR LongTrac model is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
The BAR’s trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod.
The generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.
The metalwork on the BAR LongTrac model has a subtle matte finish that is intended to shrug off everyday wear and reduce game-spooking reflections.
The charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard.
The crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
The Checkered Walnut buttstock on the BAR LongTrac model is user-adjustable for cast-on, cast off and drop at comb via interchangeable shims that insert between the stock and the receiver.
The well-formed recoil pad on the BAR LongTrac has optional interchangeable pads to let you adjust length of pull and greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching.
Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling.

Introducing the new Mossberg 935 Magnum semiautomatic shotgun with a 3-1/2"" chamber. Built from the rock-solid foundation of the Mossberg 835® pump-action, the 935 is an impressive performer. It's built to deliver the hard-hitting 3"" and 3-1/2"" loads. You'll appreciate the seamless integration of stock and forearm to receiver. A receiver, that's painstakingly set at a perfect angle to generate instant eye-rib alignment for rapid target acquisition. A fiber-optic front sight aids your aim in the first and last moments of legal shooting light. A quick-unload button empties the firearm safely and swiftly. A new self- regulating gas system vents excess gasses to help reduce recoil while eliminating stress on critical operating systems. The over-bored barrel teams with the included and interchangeable Accu-Mag™ choke-tube set to produce even and consistent patterns. The ambidextrous, ultraquiet thumb-operated safety, a cocking indicator and a free gun lock round out the included safety features"

This provides several benefits over private sales or simply selling straight out to a gun store.

1) Money! On a good day, the average gun store might offer you 50-60% of market value for your weapon. They're making an investment by purchasing your gun, to be viable, they must maintain a generous profit margin. Our consignment service costs 10% of the sale price, and we don't get paid till your gun sells. You pay NOTHING out of pocket.

2) Safety. We don't fear-monger here, most private sales go smoothly. But the notion of meeting somebody in a parking lot to swap gun for cash... Certainly leaves something to be desired.

3) Quick sale. Truth is, a huge portion of the used-gun purchases made, are by first-time gun buyers. These are the people who are NOT likely to feel comfortable meeting a seller in a parking lot. By selling through us, you have vastly expanded the range of people who will be looking at buying YOUR gun, not to mention our ability to sell and ship your weapon nation-wide.

4) Convenience. No more phone calls, emails, or texts to answer. No lowballers, or idiots wanting to trade a refrigerator for your gun. You bring the gun in, we handle it from there. When it sells, you get your money. Easy peasy.


   For clients starting the build of an Hour13 Carbine, you have the option to apply your consignments directly to your new build. For these sales, the 10% consignment fee is reduced to 5%! We have had several clients fund complete custom builds just with their consignment items!"

The company's name was changed in 1916 to ""J Stevens Arms Co."" and the name of the gun was altered slightly to ""visible Loader"" in the mid 20's. Production was started in 1908 so this gun was built somewhere between 1908 and 1916. There is no way, that I know of to pinpoint the date of manufacture any closer than that.

Anyhow the gun functions beautifully, it shoots shorts, longs and low velocity long rifle ammo, it has absolutely no rust on it and still has about 85% of its bluing. Being about 100 years old it certainly show signs of it age but is still in great condition."
