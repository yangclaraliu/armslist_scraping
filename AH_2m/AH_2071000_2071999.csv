199,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2071199,"For Sale:  #4 Enfield ""Irish Contract"" - As good as it gets!!","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida","$ 1,150","Listed On: Thursday, October 3, 2013",Rifles,no type,303 British                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"For sale today is a pristine No.4 Mark II Enfield made in 1954. When I purchased this rifle many years ago it came to me ""mummy"" wrapped and oozing with cosmoline. It took me a couple of weekends to get it cleaned up as there was a surprising amount of cosmoline! It was literally packed into every nook & cranny. Looking back I probably should have kept it wrapped, but I just couldn't resist taking a look. Plus back then I had no idea then how rare and valuable this rifle really was.   

Anyway this one was made in December 1954 by Fazakerly as part of the so called ""Irish Contract"" that was never delivered. So these rifles sat in storage overseas for many years until some were eventually imported into the USA. I found this rifle at a gun show preview and it was the only one the dealer had. Since then I've attended countless other gun shows and I've never seen another one of these offered for sale. I do see them once every so often on GunBroker and they always sell quickly.   

This rifle is pristine with finish on metal and wood near 100%. I did shoot the rifle on several occasions but always cleaned it after firing so the bore is perfect as well. I spent much time gathering up all the accessories that go with the rifle and there isn't any one place where you can purchase everything I'm including. Some of these items are very tough to find today or are no longer available. So what I've assembled is somewhat of an ""Enfield Collector's Dream"". Even the ammo that's included is darn difficult to find today and while it all will go boom - I'd probably buy some recently manufactured ammo and hold onto what's included because it's bound to become more valuable.   

Included is the original #9 blade style bayonet that came with the rifle, plus an excellent original spike style bayonet with scabbard & frog. Also included is an original Enfield cleaning kit with bolt disassembly tool. An Enfield bandoleer with 10 stripper clips and 50 rounds of brass case surplus ammo. A heavy duty khaki canvas carry bag with a matching khaki color sling. Then the khaki green sling and  cover that came with the rifle.   

Finally there are (4) 32 round boxes of POF .303 ammo that is brass case and made in the 1960's plus an original 48 round box of British L1A1 .303 ball ammo.   

Asking price for the entire package is $1150. Pick up in Brandon by a Florida resident at least 21 years old.   

This package is a must to complete any Enfield collection. Thanks for looking.  

p.s. Forgot to say that every number on this rifle matches, even the magazine. The original bayonet is not numbered. The blade looks odd because the original protective tape is still on it."

I just sell them what I purchased the parts for and don't charge for any labor because I do it as my preferred hobby only (and stress reliever!). I imagine a build like this would run $2k+ if sold in a gun shop. My asking price is roughly $250 below what i put into the rifle and that is before you add the ammo! This is a smokin deal. You can look up all the parts I've used and price it out yourself if you don't believe me. I built this intending it to be a quality lightweight milspec AR-15. I'm very pleased with it and won't mind keeping it. I just test fired its first shots today (9/2/13) and WOW let me say that I was surprised...this rifle is extremely accurate! I took 12 shots with XM193 military ammo to zero the sights at 25 meters. The photo of the last 3 shots I took to confirm zero is below. That is a very tight zero! I have also decided to add 800 rounds of Tula .223 ammo to the buyer included with your purchase!! The ammo is only available with the sale of the rifle. I will not sell it seperately. Please note that the ammo does not come in the ammo can. I will put it in a box or container of some sort. Let me know if you have any questions or picture requests. Thank you very much!

***NOTE this is a custom build but I listed the manufacturer as BCM because I could only choose one"

(Rail and sling mount added),"NW, Tucson, Arizona",$ 45,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 25, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"From what I read this stock will fit any ak type rifle. I had it on a 7.62x39 and 308 saiga (converted with forward pistol grip) this won't fit the sporter saiga rifles without the trigger group and trigger guard moved forward.  But if you're planning to convert your saiga this item will save you money as it is a stock and a pistol grip setup for less than the cost of a stock.
Wasr rifles and other AK47/74 variants and converted saigas all work fine. 
These go for around $60+shipping new(without rail/sling mount).  And half the time they ""forget"" the handguards.  This ones in good shape but is technically ""used"" so I'll take $45 for it.. Plus I've added a sling mount to the stock and a picatinny rail to the base of the handguards for a forgrip or bipod.
This will make your AK look akin to a dragunov sniper rifle.  It handles well and fits snug.  Only reason it's up for sale is because I had to sell my 7.62x39 and my 308 got some archangel furnature that I dig and the new trigger guard is too fat for this stock. Instead of modifying it (ruining its value to regular AK owners) I decided to sell it.
If interested email me.
I don't want to negotiate the price too much but feel free to float offers.

I had purchased it new a few months ago, and the manufacture date is April 2013.  As on all my 1911s, I've installed a short aluminum trigger and thin profile grips for better handling and feel.  I am including the original factory trigger, grips, and grip bushings if you want to return the pistol to stock configuration.  The pistol comes with the original plastic case, (2) factory 7rd mags, paperwork, and lock.  In addition, I will also include (4) Wilson Combat 7rd mags with the low-profile steel base.  Furthermore, I'm including a pack of (3) factory replacement recoil springs.  

This is a reliable and VERY accurate pistol that you will be pleased with.  As most Sig 1911s do, this one comes standard from the factory with tritium night sights and a checkered front strap.  This Ultra Compact model is very concealable, lightweight, and easy to carry holstered for extended periods due to the anodized aluminum alloy frame.  The slide is made of stainless steel and is Nitron coated, which provides additional corrosion protection and a nice flat black appearance.  

Here's a list of what is offered in the package and the corresponding cost that I paid:
Pistol:  $900
(4) Wilson mags:  $160 ($40 each)
Rosewood thin grips:  $60
Greider Precision trigger:  $20
Recoil spring pack:  $20

As you can see, this package cost over $1000 new.  I'm asking $850 for everything.  As you can see, the pistol is in like-new condition.  Also, I've fired about 600 rounds through it, so I've saved you some money in breaking it in.  :-)  The Wilson mags are top-notch and you'll have enough of them so that you don't have to hunt down and buy extras.  This is a great little package of a compact 1911. 

You can either respond to this ad, or you can text me at REDACTED.  I prefer texting because it's quicker, and this deal is first come, first serve.  I prefer to sell, but I might be open to trading for semi-auto pistols in either 9mm or .45ACP.

no defects or blemishes. My asking price is $500(Firm) for everything and wil not sell in pieces.

This pistol is in VERY good condition. This pistol being the ""AS"" model has a pretty neat trigger setup in it.

 ""What sets the P99 trigger apart is it is a true traditional Double-Action/Single-Action mechanism that gives the feel of a DA/SA hammer-fired gun.  How it works:  When the magazine is inserted and the gun cocked, the trigger enters what is known as Anti-Stress mode.  The striker is fully cocked and ready to fire; however the trigger remains forward in the double action position.  Pulling the trigger now can be likened to a two-stage rifle trigger: a little under a half an inch of the trigger pull is slack, and at the end of the pull, the trigger will stop and suddenly experience an increase in pull to about 4.5 pounds.  The trigger break is very crisp with minimal over travel and a short reset of about 0.1 inch.  If fully released, the trigger will stop in its single action position, which has about half the take up of Anti-Stress mode.""

It features an 18"" Heavy Match Stainless barrel with a versatile 1:8"" twist rate.

The muzzle is threaded and has a RRA Tactical Muzzle Brake installed.

The lower receiver is Forged Aluminum and has a bevelled magazine well for quicker, easier reloads, and features RRA's Star Safety Selector and Winter Trigger Guard.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation.

Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight."

The left side top to bottom. My Glock g23 with work done to it.  everything from the factory comes with it. Here is what iv done. Iv installed Ghosts springs in the firingpin which is now 4lb, also comes with factory sping and 6lb spring. Iv put on the reduced power safety plunger spring also comes with factory. And iv put on the 6 lb trigger sping. So it has a much nicer trigger pull compared to factory.  I put the chrome 3 piece pin set on it. Comes with the factory black. Iv got a black and chrome glock brand extended slide release that I haven't installed but they go with the gun. Also I put a stainless steel guide rod and spring on it. And the last thing iv done to it was put the ace of spades on the back of the slide and on the bottom of the mags. This gun comes with 3 mags (2) are 13 round and (1) is 15 round.    The middle gun is sold and the bottom is a brand new xd40 with 4inch barrel. Comes with the xd gear. Speed loader, 2 mag belt holder. , and the xd holster.  And 2 mags.

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the U. S. Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces:

A. 3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target.
B. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions.
C. Accessory Rail: The frame of the M9A1 has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Magazine Well Bevel: The magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations.
E. Sand-Resistant Magazine: Developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique magazine comes standard only on the M9A1.

After WW2, from 1945 to 1957 no P38s were produced for the German military. However, when the newly formed ""Bundeswehr"" (German Defense Force) announced it wanted the P38 as its official service pistol, Walther resumed production of the P38 and the first ones were delivered to the West German military in June 1957. This particular gun was produced October 1957 (10/57 stamped) for the Bundeswehr. It bears the eagle markings and ""BW"" stamp.

As far as AK47's go its my favorite type, the Hungarians were the first country, that took a look at the AK47, and modified it. Still a dead reliable, the mods made were the muzzle break, collapsible stock, and the forward grip. The military version had a short barrel, so the muzzle break, was made long to make the rifle 16 inches. I love the break, it really takes away the recoil, great for fast and accurate follow up shots. The forward grip comes in handy for CQB as well, and can be modified. Comes with 5 mags, 4 30 round and 1 20. Also includes a Tasco red dot, the rifle has a Ultimax rail, which isnt just any cheap rail, that takes away any iron sight use. This rail, was built to allow the iron sights and red dot to be co witnessed which comes in handy, if the red dot goes out during a firefight....or at the range. it never hurts to be prepared though.

So I had a 30-06 & couldn’t use it for small game and bought this. It turned out to be a good deer gun so I sold the 30-06. This year was asked to go for moose so bought a 270. I only need and want 1 rifle so this is for sale. This is the new one with LC6 Trigger and 3 position safety.
It’s a year old and was used for deer season last year. I shot my deer with it and it’s a great deer/varmint gun. Low recoil.
It’s a black synthetic stock with a matte stainless steel, Mauser action. Rings are original Ruger rings also stainless steel.They attach directly to the receiver so no bases are needed.
About 30 to 40 rounds down the pipe. It was broken in properly by cleaning the barrel at the range after every 3 shots (as I was sighting it in).
Currently sighted at 100 yards and a very accurate tack driver. I have pics of my last outing at the range with 2 bullets touching and 1 a half inch away. Very light recoil due to the caliber.
Includes the rings, torx wrench for the rings, manual, original box and safety bolt lock.
Rifle is in excellent condition, no scratches anywhere
I prefer to keep the scope but Will sell with 4x12x40mm Bushnell DOA Reticle with front Parallax adjustment ($300)for $900 without the scope.

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.

Hi all!

   I'm Joe, I own Hour Thirteen Defense Solutions. Offering up one of my personal blasters for sale, might be interested in a partial trade for a handgun or two. Good quality pistol, preferably in 40S&W or 9mm, or a revolver in .38spl, .44mag, etc.

   Ok, on to the carbine! My favorite do-it-all combo, the 14.5"" carbine system runs much smoother & flatter than the common 16"" while retaining enough grunt to push through even the filthiest conditions. The BattleComp enhances this quality even further, this AR lays FLAT when running! Not picky about ammo or cleanliness the way the 14.5"" mid-lengths tend to be. This is one of my personal weapons, it will NEVER let you down.


Upper/lower receivers - Forged 7075-T6 aluminum, mil-spec, type-III hardcoat anodized

Barrel - Bravo Co M4 11595E steel, 1:7 twist, 14.5"" carbine gas system, our custom ""Flag-Patch"" engraving.
