Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. Proudly made in the USA, all Heritage revolvers combine quality with affordability...an American tradition!

Up for sale is a nice little carry piece. It's a NIB .38 Special +P S&W Model 642-1 Airweight....without the internal key lock! No need for an unnecessary ""safety lock"" that could tie up the gun when you need it most. Just came into possession of this, but am looking to get an older Model 640, so it's up for sale now.

Never been fired outside the factory, never been carried, cleaned, messed with, etc. This gun has a born-on date of 10/14/2013, so it's still just a youngster! It'll come with everything it does from the factory...manual, gun lock, warranty card, fired casing, etc.

The 642 is an awesome CC piece and a top pick of many well known shooters - such as Massad Ayoob and the late Stephen Camp. Only weighing 15oz, chambered for the potent (yes, it is) .38 Special +P, stainless steel & aluminum alloy construction, and smooth lines make this the perfect ""always gun"" - something you'll have no excuse to leave home without! No external hammer to snag on a draw from the pocket or waistband and the typical smooth S&W trigger. S&W is also currently offering a $30 rebate on these guns.

I'm selling this gun for $450 OBO. Not accepting any trades. FTF meet to take place in S. Everett. Would prefer to deal with a CPL holder. No weirdos.

It's the Mitsubishi Home Theater DLP HDTV 1080p 120Hz. 

Model: WD-73737 S/N 121561 and was manufactured in November 2009.

It weighs approx 93 lbs and it's outside dimensions are approx: 64-3/4in W x 43-1/2in H x 18in D

This TV cost $2700.00 new and has always worked fine. It still works great however over the past month or so, it has started to have small white dots appear on the screen. Not many, maybe 10 -12 right now. We did replace the lamp about 2 months ago so that is good to go. Still have the original remote. Can't locate the manual but I do have a downloaded copy I am happy to email to whomever buys it.

See the attached pictures. As you can see, it still plays great, it just has white dots on the screen. I took these pics this morning. It still has a great picture.

In researching the issue about the white dots, it turns out you can buy the part needed to fix it for around $280.00 and there are articles online that show you how to even fix it yourself, so for a little bit of money you can have an absolutely awesome tv!

Never shot it. I thought it shoots 22lr, but it's chambered in 22 Magnum (22 WMR ). It is very similar to 1911 pistol: comfort grip, nice target sight (orange front and white rear), have barrel bushing, guide rod-spring, take down lever, hammer, trigger....Everything feel the same. If you love 1911s, you'll love this one also.

I don't own any 22 Mag firearms and I don't want to buy a large quantity ammo for just one gun. So, this gun is up for sale or trade. I did a partial trade on this gun, around $550 value. But I'll take a loss for $50 for my mistake. $500 take it

This gun is the only semi auto chambered in 22WMR. And they're extremely accurate

While I’ve enjoyed my time reloading I’ve simply found that I just don’t get out to the range enough to justify keeping this stuff.  My plans to get to the range have simply not materialized as often as I’d like.

I priced checked everything in the list below (not counting the brass, primers, powder, lube or bullets) and found the total retail value to be $735.  The primers, brass, powder and bullets probably add another $100 to the total value.  So this is a pretty good deal; you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better value at this price.

Everything is about 6-8 months old and in very good shape.  Everything works fine.  You’ll be reloading .223, 9mm and .308 by the time you get it set up on your bench.  I’ve reloaded a few thousand 9mm rounds, approx. 300 or so .308 rounds with this setup.  Very easy to use, set up, swap out calibers, etc.  A great kit for someone interested in getting started reloading as it includes all the extra stuff you need but find you don’t have after you buy that first “kit” or reloading press take it home and then realize you're missing something.

Here is what is included:
-	The Lee Classic Turret Press Kit (http://www.midwayusa.com/product/785993/lee-4-hole-turret-press-with-auto-index-deluxe-kit)

This includes the cast iron press, the auto index rod, one turret 4-hole plate, the safety prime systems for large and small primers, the case cleaner parts, Lee 	powder scale, etc.  Everything that came in the box is included, included the box.

In addition I’ve also purchased separately the following:
-	The Dillon powder scale
-	The Hornady case tumbler
-	The Auto-Disk Riser
-	.22 and .308 Hornady bullet puller
-	5 Extra turret plates (that’s 6 total)
-	A Wilson .308 Case gage
-	The Lee Auto-Prime XR (hand primer)
-	The Lee Decaping and Rifle charging Dies
-	The Lee 9mm, .223 and .308 reloading dies
-	RCBS .308 2-die set
-	3 spare square ratchet parts for the auto-indexing rod (I heard rumors that these occasionally need replacing)
-	The Lee Double Disk Kit (allows larger charges while using the Auto Disk Powder Measure)
-	A digital caliber
-	The Nosler 7 Reloading Manual
-	Hornady 9th Reloading Manual
-	RCBS Lube Pad
-	Reloading Wood Case Block
-	Redding Powder Trickler

I’ve also got some consumables to move too.  Best I can figure there are about $250-$290 worth of powder, bullets, brass and primers included.

-	About 3.5 or so pounds of Alliant Power Pistol
-	About .5 lb. of IMR 4895 (for reloading .308)
-	About .5 lb. of AR-C omp (for reloading .223 or .308)
-      .308 brass (mostly PMC and some once-shot stuff) - 152 pieces
-       7.62/51 (Winchester stuff, mostly, all once-shot) - 170 pieces
-       9mm (mixed, all once-shot) - 328 pieces
-      .40 (mixed, all once-shot) - 224
-       Small pistol primers - 2700
-       Large rifle primers - 950
-       Sierry MatchKing 155gr HPBT Palma Match bullets - 45 pieces
-       Hornady 165gr BTSP .30 Caliber bullets - 40 pieces
-	200 or so 9mm bullets (Remington 115gr FMJ target)
-	1 tin of Imperial Sizing Wax

I know it is BUYER BEWARE when buying used firearms, however, I have always had safe experiences using Armslist (until now, that is.)

I cycled the gun and gave it a good once over before buying.  Didn't even shoot it for five days.  Today I put 25 rounds of 357 through it, then it stopped cycling.  I could not cock the hammer for single action fire, nor would it fire in double action.  I unloaded it, checked it over, still nothing.  Came inside to call Taurus, and thanks to their excessive hold time I started working the gun again.  It started cycling correctly, so I hung up on Taurus after 20 minutes on hold and went outside to shoot it again.

This time I put 20 rounds of 38 Special through it before it started the same thing again.  Yes, I have checked and double checked the ""safety lock"" on the back of the hammer.  Yes, the gun is clean.  It seems to me, and I know it sounds crazy, but when the gun gets hot it stops working.  After it cools, it works again.

Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.  I have called Taurus a total of three times, each time being on hold for over 20 minutes.  I have decided instead to send the president of the company a personal letter.  I am retired Navy and very patient so I no rush on this.  I just want my gun to work properly--what's the purpose of having a self-defense gun that does not work 100 percent every single time?  I also buy two of all handguns I am interested in, at least I have in the past, but now I am wary of the Taurus brand and fear I am stuck with a lemon.  Even with their supposedly fantastic warranty, I am not the original owner and they can always ""find"" some sort of user-induced problem."

I have a barely used S&W 38 +P revolver that I purchased for my girlfriend a few years back which was carried in her car and rarely shot! That's why I'm selling it. She has actually ""acquired"" one of my other guns for her EDC and I need to replace that one with another. This was carried in a holster under her seat, but as the holster was a generic one , the top strap has rubbed some of the finish off the back strap near the ""hammer"". There are a few other cosmetic blemishes, but none are from abuse or misuse. These are only cosmetic and the gun functions flawlessly as expected. I mounted Crimson Trace LG 105 laser grips on it and they function perfectly as well. I have the box as well which I'll include. I have three holsters which you can choose from, I plan to sell the others separately. Included in package deal as follows;

•Smith & Wesson 38 +P 642-2
•All original packing, case and paperwork
•Crimson Trace Laser grips LG 105
•One holster of your choice : Blackhawk Serpa paddle/belt OR UBG Custom IWB leather - BOTH new/never used, Generic nylon holster - used

I have other pictures that I can email you if needed. I also have some ammo that I will sell separately if interested. I can meet FTF if reasonably close as well as ship to your FFL dealer.

Price is firm. I am looking for a cash sale but will accept a couple of hundred dollars in ammunition in trade to get you to the sale price (at what I would currently pay local retail). Will split the cost of the FFL transfer.

Additional Information:
The first of its kind, and the only rifle you need to master the infinite number of extreme scenarios you'll face in the worlds of law enforcement and personal defense. Our new Bushmaster ACR redefines the term ""modular"" with the extraordinary ability to change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations in minutes – without the use of tools. Truly the most versatile and adaptive rifle ever conceived, it was born of a collaborative effort between Bushmaster, Magpul and Remington to create the ultimate military combat weapons system. We're proud to unveil the evolution you see here – built specifically for our law-enforcement and commercial markets. It's tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on earth, truly ambidextrous and the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission-adaptable as you are.

The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

Lever Carbine with Large Loop Lever
The Henry Lever Carbine .22 rifle features a large loop lever that is perfect for individuals with larger hands or when wearing gloves in cold weather. It has a compact overall length of 34"" and a 16 1/8"" barrel.

The Henry Lever Action also features side ejection, an adjustable rear sight, a hooded front sight and a grooved receiver for mounting a scope. The blued steel barrel is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling. The result is a highly accurate shooter.

Grooved receiver for easy scope mounting
The barrel length is 18¼"", overall length is 36¼"" and it weighs in at a very comfortable 5¼ pounds. The easy to load tubular magazine can handle 15 rounds of .22 Long Rifle, 17 rounds of .22 Long and as many as 21 rounds of .22 Short, making it a viable alternative to a semi-automatic .22. And, a lot more fun to shoot.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The HS12 has a single two-stage trigger that ignites both barrels consecutively. A tang-mounted safety is located just behind the action lever—back for “safe,” forward for “fire” and the switch also operates as a barrel selector.

I just want to sell one of the handguns and keep the other for carry. But if someone makes me a nice offer I'll consider it.
Not really interested  in trades but I will consider anything, you never know.
Either email me through this site or text me at REDACTED.

I hate to let her go but since I don't have a need for this one anymore i'm going to sell her so i can work on a few other projects.

I have a Predator 20” with Nikon Monarch 2.5-10x42mm NikoPlex and Blackhawk 9”-13” bipod for sale or trade. Comes with 10 rd Mossberg-stamped magazine and black rifle bag.

This rifle was purchased new in January and has 60 rds (5.56x45mm 62 gr.) through it. This MVP shoots surprisingly well and can do sub-MOA easily if you do your part. Aluminum mags work best and lock easily. Magpul Gen 3 PMAGs work with a slight manipulation, but Magpul Gen 2s, Troy Battlemags & TangoDown ARCs do not lock. 

The rifle will run $500+ new, scope goes for $330+ and the bipod is about $40 new for a total of $870ish new plus tax, not including the bag. My price is $700.

I do unfortunately require background checks with the advent of the new laws, and we will conduct those at a Fort Collins or Loveland store.

Will trade for CZ 452/455 with iron sights, .22 LR or .357 Mag lever action rifles with iron sights, .22 LR or .357 Mag Dan Wesson/S&W/Ruger revolver, FNH 9mm handguns (i.e. FNP, FNX, FNS, BDA), CZ 9mm handguns (preferably compact models i.e. PCR, P-01), maybe some other firearms of comparable value."

It is the M28 model which is the same model used by the most effective sniper in world history Simo Hayha,with about 700 kills in 100 days. This is a genuine piece of history, and also an excellent shooting rifle.

For those who dont know, The Finnish Army took the Mosin Nagant and rebuilt it into a truly effective bolt action rifle.This particular one is a Tikka.

This gun is in great shape with a good bore. It will be at home on the range and the mantle. It is a Civil Guard (White Guard) Rifle and can be traced via serial number to the very unit it was originally issued. Pretty neat peice of history to say the least.

Pics of uch a long gun are impractical and hence not included in the add. If you look it up online you will know what the M28 Mosin Nagant is. You will also find it is one of the more rare models and as such this will probably be the only chance to get one."

I ALSO PUT A HEAT SHIELD ON IT AND THE SIGHTS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO NEON NIGHT SIGHTS. ALSO, IT HAS AN ALLEN BUTTSTOCK SHELL HOLDER AND A GELPAD ON THE END OF THE STOCK SO THAT IT WILL HELP WITH RECOIL AND NOT HAVE YOUR ARM BRUISED UP IF YOU SHOOT ALOT. I ALSO ADDED WILIAMS FIRE SIGHTS.  I HAVE ALSO ADDED A NEBO/PROTEC LIGHT/LASER WITH A PRESSURIZED SWITCH THAT IS ON THE BACK PISTOL GRIP. JUST SQUEEZE AND LIGHT COMES ON. THIS LIGHT HAS SEVERAL MODES. IT HAS LIGHT ONLY ( 250 LUMENS ), LASER ONLY, LIGHT AND LASER COMBINED, AND STROBE MODE. THIS LIGHT IS BRIGHT ENOUGH TO BLIND WHOMEVER IS ON THE OTHER END OF IT. IT HOLDS 5 IN THE TUBE AND 1 IN THE CHAMBER. I HAVE THE BOX AND ALL OF THE PAPERWORK FOR THIS SHOTGUN. I PURCHASED IT ONLY ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO AND THERE HAS ONLY BEEN ABOUT 10 ROUNDS SHOT THROUGH IT. I CLEANED IT AFTERWARDS AND ITS BEEN SITTING NEXT TO MY BEDSIDE EVER SINCE. SO, TECHNICALLY, THIS IS STILL A BRAND NEW SHOT GUN. OVERALL I HAVE THE FOLLOWING ITEMS AND THEIR COST:
GUN $219.00 + TAX + BACKGROUND = 259.26
PROTEC LIGHT WITH SENSOR = $79.95 + TAX = 87.35
FRONT PISTOL GRIP ON FOREND = $15.99 NO TAX ( BOUGHT ON EBAY )
ALLENS BUTTSTOCK 5 SHELL HOLDER = $18.00 NO TAX ( BOUGHT ON EBAY )
GELPAD = $24.95 NO TAX ( BOUGHT ON EBAY )
SLING THAT HOLDS APPROX 15 SHELLS = $24.00 NO TAX ( BOUGHT ON EBAY )
WILLIAMS NIGHT SIGHTS = $49.95 +TAX = $54.57
HEATSHIELD = $16.00 NO TAX ( BOUGHT ON EBAY )
SO, ALTOGETHER I HAVE $498.32 IN THIS SHOTGUN.

I REALIZE YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF SOMETHING WHAT YOU HAVE IN IT BUT I'M WILLING TO SELL THIS SHOTGUN FOR $325, I WILL ALSO THROW IN A $25 HARD SHELL CASE FOR FREE. THEY DON'T EVEN MAKE TACTICAL FORENDS FOR THE MODEL 320 SO YOU WOULD HAVE ONE THAT IS ONE OF A KIND AND THE ACTION ON THIS GUN IS EASY AND SUPER SMOOTH. YOU COULD BARELY GET BY WITH $325 JUST BUYING IT AND PAYING TAXES AND BACKGROUND. SO I THINK THIS IS MORE THAN A FAIR PRICE. PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS. I HAVE OVER 15 SHOTGUNS AND AM JUST KINDA TRYING TO WHITTLE DOWN ON MY SHOTGUNS. THE ONLY TRADES I WOULD CONSIDER ARE COMPACT 9MM ( NO JUNK, HI POINT, DAVIS, HIGH STANDARD, JENNINGS, ETC. ) IF SERIOUSLY INTERESTED YOU MAY TEXT OR CALL REDACTED.
