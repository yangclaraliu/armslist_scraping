The size is in between a Glock 17 & Glock 19.  It looks like a Beretta with the barrel covered. 

I am asking $400 cash or Best Offer for it

The upper started life as a Del-Ton 16"" M4 that I bought new, 1x9 and Chrome-lined.  I installed a Troy lo-pro gas block (you will also receive stock FSB and pins!!), Magpul MOE handguard in Foliage green and just installed a YHM folding front sight assembly, HK style with swing swivel. 

Battlecomp 1.0 muzzle brake out front, it does everything it was advertised to, love it!  DTI upper receiver with t-marks and M4 feed ramps which line up perfectly with ramps in the barrel extension.


Includes Del-ton charging handle and BCG.  The bolt has a BCM extractor upgrade kit, and this upper has digested every type of ammo I have tried including steel cased Wolf and Tula. NEVER HAD AN ISSUE WITH THIS UPPER.  Flings brass with authority. 

I have fired approx. 12-1300 rds, all flawless. The ejection port cover is laser etched and reads ""Break Yo'Self"", kind of subdued but I thought it was fun.  I bought this upper right before DTI started MP testing and stamping their bolts.


There is some edge wear on the FWD assist and some marks on the barrel, edge of the Battlecomp, etc. Nothing major nor concerning.  I have only shot paper and always cleaned after use.  Not a safe queen, but not a beater either.


**NOT Included unless we strike a deal for more monies:  Vortex Sparc Optic, Troy folding rear, stubby VFG and Surefire light in mount. You will get the rail section that the light is mounted on.



**Here is how I came up with my pricing as I debated simply stripping it and selling parts on AR15.com (please note I have FLAWLESS feedback there as well as on E-Bay and some other forums)

- M4 barrel DTI 1x9 Chrome-lined with Deltaring assy(incl stock FSB and pins):  $175
- BCG with BCM extractor kit and CH:  $100
- upper assembled with t-marks & m4 ramps:  $95

Differences between an Express 870 and a Police Magnum 870:

The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market. It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality. All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences. It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models. Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.Synopses of the variances are provided below.


870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:

Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame - Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life - Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes - Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish - Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves - One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel - Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories - Ambidextrous magazine release lever - Extended slide release - Patented Lock-Out Safety device

This Arsenal Pre-Ban SAM7A1R 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market; was built in the US and is stamped Arsenal, Las Vegas.

From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.

The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7A1R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, 2 30 round magazines, sling, and cleaning kit.

FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. AK scope rail. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines.

Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.

SPECIFICATIONS Caliber: 7.62 x 39 mm Total Length: 927mm (36.5”) Barrel Length: 415 mm Weight without Magazine: 3.67kg (8 lbs.) Muzzle Velocity: 710 m/s Rate of Fire (practical): 40 rds/min Twist Rate: 1 in 240 mm Effective Range: 400 m Max Effective Range: 1350 meters/4430feet

I'm looking for trades ONLY. The gun has had some feed and reliability issues that I haven't spent much time tweaking on, but that's a common thing for these and the culprit is likely in the extractor. Someone with more time than me could probably tweak this quickly and easily. Is does fire though and is quite a neat little gun. Some (web searching....) have said these a ""rare"" due to the low import number, but I'll leave that to you to decide.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power. Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools. The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time. The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. The ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. This careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds. The Model 95 provides the discerning shooter with bolt-action accuracy and magazine fed rate of fire."

I've had the gun for a little over 8 months and have used it for my concealed carry gun since I bought it. It has around 600 rounds through it and has been cleaned after every 100 rounds or so. The gun also comes with a really nice remora holster that's textured so there's no clip but holds much better on the waist than my clip style holsters. I also plan on providing all 400 rounds of 9mm I have left with the trade as well as 12 rounds of Hornady hollow point rounds. This gun has 2 magazines that hold 6 each. I really hated the mags as my pinky always was off the grip so I made custom mag extensions as you can see in the photos just to get a grip on my pinky. They do not increase the mags capacity, just makes it longer. Both the gun and the mags are wrapped in talon rubber grips (best grips I've had so far) I'm a taller guy and would rather carry a full sized pistol in a larger caliber. Willing to trade for any full sized 40 or 45 but am open to full sized 9mm pistols as well. No revolvers, no double action. Only interested in striker fired pistols. Trade value and sell value for the full set is 550. Send me a text or give me a call with any offers and I'll get back with you. REDACTED Thanks

I took it out to the range and put about 150 rounds through it and the damn thing jammed every 3rd round. I sent it back to Hi Point and they did a complete overhaul replacing everything above the frame (slide, springs, firing pin, etc), replaced all 3 magazines I sent with new ones. They also polished the feed ramp and ran 3 magazines through it to test feed/jamming/firing. I have not shot it since.

I really like this gun but it needs to belong to a collector who will appreciate more than I. It shoots great and is very accurate. Really fun to shoot. There are a few minor dings in the stock, as expected with the rifles age, and a small area of the bluing is scratched near the tip of the barrel where it looks like someone used too coarse steel wool to try to clean it. This will not show up in the photos and is nearly unnoticeable. Really nice grain pattern is present in the stock.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

Did not use it last year at all and have only fired it about a dozen times (with 100g charges). Nothing at all wrong with this ML, I just don't think I will use it. The serial number ending is -07 (I believe the manufactured year on the CVA's) It features a break open action, easy breach removal and cleaning, 1:28 twist 24"" barrel, fiber optic rifle sights, easy load muzzle and an aluminum ramrod with jag. Synthetic stock (I applied the camo finish the year I used it). It is clean and in excellent condition. Bore is shiney and rifling is good. There is no rust on this gun. I will leave the breach plug out so you can inspect it as well, it is rust free and the threads are perfect. Uses 209 primers. Is fitted with a Simmons 8 Point, 3-9x40mm scope, factory camo coating and fully coated optics. I nice clear scope still in mint condition. See through mount. Package is ready to hunt! Includes Neoprene scope cover, some 50 grain pyrodex pellets, 200 grain shockwave bullets/sabots, some Hornady ballistic tip bullets/sabots, a new breach brush, allen wrench for scope, a few 209 primers, cleaning patches, stainless breach plug and breach plug wrench.
