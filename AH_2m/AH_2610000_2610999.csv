CZ 03050 CZ 527 Carbine Bolt 7.62mmX39mm 18.5"" Walnut Blue W/ CZ 527 Scope Rings.

The Carbine is an intermediate range 'brush gun.' This handy rifle features
open sights, a straight comb walnut stock and weighs less than 6 pounds!
It's the only model in the CZ family of bolt action rifles that is
chambered for the popular 7.62x39. This cartridge is a top pick for younger
shooters for its low recoil and effectiveness on medium sized game such as
deer or wild boar out to 200 yards. Both cartridges offered in the 527
Carbine model are economical to shoot given their service rifle heritage.
The barrel of the 7.62x39 has a .311 bore, contributing to its excellent
accuracy with inexpensive surplus ammo.

Mother Russia's most historically proven early battle rifle and our most popular selling rifle by far.  And why not, these fine rifles have been meticulously refinished in Russian arsenals before release for export and they look great.  Not only are they 100% functional, but they have a reputation for being reliable, hard hitting, and extremely accurate.  The 7.62x54r round was the Warsaw Pact heavy caliber from the early 20's until modern day, so surplus ammunition is very plentiful and extremely affordable.  This renown cartridge is more powerful than a .308 and ballistically rivals our 30/06 caliber.  This round is more than adequate for harvesting any Big Game animal in North America.  Rifle is extremely accurate up to 300 plus yards with open sights and is capable of accuracy out to 1000 yards with proper optics.  Without a doubt the Mosin Nagant M91/30 provides by far the most bang for the buck of any rifle on the market today.  Here you have a rifle capable of taking any big game in North America at respectable yardage.

I am looking for a used full size Ruger .45 handgun. I have been to several pawnshops to price the gun and they are running between 300 and 450 for the newer models used. I have cash and just havent seen many .45 handguns on here lately. The gun must have a hammer and slide lock on it. I am not much into centerfire handguns. Also it doesn't have to be a Ruger only. I also like sigs. I just dont want a generic brand handgun such as highpoint, ati, or jinez. If you have one around what I am currently seeing them for please call or text me at REDACTED.

A very small handling/paypal fee has been included in those shipping prices to help cover my expenses.  The $7 box can take very small packages while the $14 and $18 boxes will be more common for most orders.  I usually ship within 24 hours and supply a tracking number.  I have had good feedback from my online customers.

Email me to get a quote on my listed inventory or possible other calibers you are looking for. Thanks for looking.  I added ""once fired"" into the title for search term.  While the great majority is probably once fired, I cannot make any guarantees that some have been reloaded.

I sanded and refinished the stock with 3 coats of exterior polyurethane.  By the time the barrel was cleaned of rust on the outside, there was no blue left, so I did paint it black.  I realize that's a no-no, but its not like this is a rare or expensive gun.  The paint could probably be removed pretty easy if you want the patina look.  The inside of the bbl is in great shape and 22 inches long. the gun is 39 inches overall. It would make a great first gun for someone, shoots good."

You will find a lot of Lake City, Federal and Remington in .223 as well as a 5.56 once in a while. In the pistol cartridges, the majority are blazers, remingtons, winchesters, and federals. Let me know how much you are interested in.

My prices are:
[9mm Luger] 1k casings/$35
[.40 S&W] 1k casings/$40
[.45 ACP] 500 casings/$35 or 1k/$65
[.223/.556] 500 casings/$40
[38 special] 500 casings/$30 or 1k/$55
[44 Special] 100 casings ($20)

I come across calibers like .357 sig, .25 auto, .32 auto, 7.62 tokarev/mauser, 500 s&w, 50 ae, and 5.7x28 here and there.  

I am in Grand Rapids, Michigan but can ship with flat rate boxes. I take paypal for transactions. I charge $7, $14, and $18 for 3 sizes of flat rate boxes. A very small handling/paypal fee has been included in those shipping prices to help cover my expenses.  The $7 box can take very small packages while the $14 and $18 boxes will be more common for most orders.  I usually ship within 24 hours and supply a tracking number.  I have had very good feedback from my online customers.

Email me to get a quote on my listed inventory or possible other calibers you are looking for. Thanks for looking.  I added ""once fired"" into the title for search term.  While the great majority is probably once fired, I cannot make any guarantees that some have been reloaded.

This is not live ammo."

A Brief History of the Suomi M31 Finland was at war with the Soviet Union from November 30, 1939 - March 13, 1940 (The Winter War) and again from June 25, 1941 - September 4, 1944 (The Continuation War). The Winter War was mainly an outcome of the major political events taking place in Europe during the 1930s. Germany was loaded for bear and Hitler made it clear that Russia was in for an attitude adjustment. Until 1917 Finland and the Baltic States had been part of Russia for several generations and regardless of what the people thought, when Mother Russia said ""jump"", the people of Finland were expected to say 'how high?'. Being naturally strong willed and physically imposing, the warriors of Finland prepared for a fight. A fight on their soil, in their homes. War breaks out. Faced with the Finnish intractability, the Soviet Union finally decided to take by force what it could not get through negotiations. On November 30, 1939 Russian troops entered Finland.

Do you ever wish your glock and your 1911 had a love child? One day, they snuck out of my gun safe. They snuck away together to a craaaazy party, got drunk, and made sweet sweet love. The 19111 thought he could ""draw "" himself out of her ""holster"" before he ""discharged"". But alas the 1911 forgot that the glock, an ugly sl*tty girl, had quite the ""service record"", and was good in the ""belt"". The 1911 had an ""accidental discharge"" and several months later, their bastard child was born! The XD took mostly after his mother, inheriting her ugly polymer frame with a tactical rail, and a safe action style trigger. However, the 1911 had his genes represented in the beavertail safety, and normal grip angle. The XD keeps the legacy of being very ""reliable"" that its parents had acquired. Well, the xd has grown into a fine young gun, and its time for him to leave the nest and start his own weird family. He needs a place to stay, and will bring his box, docs, and other goodies that are in the box including three magazines! Hurry, this well mannered bastard child will be adopted soon!

The Hungarian SA-85Ms (post -ban sporters) were imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's for just a few years.

Lower handguard and pistol grip are more reddish (Russian red) finished than the buttstock and upper handguard. The gun has enough U.S. made parts for the 922r compliance. Sorry about the pictures.

I had to reblue due to an unsuccessful attempt by a privies owner.  Yes this ruined a high collector value it is still a nice piece. I also ordered a screw kit for the period and replaced the external screws. The front band needs replaced to be all factory, it had a larger screw installed at some point in the past in turn the correct screw will not fit properly.

I am only listing this for a couple days and it kills me to do so but I need the cash right now. 

It will come with 2 boxes of remington shells minus 3 or 4."

This is the compact version of Smith's 99 in 40 which is designed to be easier and lighter to conceal.  I used to carry this as a backup on my ankle and, later, use it is an off-duty on my hip.  

For the punch of a 40, it is light and compact ... comfortable carry.   This was the only sub-compact I could find that was a single/double, in 40, with a de-cock.   I would not own a semi without de-cock, so this was my choice.

I have two clips for it ... only range fired with low rounds down range.  I fired it from time to time but never intended to use it so seldom range-fired it.

Great little gun and I have a hand made leather paddle holster I'll throw it ... if you ask nice.

Prefer FTF, with papers, CCW, and VA ID ... but will do FFL shipping for $30.

The bayonet is a training bayonet however someone has tried to sharpen 1/2 the blade.   The bayonet is correct for the rifle.
