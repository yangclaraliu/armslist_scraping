The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP™-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers."

It measures approximately 30 inches wide and it is adjustable from approximately 18 inches to around 32 inches high in three different positions. More holes can be added for more positions. The round target is made of 1/2 inch thick, 6 inch diameter AR500 CNC laser cut steel. The legs are removable and the assembly will fit in a small car trunk for easy transport. The chain and round target can be removed very easy for different size targets. Best part is that YOU DO NOT NEED ANY TOOLS to assemble or disassemble this unit. I have shot this target with my Savage Axis XP .308 at 100 yards without any problems. I would not recommend shooting at it any closer than 100 yards. I will not be responsible for improper use of the target assembly. If you need more target assemblies I can make more in different size frames. The frame/target assembly in the picture is not the one you will be receiving. You will be receiving an unpainted target assembly. All the welds will be ground down with the exception of any welds on the inside corners. I do not claim to be a great welder so some of the welds may not look perfect.   Please allow 3 days for me to build and ship the target assembly. Contact me if you would like to purchase just the frame without the chains, connectors and AR500 plate. The frame, chain and attaching hardware will not be able to handle a direct impact of any caliber ammunition at any distance. This is true with most steel target assemblies. Local buyers are highly encouraged to see the item in person. Please ask any and all questions.
Thank you."

I do not want to sell it but it's time to move on to other projects.

I purchased it from the government at auction and over the last several years have done quite a bit of work on it. It has mill spec Air-Assist power steering, A fuel fired arctic heater, coolant filter system, remote brake fluid reservoir and low air pressure alarm.. Everything works.

These are easy to insure in Oklahoma for liability.

112 inches (2.8 m) tall, 96 inches (2.4 m) wide and 277 inches (7.0 m) long, and 15,030 pounds (6,820 kg) empty (15,530 pounds (7,040 kg) empty when equipped with the front mount winch. The cargo bed is 8 feet by 12 feet (2.4 x 3.6 m). Includes canvas soft top.

LDT 465 engine, It is an in-line, 478-cubic-inch (7.8 L), six-cylinder, turbocharged multifuel engine developing 134 bhp (100 kW) and 330 pound force-feet (447 N•m) of torque. This is coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission and divorced 2-speed transfer case, air-operated selectable transfer case Rockwell 136-27). Multifuel engines are designed to operate reliably on a wide variety of fuels, to include diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, heating oil or gasoline. Gasoline should only be used in an emergency because it does not properly lubricate the injector pump. While using gasoline, common practice calls for the addition of at least 1 U.S. quart of clean motor oil per 15 U.S. gallons of gasoline (1 imp qt/13 imp gal; 1 L/60 L) for proper pump lubrication where available.

Brake system is air-assisted-hydraulic six wheel drum with a driveline parking brake, although glad-hands exist on the rear of the vehicle for connection to trailers with full air service and emergency brakes. Braking performance of the truck is similar to other power drum brake vehicles of this size. Each drum was designed with maximum efficiency in mind, and individual drums can dissipate up to 12 kilowatts (16 hp) of braking heat. Due to this brake system and GVWR under 26,001 pounds (11,794 kg), the big deuce can be driven without a commercial driver's license in most states, including Oklahoma.

Great condition, clear Oklahoma title. It is registered as a classic. Includes Job Site Toolbox in bed with some supplies, spare parts and specialized tools and a set of manuals. Includes cargo cover bows and rear cargo cover not pictured.

Due to federal law, buyer must be a US citizen.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

Sleeps 6. There is an $11.75 resort fee per day per guest, and the room taxes will need to be paid. Selling for only $100 per night!

Set within 54 acres surrounding the serene natural setting of Lake Eve, and located along popular International Drive, The Fountains offers everything you would expect from a world-class resort as well as the convenience of a central location.

Orlando is famous for its amazing attractions, unbridled family fun and exquisite weather. Now, The Fountains has its own claim to fame- Bluegreen's Wakoola Springs. This 75,000-square-foot tropical oasis sets itself apart from an everyday pool with two twisting water slides*, a zero-entry pool, interactive water fountains, two hot tubs. Cross over the two bridges on the campus and head over to one of two fire circles for evening stargazing and relaxation.

There is so much to do poolside at Wakoola Springs. Enjoy a massage poolside in our massage cabana. Or even get your hair braided.

With so many on-site amenities for both adults and kids, not to mention the hundreds of attractions in and around Orlando, you'll want to plan an extended stay to fit it all in. The beautiful Lake Eve offers fishing and features a boardwalk and pier. Enjoy a 6,000-square-foot indoor/outdoor pool, two hot tubs, a convenient pool bar and playground.

An immense 20,000-square-foot clubhouse houses a game room, business center, kids’ activity room, fitness room and outdoor relaxation garden. Spoil yourself with massage and spa services available. Stop by H20 or the Coffee Shop for a bite to eat.

For a casual and fun dining experience, try H2O arcade and bar. Great family fun!

Give into temptation at the Coffee Shop! If the sumptuous smell of one of our gourmet coffee drinks such as caramel latte foam or chocolate hazelccino wafting across the lobby doesn't grab your attention, then an assortment of fresh-baked breakfast pastries or our hot breakfast Panini certainly will. Your taste buds will thank you for the treat!  The Coffee Shop proudly brews Starbucks coffee. 

Our two-bedroom villas are richly appointed with all the comforts of home—and then some. Most feature a screened balcony overlooking the lake and a fully equipped kitchen. The décor is elegant and tasteful with many focused on water, lake or pool views.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

I've only shot it about 15 times. Actually bought it in Michigan and shot my first buck with it a couple years ago. It hasn't been used in a while, so it needs to find a good home. 

It's been well maintained!

The only thing wrong with it is that it has a broken loop for one of the strap clips (see last picture). The first shot I ever fired, I had it propped up on a fence. The strap pulled and ripped through the molded loop during the recoil. So basically it can't have a strap unless that's fixed.

Along with the muzzleloader, this sale includes:
*Soft case
*Hard Case
*72 Triple Se7en Pellets
*85 Primers
*Cleaning kit:
-Breech cleaners
-Bore brush
-Bore Butter
-Bore cleaner
-Anti-seize stick
-Cleaning rod
-Package of cleaning cloths

You can find these kits for $320, but they don't include the scope, hard case, primers, pellets, or half the cleaning supplies. So you're looking at about $450 for all this in store.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union.

Up for grabs is a lightly used Taurus PT1911 chambered in 9mm, blued (with polished accent parts). She has had no FTF or FTE with any brand, grain and bullet type in the 400 or so rounds that have put through her. Everything is stock except for the addition of the Pachmayr grips($30 value) and Wilson Combat mag well($30value). Will come with everything that came originally from the factory including 2 mags, original grips, take-down tool, cleaning brush and locking keys. The only thing i do not have is the original case. 

COSMETICS - 
Gun came blued and original parts were custom polished to give it the look i wanted. Mags show typical wear there is also a small amount of holster wear on the slide, but this was my EDC for the past year. Other than that no major damage, scratches or ware that i can find.

ACCESSORIES - 
This will come with a Uncle Mikes basic 1911 IWB holster. I have the option to add a BlackHawk Serpa tactical holster that has been attached to a drop leg holster but also will come with paddle and belt loop options. 
I also have a Horsehide CrossBreed SuperTuck Delux IWB holster! This would cost almost $90 new and take at least a couple months to receive due to their high demand. Honestly the most comfortable holster i have ever used, especially when carrying a full sized 1911. It has also been decently broken in so you wont have to go for the first month with that break in period and constant squeaking. I am asking an additional $60 for this.

AMMO - 
Will see what I have. Around 100 rounds most likely

$500 - for the gun, upgraded parts, uncle mikes holster, mags and everything else original and from the factory except for the case. I can give it to you, there is just no foam in it anymore.
If you are interested I also have:
$25 - for 100 rounds of remington 115g fmj (worth $30)
$30 - for the BlackHawk Serpa Rig (worth $50)
$60 - for CrossBreed IWB Horsehide holster (worth $90 and a 3 month wait)

If you want everything, I will to a combined deal of $600

Really looking for cash, but shoot me any offers the worst I can say is no thanks! More pictures per request.

New unfired direct from the factory Israel Weapons Industry Tavor SAR-IDF chambered in 5.56 nato. This rifle comes with the highly sought after Mepro 21 sight. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Money Order/Certified Check,Western Union. We charge $30.00 for freight to ship this firearm UPS. IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO KNOW YOUR LOCAL LAWS BEFORE PLACING AN ORDER. contact. 6465042587"

Tho this gun has been fired , the round count might be 250 . Rifling is prominent . I have two other .45s that are my shooters . This was my truck gun . The price is the price .  Very firm on price . Blueing is mirror like  . I have owned this for about 4 years and I am the 2nd owner .You don't have to buy it and I really don't need to sell it . I recently bought a .380 for my truck gun and just don't feel I need 3 .45 ACP's . Serious parties only please ."

2 magazines 12+1, manual, back straps, carrying case, lock, EVERYTHING that came with it.

Reason for sale: Basically I bought 5 guns.. 3 compacts, one full size gun, 1 rifle. I normally carry a revolver and was weighing my options, the gun I decided to keep was a full size gun for a bedstand gun, the compact I liked the most was this 9c, it was better than the m&P shield especially because I'm lefty but I liked the more rounds and the all around feel to the weapon more. But I want the full size gun and can't keep both financial wise. So in other words this gun is truly flawless. I'm not selling off my problems like most gun sellers, I just need the money.

This gun is not cheap - http://www.gandermountain.com/modperl/product/details.cgi?pdesc=Smith-Wesson-MP-Compact-Handgun&i=422363

You can't find it in a store for less than $550-$650 then you add tax and processing fees..

my price is $500, no tax, fees, paperwork or anything like that.

I really need cash but will consider cash + trade.. $350 + shotgun.. deals like that I would consider for the right guns. (Not only shotguns make me an offer with any gun)"
