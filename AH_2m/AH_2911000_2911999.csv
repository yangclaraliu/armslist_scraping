Has very bright night sights, comes with 3 - 17 round magazines, factory case, manuals, etc.  Everything you get with them new.  I will also include a full box of another hard to find box of Remington Golden Saber 9mm +P hollowpoint ammo. This gun shoots and feels amazing.  The compensated slide and barrel make it such a soft shooter.

I love this gun, but  have a Glock 22c and don't need both. 
I will look at other handgun trades, or I will take $575 for everything.

This rifle has the lightweight barrel that colt is known for. 1:7 ratio and chrome lined. These are fantastic rifles that are built to mil spec.

The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability. While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out! ""Have neer seen one like this"" The magazine follower, action etc have no wear, metal is very smooth , not a mark on it, Mint bore!!. All matching. This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine. i do not see a refurb mark on the stock , if this is a refurb it was most likely a garrison rifle, maybe an officers or political gaurds rifle. i was originally going to turn this into a repro sniper because the bore is unlike any i have ever seen, !!
The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was appreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle."

***From Magpuls website
The Magpul MOE Hand Guard for AR15/M16 rifles with mid-length gas systems combines the light weight of a standard hand guard with modular flexibility. Designed with versatility in mind, slots at the two, six, and ten o'clock positions allow the attachment of optional Picatinny rail sections and other accessories for mounting tactical lights, slings, grips, etc. Reinforced, heat-resistant polymer construction provides operational durability without the weight and expense of an aluminum rail hand guard. Front extensions and lower lip provides additional operator protection from hot front sight assembly.

GRIP***
Designed for use with MOE Hand Guards and Forends, the MVG is a basic, light weight, cost-effective vertical fore grip that attaches directly to these hand guards without any rail needed. Shape is ergonomically designed for use as a traditional vertical grip. It has also been optimized for use with the ""thumb break method"" of shooting

Paid just over $60 after tax and shipping. Asking $35 OBO

As the model name suggests this is a 5.56 NATO/.223 Remington bullpup ""carbine."" For those unfamiliar with this style of rifle it has a 16"" barrel that runs almost the full length of the rifle. The magazine well is located behind the pistol grip and trigger, bringing the total length of the rifle to about 26,"" just over the legal length minimum of 24."" This makes the weapon easier to handle in close quarters or entering and exiting vehicles. The rifle is delightfully easy to get used to despite the drastic difference in feel from a traditional carbine.  Primary drawbacks include the inability to use standard AR magazines, although I will include 3 thirty round black mags and one ten round amber mag. Point of aim has the most natural feel of any rifle I've handled, and I've handled most common styles.  Negligible recoil, easy to handle, easy to learn. Left handed shooters will either need to buy a replacement bolt from either the manufacturer or a site I recommend, ratworx.com, that specializes in AUG and MSAR parts. Ratworx also offers a snap-on brass deflector that would stop lefties from getting hit in the face with brass that ejects right in front of your cheek weld with this rifle. A light amount of scratching is visible immediately behind the ejection port from where the brass typically strikes the stock on its way out of the gun.  This particular model is a flat-top ORC style, but I will include Magpul standard MBUS flip-up sights.  A common issue with these rifles when purchased new is that the extractors tend to break easily. I made the mistake of feeding mine steel-cased 556 surplus rounds and had to send the rifle into MSAR to rebuild the bolt and examine the chamber for wear. Te rifle was returned with a rebuilt bolt similar to the one found in the E4 variant of MSAR's STG556 line, so it should not have any ongoing issues, while I will advise against using steel cased rounds, but more experience has taught me that this is true for any weapon.  And finally, my favorite part of this rifle is the ability to remove the barrel using only a toggle near the gas port above the built-in fire grip.  This allows for rapid field clearing of chamber/bore.  Any questions or photo requests feel free to respond, I have been out of state working for a while now and cannot provide photos other than those I've found online just yet, but I will be reposting this listing once I can get new photos."

Up for sale is my Eotech HHS II holographic red dot sighting system. Excellent to like new condition! Had it mounted on my AR15 but very lightly used at the range and one coyote hunt then stored in the safe. Never even had to change battery. 
This system includes the EXPS2-2 Circle w/Double Red Dot reticle with quick detach mount, G33 3.25X Magnifier w/quick detach flip-to-side mount, fresh new battery w/spare, and foam lined factory pelican case with manuals. 
Exact setup used by many military units and law enforcement agencies and marked as such. Outstanding system for both close-quarters engagements and with the magnifier engaged, great out to 300 yds or more. Provides the tactical advantage of precision shooting with both eyes open for full range of vision. With the flip-to-side mount, allows you to quickly go from close quarters to longer range engagements and back again with the simple flick of a lever. 
The quick detach mounts allows you to very quickly remove one or both units and continue to engage targets with your backup flip up iron sights. The magnifier can be configured to flip to the right or left.
The circle and double red dot reticle allows you to zero the center dot at the desired distance and use the bottom dot for aiming at more distant targets. Extremely rapid target acquisition from 7-300 yds.
20 different brightness settings for any lighting conditions, easily accessible on outside of unit. Automatic shutoff programmable for either 4 or 8 hours. 
For your tactical, home defense, or hunting needs, this is one of the finest sighting systems on the market!
For a pic of the reticle, see here:

The remington 878 is in excellent condition, great wood stock, 26"" improved choke barrel, and holds 2+1 rounds. It also comes with a scope mount and a remington 1100 pistol grip/shoulder stock. The synthetic stock doesnt quite fit (the 878 uses an 870 stock and 1100 forend) i just bought the wrong stock, but with a stock screw from an 1100 it would fit proper.It cycles everything from low brass birdshot to high brass slugs perfectly.

The cobra patriot 45acp is a great carry gun, its almost the same size and weight as a springfield xds, has a 7 round mag and accepts 1911 mags from what ive read, and has only had a total of 50 rounds through it. It has a heavy trigger pull, but for a carry gun thats a good thing. I had a couple jams, but its also still well below its 200 round break in period.

Im looking to trade both for a semi automatic 12 gauge that accepts synthetic stocks, shorterbarrels (not sbs, but 18 1/2 or longer), scope mounts, and magazine tube extensions. Basically i want to build a tactical 12 gauge semi. I thought i was going to do that with the 878 but i found out after i got it that the gas piston system is in the mag tube so it cant hold more than 3 rounds total. The recoil system in it functions flawlessly, but its the perfect hunting shotgun, not so much for a tactical overhual."

“Grand American” MK-85 in .50 caliber

Beautiful brown and gray laminated wood stock with thumbhole and Schnabel forearm, Williams sights, stock, like new condition (no nicks, scratches, dings, rust, etc.). Includes the original factory test target, tools (breech plug/nipple remover & allen wrenches), manual, etc. In-line ignition for accuracy plus reliability, and Knight’s legendary double safety system. Uses #11 percussion caps. Drilled and tapped for a scope mount.

I bought this new in 1992 for $649 before tax and shipping – I still have the receipt. Serial Number 17505. This was a limited production gun called the “Grand American.”. I shot it at the range and took it on 1 hunt. Cleaned, lubed and properly stored with anti-seize grease on all threaded parts of the action. A true safe queen. I’m not likely to hunt muzzle loading season again, so it is time for it to go to a new home to be used and enjoyed. 

No FFL is required since it is a muzzleloader.
Asking $595. Sorry, but I’m not interested in trades.
I will ship within the lower 48 states for $30.

These were easily the coolest looking shotguns ever made, and featured in many action movies such as the Terminator, Jurassic Park, and the Matrix.  It holds 8 shells (7+1), and can switch between semi automatic and pump action.   It has a magazine cutoff, allowing you to load a different type of shell without having to unload the magazine first (in case you need to switch to a slug, less-lethal, etc). The pump action mode allows the firing of low-pressure rounds that wouldn't cycle the action on semi, like bean bag or tear gas rounds.  It has excellent ghost ring sights that are very quick on target and work well in low light.  It has a threaded barrel, allowing the use of muzzle attachments.  

The SPAS isn't just about looks -- it is very rugged and reliable, and is in use by police and military units worldwide.  It is an absolute blast to shoot -- you can fire those 8 shells amazingly quickly and with very little recoil on semi auto, even with 00 buck or 1 oz. slugs.  It would make a superb home defense shotgun, and would definitely be nice to have by your side in case of any sort of SHTF scenario.  It is a very nice gun and it shoots great, but I am really wanting to get a .308 AR for hog hunting and Run 'n Gun.  I am asking $1295 OBO.  I would be open to trades, especially for a S&W M&P 10.  I am also looking for a cheap car that gets good mileage and has a/c.

I can meet anywhere anywhere in the OKC area and outlying towns for a face-to-face deal.  I would also be willing to ship it to your FFL if you can't meet face to face or if you're in another state, as long as you pay the costs of shipping.

LWRCi REPR 20"" Spiral Fluted, Patriot Brown Ceracoat

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. Each R.E.P.R. rifle comes with one barreled upper, but extra uppers are available in light contour  16.1” and heavy contour 20” configurations. Custom packages including one lower and two or more barreled uppers are available. These packages can be had with a variety of optics and accessories. Contact our customer service department for specifications.

New for 2012, we are offering the 16” R.E.P.R. with a spiral fluted barrel. The spiral fluting shaves weight while relieving longitudinal stresses that can cause ‘stringing’ in barrels with conventional linear fluting.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

LWRCi REPR 16"" Spiral Fluted Barrel 308 Win OD GREEN for Sale! BUY HERE!

The LWRCi Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle is the right tool for when you need to precisely place many rounds on targets at varying distances. The 20 round magazine makes for constant target engagement for multiple threats or targets. The Geissele Automatics trigger is super smooth and light enough for extremely precise shots on target. The spiral fluted barrel really lightens up the swing weight of a 308 carbine making it possible for an effective heavy perimeter defense rifle for law enforcement, or heavy class for three gun.

The side charging handle allows for easy charging of the weapon in the prone position without giving up your shooting position. The Fail Zero coated bolt carrier group and the piston gas system really help the reliability of the 308 based ARs due to the tremendous amount of carbon being expelled while firing a cartridge that has more than double the powder of the 5.56 round. This is problematic for most direct impingement 308 carbines because more carbon gets deposited on the internals.

The smooth hand guard with the modular rail set makes adding white light or bi-pod easy while keeping a smooth profile to assist in marksmanship. The 16"" barrel provides enough velocity to be effective out to 800M and capable to 1000M with the right ammo without being to heavy to quickly deploy like many longer barrel precision rifles. The barrel  process is so effective that you will only wear out this barrel under extreme round counts. It is made of cold hammer forged 41V45 steel alloy and treated with NiCorr™. This is extremely important on 308 based AR because of the heat produced with heavy firing. The 16"" barrel is also a great length to run a suppressor (silencer) because the overall length will be more compact than the 20"" barrel version. Additionally you have an adjustable gas system with a suppressor setting to allow for optimization while suppressed.

Choose the LWRCi  R.E.P.R over a 5.56 carbine if you need more penetration, range, accuracy, a more compact semi auto sniper system (SASS) and the need for more firepower than a bolt action rifle."

The LMT LM8 MWS is one of the most popular 308 ARs out there, for a good reason. The LMT is a switch barrel rifle capable of converting to multiple calibers with a change of the barrel only. The MWS platform allows you to quickly change from a 308 Winchester cartridge to a 6.5 Creedmoor by loosening two bolts, remove one and change the barrel. this is a 120 second operation at best.

The LMT MWSE is also the same type of rifle that is used for the British L129A1 Designated Marksman rifle. These rifles shoot very well with most chrome lined 16"" barrels grouping  around 1 MOA with match ammo. Many under.

Another benefit of the MWS is that it is a true monolithic upper, one forging of aluminum is used to create the upper and hand guard. This allows the top rail to be un- interrupted and the picatinny slots are dimensionally correct from one end to the other. Unlike most rifles that have to separate parts that can be dimensionally incorrect. This allows the use of conventional rings and mounts for higher power optics to be mounted anywhere on the hand guard without regard to placement. There is no gap or joint to take into consideration on the LMT LM8,

MWS barrels come in three lengths 16"" 18"" and 20"" many calibers also come in Stainless Steel for increased accuracy. Current barrels are available in .260 Remington, 243 Winchester, 338 Federal, .308 Winchester and 6.5 Creedmoor.

Almost all in clean or useable shape but a few have rusty hooks or chipped paint. Included are various weights, bobbers, jigs, tools, line, hooks and other stuff. There are quite a few items that were never removed from their package and some look very old. 2 tackle boxes, one very large grey/green fully loaded and the smaller brown one that has a cracked cover also full. I looked up the individual price of 30 of the older looking lures on ebay and found them to be worth $7 and up with a few being sold for $50 but I would really rather not deal with that many deliveries so I'm selling/trading them all at once for less. These belonged to an old doctor who spent a lot of time fishing so clearly they're lucky. All good stuff for local fishing, musky lures, walleye and bass mostly."

The first one, in the glass case. Gun is housed in special collections divisions in Tulsa and can be viewed by appointment only. Please email for an appointment.
One of the earliest cartridge Colts known to exist and now on the market...having MATCHING Serial number #2004. U.S. Marked. Comes from Lot 2 issued in 1873 This is an EXCEDDINGLY RARE piece of history, Issued to 6th cavalry to fight the Native Americans ""Possibly Little Big Horn"" Custer colt. This gun locks up and indexes perfect and has been tested with blanks. The fact that the barrell was cut to non-standard length is strong evidence it was taken by the Native Americans during a battle and modified as this was the common practice. As well as the holster having a strong Native influence hand made as well as the knife. The handle was checkered likely by a simple knife probably sitting around a camp fire back in the day. Having the badge from 6th cavalary also suggest it was taken by Natives after a kill as this was common to use for trade goods as well as a battle keep-sake to show bravery within the tribe. This gun was used!!! And if it could talk. 
The gun was taken to an expert smith and the screws were replaced during the cleaning and initial repair, but the original screws are now back in the gun. The gun was plum colored from age and after inspection and cleaning was put back to plum to preserve the original color..
The John Kopec letter states the history of this gun with much detail and John Kopec is the worlds leading colt expert having devoted his life to the study of this period colt revolver. 
Comes with period holster and knife and 1876 6th Cavalry badge and 6 period ammo rounds ""One round has an X carved on it"" Also comes with COA. Please feel free to ask any questions. This is a museum piece for the serious collector. Once again, this gun is housed in a special collections division and can be viewed by appointment only.

THE SECOND GUN is awesome too. 
This gun is housed in a special collections division in Tulsa, and can only be viewed by appointment only.
HERE IS YOUR CHANCE TO OWN A REAL PIECE OF THE WILD WEST. this colt 45 SAA once belonging to William Price AKA ""Tubby Price"" this gun shot a man over a dispute and the bottom of this pistol is clearly marked with an X to indicate it. Documentation of the shooting comes from the family as well as the picture of him taken in later years with it stuffed in his belt. This is REAL western history not the hollywood version. Also comes with the COA from colt.
colt 45 1896. numbers match. it shoots as it should.....yes im known to shoot it from time to time. Indexes well and all is as it should be. More pics located at www.MyPapasBarn.com in the gun section.

I have a slightly used, semi auto, Stoeger M2000 for sale. It has a 26 inch barrel w/ real tree camo. I just took it trap shooting for the 3rd time today and it shoots great. I also took it on my pheasant hunting trip to South Dakota and it worked great for that too. I've put about 350-400 rounds through it with no problems. Unfortunately I had to move more towards the city for my job and I'm not really going to have time to use it anymore. I would rather have it go to someone who will get some use out of it than collect dust in my gun case. 

I paid $480 for it on sale. I still have the original box, owners manual, and the 5 choke that it came with. The chokes include; Full, Modified, Improved Modified, Cylinder, Improved Cylinder. It takes 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells I clean my guns immediately after I go shooting, so the barrel is nice and clean. The only thing is that the stock is about a quarter of an inch shorter than I think it's suppose to be. There's a tiny gap between the stock and the magazine cap. You would have to look for it to actually notice it.

This is a great gun for someone that isn't looking to drop $1,500 on a shotgun. It shoots nice and smooth and gets the job done with no problems. 

I've seen these on armslist from $400-$500. I'm asking for $450 because it's barely been shot and comes with the box, owners manual, and all 5 choke tubes.

In excellent shape, comes with 2 13 round Beretta magazines, and has a steel guide rod instead of the factory polymer one.  This is the hard to find compact model so it has a shorter grip than the standard cougar but it will use the standard 15 round magazines as well.  About the same size as a Glock 19 but with a shorter grip, it carries surprisingly well.  This is a Stoeger Cougar, not a Beretta, they don't have Stoeger in the manufacturer listing. The only difference between these and a Beretta Cougar is the name on the slide.

Its in great shape and shoots very well.  I love it but I'm getting into reloading .40 so I would like to trade for a mid to full size handgun in .40 caliber.  I am ONLY looking for .40 caliber handguns.  I prefer hammer fired guns over striker, but doesnt have to be hammer fired.  I'd love to have this same gun in .40 but let me know what you have.  No Tauruses with the one possible exception being a PT 100.
I would also be interested in a 4-6"" barrel .357 magnum revolver.  Once again, no Tauruses (I already have a Taurus revolver).  Prefer Rugers, but let me know what you have.

I also have a large amount of 9mm ammo (500-700 rounds) that I can trade for .40 ammo or trade in place of cash for a higher value gun.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers.  Texts preferred as I sleep during the day but I will get back with you ASAP when I get up if I'm interested.
