This scope is perfect in every way.  Almost brand new, not a mark on it anywhere.  As you likely know, this scope uses NO BATTERIES EVER!  It collects light during the daytime through a fiber optic device to light the reticle.  It uses a radioactive Tritium capsule for illumination in dark conditions, all the way to complete darkness.  The model number is TA31H-G.  That means that it's a 4 power by 32mm objective lens unit that has the green Horseshoe reticle and BDC markings.  Comes with either the standard Trijicon picatinny rail mount or the upgraded LaRue mount that I bought at the same time.  I bought this unit in June of this year and have had it to the range three times.  I bought  separately a spare set of tethered adjuster caps as well as the Trijicon brand lens covers, which will be included.  Comes in the original Trijicon hardshell plastic box.  $750 OBO

If you email me or text Ill tell you all about them.
The Bullpup has had the most work put into her, It started of as a traditional SKS and modified heavily. I First took the clip off of it and modified it to accept extended magazines, I put in a new recoil spring (the old one was fine but I wanted to make sure it had a new one) . I decided to replace the receiver cover with a Texas Dog rail system and lighten the trigger. I also put on a short pin muzzle brake to reduce recoil...and because it makes it look bad ass when it shoots flames out the end. I then proceeded to put it in an Ati tactical stock with collapsible butt and added Knight's Armament Company rails to the front of the stock to ""beefin"" up the area in which I held the stock. I really liked the way it felt, very smooth shooter but when I seen the Cbrps Bullpup Stock I fell in love. I ordered it, put it on and shot it. I liked it but wanted the shell deflector taken off so I could leave the dog rail system on as a cheek rest.
Mac 11 9mm has some marks on her but shoots flawlessly,took it to shooters choice yesterday and shot a box through it without an issue. 

Mossberg 500 is a beauty, Ati adjustable stock with butt stock shell holder. Laser light combo and tru glo ghost ring sights on top. Put this together with a 18 1/2"" barrel and you have a great home protection gun.

It comes with 39 rounds of Federal FMJs and about 35 rounds of sketchy pawn-shop hollow-points (I fired a few of them and they work fine). Also included are two Remora In-the-Waistband holsters. One also has an ankle strap for ankle carry and sweat guard. 

It also comes with all the stuff included with a new Ruger: A lock with two keys, a tool to activate the trigger safety, a sticker (woohoo!), the manual for the gun and Lasermax, the first-fired shell, one magazine and optional pinky extension, and a dust cover."

Battle Born Tactics is going to show the American way and introduce a lower price and yet the same durability!

I ship (flat rate, postal service) anywhere in the country on your dime. Local pickup available and preferred. 

To answer some questions:
The brass has not been cleaned, but it isn't very dirty. A few minutes in a tumbler would have it looking spotless. 
Second,
45s are MOSTLY large pistol primer. Estimated that no more than 5% are small pistol primer. I cannot remove these, as I typically get north of 7,000 45s per week. 

For non-local orders, I accept Paypal and USPS money orders. I can accept a personal, bank, or cashiers' check, but this will need time to clear. For local orders, I can take a certified bank check, cashiers' check, money order, or ideally, cash. I do not accept personal checks for local pick-up unless you want to drop off the check and wait for it to clear to pick up the brass.

For any other questions, concerns, or to place an order, please send an email or call/text D. Hampton Phillips at 704 six four four 9134.

This is a Springfield Armory SAR-4800. Chambered for 5.56 .223, this is the more ""Politically Correct"" version of the SAR-48, Springfield's version of the world famous FN FAL. Rare – very few imported in the 5.56mm caliber (.223), receiver is also marked 1005-SA-48-Match made by Imbel Brazil under FN contract, imported by Springfield Armory . It has the original thumbhole stock and ""thread protector"", two items that kept the rifle legal following the infamous assault rifle ban. This is a first class weapon, much better in quality and reliability than many pieced together FAL rifles. It features an adjustable gas operated semi-automatic action. Condition is excellent with only a very few minor handling marks. There is no rust or pitting. I'd grade this rifle at 98%+. Less than 100 rounds fired. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is also excellent...bright with sharp rifling.

Comes in the original box and the following:
•	Three 30-round metal magazines with green followers
•	Bushnell Elite 3200 4-12x40 AO Riflescope - The Elite 3200 offers multi-coated optics for generous light transmission and crisp image quality. Exclusive, patented Rainguard lens coating reduces large drops of water to near-microscopic specks, dramatically increasing light transmission and resulting in a remarkably clear image in wet weather.
•	Tactical Bipod – Tactical /  Sniper Profile Adjustable Height
Have over $2,000 invested – sale price $1650 

Might trade for AR15 or similar tactical rifle or .308 long range rifle. If you have something to offer, let me know and let’s chat. 

If you cannot legal possess a weapon of this nature, please don’t contact me. I follow the laws of our State and Country.

This is a progressive press, capable of cranking out 12 gauge shells in volume. The press is in great working condition, and comes with a ton of different powder bushings. The only thing wrong with the press itself is that the bar which seats the primers is a little worn, and a small shim underneath the guide post (like a small piece of cardboard), is required to keep it from falling. It works just fine shimmed, otherwise a replacement is available from MEC for $12. Other than that there are no issues with the press.

In addition, I am including a BUNCH of reloading supplies. I have nearly 75 pounds of shot included - 1 25lb bag of #8 shot, 1 25lb bag of #8.5 Shot, and a nearly full 25lb bag of shot of an unknown size. In addition, I have 1000 Federal Shotshell primers, 1 pound of Clay's powder, about 1300 hulls (1000 Claybuster), and an absolute MOUNTAIN of empty hulls and boxes to put them in. I'm not sure how many hulls I have, but it is probably well over 2000.

I am only selling because I am moving to Milwaukee and will no longer have room for this setup. As most people are aware, just the powder, primers, and shot are extremely difficult to get right now as well.

It has a Zev Tech Fulcrum Trigger, with adjustable pre-travel and over travel, and can be adjusted from a 2 lb. trigger pull up to a 6 lb. trigger pull, and has 50% less trigger reset travel than stock. It's currently set up at 3.0 lbs. and average pre-travel for everyday carry. It has a Zev-Tech stainless steel polished skeletonized striker with a 4lb. Striker spring, and marine cups. It has a KKM Precision match grade barrel that was match fitted by KKM. It has a Tungsten Recoil double spring assembly that's 5x heavier than the factory polymer recoil assembly, and 2x heavier than a stainless recoil assembly. It really does reduce muzzle flip and recoil. It has a Zev Tech ejector housing with adjustable over travel, and a Lightning Strike polished titanium safety plunger with a reduced power safety plunger spring. It has a Ghost Evo 3.5 lb. connector with a 6lb. Trigger spring. Also has +1 Pearce Grip extensions on all 3 mags, and a Vickers Tactical Tango Down mag release, and slide catch. I also installed Trijicon night sights on it, and I have all the factory parts that I replaced to go with it. You can truly tell a huge difference in this gun and shooting a stock Glock. The mods aren't necessary, but are well worth the money if you want a nicer glock. If you are looking for a stock Glock this gun isn't for you. It's for the guy who wants a Glock that is heads and tails better than any other polymer frame pistol out there right now. It shoots amazingly, and has the best trigger of any gun I've shot that wasn't a $2,000.00 or more 1911, and I've shot them all. It's basically all the upgrades and match grade parts you find in a $2,000.00 1911, but in a Glock Platform. I'm just ready to move on, and build something else."

813,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2049813,For Sale:  H-S Precision Pro Series  2000 .308 Winchester Tactical / Target Rifle,"North, San Antonio, Texas","$ 1,995","Listed On: Wednesday, August 28, 2013",Rifles,no type,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a semi-custom HS Precision Pro Series 2000 Tactical / Target rifle in .308 Winchester. It has a 26 inch, cut -rifled, straight contour, 1.2 inch diameter at the muzzle bull barrel with a 1 in 12 twist. It's designed specifically to shoot 168 grain match ammo.  It might indeed handle 175 grainers but I've never shot them, but the specs ordered on chambering and twist were at the time, designed to optimize shooting 168 grainers.     Anyway, the barrel is actually stainless steel but has a Teflon-type exterior coating. I forgot the exact trade name HS Precision uses for it, but it's definitely a stainless barrel, not blued chrome moly. It has the HS Precision tactical stock in olive green with the aluminum bedding block.  Overall weight with scope is 15.5 pounds.   It has  a detachable muzzle break as well, which is a $ 220 added charge these days.  This rifle is essentially an earlier version of what they market these days as their  ""HS Precision HTR (heavy tactical rifle)"" with the only difference being that these days, they flute the barrel and ship them with detachable box magazines, whereas mine has an internal box magazine and is not fluted. But I'm an old school bench rest shooter, and so frankly, fluting looks cool, we all admit that,  but whether it really does add accuracy to the barrel is very much debatable. The last I'll say on this before I get hate mail from fluted barrel fans, is that  you don't really see many guys with fluted barrels shooting benchrest competitions...  Anyway, this rig shoots 1/2 MOA @ 100 yards all day long with Federal 168 grain match ammo and Hornady 168 grain match ammo, and I have shot many one-hole 3 shot groups with this thing.  Handloads have this shooting 1/4 MOA consistently and makes it a real competition worthy rig. As of now, I only have about 650-700 rounds through it, even though I've had it for years, which means it actually has several thousand rounds of good barrel life to it, and is still a very young barrel.  My only criticism of this rifle is the trigger, which is a bit rough and sticky for spoiled bench gun shooters like myself who get used to 2 ounce Jewell triggers on their bench guns. But for a tactical rifle in tactical applications where hair triggers are not appropriate, the trigger pull is correct, with slight stacking, probably measures out around 2.5 -3.25 pounds.  So if someone wanted to use this solely as a bench gun, it just takes some trigger work and you are there.  HS Precision charges about 3,600 for these rifles new these days, plus 220 for the muzzle break, then taxes and shipping, and you'd still have to wait at least 6 months to get one.  Mine is available at basically half that and can be had immediately.  Rifle can be sold with or without the Leupold scope, let me know what you want to do. It's a 6.5 x 20 x 50 on there right now.  And only reason I'm selling this is because I have a new, fully custom bench gun these days, and until I hit the Lotto, I just cant keep ALL my toys from days past:   sometimes things have  to go to pay for others, as much as it hurts ."

Never Fired! Mint Condition!

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

I also lightly polished all contact points in the trigger parts (gave it a trigger job).. so now it runs even better, and mags drop free, and it isn't as much of a pain to disassemble/disassemble.

THE STORY BEHIND OUR PRODUCT! BEST AND CHEAPEST ON THEMARKET! My partner and I are both preppers, and huge gun people. Weboth decided we wanted to purchase armor for our entire family. So we bothbought molle vests with ar500 steel on ebay, we both paid 220.00 shipped whichwe though was a good deal…. We got the vests and noticed there were some thingswe didn’t like about the armor, and though we could do better. So here is our product! The main things wedidn’t like about other peoples products are as fallows. The ar500 steel was 3/8 or ½ inch whichnormally would be a good thing but the molle vest with plates weighted 43lbs.that’s way to heavy and the thickness of the steel is over kill, also everyonejust spray painted there plates, the bend on the steel was uncomfortable, andlastly there were no videos backing up there product! Just words basicallysaying “take our word for it!” also all tests were done at 100 yards!Everything about our product is amazing, its light weight ¼ inch ar500 mil specsteel which is perfect!, our steel is professionally powder coated, also ourvest plates have 3 break bends in them instead of 2 for more comfort and sideround deflection, and best of all we made youtube videos of us shooting outproduct over and over and over with.308, 762x39 and .223 at 25 YARDS! See you tube video links below or search“patriot body armor” on youtube search bar. Also out plan was too sell thishere in reno , nv and also the internet. We sold out so fast intown and in thegun shops that this is the first time we have offered out product online. The goalwas to make a better, lighter, cheaper way to outfit our family with protectionas you should. Mission accomplished. We are offering these back packs dirtcheap, and the last of our vests will also be listed on ebay soon and that’s itfor us. Get it while you can. check out of videos and pictures to see theproof, get a couple for your family put them in the closet and call it a day,the fact that you know you and your family is covered if the bad guy gets thedrop on you and yours.

Also has after merket accutrigger grip for perfect trigger pull every shot.
Great gun, Have had great fun shooting it but just like a 338 that I just sold here, I need the cash as of late more than I need the rifle at this time. Not desperate enough to take low ballers so please don't contact me with a price you know wont fly, I will not reply. 

All invested this rifle cost me $3100 for everything  all new and has only been out a few times. Those times were flawless and smooth. Found a piece of land and tested her at around 600yds a lil less and had right around  6in groupings.  All around great rifle and a joy to shoot and proud to own. 

Rifle,Optics and extra rounds to get you started or add to your collection Only Asking $2400 will take possible trade plus cash but we must meet around the 2k mark for cash. 
No straight across trades/Cash=2krange plus trade ok/ if buyer is ready to buy now I will knock off a couple hundred for quick sale. Otherwise if she sits the previous deal sticks and if nothing at all I am happy to put her back in the safe where I would much rather have her at! 

Thanks for reading- contact if interested- as said before will knock off some of the price for a speedy buyer ready to invest in the rifle."
