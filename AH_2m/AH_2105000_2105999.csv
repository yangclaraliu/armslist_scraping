Product Description
Rossi now offers medium frame revolvers built to the same quality and reliability standards that have been part of the Rossi name for over 100 years. Rossi revolvers are machined from forged steel and will routinely fire the powerful rounds for a lifetime. Each handgun features deep, contoured finger grooves in the grip for a solid grasp and maximum shooting comfort. All Rossi Revolvers have the lifetime repair policy, as well as the patented Taurus Security System, a simple, integral locking device that allows the firearm to be secured by use of a special key. The Model 972 is a heavy-duty stainless steel revolver that fires .357 Magnum rounds. The 6-inch barrel helps reduce recoil and the adjustable rear sight along with a red ramp front sight help further ensure accuracy.

UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS (HB 13-1229)

Background Check Requirement

Under the new law, before any person who is not a licensed gun dealer transfers possession of a firearm, he or she must arrange for a licensed dealer to obtain the required background check. In obtaining the background check, the dealer must follow all procedures that it would follow were it transferring the firearm in a retail transaction, including recording the transfer, retaining the records, and complying with all state and federal laws. The dealer must provide a copy of the background check results and the Bureau's approval or disapproval to the transferor and intended transferee, and may charge a fee of up to $10.

A prospective transferee may not accept possession of the firearm until after the transferor has obtained the Bureau's approval, nor may he or she knowingly provide false information to the transferor or licensed gun dealer for the purpose of acquiring a firearm. Bureau approval of a firearm transaction is valid for 30 calendar days. A person who transfers a firearm in violation of the law may be held jointly and severally liable for any civil damages caused by the transferee's subsequent use of the firearm."

85 rds mixed Ball, mostly 1950's British production.
18 rds tracer cases with Israeli 7.62 AP black tip over cordite. (I would not fire these, recover projectile for use in 7.62x51 reloads)

This was all from Sarco (except for the black tip) years ago when they got to the bottom of their pile of .303 Surplus.

I've fired some of these over the years. Ball was all decent ammo, none of the Pakistani delayed ignition stuff. The tracers were about 50/50 light/no light, but all went bang.

This ammunition is pushing 70 years old, so expect some tarnishing,  marks, and occasional neck splits on cases of this vintage.  Should you choose to shoot this ammo, it is corrosively primed and the tracer element on the tracer rounds poses a potential fire risk down range, so exercise extreme caution. 

FTF Cash sale only in Fridley or Burnsville.

Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Transition sights,"Penrose, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 100,"Listed On: Saturday, May 10, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. Designed by Barry Dueck—Director of SureFire's Suppressor Division and a top 3-Gun shooter—these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly—a gunfight.

From their website:

""The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged.  Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians.

The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing.  What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile.  This profile, in conjunction with our Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.""

I would consider trades (plus some cash) for an M&P 9c. I am located in Southeast Virginia and would prefer a f2f transaction for cash or USPS money order, but would be willing to ship it (at your expense) so long as you have a dealer who can accept the firearm from me directly. This is a very nice rifle, it has never been fired and has been in the safe since I purchased it. I intended to use it as a patrol rifle and originally outfitted it with optics and a vertical grip, but I have since grown fond of the previous one I have been using for the last several years so this is now up for sale. I left on it a Mako Magwell grip, Ergo grip rail covers and a VTAC sling - other than that it is factory issue. I paid considerably more than the asking price for it and believe this a more than reasonable price for this firearm. This rifle has a half-quad free float barrel (very unique if you have not seen it), flip up front and rear sights, Ergo grip, a chrome lined barrel, a mid-length gas system, a tactical muzzle break, a rock river arms two-stage triger and winter triger guard. It comes with the hard case it was shipped in from Rock River Arms. I did the best I could with the picture but it does not do it justice. It is really a nice AR. I will try to get some better pictures and at that time additional photos can be emailed if requested. There is not a mark on this rifle and it is literally in better condition (with the add-ons) than it was when it came from the factory. I can best be reached via email at REDACTED

These Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads were designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for defense against humans. Both loads feature light weight, hollow nosed bullets, designed to mushroom dramatically at the intended impact velocities. Item # 4H will perform on humans much like our DEER GRENADE load (Item # 4F) performs on game animals. The light-for-caliber weight of these bullets, aids in reduced felt recoil, for faster follow-up shots. We've employed flash suppressed powders but, with any bullet moving this fast from typical length revolvers, there is still a decent flash in low light.

Both of these loads will also work well on light, big game such as whitetail deer.

Both of these loads are safe to use in ALL/ANY 44 mag. firearm that is in normal operating condition.

Note our real world velocities taken from my personal stock firearms. We prefer to establish our advertised velocities from over-the-counter, stock firearms, while most ammunition companies establish their published velocities from laboratory, long, test barrels, which provide false or exaggeratedly high readings. We feel that this long established practice does not give the customer a true idea of what the ammunition is doing when fired from 'real world guns' under 'real world conditions,' where these numbers really do matter.

 I have never fired the gun since I purchased it earlier this year. It comes with 3 magazines and 2 Pearce grip extensions, 1 is a plus zero extension to just extend the grip and the other is the plus 1 extensions that gives you an extra round.

 It also has the original case, lock, cleaning brush, fired shell casing and all paperwork.

 This is the smallest Glock 45 ACP you can buy, great for CCW."

At the moment I'm especially interested in high caliber pistols/revolvers.
1911 full parts kit minus the frame.
One or two good working 10/22 hi-cap mags.
Always interested in military firearms. Russian bolt guns to AK's. Parts kits, broken or fully working guns. Old parts changed out of guns. If you've got something interesting let me know.
Any broken/old/rusty/malfunctioning guns laying around or passed down anyone wants to sell for the right price. I like to tinker and strip the parts or refurbish.

Trades possible for things I have and don't want to shoot anymore. Other than that I'm in the mood to buy something new. It's been a few months.

My friend also wants a Jericho 941/Baby Eagle/Uzi Eagle or a full Desert Eagle. Maybe something of that sort will strike his fancy. He's willing to pay or he has an AK I built he'd probably trade. It's a mixed parts gun that's definitely a born again blaster and not a collecter piece. We've put a couple hundred rounds through it out of 40rd mags and it works great.

I am joining the Air Force and am looking to sell my FEG AMD-65, which is a tanker version of an AK-47. It has a 2-tone Cerakote finish, and the rifle was bought new from a dealer in St. Pete less than 2 years ago and has under 200rds through it. It comes with 4 Tapco mags, 170rds of Tula 7.62x39mm ammo, and the original cleaning kit that came with the gun. The only thing I don't have for it is the FEG box it came in. With ammo prices so high I haven't shot the gun since this winter, and before that was probably another 6 months before that. This is one of my favorite rifles but I simply don't want it sitting around through my 2 years of training and not being used. I have seen similar rifles without the Cerakote go for around 900-$1000, and with the ammo and everything else I'm asking $900 OBO. Don't be afraid to send me a reasonable offer. . My name is Sam and please feel free to contact me at anytime at REDACTED or by email. I prefer someone with a CCP license and to meet in a public place. I live in the Tampa area but will drive if my gas is paid for. Thanks for looking."
