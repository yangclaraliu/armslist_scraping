The Judge has a very small tear in the rubber grip, but because of the design of the gun it doesn't affect the feel of the gun at all. Shoots great, very powerful, easy to keep clean and super fun! MSRP is usually close to $600 depending on retailer, but because ive fired it quite a bit and the grip laceration im letting it go for $400/O.B.O.
     The .38 s&w is a CTG model, and Ive been told was a service pistol for police in the early 1990s but im not sure. Its really sturdy. Has a good solid feel, easy to keep clean and maintain, and is a good addition to any revolver collection. Got a few scratches but that's about it. Guns aren't made to be Pretty!!! Id like to sell both in kind of a package deal, but the .38 alone can go for $300. 
They both have ammo, but not much. Ive got about 15 .45 Long Colts but no .410 shells for the judge. The .38 has about 20 rounds.

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

Brand new never used, I only have two I need to unload and they have consecutive low range serial numbers (below 0050). PSA mil-spec lpks installed and include takedown pin assbly parts for when you mount the stock/buffer kit of your choice.

These are blem receivers, as indicated by the cool serial number prefix ""BLEM00"". Both have a couple indentations below the anodized surface that do not affect fit or function. I built two a couple rifles on receivers from this batch already, and all parts fit and function flawlessly. I mated them with aero precision upper receivers and they fit perfectly tight for me, no wobble in the union.   I was going to build em all, but ran out of money to fund any more projects.

One receiver for $125, or take the pair for $245.
Accept cash, pp, USPS money order.
Prefer face to face with PA resident with basic bill of sale for my protection. If you aren't comfortable providing me PA license or ccp number, sorry.  Will also ship to ffl of your choice for $10.

Rifle Case $620.00 OBO

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle.

For a pistol to be worn all day in town or in the field, the belt, holster, and ammo pouch must be sized and all work together as a unit. This belt will last decades and maintain it’s strength and support. We recommend 1.75″ for most applications. This is the American standard belt width for Carhartts, Levis, Wranglers, BDU/ACUs, et cetera. If you wear a suit, the loops are generally 1.5"". All belts come with a leather keeper. The solid brass buckle is held on with ""Chicago Screws"" and can be easily replaced with your own buckle. SRH makes their belts (For Real Women as well) to accommodate wearing a holster and ammo pouches. The 1.75"" belts are wide, thick belts; you will have to work them through each loop of your jeans.

Guys: if you have over a 48"" waist measurement, we highly recommend a 1.75"" belt. This will avoid the ""kite string"" around the grain sack effect. The wider belt will be far more comfortable for you.

Made from oil tanned, oxblood colored harness leather, or black; these belts are made from a single, thick piece of saddle skirting.

Description
VX-3L riflescopes combine the low-light performance of a larger objective VX-3 with a revolutionary design that hugs the barrel of your rifle. You'll be amazed at the exceptional low-light performance and more natural cheek weld in your VX-3L, the ultimate low-light riflescope. 

Features:

- The Light Optimization Profile allows your large objective VX-3L to hug the barrel, for the more natural cheek weld of a much smaller objective riflescope. Mount your 50mm VX-3L as low as a traditional 36mm riflescope! 
- Your sight picture remains perfectly circular, with crisp, edge-to-edge sharpness across the entire visual field. 
- The Xtended Twilight Lens System optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available. 
- DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on exterior lens surfaces provide the highest level of scratch resistance Leupold has ever offered. 
- The twin bias spring exerts up to 30 percent more holding force on the erector, virtually eliminating erector system backlash and stress on the vital internal workings of the scope, for longer life. 
- Blackened lens edges reduce light diffusion, so more usable light reaches the shooter's eye, for a brighter image with increased contrast. 
- Most VX-3L models available with the Leupold Ballistics Aiming System for more accurate long-range shooting. 
- Duplex Reticle
- Matte Black 
- Finger-adjustable, cryogenically treated, ¼-MOA click windage and elevation adjustments with resettable pointer dials marking the zero point. (6.5-20x56mm model features 1/10-MOA click adjustments) 
- Tactile power indicator also features built-in range estimation functions and graphite O-rings for easy operation. 
- Internally threaded, lockable, extreme fast-focus eyepiece with Alumina rubber eyepiece guard. 
- Illuminated models feature second generation LED technology, nearly twice as bright as previous models, with multiple intensity settings for precise shot placement in low-light situations. 
- A durable Leupold Scope Cover is included to protect your valuable VX-3L riflescope during transport or when not in use. 
- Incredibly rugged, with absolute waterproof integrity using Leupold's proprietary Argon/Krypton gas blend. 
- As a final touch to the VX-3L, Leupold mounts a 24k gold-plated ring and medallion to each scope. 
- Covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee.

They are police trade-in's and I think they only come with one magazine or at least mine did. The gen 4's were a little more than that I believe but in nice condition. Most of the guns have nights sights. I bought a 26 from them for $373 and change out the door. Way cheaper than what everyone is selling them for on here. Just thought I would pass it along for the people who are really interested in getting a Glock and are sick of seeing these prices that are the same as MSRP or higher for a USED gun. The 26 I bought was priced at $399.99 on the tag but I was only charged $349.99. I don't know if it was a mistake or not but I was more than happy with that. They have a few that look really nice and most have some holster wear but it's a Glock so that shouldn't matter. They has some 19's, 22's, a 27, and a 26. I am not sure if there were any others.

""The Mini-14/20GB featured a flash suppressor and a bayonet lug. A ""Target Rifle"" version with a heavy barrel, adjustable harmonic dampener[8] and target stock was introduced in 2006. While never adopted by the U.S. military, both civilian and military Mini-14 variants are popular with many police departments as an affordable medium-range patrol rifle to fill the gap between short-range weapons (handguns and shotguns) and sniper rifles. Newer models have a 16.12"" barrel (1:9"" RH twist rate) with flash suppressor, and are available with a standard fixed stock/forend, or a collapsible ATI brand stock with Picatinny rails.[9] This rifle is marked on the receiver as ""Tactical Rifle"". It is very similar to the ""Ranch"" model except for the ""bird cage"" flash suppressor, folding stock, and shorter barrel. This model will chamber both .223 Remington and 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition."""

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these  varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century.

The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle  family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics.

Characteristics:

    Bull pup configuration.
    Optimized ergonomic design.
    30 Rds. Magazine capacity.
    Body built of high strength impact modified polymer.
    Detachable barrel.
    Integrated reflex sight directly attached on to the barrel.
    Conversion from day optics to night optics is done without the need of re-zeroing.
    100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy.
    Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry.
    Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs.
    Folding back-up sights that include tritium for night combat.
    Very easy field striping into 2 parts.
    100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system.
    Equipped with a  last round stopper.
    All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant.
    Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing. 

Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to posses the following significant operational advantages:
• Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure.
• Superior reliability under extreme conditions.
• Uninterrupted day-to-night switch without re-zeroing.
• Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use.
• Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy.
• Right and left handed operability.

I can provide pics upon request. The Lower has only ever been hand cycled and was built in pistol configuration before being converted to a rifle, so you can remove the stock and put an upper on it that is less than 16"" legally, as long as the stock is removed!  It is in rifle configuration now but you DO NOT have to use a pistil buffer tube to convert it back to pistol config. It has never been fired, other than dry-fired to check function and mated to an upper to check fit... It is TIGHT.  This deal also comes with 10 MOE Pmags, bran new, all but one of them are still sealed in their packaging... the one that is open was just used to check the lower's function. I will throw in a 50cal ammo can, which is also bran spankin new!

-Lower is multi-cal compatible, marked for safe/fire. Has PSA logo. NOT a blemished lower. 
-mags drop free as they should.
-Built as a pistol first, listed as ""other"" on FFL.
-LPK is NOT the PTAC model, it is their higher-end phosphate coated LPK.
-Has MOE trigger guard and Blackhawk pistol grip
-6-pos stock and mil-spec buffer tube and buffer.
-Trigger breaks at a clean and crisp 5lbs
-Safety selector is very positive and smooth, not gritty and sloppy like 90% of the cheepo brands.

Price is FIRM. I am only selling this because I bought several when the prices were low(ish) but I have decided I need to finish other projects. I see a whole lotta price jacking going on so I am going to be 100% upfront about this deal; I paid $250 (not including shipping and FFL fee) for just the parts and lower and $150 for the mags and ammo can! This is your chance to snag a good deal. As you can see, I am not making any money... I am loosing money in fact. Shipping, Tax, and FFL fee was about $40 iirc."

EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Several great reasons to purchase AA .22 LR conversion kit:
1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 
2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.
3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 
4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.
5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice."

For sale only is a nearly new Ruger GP100 in 357 magnum. Fixed sight 3"" model. Born on date of January 2013. I am the only owner and have put less than 500 rounds through this one. It is a great shooter! Package includes the revolver with Pachmayr rubber grips, a set of old school two tone Ruger grips and 35 factory rounnds of assorted jacketed 357 mag ammunition. The revolver came to me with the big Hogue grips but those were my least favorites and went with a prior GP100 sale. I will even throw in a brand new Outbags nylon holster when I receive it in the mail. Hate to sell this one but must move some out before new ones come in. If you are a GP100 fan or just want a rock solid piece tht will last a lifetime then this is the one.
