The serial number is 567,983, “B” lever boss code, manufactured in Chicopee Falls. It has the typical 99 features that made these a popular rifle; brass rotary carrier, cartridge counter, cocking indicator & a locking lever. These can be safely carried de-cocked with a live round in the chamber. Mechanically sound; functions correctly, the bore is excellent, bright, shiny with no frosting & the action is smooth & crisp. The rifle is numbers matching; receiver, forearm, butt stock & butt plate. The barrels on these were not serialized but the barrel address is correct for a 1950 gun. The stocks are walnut with nice grain & finish. Schnabel forearm, pistol grip with cap & hand cut checkering (the EG Model was checkered after 1940). There are no cracks or repairs, just minor handling marks & the checkering is still fairly sharp. The barrel retains almost all of its original bluing, the receiver & lever have turned a light Patina. There are no rust or pitting issues, no dings or dents, just minor handling marks. The receiver is tapped for a scope it must have once wore. The Savage 99 is a great hunting rifle with some nice features & the .300 Savage is a great round. I am the second owner. The first owner was a gentleman from the state of Washington. He purchased it in 1950 after serving in WW II. This was his personal hunting rifle for many years, but not fired often. He turned 85 recently and I purchased it. It has not been fired for over 20 years. New box of ammo goes with it."

This is a minimalist 1911 done right - it has standard GI sights, standard grip safety, Magpul Industries grip panels and a Wilson Combat extended slide release. I will also send the pistol with a soft case, two magazines, a box of 50  FMJ rounds, a serpa paddle holster and an extra set of hogue finger groove grips.  This isn't a pistol for the boring range goer with a collection of safe queens, this is for the man or woman that carries a pistol daily and developes a relationship with their weapon.  This 1911 is super reliable, and has eaten every type of ammo I've given it with a smile, and asked for more, including every type of hollowpoint I could find. The slight holster wear, adds to the character of the pistol, and shows that it has been loved and carried often.  This is a single owner gun, which has been maintained by myself - a US Marine. If you know one of us, you know how serious we are about weapons maintenance, and should find peace concerning the care of this 1911.

This gun is easily a sub .50"" MOA shooter at 100 yards and can be taken easily to 600. See picture of 5 round group at 50 yards. I was using good old fashioned 55gr HPR store bought ammo. With handloads you will see extremely tight groups at distance. I am almost $3000 into this rifle setup and expect a fair amount for the extremely high quality parts put into this rifle.  Will sell gun alone for $1700."

It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. MSRP OVER $500.

It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels.

This is a super lightweight model weighing only 6 lbs!  Most rifles this size can weigh anywhere from 9 to 12 lbs and more depending on what is attached and this is only 6 lbs with the red dot attached.  The saved weight makes a huge difference when either carrying it around for any extended period of time, or when trying to speed up your movement and shooting.  I've used some rifles where my arms get tired and start to sway while aiming, but this rifle feels very easy to use and shoot.  

The handguard, grip, and stock have all been changed to Magpul parts in tan (FDE), which not only gives it a cool two tone look, but makes this rifle a very solid and light platform that is a pleasure to shoot.  This model is the optics ready carbine which leaves out the clumsy A2 style front sight base which leaves your sight picture clear of any obstructions.  Because of this I am selling it with the red dot sight in the pictures, as it is meant to be used with some kind of optic. 

This rifle features a true 5.56 NATO barrel which accepts both military 5.56 NATO and commercial .223 Remington ammunition. If you want to be able to shoot both, don't be fooled by some AR15's that shoot only the civilian commercial .223 only!  The 1/9 twist also means you can shoot the cheaper 55gr ammo as well as the match grade ammo (70gr +) with accurate results.

Rifle comes with a Red Dot Sight, 30 round magazine , and a soft case.

Less than 200 rounds through it. Serious inquiries only; Cash only. I am not interested in any trades either. 

Thanks you."

I am the original purchaser and have taken meticulous care of it. The Duratouch coating is 99% intact (I'd say 100% but I am sure there is something somewhere I can't see). I am also including two extra turkey chokes pictured, both NIB.

I have shot nothing but target loads with this, mostly Remington Gun Club. It's never failed once. The self adjusting gas system, which is designed to handle anything from target loads to heavy field loads, is as reliable as can be. Round count on the 26"" barrel is probably about 1000, which is basically nothing for a shotgun. The 28"" barrel has zero shots through it.

This is a gorgeous shotgun, I am just not going to get to it these days. Pictures are below.

There is nothing wrong with this crossbow I just discovered that I like the compound bow more. It comes with 7 Wicked Ridge aluminum arrows 3 of which have never been shot. Only 6 field points though. It is the premium package with the TenPoint 3x multi line scope, rope cocking aid (not a tenpoint one) and the sling. This thing is a beast and you won't find better quality for the money. I took one deer with it. Rated at 300 FPS, 84 FP KE with a 175 lb draw per the Wicked Ridge web site. I never chronographed it myself. With extra arrows I paid $450. Will let it go for $350."

First, the Sightmark is brand new, I bought it and decided it wasn't going to fit my needs. It features 4 reticles and a quick detach mount. It comes with the box, the neoprene sleeve and paperwork.  Second, the Moe buttstock was pulled off of a new rifle when I bought it, it is black. The ACS stock has about 70 rounds of use, it also has the enhanced rudder pad installed, it is flat dark earth. All three are awesome products and well worth the money.

Will consider trades + cash, especially for a nice .223 bolt gun w/ scope. No low-balling please. I put too much time and effort into building a solid rifle to bother with nonsense. 

I built this Foliage Green AR15 for easy, fun, accurate shooting with a free float handguard, polished trigger group with 4.5lb springs and a VLTOR A5 long-stroke, heavy buffer system. It is dead reliable, fires both brass and steel-cased ammo without issue and hits wherever you point the Primary Arms red dot.

Album with more pictures and descriptions: http://imgur.com/a/8dWQZ#0

UPPER HALF: 

• Aero Precision 7075 forged Aluminum, phosphated upper receiver
• ICE Arms 16"" Mid-length, 5.56 NATO chamber, 416 Stainless Steel barrel with 1/7 twist and .082"" gas port.
• ICE Arms Nitrided Bolt Carrier Group, Full-Auto profile, BCM Extractor Upgrade Kit to ensure reliable extraction and ejection. Nitride coating is both harder and smoother than standard Manganese Phosphate for more reliable cycling and easier cleaning. 
• Head Down Products Provectus 13"" free-float handguard. Multiple picatinny rails, key mod slots and QD sockets all around with a solid mounting system. Beefier than other free float hand guards and it feels sturdy. One of the best moderately-priced hand guards currently available.
• Noveske NSR Foliage Green rail covers
• Magpul Foliage Green ladder rail cover on top
• Noveske NSR 5-slot Keymod rail section
• Magpul Foliage Green Rail Vertical Grip (easily removed if desired)
• Mil-Spec A2 flash hider
• BCM Gunfighter Mod3 (large latch) charging handle for easy, one-handed bolt manipulation. 
• VLTOR A5 receiver extension. About 1"" longer than a standard carbine buffer tube, it allows you to use VLTOR heavy buffers and a rifle-length spring to create the smooth, easy cycling of a full-length rifle setup while still fitting inside an adjustable carbine stock. 
• VLTOR H2 5.3oz heavy buffer
• DPMS rifle-length return spring. 
• Palmetto State Armory M4-style stock. People like to try different stocks and it's one of the better M4 stocks available, so I stuck with what works.
• Primary Arms Micro Red Dot with QD mount. Fantastic Red Dot sight. Holds zero, stays on tight and has great clarity. 

LOWER HALF: 

• Anderson Arms 7075 forged Aluminum, phosphated lower receiver with integral trigger guard. 
• ALG QMS ""tuned by Geissele"" polished fire control group (trigger, hammer, disconnector and pins). Noticeably smoother than a mil-spec trigger with a crisp break.
• JP Enterprises ""Reliability Enhanced"" Reduced Power Trigger Spring Kit. Yellow trigger spring and red hammer spring gives a slightly lighter trigger pull than mil-spec (around 4.5lbs) for more consistent groups. 
• Joe Bob Outfitters lower parts kit. Standard mil-spec parts: pins, springs, detents magazine catch, button, safety selector, etc. 
• BCM Gunfighter Mod3 Grip. Grippy texture without any rubbery material and a vertical angle that's more natural for modern ""tucked in,"" elbow down stances. 

I did not install any iron sights on this rifle because people tend to be picky about which sights they like and the red dot worked fine for target shooting. 

Rifle will come with Primary Arms Micro Red Dot, 5 30rd Foliage Green Windowed PMags, and a Midway USA Flat Dark Earth soft case. 

Asking $1000 firm. Will consider trades + cash, but prefer at least some cash because I just bought a house. Call, text or email; must be KY or IN resident with valid ID.

The TaylorMade Burner Plus Iron Set offers no. 3 through no. 9 as well as the pitching wedge, sand wedge, lob wedge, and approach wedge, enabling golfers to make short work of difficult courses.This golf club set offers a variety of beneficial features. The wide, beveled soles of the iron set create a bigger area from which to generate a powerful strike, while the longer-than-average shafts improve a golfer’s overall posture. A high moment of inertia (MOI) is created by perimeter weighting and that, combined with the deep center of gravity, allows even a novice to hit a golf ball accurately over an increased distance. Furthermore, ball speed and precision are increased by the Inverted Cone technology in the clubface.The TaylorMade Burner Plus Iron Set not only offers all of the above, but also sports a lightweight shaft set and flexible grips to make the golfer’s game even more productive. Any golfer, young or old can learn to make distance a part of his or her everyday golfing game. Flexible and ProfessionalBuilt for distance, the TaylorMade golf club offers a steel shaft with excellent energy transfer on the clubface. An excellent option for golfers who want to take their game to the next level, the clubs are available in both left- and right-handed designs, and offer a choice of Regular, Uniflex, and Stiff flex shafts depending on the player’s needs.The Regular flex TaylorMade shaft is well suited to individuals who tend to hit their drivers around 190 yards to 210 yards on the course. Uniflex shafts fall between Regular and Stiff, so they are best used by individuals whose drives range between 210 and 230 yards, whereas Stiff flex shafts are better handled by golfers with drives averaging more than 230 yards. Other factors in choosing flex include swing style and direction. Smooth swingers benefit from softer flexes no matter how quickly they drive, whereas individuals who tend to drive left often find that firmer flex shafts suit them better than softer flex ones.High-Tech DesignGolf has come a long way from its roots in 16th-century Scotland, and so has the equipment. Modern clubs are designed to deliver the utmost precision and to simplify the game for amateurs and experts alike. The Inverted Cone golf club is a worthwhile investment that will stand the test of time and be ready to introduce a new generation to the game of golf.Suitable for novice players who are still learning the finer points of the game and highly experienced professionals alike, the TaylorMade Burner Plus Iron Set has a satisfying sweet spot on every club and a very forgiving nature. Turf drag is no problem here; easier shots mean a much more enjoyable day on the course, as well as a better overall score. Furthermore, vibration and sound are dampened by the vibration-management cavity badge on each of the irons, making the clubs even more effective. The lack of vibration in the clubs will also be appreciated by golfers with bad backs and older individuals who want their drives to remain stable despite the constraints of a more mature body. In fact, golfers often find that the longer length of the shafts mean they hold their spines at a straighter angle, leading to a much more comfortable and productive swing.For golfers looking to improve their game without sacrificing style or compromising on value, the Inverted Cone golf club is an exceptional choice. Casual golfers as well as more dedicated players can improve their trajectory, swing, and strike. The consistently good reviews are a testament to the quality of the set, as well."

Best trigger I've ever felt.

I say it's the best because fit, finish and reliability.. The slide racks like butter, you feel like robocop when you hold this and the way it spits out shell casings you know it'll never fail on you. Also compared to a 380 of mine the recoil is less with this .40, the rotating barrel system eliminates any problems with recoil you can shoot and hole punch all day with this gun. Highly outperformed my S&W M&P

Reason for sale: I Don't want to sell this but I owe money, I'm lefty which doesn't really bother me but to fully commit I'd want the slide release ambidextrous and most importantly I bought a few guns looking for a carry gun and this one is a little too big for me to hip carry in the summer. I'd rate it as the best home defense pistol available, awesome range gun and probably concealable with a good holster but my snubby sits on my hip better. I'd also rate it up there as one of the best looking pistols.

$450 is all I'm asking, no tax, fees, just a local pick up for $450 (also will trade for a compact px4)

I'm looking to sell my SKS.  It has a 16"" barrel. The numbers on the gun match on all components including the factory clip. It has 0146 on the left side of the receiver and the Chinese writing next to it.  It has Made in China with the importer name and caliber next to it.  

It will come with the factory clip, soft case, and one old/worn out 40 round P mag.  I DO NOT have any other stocks or accessories.  From my research this was a Type 56 made for the military and not a gun that was made for export.

It was imported by GBF out of California. Over all the gun is in pretty good shape with a few minor blemishes on the receiver.  No pitting what so ever.  I would put the round count at under 1,000.  Its a used SKS.  Nothing more and nothing less.
