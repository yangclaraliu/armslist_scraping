This is a Winchester Model 12 pump that comes with two different complete front ends. Both barrels feature factory solid ribs. One barrel measures 30"" in length and is marked for Full choke, while the other barrel measures 26"" and is marked for Cylinder bore choke. Both barrels are serial numbered to match the receiver. The 30"" barrel is likely original to the gun, while the 26"" barrel is certainly of earlier production, marked ""Model 1912"". Each barrel features two sight beads. The mid bead has been added to the 26"" barrel as has the ""glow worm"" front sight on the 30"" barrel. The gun has been refinished in the past but it was a very decent job and the gun looks quite nice. There is no rust or pitting and the finish rates about 98% with a few marks to the front of the receiver from careless assembly. The stocks are sound and free of cracks or chips. There are a few handling marks and the varnish on the buttstock is a little heavy and uneven. LOP measures 14"" over the red rubber Winchester marked replacement buttpad. Mechanically, this shotgun appears to be in good working order and both barrels snug down nicely to the frame. The bores are in good shape too and are free of pitting or problems. This should make a handy dual-purpose shotgun for someone who can appreciate the shooting qualities that defined the classic Winchester Model 12"

Stepping up to the Sporter Series gives the piece of mind that the UL RSC (Residential Security Container) Rating against tool attack provides. A versatile DPX Storage System adds value and convenience.WHY CHOOSE A SPORTER SAFE?Sporter safes offer the quality, security and fire protection features expected from a Browning ProSteel gun safe at a price that is next to impossible to beat. A heavy 12-gauge steel body and rigid 1"" thick formed door with a Force Deflector Lock System. 2016 models include a 1400F/60 minute fire protection rating for additional peace of mind. The Cantilevered Modular interior and DPX door storage provide the most versatile interior found in a safe at this price - and above.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVERED MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine modules.

It's my loss but priorities are what they are.  I asked a Henry rep about whether or not .45 loads could be loaded to the pressure of .44 mags for hunting and he said, ""All I'm going to tell you is look at the .44 mag - it's basically the same receiver.""  I bought the .45LC instead of the .44 mag because when reloading components got scarce the past couple years, as long as I had primers I could always use blackpowder to reload if needed.

This shotgun has had 25 rounds fired threw her, thats it. 

TriStar's Cobra Force Pump Model offers the most features of any home defense shotgun on the market for a fraction of the price. The Cobra Force was designed for close quarters with a 20"" barrel. Add the fixed pistol grip stock, picatinny rail on the top of the receiver, ghost ring rear sight and bridge front sight, and you get the ultimate in home defense.

This easy to maneuver, short barrel pump shotgun comes with a standard molded stock. The Cobra Tactical has one feature that truly separates it from the competition (aside from its incredibly low price); it comes with a return spring in the forearm. This allows the user to pull back on the forearm to eject the shell and then simply release. The spring returns the forearm back to position and shucks another shell into the chamber in one extremely fast motion, allowing for a quicker reload.

Sporter safes are packed with tough-to-beat security and fire protection features. Proven gun safe security and added convenience are yours with a Sporter safe. Stepping up to the Sporter Series gives the piece of mind that the UL RSC (Residential Security Container) Rating against tool attack provides. A versatile DPX Storage System adds value and convenience.WHY CHOOSE A SPORTER SAFE?Sporter safes offer the quality, security and fire protection features expected from a Browning ProSteel gun safe at a price that is next to impossible to beat. A heavy 12-gauge steel body and rigid 1"" thick formed door with a Force Deflector Lock System. 2016 models include a 1400F/60 minute fire protection rating for additional peace of mind. The Cantilevered Modular interior and DPX door storage provide the most versatile interior found in a safe at this price - and above.THERMABLOCK FIRE PROTECTIONNew ThermaBlock Fire Protection- Exclusive to Browning ProSteel Safes, uses thicker material and an interlocking design to provide optimal protection for your valuables. ThermaBlock combined with our external hinge design, eliminates gaps where heat from a fire can enter the safe and damage your prized possessions. The thickness of steel used in the body is vital. Heavier gauge steel flexes less when heated, limiting distortion that lets heat in through gaps in broken welds and around the door frame. Speaking of welds, Browning ProSteel continuously weld every seam – not spot weld like some of the competition for added resistance to heat-related flex. Even the door hinge design matters. All of these little touches add up to big gains in fire and heat resistance and go a long way towards protecting your most valuable possessions. When heat builds and flames roar, ThermaBlock ensures that your valuables are well protected.CANTILEVERED MODULAR SHELVINGQuickly and easily adjust the shelving to meet individual storage needs. Barrel racks can be adjusted at various heights to accomodate long guns, as well as shorter carbine modules. The cantilevered design eliminates the need for a vertical shelf support to add extra interior space.QUICK ACCESS RACKFlexible polymer wings secure the barrel and allow firearms to easily be pushed into or pulled from the rack.BROWNING PROSTEEL SPORTER 33 DIMENSIONSExterior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 58""x36""x27""Interior Dimensions [HxWxD]: 54""x33""x20""Cubic Feet: 33Weight: 665 LBSBolts [Total/Active]: 8/5Gun Capacity: 40 Total (20/30+10)SECURITY FEATURESBody Thickness: 12-Gauge SteelDoor Type/Thickness: 1"" Formed Door w/ Partial Inner PlateLocking System: Force Deflector Locking SystemLocking Bolt Size: 1"" Diameter Chromed Locking BoltsLocking Bolt Side Coverage: 3 SidesLock: S&G Mechanical or SecuRam ElectronicLock Protection Features: Hardened Steel Pin Lock ProtectionFIRE PROTECTION FEATURESInsulation Thickness- Door/Body: 1""Insulation Thickness-Ceiling: 1.5""Fire Seal: PalusolFire Rating, NEW ThermaBlock: 1400F/60 MinutesAPPEARANCE FEATURESExterior Finish: Gloss Black or Hammer GrayInterior Covering: Beige FabricHandle: Three-spoke Silver Chrome HandleCOVENIENCE FEATURES180 Degree HingesStorage Solution: DPX Storage System (top half of door back)Interior Shelving: Cantilevered Modular ShelvingRaised Floor: Elevated floor protects gun socks"

Look bud...PERSONALLY I have nothing against you, HOWEVER based off of the responses I received exposing all your schemes, your complete lack of morals & character has NOT GONE UNNOTICED IN THE FIREARM COMMUNITY that for a majority has a code in which we BELIEVE in REAL Capitalism where one can profit from say their LABOR, PARTS, RARE COLLECTIBLE FIREARMS, TIME (but for the record TIME DOES NOT EQUAL GETTING A FAT ASS OUT OF BED TO HIT WALLY WORLD AT 0730 TO SNAG ALL THE .22LR YOU CAN BEFORE ANYONE ELSE), but TIME spent beautifying/modifying your firearm etc...etc..THAT IS A REAL FREE MARKET PAL. Oh and being HONEST goes a LONG WAY, it's a credibility thing.

NOT from folks who make up LIES that they need to sell badly some Wally World flipped .22LR (while there is already a shortage) in order to make their months rent which gets posted on March 31st...ONLY to go back and see that the same person within 6 weeks had made almost 2 dozen posts about how they have ""$$CASH$$"" for peoples .22's, AND are selling a $1700 AR-15 (which that story was regarding, if I am not mistaken...a truck that was broke that desperately needed to get fixed so that you could make it to work and feed the family and pay the bills. ALL OF WHICH THAT HAS NOW BEEN TAKEN DOWN. Probably posted up under another account THAT BELIEVE ME I WILL FIND, AND EXPOSE. Folks like you man are the antithesis of what a majority of firearm owners are on here.

You and your ad's are MUD on here man. Take your crap over to CRAIGSLIST, might find better SUCKERS OVER THERE ;-) Good luck with your sale of what is it....A STRIPPED DOWN .22LR Ruger 10/22 that you probably PAID $120 FOR AT SAID ""GUN SHOW THAT YOU GOT RECEIPTS AND EVERYTHING FOR"" when I can literally WALK a block away and spend $100 and get a BNIB one that is COMPLETE. YOU ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE ON HERE, plain and simple. One of these times, and this is just a heads up as I have done MANY deals with folks on Armslist (ALL of which have been some of the nicest people I could have ever met, in fact have either later gone shootin with some and/or plan to soon), but one of these days you are gonna cross the wrong guy if you keep this kind of behavior up kid. I'm just sayin.   


""6516 rounds total. Contact me if interested.

If you have nothing better to do then harass people, Then DO NOT CONTACT ME. THIS IS A FREE MARKET... LET IT WORK THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS!""

Free market my A$$, you are a HOARDING PRICE GOUGING FOOL, gee I wonder WHY you are getting all of those ""harassing"" emails after I EXPOSED YOU the first time. You want to know the emails I got? ""Hey man thanks for pointing this POS out, we in the firearm COMMUNITY must look out for one another from these type of SCUM"", ""Hey brother keep on keepin on exposing these LOSERS, I give you my thanks!""

Dude in addition to what I mentioned above, you also have ZERO MORAL CHARACTER (besides knowing nothing about free market principals in which you claim). Let's see with your last ammo price gouge attempt it was posted ON MARCH 31ST AND YOU NEEDED MONEY OR YOUR RENT WOULDN'T GET PAID (hear that? The worlds smallest violin is playing for you right now). Now why would I say such a rude and inconsiderate statement?

BECAUSE YOUR PREVIOUS 2 DOZEN POSTS IN THE LAST MONTH AND A HALF WERE ALL ABOUT ""I WANT TO BUY YOUR .22, HAVE $$$$CASH$$$$ IN HAND!!"" and my personal favorite your ""top end"" AR-15 (HAHA Top End huh? You don't know what ""Top End"" even means, wanna see some of mine? haha), but you needed to sell it BECAUSE ""YOUR TRUCK WAS BROKE AND NEEDED FIXIN AND YOU GOT TO GET TO WORK AND FEED THE FAMILY AND....BLAH...BLAH...BLAH""

Dude YOU ARE A JOKE, and from the responses I GOT, I would say the reason that you are STILL HOLDING onto your .22LR in the midst of a shortage still (GEE I WONDER WHY THERE IS STILL A SHORTAGE OF .22LR's? Oh it's because of WARTS ON THE A$$ OF SOCIETY LIKE YOU THAT PREVENTS REGULAR FOLK FROM BUYING IT!!!)

I WILL KEEP ON EXPOSING YOU, I WILL NOT STOP UNTIL YOU ARE RAN THE HE11 OUT OF HERE YOU GOT THAT? Now you go on and have a nice day there hoarder/gouger ;-)

P.S. Love the ""americanfreebusiness [at] gmail [dot] com"" nice touch considering EVERYTHING UNAMERICAN YOU ARE DOING TO YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN ARMS!

Here's more info on the gun itself:

Type	 Double Action semiautomatic
Caliber(s)	  9x19 Luger / Parabellum and .40SW
Weight unloaded	 915 g
Length	 165 mm
Barrel length	 89 mm
Magazine capacity	 8 (9mm) or 7 (.40) rounds

In the late nineties, the South African police issued a requirement for a compact, concealable pistol chambered for 9x19 ammunition. In 1997, the contract for a new police pistol went to the Republic Arms Company, which had developed the RAP-401 pistol, a relatively compact sidearm suitable for concealed carry. Later on, Republic Arms also produced a .40 calibre version of the same pistol, intended for export. This was designated RAP-440. It seems that RAP pistols were influenced by the Spanish Astra A-75. RAP pistols are favored for their reliability and mild recoil; on the other hand, these pistols are somewhat heavy for their pocket size.
The RAP-401 is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech pistol of all-steel construction. It uses a modified Browning type locking system, as the barrel engages the slide with a single lug that enters the ejection window. Unlocking is controlled by a cam-shaped lug below the barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and frame-mounted safety, which also doubles as a decocker. Sights are fixed. Magazines are single-stack; the magazine release button is located at the base of the trigger-guard."

Here's more info on the gun gathered from the internet:

These were Italian made single action .380 pistols, also made in .32 ACP. They are all steel, well made, very reliable and seem to feed nearly every type of .380 ammo with no problems, and are pretty accurate for their type. I own 2 of them, both Tanfoglios, both imported by EXCAM probably in the 1980's. 

Here's the manual for all of these pistols...

http://www.eaacorp.com/Manuals/ea380-manual.pdf

There were variations of these pistols, but all are the same basic design and they are all good guns. They sort of look like the old Beretta M.70, but are not similar internally. They have a slide lock safety, a mag safety and a firing pin block safety, which I engage in order to safely lower the hammer manually on a loaded chamber. I carry one of mine loaded with Remington Golden Sabers, which feed like glass in this pistol. I have ordered flat wood grips from EAA to replace the 1980's ""thumbrest"" grips that I find very uncomfortable to carry and to shoot. 

Mags and at least some parts are available from EAA and from Numrich, but you probably won't need any.
In my experience, they work best with a light lube on the rails and a little in the works... I also recommend a thorough cleaning if you find one - they are pretty old and like most low priced guns, did not get a lot of respect/cleaning/attention...a little maintenance makes a lot of difference.

They were very inexpensive pistols when new, and still can be a good choice for a rugged, reliable carry or home defense pistol for not much money."

This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.

As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge.

Comes with a soft case and ammo.  My father has become unable to own and operate a weapon like this so I am putting it up for sale for him so he might have a little cash for something he can still do.  I will include a case of 500 shells with the shotgun at my $450 asking price. I will look at firearm trades but cash is king.  If you have a trade I will only sell it so I'm not interested in any low-end/ lower-quality firearms that are hard to sell.  I may also consider a quality 22 or 38 revolver for him to keep around for his self defense.   Again this is being sold to get a little extra money for my aging father.  Call/Text Rick 5O5*6IO*5291"

This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.

Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when we designed the SIX8™ family of weapons, we started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul®, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, we designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, we designed the SIX8™ platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.

As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8™ family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8™ rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.

The new SIX8™ family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge.

The pistol has the original sights and a set of high (suppressor) Meprolite night sights that are adjustable installed.  This was a 165.00 upgrade.  The pistol comes with a knurled ""o"" ringed thread protector to protect the factory threaded barrel.  I have also included a GG&G rail adapter in order to use lights outside of HKs UTL.  This allows you to run the Surefire x200/x300 series lights or the like.  The pistol has less than 200 rounds fired and appears even less.

802,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2910802,"For Sale/Trade:  1980 Kawasaki KZ750 LTD (4,900 orig mi) Great Project","Hartford, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 750,"Listed On: Sunday, April 6, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One owner family Kawasaki KZ750 LTD

Purchased new in 1981 by my uncle who loved bikes but had a bad heart and couldn't ride much. It has just over 4,900 original miles on it. It's always been stored inside; never a night outside. When I inherited the bike in 2009, I went through getting it tuned up and got it on the road for a while until the rear brake caliper cylinder seal blew. I drained the gas then and it's been parked in my garage since and haven't gotten around to replacing/rebuilding the brake caliper yet and finally just decided that it's better now, to sell it to someone with more time and know-how than I have. 

I just got it out of the garage to take a few pictures and see the battery is dead from sitting, so at minimum, it will need a new battery, tune up and the brakes gone through. 

It's completely original/stock and will make a great project and/or restoration bike. It is filthy and needs a really good cleaning. Cosmetically there is surface rust in places (exhaust pipes, etc) from sitting but very solid overall. This is the more desirable KZ750, being a 4 cylinder with quad carbs. It's a 33 year old bike and therefore sold AS IS. 

Clean title in hand. 

First $750, picked up in Hartford. 

The only trades I'd consider would be firearms, otherwise just cash.

The scope is like-new and includes parallax adjustment from 10-infinity yards, tool-free windage/elevation adjustment with 1/4MOA clicks, red/green illuminated reticle with brightness adjustment on the side, 4-16 magnification, and Tasco rings and scope mounts. The scope is not sighted in currently, as I just took it off another rifle when I upgraded to a Nikon Monarch. 

The only cosmetic problem with this rifle is some bluing wear on the barrel. You can see it on the picture. Some cold-blue would fix it up easy, as there is no rust or pitting, but this is my deer rifle and I haven't cared to fix it. 

Trade interests include bolt rifles in .308 or .30-06, budget ARs, full-size 9mm pistols including nicer CZ knockoffs, milsurp guns, or whatever else you may have to offer. Try me!

Trade/sale value is $450 with the scope, $400 without. That's a deal on the scope, they go for about $80 new.

957,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2910957,For Sale:  Desert Tactical Arms (DTA) Covert Rifles NIB,"Howell, Detroit, Michigan","$ 4,996","Listed On: Monday, August 18, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"We currently have ODG/ODG and FDE/FDE in stock with 16"" 308 barrels as ofBuy Your Desert Tech Covert HERE! 4-6-2014

DTA SRS A-1 COVERT Rifle Choose Your Options.
The SRS Covert sniper rifle was purpose-designed for Police and Military snipers needing ultimate concealability and maneuverability. The rifle’s 26-inch overall length puts it in the submachine gun length class. The Covert’s 16-inch barrels provide 1000 yard capability with exceptional accuracy. The Covert is fully compatible with 26-inch barrel SRS conversion kits.


Accuracy
Covert conversion kits use fast-twist barrels to optimize accuracy for both subsonic and full-power ammunition. We guarantee 1/2 MOA accuracy at 100 yards for 3 shots with DTM Ammunition. The Covert chassis use the same optimized core components as the standard SRS:

1. Match grade (free-floated) barrels, chambers, and crowns.
2. High quality match trigger
3. Repeatable return-to-zero barrel mounting system

Quick Caliber Conversion
The SRS Covert uses our patented Quick Caliber Conversion feature. Covert conversion kit barrels have fast-twist rates for optimum performance in 16-inch barrels giving operators the option to fire both suppressed subsonic ammunition or full power standard ammunition with 1/2 MOA accuracy. The Covert accepts full-length SRS conversion kits, providing operators full-size rifle flexibility.

Compact
The SRS Covert is the shortest sniper rifle in the world with an overall length of just 26-inches with a 16-inch barrel. The Covert adds a new level of concealability in a full-power sniper rifle never-before-seen outside of submachine guns yet gives up no capability.

Rugged
The SRS Covert (like the standard SRS) was designed to operate under the harshest conditions and abuse. It utilizes high-impact polymers, aircraft grade 7075-T6 aluminum, ultra high-strength steels, and the most durable coatings known to man. The monolithic receiver serves as a full length mounting chassis, eliminating the need for any sort of receiver-to-stock bedding interface. Ergonomic stock panels attach directly to the receiver. The SRS sustains its accuracy and reliability in virtually any environment, including subzero arctic temperatures, extreme desert heat and dust, and wet jungle environments.

Best all around bolt action out there!

By using the same optic, same chassis, same trigger same suppressor for all calibers you take out  the variables to producing an effective shot. This helps facilitate outstanding marksmanship without readjusting to another platform. Most who purchase The Desert Tech HTI, SRS A1 and Covert A1 rifles abandon shooting their other rifles in the same calibers. These rifles are not just accurate they are military hardened and work in the most adverse conditions on the planet from 130 to sub 0 This rifle will perform either on the hunt or in the field of battle. 

This rife wins shooting competitions on a regular basis because of its superior weight distribution of 50/50 and can be shot offhand without the nose dive and muscle support of a heavy barreled conventional rifle where most of the weight is hanging off the front end."

This rifle was built by Mario Frarie at Piece of History Firearms. He is known to be one of the ""top-tier"" ak builders in the industry. The rifle comes from an original russian parts kit, with a re-marked front trunnion, built on a custom number-matched nodak-spud receiver. The barrel is original Bulgarian cold hammer forged. This rifle is historically correct, down to the custom engraved cyrillic full-auto selector markings. This rifle has very few rounds through it and has always performed flawlessly. There is some light surface/finish wear on the metal parts and the wood, but nothing that effects perfect function.To have this same rifle built by PoHF today would be well over $1500, and the wait would be over 6 months (If you could even find the parts kit). 

Comes with 1 Russian Izzy matte plum 30rd mag, and 30rds of 7n6 steel core ammo. Original Russian mustard colored sling is also included. 

$800 

I spent more on this rifle than I am selling it for so my asking price is firm. Will meet near DTW airport or I can ship at buyers expense to an FFL. Not interested in any trades at this time."
