This one is super clean, has the light wood and appears to have been fired sparingly if at all. It comes with a sling and a 30rd SS mag. If I had to grade it I would call it a 9.7 or so, this is not an AC556 so no tax stamp is required. The last one of these sold on GB for $2500 with a broken up box so I know the price is right. I am asking $2000, I will entertain reasonable offers and trades. The first picture is a generic but the last two are of the actual rifle as well as the letter from Ruger, if this makes it to gunbroker Sunday I will have better pictures taken.

Most of these rifles are missing the cover or it is broken. This one is perfectly operational. The rifle is in great shape and is completely functional. I am unsure of the caliber but I know that this one was converted to the more common caliber version for this model.

The double action weapon is about twice as wide, and substantially heavier than the typical .25 automatic pistol, though its relatively compact size and powerful cartridge made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun. The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

The scope power is adjustable from 3.5-10X and the objective diameter is 50mm. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. The optics are beautiful and crisp. The condition of the rifle is mint. No scratches that I can find on the laminate wood stock either. The laminate wood stock has nice checkering on the grip and forearm, a rubber butt pad, and a raised cheekrest. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. This rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

I will sell the rifle seperate from the scope, mount, caps, and rings for $650.00. For the Leupold scope, rings, caps, and mount, I am asking $425.00. For the whole package, I am asking $1000.00. You can keep the sales tax! Shipping is available for a marginal amount. Face to face transaction is possible.

Featuring fine Walnut, a precision machined ordinance steel receiver and a hammer forged barrel, this magnificent BAR will make autoloading enthusiasts out of the most skeptical riflemen. Classic in looks and contemporary in performance, the BAR MK II Safari is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet. Hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy. The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy. Scroll-engraved ordinance steel receiver on the BAR MK II Safari is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform. Gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel. Seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges. Strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration. Buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability. Bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves. BAR MK II Safari is equipped with a traditional detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading, in the field or on the range. Magazine capacity on the BAR MK II Safari is 3 rounds. Trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod. Generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves. Richly blued steel finish is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art. Charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard. Crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. Walnut stock on the BAR MK II Safari has cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end to improve your grip, and a beautiful deep gloss finish that brings out every nuance of the warm grain of the wood. Traditional recoil pad on the BAR MK II Safari greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching. Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling."

The teeth are still in tact, and I can email pics to you. If you would rather, I have a daniel defense enhanced flash Hider I can include instead, which is in flawless condition and has no marks. Includes the crush washer that came off the factory gun. 
**I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU NEED TO PURCHASE A NEW CRUSH WASHER, SO INSTALL WITH INCLUDED ONE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.

Now down to the lower: It was purchased in fall of 2012, but has only seen about 150 rounds. It has some blemishes from installation, namely some marks near the takedown pins, and the bolt catch roll pin. I can include a new roll pin if you want to swap it out. Will come with the A2 grip & a Magpul MOE grip in black. I have included detailed pics of the wear marks, and a small mark on the stock from safe handling. This was not a chainsaw lower. I used a stag AKA CMT lower parts kit. Noveske uses CMT parts kits, and I wanted to stay true to that. The front takedown pin is a tight fit, but I can offer a replacement for you to install.

For sale is my 2010 Honda Civic EX-L. This Is the top tier model for the Honda civic including Honda brand mats, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, moon roof, and leather interior.

The vehicle has 89,700 miles and has 4 brand new tires put on within the last 40 days. The tires are tread warrantied for 65k miles and are firestone brand. I have the receipt to prove purchase/installation of these from Sandone in Scranton.  I am selling this car as I need an AWD for my work.  Car runs well mechanically.  Someone keyed my vehicle and there are some marks on the outside.  Overall this would be rated approx. 6/10.  I am looking to sell outright and avoid trading it in at a dealer as it would not make as much financial sense. No trades at this time.  Thank you for looking!

This car is appraised at 10,300$ based upon the year/mileage.  Given the mentioned wear issues I would accept 9500$.  AS mentioned 428$ worth of  4 brand new tires were put on in the last month.  This car does have 4 tinted windows as well."

Occasional FTE, but I believe this is just a pair of screws that need to be adjusted in the action. There are plenty of threads online about this issue and how to make a simple and permanent fix, but I haven't had the time to tear the gun down that far. Nothing else wrong with it, and again, this should be easy to fix for anyone comfortable with tearing the firearm down and adjusting some screws inside the firing mechanism.

Selling for the ridiculously low price of $350 or equivalent trade value. This gun was $550 new, and is about $450 used all over Armslist. Buy it this week, and I will load the mag with new Federal .22 to boot.

The stock had been removed by a previous owner and redone and the screws weren't put back in tight. It now holds great groups at 150 yards. Had a scope on it but took it off an used it on my new .17 Super Mag which is why I am letting this one go. Has 1 mag only. I have seen them for sale at local shops everywhere though. Only problem with the gun is some pitting midway down the barrel on the outside only. Bore and rifling are great. I have a set of scope rings with dove tail bases to go with it as well.

The rifle hasn't even made it to the gun range once and never had a round shot out of it by me, because I decided that I instead want to go a whole other direction than an AR-15 and get something different over the summer. 

I paid $1100 for the rifle that came with a silver 30rd clip. That is all I would like to sell at this time, and the price is $1000 flat. I do not NEED to sell this, so I am in no mood to haggle over the price. I will keep the new Magpul grip I purchased ($30) on the rifle and also include the new black Magpul 30rd clip ($15.00) with the gun as well for no additional charge.

Now, I also bought quite a few accessories that day, but may end up keeping them, unless you want them as well -

If, in fact, you want the whole shabang and purchase the complete case, then maybe you could intrigue me. But as you can see, I blew well over 2 grand on this rifle and accessories, so don't come at me with some $1400 bid, bra!!!

Now, this purchase will be done in accordance with the law, which will involve a signed 'Firearm Bill of Sale' between us, completely down to a photocopy of both our I.D.s as well so nothing comes back to haunt either of us in 20 years! (Hey, ya never know!)

I am a legit man with no criminal record, nor do I buy and sell guns regularly. In fact, this is the first gun I bought since I got talked into buying a Tec-9 back in 1993. 

(Hey, screw you! The gun looked awesome with its shiny silver Tec-cote, and I didn't know any better back then! Little did I know I just bought a piece of chit that couldn't hit a house, even if you were inside 'said' it!!)

Point being, check it out and get back in touch if you want any more information or more pics of the rifle. I took quite a few for my records when I bought it, but just included a few in this post.
