Had it about a year and a half and i usually just shoot my Springfield since that's my carry pistol. So since i don't use this much anymore i figured i'd sell it. Comes with original box, lock and 3 magazines(15rd) asking $500 firm. The thing looks brand new and the extra magazine was $35. It was $500 brand new plus tax so this is alot less with the added magazine. Prefer someone with a current permit to purchase or a carry permit in the state of MN. If someone without either of those purchases it i'd like to get the firearm transferred at a dealer at buyers expense. This is a black with a stainless slide(silver upper/black lower) ~Cole~

The Vltor lower receiver also features unique grip enhancing cuts on the front of the magazine well, an oversized mag release button and the Vltor ""side saddle"" sling plate - featuring three positions to mount a quick disconnect sling swivel. The lower receiver comes complete with a Vltor receiver extension tube, standard carbine buffer, spring and A2 grip.

This SBR has a 7in Barrel and Vltor Flash Hider mounted with a Vltor CASV-M Handguard.

The CASV-M was originally designed for the popular mid-length gas system rifles. Like all CASV systems, the CASV-M relies on piggy-back mounting to the top of a flat-top M4 or M16A4 upper receiver. This chassis features a removable lower handguard, which allows the access of an M203 grenade launcher. The smooth body construction allows multiple rail mounting points, adaptable to any mission needs. The area forward of the top rail can be filled with a short rail, or used to mount the VLTOR flip-up sight assembly. This forearm allows plenty of space for modular accessories and adequate grip without sacrificing any of its lightweight characteristics."

This is Model 213 Norinco 9mm and 2(two) 8(eight)-round magazines. Some more important points:
1)It looks extremely similar to legendary TT-33 ""Tokarev"", Russian/Soviet WWII standard issue pistol. (read: makes you feel A REAL BADASS, also is good for reenactors (especially, WWII reenactors) as well as for WWII movies/documentaries/shows production). 
2) Lots of Tokarev TT-33 spare parts will fit it. But on the other hand, it is in 9mm caliber, (read: ammo is cheaper and easier to find than Tokarev 7.62X25 ammo).
3) Also, its more than decent collectible value  is gonna only raise since it's no longer importable. The last Norinco guns and ammo were imported circa 1993-1994 before embargo was enacted.  (read: the owner gonna have a lot of bragging rights eventually, if not right away)  
4)Condition is very good as well. It functions very reliably. Good choice for Concealed carry/personal defense.
5)It is a good choice for an undercover law enforcement officer, who needs a weapon which will not reveal him/her away.
6) The asked price is $400 cash. Other forms of payment as well as LOWER OFFERS ARE DISCUSSABLE. Higher offers are obviously welcome.  If I do not sell it by Oct, I am taking it to the Gun show for sale.
7)The last, but not the least. If buyer is located outside of Lubbock area, feel free to discuss an arrangement over email. I will ship it to buyer's FFL as long as you are legal to purchase, possess and own it in your location. US Postal money order is the best option in that case. Other options are discussable. The buyer then pays actual costs of shipping and is responsible for FFL transfer fee(s) and other applicable fees/taxes. Another possible option for those outside of Lubbock area: If you are Texas resident who is legal to purchase a weapon, you are welcome to come to Lubbock so we can make face-to-face sale."

Does not look great (bluing worn off in multiple places), but its rock solid reliable.  It has a large striker, so rarely misfires even with the cheap bulk ammo.  This has got to be one of the most under-rated and under-appreciated revolvers.  It has a bad rap as a cheap ""saturday night special"", but this double action revolver uses a striker system in combination with the hammer that acts as a safety when its not cocked.  You can hit the back of the pistol's hammer with a sledge and it will not engage the striker. So you can feel completely safe carrying it with all chambers loaded.

I've been carrying it as a snake gun (loaded with shot shells and cb caps) when hiking or mountain biking. Decided I want to switch to a small semi auto.

This has been my favorite truck to cruise around in and work on in my spare time. May be a little old, but it's got it where it counts. I'm only selling the truck because I'm starting college. I don't have the time or energy to keep upgrading/repairing/maintaining this truck the way it deserves.
Needs an owner that can give it the hands-on care and attention it needs to stay beautiful and finish fixing it up. Will keep running forever with a little TLC, I've done 90% of my own maintenance with only basic tools.

Alan D. Fries

""5/5 Stars This thing is rock solid! Bright as all hell, and of Great Quality!""
""The quality is beyond the description...tough as nails. Quality in the machining and the mount. water proof O rings, easy acquisition of both the laser and Kree led button. Laser also adjust easy with supplied allen wrench. The Kree is sooooo Bright!. Kree led's come with a warning that they can cause retinal damage they are so bright. Strobe is sweet also, not as bright as it pulses (quickly, which is nice) but definitely disorienting and blinding as well. This thing is definitely worth the money. No play, slop, or misconfiguration. I would think the follow up reviews will be spot on. Good job on this one Monstrum! Happy 100% to have purchased this.""

Comes in Original Glock box with Glock 23, lock,  factory test cases, 2 13rd mags, 1 31rd mag, speed loader and cleaning brush and rod. I did a grip reduction on this firearm to give it a smaller grip and more texture to keep it from slipping. It feels really good in your hand and gives more control. The only problem with this gun is when doing the reduction some epoxy  spilled over into the magwell. It has been filed down and the mag loads and ejects perfectly fine. It has a clip draw holster on it to make it easier to conceal in summer but still fits in IWB hosters such as Galco kingtuk IWB. Really like the gun but I dont see any need to have 2 . 40 S&W's so I am selling or trading this toward something else. I am open to just about anything but prefer to sell or trade toward a Kimber Covert Pro or other Pro model 1911 such as Sig Scorpion, Para Ord, Paid $550 for the Glock 2 2 years ago and it is in really good condition. Has some holster and carry wear but is a great firearm. please let me know what you have. Would really like 10mm , .357 sig , 45ACP, or Sig P938 in 9mm for my wife. Thank you for looking.

Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the U.S. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. The SPAS-12 has been sold to military and police users worldwide, on the civilian market, and has been featured in films and TV shows. The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the foregrip and sliding the foregrip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. The barrel of the SPAS 12 was externally threaded to accept a variety of attachments, from chokes to gas-grenade launchers. The appearance and intended purpose of the SPAS-12 initially led to its ""combat"" designation. Franchi renamed the model the Sporting Purpose Automatic Shotgun in 1990, after the importation ban of 1989 (when it was called the Special Purpose Automatic Shotgun). This allowed continued sales to the U.S. as a limited-magazine-capacity, fixed-stock model until 1994. Following the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, exports to the U.S. ceased."

 Looking to buy one of these 1911's. I have cash in hand ready to go!!

Remington R1 (standard)
Ruger SR1911
Desert Eagle 1911
Kimber Custom II
S&W E series 1911
Sig 1911

I am looking to pay used price for one of these! 675 is what I am looking to spend. The Sig or S&W I may pay a little more for though. NOT LOOKING FOR NEW PRICE FOR YOUR USED GUN. I can go to either of my 3 local gun shops or drive to Fin and get all of these guns brand new for 650-700 out the door after taxes etc. So I believe 675 is fair for a decent used one! 

Thanks for your time guys! Hope to hear from you soon."

721,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2006721,For Sale:  Cobray 37mm launcher,"Alexandria, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 225,"Listed On: Friday, August 16, 2013",Shotguns,no type,no type,Single Shot                                                                                ,Shotgun,"Cobray CM203 37mm Launcher
 Modeled after the grenade launcher, this thing is so fun!  Launches flares, gas, fireworks, or make your own rounds! Cobray Co. (originally of Smyrna GA, but now currently of Westhope, ND) built many smooth bore 37mm Flare launchers that were smooth bore copies of the M203 grenade launcher back in the late 1980s (originally known as the CM2037 IMP). Versions were made by SWD (the predecessor of Cobray) and RPB, as well, but Cobray was the last, and most successful company, to sell the launchers. Throughout the 1990s, several improvements were made in the construction and cocking lever as well as shorter and longer length barrels. 

The Cobray CM203 37mm flare launcher is not a grenade launcher. It fires distress flares from a 37mm smooth bore and cannot accept 40mm munitions. However, since it looks like an M203 grenade launcher it is commonly mistaken for one in films on this site. It was built for civilian use as an under slung flare launcher commonly mounted under M16/AR-15s variants and other rifles. It is preferred for most film use over a genuine M203 mainly because, unlike the M203, it is not considered a ""Destructive Device"" in the U.S. and not subject to NFA regulations. Such weapons are thus more expensive and difficult for film productions to acquire. 

The Cobray CM203 37mm flare launcher can be distinguished from the Colt M203 based on the following: 
1. The M203 is a 40mm launcher capable of firing multiple purpose rounds, the CM203 is a 37mm launcher built specifically as a flare launcher for civilian use. 2. The CM203 has an M16 style safety switch (on later models), the M203 does not. 3. The CM203 lacks a second safety trigger in the front of the main trigger, which the M203 has. 4. The CM203 Flare launcher's trigger guard is more squared when compared to the M203. 5. The CM203 37mm had an external cocking lever on the side of the receiver, the M203 cocks on closure"

This is an awesome rifle; I am only getting rid of it because I have 2 others."

The magazine extension adds about an inch to the grip; if you're like me and have big hands, this is incredibly helpful as it allows the subcompact to fit my hand well and makes the draw smoother and easier.

The double-action only configuration is good for concealed carry to ensure you have acquired and identified your target before firing. Overall, I have found the XD subcompact to be the best concealed carry firearm for me.

The Steyr M1895 rifle, also known as Steyr-Mannlicher M95 straight pull rifle, was developed by famous Austrian arms designer Ferdinand Ritter Von Mannlicher. Based on his previous M1890 design, this rifle was manufactured in Austro-Hungarian Empire at state arms factories in Steyr (Austria) and Budapest (Hungary). More than 3 millions of M95 rifles were produced between 1895 and 1918. This rifle was issued to Austro-Hungarian army, and, after the fall of the Empire, to the Austrian and Hungarian armies. Originally produced in 8x50R caliber, in 1924 some of M95 rifles were converted to the German 7.92x57 Mauser (also known as 8x57 Mauser) ammunition. These converted rifles featured shorter 58 cm barrels, were designated as M95/24 and used in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. This conversion gave away with original Mannlicher en bloc clip, and replaced it with Mauser stripper clips. Since 1930 Austria converted most of the M95 rifles to the more powerful 8x56R M30 ammunition, using the same Mannlicher en bloc clips. These rifles were designated as M95/30, and marked with the letter ""S"" on the receiver ring. Hungary started to convert their rifles to the same 8x56R ammunition in 1931, with the upgraded rifles being marked with the letter ""H"" on the receiver ring. Many of the M95 rifles were used during the Word War 2 by the Hungarian, Bulgarian and Italian armies, as well as by some German police forces."

ALL FOR $250.  No more price-gouging (even though I got gouged when I bought the .223 and the the boxes of 22lr...a gouge at Sooner Guns for $30/box, still has tag...not going to gouge fellow shooters!).  WILL DELETE THE AD WHEN GONE.  If separating the two, it'll be $210 for the penetrator on clips with ammo can, and $40 for 750 rounds of 22lr.  That's .50 cents/round of the 223, and .05 cents/round of 22lr."

I can meet you anywhere in the Twin Cities. I'd rather not ship them but if you want to pay for shipping, I'm sure we can work something out.

I've never even used the 20 rounder, so it's basically brand new. The others have been to the range about 4 times, so they have probably only been loaded a couple times each. I don't keep any of them loaded. I've never had any malfunctions with any of them.

The springs are ridiculously strong, so you can consider these ""new"" mags.

For anyone unfamiliar with Mec-Gar, they make SIG magazines. So they're the same quality as the factory mags; just without ""SIG Sauer"" written on them."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

The CVA® Optima also features the quick-release breech plug which comes out with just a twist... no tools required! Even after 20 or more shots, you'll still be able to remove the breech plug with a simple twist. The breech opens with just a touch of the breeching lever, which sits right in front of the trigger guard.
