It is the synthetic stock not the cheap artificial wood stock you see that goes for $350 so please don't waste either of our time telling me you can find one brand new for the same price because you can't. The synthetic stock 870's sell from $450-$600 brand new.

Now that that is out of the way I am the original and only owner of this gun and it has been well kept. I changed the original 24"" barrel out for a 28"" for personal preferences only. It is a vent rib barrel with a high viz sight/bead which is removable. Also comes with a sling and cloth sock to cover the gun. It has absolutely no rust or pitting anywhere on it, only the typical wear on the slide which is to be expected from a used gun that has been a ""hunter"". Feel free to ask anymore questions you may have, but the model 870 speaks for itself in a quality shotgun.

I'm asking $325 firm which is completely fair.
The ONLY trade I may consider is a M&P shield 9mm or.40 or M&Pc 9mm or .40
Thanks and happy holidays!"

scored a hit in 1992 when it paired its classic semi-automatic .22 Long Rifle rimfire pistol design with a fiberglass-reinforced nylon grip frame whose shape and angle approximated that of the M1911. Since then the appropriately designated 22/45’s grip frame has been subtly reshaped, and the Mark III 22/45 line has grown to include several models—the latest of which is the 22/45 Lite. As its name suggests, it is the lightest to date, weighing 22.8 ounces with an empty magazine in place. That makes it more than a half-pound lighter than other 22/45 models, which range from 31 to 33 ounces.

The weight reduction is mostly the result of a gold-tone-anodized cylindrical aluminum receiver that measures 1 inch in outer diameter and fully shrouds the steel inner barrel, thus preserving the gun’s classic bull-barrel profile. The barrel measures nearly 3/4 inches in diameter at the chamber but soon after reduces to little more than 5/16 inches out to the muzzle. There a factory-installed, non-removable nut tensions the barrel against the receiver. In addition, the barrel is fitted with a knurled, finger-tight, black aluminum cap that protects 1/2-inch x 28 muzzle threads designed to accommodate a sound suppressor.

The 22/45 Lite’s Zytel frame, unlike earlier pistols in the 22/45 line, features metal bushings that allow for the attachment of the stock panels by way of two screws each. Rubber stocks are included and wood stocks are available. Controls present on the left side of the frame include: an M1911-style magazine release button; an extended, swinging manual bolt catch/release button just forward of the top corner of the stock panel; a manual safety at the top of the backstrap and, just below that, a recessed keyway to an internal lock for which two keys are included. The pistol also features an internal magazine disconnect safety, rendering it unable to fire when the magazine is removed. The grip features a panel of fine horizontal serrations on its frontstrap and checkering on the backstrap. Molded reliefs at the rear of the trigger guard mimic those of the M1911A1 and ease access to the wide, serrated trigger bow."

It does have Inland trigger group, and Inland bolt, the other parts, I am not sure, but think they are also Inland. The barrel is also inland and original marked from 1944. I would put it in my own collection, but already have a USGI M1 carbine, so I am putting it up for trade.. Not so much interested in a cash sale, but might for the right offer. More interested in trades. Trade I may be interested in are listed below."

Rifle is new military production made in December 1954 as part of the so called ""Irish Contract"" that was never delivered. So this isn't a refurbed or refinished rifle but rather a real deal military original.

I am the first and only owner, and rifle was mummy wrapped and caked with cosmoline when I purchased it over 25 years ago. Looking back I suppose I should have left it sealed and wrapped, but I have no regrets as I've enjoyed admiring it over the years.

Condition is as close to perfection as you will ever find.  

every number matches and bore is ""as new"".  

Rifle was tested fired by me shortly after I purchased it then cleaned, prepped for storage, and put away in my safe. 

All of the ammo & accessories that are pictured are in excellent condition and are included with the rifle. 

I'm asking $1000 for the package.

If you look hard enough you may eventually find another rifle as nice but you will not find one better.

Rifle is local sale only and must be picked up in the Brandon area by a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old

If you have anything but Colt, it is 99 percent chance you have small pins.

I purchased these in the last year and find we rarely travel to use them. They have been kept in our home in their case. If you are used to high value glass, this is a great choice over the greater magnification. I sold my 8.5 x 42 power set because of the weight; these are much lighter and the clarity is astounding. 

Note I paid $2,200 for these binoculars from a dealer. This is an extraordinary price for barely used binoculars, or 14 foot flat bottom boat and/or motor, or part cash, and if you offer a trade, please let it be similarly well-priced. Preference is all cash. I will prepare a bill of sale, and if there is a trade of a firearm will want to examine your D.L. or CHL. I have many references and are verifiable as  ""good guy"" and so should you on any trades.

From Cabelas website:
These screw-in choke tubes let gases vent through slots, creating a braking system that reduces recoil. It also keeps gases from moving faster than the wad or shot. Plus the slots momentarily grab the wad to separate it from the shot before exiting the barrel to improve shot pattern consistency."
