I am the original owner of the gun and it has performed flawless. It has eaten everything that I have put in it. I'd estimate 600-700 rounds down the pipe. I have done all of the recommended ""enhancements"" to this gun including: adding a charge tube buffer, replaced all of the screws with high strength pieces, replaced the take down screws with actual HK take down pins and filled the stock with foam for a solid and balanced feel. Also I integrated a Magpul rail into the forearm and added an AFG which really makes this gun comfortable to hold and maneuver. This is a fun gun. Just thinning the herd.

The gun is in immaculate condition. Over the years I ran maybe 200 rounds down the pipe. It was never carried. Simply a safe queen. You don't see the High Capacity versions very often.

Included is everything that came with the gun, the box, the original wrapping paper from around the gun, the mags, and the tools. The gun has a nice aftermarket grip (Pierce I believe) installed, but the original grip and grip screw are included as well. Not pictured, I have two Kydex holsters that I bought years ago that I will include. I bought them, but never used them as I never carried this gun.

178,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2120178,"For Sale:  Smith & Wesson Model 1940 Light Rifle MK-I and MK-II ""VERY RARE"" 9mm Luger. Caliber","West Columbia, Columbia, South Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 1, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"******************Make an offer******************
Smith & Wesson Model 1940 Light Rifle MK-II in 9mm Luger: In 1940 Smith & Wesson manufactured the Model 1940 Light Rifle for the British government. However, because Smith & Wesson designed the rifle around the 9mm Luger of American manufacture the rifles failed the British 5000 round endurance test at the Enfield Arsenal. The arsenal used 9mm Luger ammunition of European design that had a breech pressure of 7000 foot/pounds of energy, which is much higher than the American ammunition. The British government asked Smith & Wesson to make design changes to handle the more powerful European round. Smith & Wesson redesigned the rifle with an oversleeve to strengthen the frame and to serve as a bolt lock safety, negating the need for the hand operated safety lever. To distinguish between the two models, Smith & Wesson stamped the first as the Mark-I and the second model Mark-II. The Smith & Wesson manufactured 2200 frames in all with serial numbers ranging from 1 to 2200. However Smith & Wesson only sold 1227 rifles to the British & Canadian governments. At the end of WWII the British & Canadian Light Rifles were cut up and dumped into the English Channel with the exception of five rifles which are now in the Tower of London, British Military Museum and the Enfield Arsenal. In 1974 Smith & Wesson discovered crates of Model 1940 Light Rifles, and subsequently sold as C&R (curio & relics). In this batch of Light Rifles there were a total of 217, of which 137 were Mark-Is and 80 Mark-IIs. Smith & Wesson records indicate that these Light Rifles were sold on March 30, 1975 to GT Distributors, Rossville, GA.  ""Please Note: The Smith & Wesson letter indicates that it is extremely important that these rifles not be loaded or fired with any of the modern 9mm ammunition. They are only sold as collector pieces and are hazardous to fire."

45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living.


The below velocities were fired from my Colt Gold Cup Govt. Model (5 inch) that was converted by Garey.

1. Item # 45S185-----------1330 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. Item # 45S200-----------1235 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. Item # 45S230-----------1131 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. Item # 45S230FMJ----1133 fps (230gr. FMJ-FLAT NOSE) 
5. Item # 45S255-----------1090 fps  (HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)

 As always with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give you real world data and results.

All our 45 Super ammunition is loaded with flash suppressed powders so that if you have to fire in low light (when the criminal element is out) you will not be blinded by your own gun fire at the worst possible moment.


All three of the JHP loads were designed for anti-personel use and for hunting small big game like deer. The two solid bullet loads were designed for breaking large bones like a bears shoulders or skull, but will work for anti-personel use as well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

It has a few scratches from use but overall is in great condition and functions flawlessly. I love the gun but I want something a little smaller for carry. I do have paddle holsters, but this pistol has the wider European trigger guard, so the holsters need to be opened up a bit to fit properly. I never did it because I don't carry the gun. 

Includes the following magazines: 

(2) Sig factory 15 round
(2) Mec-Gar 18 round
(2) ProMag 15 round

All are flush-fit, even the 18-round Mec-Gar magazines. 

I'll also include a ProMag 32 round magazine if desired, just be aware that it double-feeds if loaded with more than 25 rounds. It was a bit of a disappointment, to say the least. Fortunately, all of the other magazines fed everything I tried without issue.

Turkish built gun with Weatherby backed support.  I had an issue with weak ejection when it was new but the extractor just needed to be tuned which was corrected under warranty.  Gun runs great now.

I am selling this in favor of a semi-auto.  I like this gun a lot but it is just not within my financial grasp to have both a pump and a semi...one day.

Has the trigger guard mounted safety, which i prefer over the tang mounted.

I have a colt 1911 it was made in 1917. It has decent amount of wear on it and the grips, mag and sights are not original. I would say it doesn’t have a lot of historical value. but it is a nice shooter with no problems. I'm not the original owner so I don’t know much about it. a cool thing is about this gun is that they only made 800 of these for USMC back in the day. I'm looking around $550 for it, would rather sell. my trade interests are M&P shield, Glocks, H&k's, SIG, I'm pretty much open to anything. The worse i can say is no.
Thanks for looking feel free to PM with any other questions. I will be in the Seattle area the 20,21,22 of September."

These guns are rare and very collectable.  Baker was one of the high end gun makers back in the day when LC Smith bought them out in 1888.  LC Smith was then bought out by Marlin in the 1940s. This gun comes with a note from Ahlman's gunsmith varifying that it is still in fine working order and safe to shoot with light blackpowder loads (comes with the note from ahlmans themselves for proof). This is not necessarily a wall hanger since it is safe to shoot.
