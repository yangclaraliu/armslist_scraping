The low-profile RMR™ (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) sight enables fast, both-eyes-open, target acquisition—even in poor lighting conditions. Unlimited eye relief allows natural presentation from almost any shooting position, plus clear, unobstructed panoramic views for maximum situational awareness.
Performs in the harshest operating conditions thanks to a computer-optimized geometric housing of high-strength, forged, military-grade, aluminum that absorbs shock and diverts stress away from the lens. Simple to operate, no switches to toggle, or forget to activate under stress, because the sight is always on. Battery lasts over a year.
Adjustable LED models have eight reticle brightness levels that can be set manually, or the user can select auto mode that automatically selects the brightness suitable for ambient light conditions."

The proven performance of YHM''s Phantom Flash Hider eliminates 99% of muzzle flash and reduces muzzle noise by up to -32 dB. The fast attach design allows you to permanently install the Phantom Flash Hider and then install the Sound Suppressor without the use of tools when sound suppression is desired. The patented Phantom Flash Hider system holds the sound suppressor firmly in place by hand tightening and allows the sound suppressor to be removed by hand when no longer needed. A patented gas seal keeps the threads clean so the suppressor will not bind, making removal a breeze. The Phantom Flash hider supports the sound suppressor in two places making misalignment nearly impossible, even if the sound suppressor is not fully tightened. This sound suppressor is designed so that it can be used with a Phantom 5.56 flash hider. This allows users to purchase one sound suppressor and use it on multiple firearms and calibers.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

From Ruger website/ The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

The Daniel Defense CAR EZ Mount attaches quickly to any AR15/M4 with a collapsible buttstock. It is CNC machined from 6061 T6 aluminum and has a type 3 mil-spec hard coat anodize finish. It also features a heavy duty Uncle Mike’s pushbutton QD swivel* attachment that allows for ambidextrous functionality. The QD swivel can be swapped from left to right with the push of a button. 

If you have a duty weapon that you cannot modify due to department regulations, this mount is a ""bolt on"" part and can be used by most departments.

Since a trade has not materialized, I am now willing to sell it.

I have an ANIB Remington R1S. It is my last .45acp pistol so with it, I will include 6 x 50 round boxes of factory 230gr ball ammo: two boxes of Remington and four boxes of American Eagle. It has had only 50 rounds through it but you cannot tell that it has been fired outside of the factory. It comes with everything that was originally shipped with the pistol by Remington. It is a newer pistol as it does not have the ERPC marking that was evident on the earlier versions.

You will be required to have a valid FOID, sign a bill of sale, and abide by the state mandated 72 hour waiting period. Also, since you will not be taking possession until after January 1st, you must provide your FOID information when you agree to purchase this pistol as a new law goes into effect that requires private party sellers to obtain approval from the ISP before delivering a firearm to another private party. If you can't or won't agree to the foregoing, I will not sell this pistol to you."

Specifications
22 Long Rifle
40-grain, round-nose bullets
Blackened, Plated for reduced fouling
1,255 fps muzzle velocity

Designed specifically for the high-volume shooter using high-capacity magazines. These 40-grain, blackened, round-nose bullets are highly accurate, plated for reduced fouling and enhanced function and they maintain reliable feeding in high-capacity magazines. Clean burning powder produces consistent chamber pressure and delivers a 1,255 fps muzzle velocity. Noncorrosive primers for consistent, sure-fire ignition.

Good target and hunting ammo in the plastic box where the top slides to access the ammo. This is not cheap bulk crappy ammo this is good stuff. Never had one not fire or cycle in any rifle or pistol I have ever owned.

This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol. Click the below links to get magazines.

The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. This one has a Nitron® Finish. The RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile hogue grips. These 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.
