This is the all steel model. It has been Cerakoted in burnt bronze. The grips are VZ frag pattern grips in hyena brown. It has Meprolight night sights installed. I have put a total of 200 flawless rounds through it so far. It is a very accurate shooting gun. Overall the gun is in excellent condition. The Cerakote finish did have a small flaw in in near the magwell on the back of the grip. it is hardly noticeable. I added a pic of it. The Cerakote job was done by a company here in Boise. It is the baked on version.

The gun comes with 3 14 round magazines, 2 factory, 1 Mec Gar, which makes CZ's factory mags. All mags have the rubber base pads. I have 2 flat steel base pads included as well.

This is a matching set of 4 truly unique limited production Winchester Model 70 Super Grade rifles...each of which is chambered in a cartridge that is ideal for the game animals they commemorate and is so marked with engraving on the magazine floorplate. Only 100 of these sets were made. The pictures do not do these rifles justice. They are stunning.

Rifle #1 is the Varmint Rifle chambered in the blistering 22-250. Rifle #2 is the Deer/Antelope Rifle chambered in the flat shooting 270 Win. Rifle #3 is the Elk/Moose chambered in the potent 300 Win Mag. Rifle #4 is the Dangerous Game Rifle and is chambered in 375 H&H Mag. All of the classic Model 70 Super Grade features are present – the fancy grade checkered walnut stock with shadowline cheeckpiece and ebony fore-end tip, the engraved crossbolt head and the traditional Super Grade pistol grip cap. Each of these beautiful rifles is built with the Pre-’64 style action that offers a forged steel receiver, massive external claw extractor, controlled round feeding and reliable blade ejection. 

Not only did Winchester only make 100 of these 4 rifle sets but...they do not make a Model 70 SuperGrade in 22-250 or 375 H&H Mag. This adds to the value and uniqueness of this set. These rifles are NIB...never been fired. 

I spoke with an official at the Midway Foundation who informed me that these rifles are among the last Model 70 Super Grades that were manufactured in American facilities. Future manufacturing is being moved to Japan. Get the last of the American made Model 70 Super Grades while you can!"

The company wants to emphasize that no injuries have been reported to date.

Springfield has determined that under exceptionally rare circumstances, some 3.3 XD-S 9mm and .45 ACP caliber pistols could experience an unintended discharge during the loading process when the slide is released, or could experience a double-fire when the trigger is pulled once. The chance of these conditions existing is exceptionally rare, but if they happen, serious injury or death could occur."

I'm willing to travel, even all the way up to Green Bay, WI to Chicago, IL. I check my emails frequently. If I don't get to you IMMEDIATELY, I either went to sleep, or around the house.
I'm looking for a nice looking pistol. I'm open to many offers, so please don't pass me up because of some of the things I prefer. I may just settle for less. 

But with that said. I prefer a polished chrome finish or a silver/grey finish. But I don't mind black really or a mixture of it. 
Price isn't too much of an issue. I'd rather try to see if I could buy 2 handguns for the price of one like around $600-$800. Depends on how it looks and what comes with it. Just don't try to break me because you know my limits, I could pay more than $800, but I don't feel it's worth the money. I want a handgun for Home defense one for me and one for my wife if possible. I also do want to start my own collection as well. 

As for the extras I'm hoping comes with is holster, ammo, and a lot of mags. That's basically it. When we agree on a price I will email my Drivers License, and my Conceal Carry License. I don't have a cell phone I can get pics to, so please email pics of your handgun. I don't want to have to google it because I won't get the exact photo of what yours looks like. There's too many different styles and colors. So please send me pics. 

As for the calibers, I'm only accepting 38 and larger. Nothing smaller than a .38, no exceptions on that one. .380, 9mm, 10mm, 40, 45, etc is what I'm looking for.

Also, just to throw this out there, I have a 2001 black Hyundai Elantra Hatchback w/ 189,999mi on it. cool a/c HOT heat, drive-able I may be willing to trade. Alloy wheels, black leather seats. Dashboard lights up blue, aftermarket CD player. Brand new OEM Cradle done, brand new OEM axle, both left and right control arms. All done by the Hyundai Dealership. I have all the paperwork. No it wasn't in an accident. Just rusty and was recommended to be replaced. New sensors, New tires, brand new brakes, still have the box, new wheel bearings. Replaced Power steering pump, power steering pressure hose, and power steering reservoir with same OEM parts. I have a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee we drive everyday, so the Hyundai just sits there because the registration is bad since I didn't take it for the emissions test. Needs a flex pipe for the exhaust, found it on ebay for $115, driver side strut, a wheel alignment $40, and an oil change is due now."

- Gun is like new and shows no wear what so ever.  Ran 2 mags thru it and it's been in the night stand ever since. It's Glock, they go boom every time.  Only selling it because I am thinning my collection.

I have misplaced the box in moving so this sale is for the gun and 2 factory mags in a new holster that holds the gun and spare mag.  Because of this I have priced it accordingly and the price is firm.  I know some people want the box with their gun and understand it is part of the value.  If a box is that important you can go to Dean Forest and get a new gun w box for about $580 or so out the door or save $150 and do without the box.  Not meaning that as a jerk just saying.  I personally have never been in a situation where I needed to throw the box at someone to save a life haha."

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.  

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.  Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. 

Features:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
•	Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•	Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish

•	One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel

Historically, its compact size and low weight has made it very popular for conceal carry. 
It is in overall very good condition, with just light scratches along the slide from regular usage. Comes with two S&W mags.
I am open to both trade and sale at this point. As far as sale goes, these run about 675, so shoot me a fair offer and we will discuss it. That being said, please dont waste my time or yours with low-ball offers, this gun is rare and only expected to increase in value.
Trade wise, I am mainly interested in a Gen4 Glock 26 or 27. I will also consider trades for weapons of similar size and caliber, but will expect some cash on top if there is a significant discrepancy in value. I am a CCL holder, so I'm not really interested in any guns that are larger than my 4013tsw.

Upgraded Grip..

No case, no holster.. no gear of any kind just whats listed above. Trade value 350..

Now on this model of Taurus, it originally comes with rubber ""ribbers"" on the grip but apparently they mostly fall off and then you have to drimmel the rest off and then you can put the grip on. That's what it says when I google the model and grip. So I did take the grip off of this gun and the default handle is not pretty but the grip does hide this issue and feels great in your hand. Other then that cosmetic issue under the grip the gun is in great condition. I have filled each magazine multiple times and unloaded all rounds rapidly without issue.

I don't want to be responsible for arming someone who shouldn't be armed and what they may do once armed.. So this is for trade only.. Bill of sale and valid Texas photo ID required. I bought this used, we did bill of sale.. got approved for a credit card a month later and bought a new .40 cal from Gander Mountain so now its for trade.

If you have responded to this ad in the past feel free to contact me again. My phone messed up and I lost all my text message so I have no idea who was messaging me before..

I have decided to sell one of my target guns. I have shot 1/2"" groups at 100 and 5/8"" groups at 200 with 53 grain Hornady VMax's.

The barreled action is a special release Remington 700 VTR in .223. Normal VTR's have a 22"" triangular barrel with a factory muzzle break; my rifle has a 26"" triangular barrel with no break. I have all the paperwork and (I think) the original box.

The trigger has been professionally tuned and breaks at a crisp 2 pounds.

The barreled action is bolted into an Accuracy International AICS 1.5 chassis system. I have painted the stock and it looks great (see pictures below). This thing is solid. Period.

The rifle comes with three Accuracy International ten-round mags.

The bipod, mount, rings, and scope are not included unless otherwise negotiated.

The gun, trigger work, AICS and AI mags - $1275.
Can add a Harris 9-13"" bipod for $50.
Can include the Leupold Mark 4 mount for $100.
Can add a Custom / Professionally cut Pelican for $200.
