The barrel on this revolver shoots from the bottom of the cylinder which greatly reduces perceived recoil. I shot 18 rounds of full house 357 and it was unbelievable on how well it works. Its surprisingly accurate too. The first batch of these handguns had really nasty triggers on them Serial #2000 and below. This one does not have the heavy trigger pull as it was manufactured just last year and is crisp at 4lbs in single action and 8lbs in double action. Be weary of purchasing one of these as the older trigger has a 4lb heavier pull. The cost of a new trigger kit is 170.00 and the gun must be sent to chiappa to have the kit installed. The only reason I am selling is because in April Chiappa is bring out a convertible model that also can shoot 9mm through it.

It’s a straight-forward carbine that should appeal to a wide user base looking for a hard-hitting tactical rifle.

The SRC-308 is a direct-impingement rifle with a 16.5-inch carbine-length barrel and a mid-length gas system. For the buttstock and handguard it uses common A2-style parts but for the magazine and grip they go up a step with a 20-round Magpul PMAG and Hogue over-molded pistol grip.

It is an “optics ready” rifle, meaning it does not come with any sights installed. Optics and iron sights are often a personal preference so this will help keep the overall price down. The SRC-308 has a receiver-height railed gas block and standard flattop upper receiver for mounting iron sights and other optics.

The railed gas block is another Windham design that features an accessory lug and a 12-o’clock quick-detach sling socket built in.

Windham appears to have developed the receivers in-house with lines and contours similar to their carbon fiber rifles. Appearances not withstanding, the SRC-308 is built on hard-anodized 7075-T6 receivers, upper and lower. The lower receiver is reinforced at the buffer tower and has quick-detach sling mounting sockets on both sides of the rifle. The design sports an integral trigger guard for simplicity.

Even with the beefed-up receivers the SRC-308 is fairly lightweight at 7.5 pounds unloaded. Other specifications include an overall length of 32 inches with the stock collapsed (38 with it completely extended), a one-in-10 right hand twist and of course, the barrel is chrome-lined 4150 chromoly-vanadium steel for a long life.

The controls are standard and familiar to anyone with experience with AR-type rifles. While they are right-handed, the lower receiver is marked on both sides for users who prefer to use left-handed or ambidextrous safety selectors.

Sorry about the new listing but the sale is pending on this gun (Haven't received funds or shipped the gun. The picture below is the gun laying on today's newspaper so like all my listings it's a real gun, in my possession and for sale just like the other guns I've sold out of my dad's private collection here on Armslist) and I wanted to keep the listing until the sale was final but had it marked as SOLD.  Some busybody didn't like that and flagged the listing.  But the sale is still pending so that's why the new listing.  And again, sorry for that.

Mauser 08 ""Luger""
(S/42 1938 Dated Chamber)
9mm Para. cal., 4 in. barrel, ""S/42"" stamped rear toggle, chamber dated 1938. 

Category/Grade:  Pistols (NRA) -  Modern Good to Very Good (70%-80%)

The best compliment you can give this Nazi-period WWII Luger is that its all original, and except for condition, there are no major problems. Wear on this pistol is where it should be-on the sideplate, barrel, and grip straps-due to holster wear and usage. Also note very slight pitting on barrel, lower sideplate, and top of slide. All parts have matching serial numbers, with the exception of molded base magazine.

SAFETY
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

Originally designed for the US militaryâ€™s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x50 provides maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This advanced field tactical scope has a wide magnification factor that allows precision accuracy at the longest ranges yet is highly effective for shots at close ranges. With four inches of eye relief, 100 MOA of elevation travel and 20 MOA or 10 mils of travel per turret revolution respectively per turret version, no target will be out of range of this scope. Optional Zero stop elevation turret and standard illuminated reticle compliment the side parallax adjustment. These characteristics have proven highly appropriate for the .50 BMG allowing shooters to accurately reach 200 yards and beyond. With itâ€™s 50mm objective, the NXS 5.5-22x50 retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to wide range of mounting systems. Superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range for the accomplished marksman.

It is all matching (including firing pin and magazine), no rust, no import stamp, vet bring back, and fantastic bluing. There is not one thing off with it, which separates it from examples with one thing wrong (non-matching, rusted up, firing pin repair, incomplete, import stamp) which are much less collectible and significantly less in overall value.

The firing pin is tipped and has not been repaired (which is GOOD and the only sign of a true vet bringback), is complete, and has never had an import stamp. This example is unlike 90% of the ones on the internet where there is something wrong (which makes them undesirable).

I would include:

 a spare (original) firing pin in excellent condition

 a spare set of Wolff springs (in case for some reason one desired to fire it)

a hard case

Don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a pre-built rifle that's not exactly what you want?

I have the equipment and experience to build an AR15 that is a perfect fit for your shooting style, budget, and intended use.  Not sure what you need?  I can advise you on which accessories and parts will work best for you and guide you to the best price for every component.

I have over 15 years experience in the shooting world and have trained and advised many new and experienced shooters.  I am a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and have competed with rifle, pistol, and shotgun.  I'm a skilled machinist and have built dozens of AR15's in various configurations.  I know what works and what doesn't.

To be clear, I will not buy the rifle for you.  If you want to take the guesswork out of gathering the parts, I will give you a list with direct links to order everything or guidance on where to buy locally.  I can guide you step-by-step through the process to ensure that you don't make the same buying mistakes that most shooters figure out only through trial and error.  If you want to purchase the lower receiver and have me gather the rest of the parts, we can arrange that.

My pricing depends on the level of difficulty and amount of involvement.  I do not have a store-front which enables me to do a lot without charging much.  For example, I charge only $50 for a complete build from scratch with your parts.  This includes assembling the lower receiver.  I encourage my customers to be present during the build so that they can learn how to build their next rifle.

Email me with your ideas and we will go from there.  REDACTED"

Bought it about a year ago but never put it on my AR.  

The TRS-25 utilizes a crisp, sharp red dot reticle. A control knob is used to adjust the red dot setting. A certain amount of resistance is designed into the control knob to ensure that the sight is not inadvertently turned on. The red dot may appear blurry if the dot intensity is set too high for the ambient light conditions. This is most likely to occur indoors with artificial, fluorescent lighting. The illumination control knob should only be set at the highest settings for use in bright ambient light conditions; for example, outdoors on a sunny day. An illumination setting that is too high for ambient light conditions typically results in a dot that appears distorted and non-concentric.

I completely understand this is obviously no Colt, Springfield, or Kimber, and naturally for that reason I do not expect to get $700 for it. HOWEVER, this pistol is reliable, accurate, and has great slide to frame, and barrel to slide fitment. There is no more play in this pistol than any of the other high end 1911.**
Now, as for the pistol, it has roughly 400 rounds down the tube and I've run about 4 different types of ammo with no FTF' s or FTE's, but the slide has slight wear from holster in and cycling. It has the black finish with gold/silver inlays. This model had 2 - dot Heine Novak style sights. Other features include skeltonized adjustable trigger, skeleton hammer, ambidextrous thumb safety, high rise beavertail, flat MSH that has 30-lpi checkering, same goes for the front checkering and u del the trigger gaurd. It also utilizes forward cooking serrations, full length guide rod, and a flared ejection port.
This pistol doesn't have the original case, but it does have just a universal case. Came with two Taurus mags, but I have two others totalling 3 8 Rd mags and one flush 7 Rd mag. Anything else you want to know, just ask!"
