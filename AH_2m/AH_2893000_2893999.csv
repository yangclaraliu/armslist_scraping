This is about as close as you can get to ensuring your AR is USA made. BPM is a machine shop in NC. They machine almost every single part in house, including some of the screws and the pins. The guns comes from factory with a stainless thicker barrel, BPM's own barrel nut design(much more heavy duty than a regular barrel nut) and BPMs own rail system and flash hider. Comes with magpul stock, grip and sights. The gun is chambered in .223 wylde, which is a hybrid chamber of .223 rem/5.56. It can handle anytype of .223/5.56 you can put in it with the added accuracy of the .223 chamber. This is a 1/2 inch group gun at 100 yards with iron sights and a good shooter. Gun has about 600 rounds through it. The gun has an eotech holographic sight on it at the moment. Will sell with the gun or separate for the right deal.

This website doesn't even have BPM listed as a manufactor, that it why I chose Armalite even though BPM makes it. I have never seen this gun in WI with another private owner. The only other one I have seen in person was at the gun shop on 84th street in Milwaukee. They were asking 1700 for it with no opic."

Also I priced the ammo across the US here I could find some. My price factors in shipping and or taxes. That's the reality of buying anything. So when factoring that in the prices are consistent. Also I am an army of one and not Cabellas, Sportsman or whatever retailer you want to name, there is always a chance someone list the exact same thing at a lower price. Its called buying power.

I have never bought any of my pistols to take out and shoot at the range as I was merely collecting them. I just figured if I ever had to fire any of them, some unlucky bad person would be on the receiving end. I never got on the Glock bandwagon, even when the LEO's in my family and friends raved about them. I decided a few weeks ago to go look at Glock's and I ended up buying 8 of them. Yes, a senior moment, but not buyers remorse, but more of an impulse buy. While I think they are pretty nice handguns, I overdosed on buying and now want to unload a few of them to free up space in my safe. My desire would be to sell the higher caliber weapons like the .357SIG and .45ACP and keep the rest for my collection.
My prices are firm. I have not opened the boxes, because I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with over $4000 in weapons with storage limitations. I am not interested in trades. I will ask that you sign a bill of sale, be over 21 and have a FL Driver's License and if you have one.....a CCW permit.  Any sales will be in cash and face to face.

Again, I am not interested in any trades. I am being inundated with trade offers and I am not trading. Sell what you have in here and buy one of mine if you want or buy mine then sell yours. Save the background check money and sales tax. I already paid it.

The finish is an easy 95% and the original grips are excellent with no cracks, chips or repairs. They really don't show any wear at all. The bore is about an 8 with some very minor frosting from the old corrosive primers. These Colts are chambered for the 38 rimless smokeless or 38acp which was the forerunner of the 38 super acp. Although the cases are the same dimensions do not shoot the “super” cartridges as they will eventually do much damage to the gun. You can find the older ammo at gun shows or as I do reload to the lower pressures. These are really nice accurate pistols. Im ready to get the shipment done to your FFL.

The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

This M4 represents the first major design change from Colt since their original M4 and is sure to retain its value for many years to come. Only 60 rounds have been fired through this gun since purchase. There are NO issues whatsoever. I have equipped this rifle with precision shooting in mind. You need only add a quality scope to have one of the very best production M4's made.

374,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2893374,For Sale:  TASER LIKE NEW M18L WITH LASER,"RIO RANCHO NEW MEXICO 87144, Albuquerque, New Mexico",$ 450,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 2, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Advanced Taser M-18 series has almost 100% effectiveness rating. It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. MSRP OVER $500.

It combines the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) technology. In police studies, the new Advanced Taser has a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun. The Advanced Taser shoots out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire. 50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.

NEW Electro-Muscular Disruption (EMD) Technology
There are two categories of energy weapons: Stun weapons and EMD weapons. 
STUN WEAPONS: Traditional stun technology weapons operate in a 7-14 Watt range and interfere with the communication signals within the nervous system of the target. These stun systems primarily effect the sensory nervous system. Like static on the communication lines between the brain and the body, stun systems interfere with the human command and control systems. However, a small percentage of people with a very high tolerance for electrical stimulation can fight through the effect of these 7-14 Watt systems. The AIR TASER 44000 series is a stun weapon using the same settings used by law enforcement for over 20 years. 
EMD WEAPONS: EMD weapons use a more powerful 18 to 26 Watt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control the skeletal muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the M-Series to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. The ADVANCED TASER M-Series are EMD weapons -- specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, the ADVANCED TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do: contract until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The ADVANCED TASER provides for maximum safety for both the officer and the subject by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. MSRP OVER $500.

$1,200 cash or will look at good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state exactly what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. etc. either way, so I know the deal.  If you respond with, ""I have a Beretta 92FS INOX I will trade"" and mention nothing else, I will think you want a straight trade and kindly pass.  Again, let me know what you want to do.

Not in need of anything at all right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of since I know cash can be tight for folks, not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know, I can add ammo, cash or?? Maybe 1-4x like the Burris set up with Fast Fire red dot on top.
Maybe the Burris MTAC 1.5-6x40mm
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool. 
Daewoo
Colts 
FAL 308/7.62 
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal.  
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too. 
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,

.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

If you look at the third picture you can see that all the color is still there and looking like new. Rifle has not been shot much. The rifle is really clean and in real good condition.

Comes with one box or Remington ammo. 20 rounds.

Asking $800 (will consider reasonable offers) need money for a new build.

Super Semi-Automatic Trigger Overview

The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA) Trigger is the semi-auto only version of a select fire trigger that Geissele makes for U.S. SOCOM. The SSA is a non-adjustable combat trigger, it is not a match trigger. The second stage break is like a carrot rather than an icicle. Suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and mid-range carbine work, the Geissele SSA is also the perfect trigger for Squad Designated Marksman (SDM) rifles. A short summary of the Geissele SSA features and advantages follows.



1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter

The Geissele SSA has a pull weight of about 4.5lb. 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage. The pull weights and sear engagement are non adjustable.

Trigger and hammer are made from quality tool steel 

Sear surfaces are cut by a wire edm machine. Sears cut this way are very accurate and the non-directional surface finish of the wire edm gives a smooth trigger pull without the associated grittiness of directional machining marks left by a milling cutter.

The initial force needed to start the disengagement of the sear surfaces is low and the force linearly increases at a low rate. This helps the shot to fall at the initial point of aim and aids in building shooter confidence in his weapons ability to put the rounds where his sight is pointing.

The Geissele SSA trigger allows the shooter to slap through the trigger pull on close in shots but also set up a long range shot with a crisp trigger break.

A full force hammer spring is used for quick locktime and positive ignition of all types of ammo. No lightened hammer spring is used.

The hammer is lighter than a standard AR15 hammer. The lightened hammer favorably decreases locktime and increases accuracy of the weapon, especially for snap shots.



2. Advantages for the Armorer

The Geissele SSA is a simple design that is very similar to the original M16 trigger. The number of parts is identical.

There are no adjustment screws to come loose. 

All springs are captive; they will not get lost during disassembly in the field 

The entire trigger can be dissembled for cleaning (no rivets or staked parts) 

The trigger can be installed without removing the safety 

Sear engagement is pre-set from the factory. 

Hammer and trigger pins are a close slip fit into nominal receiver holes so the trigger can be installed and removed with rudimentary tools.

Triggers come with a slave pin for the trigger/disconnector assembly for easy installation.



3. Safety Advantages

The Geissele SSA is a 2 stage trigger where there is generous overlap of the sear surfaces which contributes to safety and a low tendency of any inadvertent movement of the trigger to discharge the weapon.

The Geissele SSA has a patented pseudo sear that is almost identical to the standard AR15 single stage sear. However, this secondary sear has surfaces that never touch during normal operation. This sear prevents the hammer from falling unless the trigger is pulled.

The secondary safety sear contributes to shooter confidence in dynamic/vehicle situations where a fellow shooter’s muzzle may cover him. There is firm knowledge that even with the safety in the fire position the weapon can never discharge unless the trigger is pulled.

Trigger timing is robust and parts have been sized to operate with a certain amount of wear to the working surfaces. The trigger is designed to operate in dusty, abrasive environments that cause wear.

This isn't a pistol for the boring range goer with a collection of safe queens, this is for the man or woman that carries a pistol daily and developes a relationship with their weapon, and loves to shoot often.  This 1911 is super reliable, and has eaten every type of ammo I've given it with a smile, and asked for more, including every type of hollowpoint I could find.  This is a single owner gun, which has been maintained by myself - a US Marine. If you know one of us, you know how serious we are about weapons maintenance, and should find peace concerning the care of this 1911.

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

Swarovski Optik produces some of the world's finest optical designs and products. From their beginnings in 1905 until today, founder Daniel Swarovski's ""Constantly improving what is good"" motto has endured as a company mantra. Their brilliant, innovative optical products & designs exemplify their commitment to uncompromising quality.

Seasoned hunters rely on maximum concentration & intense observation for a successful hunt. Physical exertion, reliable gear and a bit of luck must also be factored in, but without being able to see your target, you can not hit your target. How often have you wished that your riflescope could deliver more zoom or even a teeny bit wider view? If it were possible, think of all the shots you've had to pass on becoming a reality.

Swarovski, who is always on the cutting edge of technological advancements, once again raises the bar by introducing the Z6 line of riflescopes. While most variable power riflescopes offer a modest zoom, the Z6 series delivers a broad (6x) magnification range. This enhanced field of view makes your favorite hunting firearm more versatile while eliminating the need for a second or third optics purchase. The Swarovski Z6 1.7-10x42 Riflescope is not just another sighting system with fancy specifications; it is rugged, dependable and repeatable. Hunters who have attempted to gain positive target acquisition on fast moving game will greatly appreciate the low 1.7x magnification setting. Longer shots can be executed easily when the power is dialed up to 10x for maximum magnification. From the ocular to the objective, inside and out, this scope is a world class performer that will get you on target quickly and accurately.

To use a riflescope with your firearm, you'll need a mounting base and mounting rings in addition to the scope itself. Bases attach to your firearm and rings attach to your scope. By affixing the scope mounted rings to the rifle mounted base you create a reliable accurate, and secure sighting system. Proper spacing of the rings, as well as the ring height should be considered to ensure a proper line of sight can be established. This will maximize the value of your investment, and enhance your shooting experience. It should be noted that in many mounting applications, a professional gunsmith's skills will be needed for proper installation.

Key Features

Parallax Correction
    Factory preset to 109.4 yd (100m) 

• Swarotop Coatings
    Proprietary lens coatings increase light transmission & micro-grooves on the edges of lens elements prevent residual reflections inside the tube for bright, high-contrast images under all lighting conditions. 

• Temperature Ranges
    Operating: -4 to 131°F (-20 to +55°C)
    Storage: -22 to +158°f (-30 to +70°C) 

• Waterproof and Fogproof
    Nitrogen purged main tube is waterproof to 13' (4.0m) 

• BR Reticle in the Second Focal Plane
    The BR Ballistic Reticle is designed for long-range target acquisition. Alternating dots and hash marks on the 6 o'clock stadia provide hold-over points when targeting at great distances. The wide gate offers a clear view of the surrounding area, while medium length heavy posts at 3, 9, and 12 o'clock help to center your eye quickly.
    This scope has the reticle positioned in the second focal plane so its dimension does not change when adjusting the magnification level. This leaves the sight picture unobstructed for a clear view at all times.

To buy the pistol and extra mag new today with tax will cost you $ 714.42, the 25 rds. of Hornady Critical Duty ammo $ 26.49, the 250 rounds of Remington UMC is $ 115.54, the 50 res of Winchester is $ 25.43. 

So to simplify $ 714.42 pistol & accessories + $ 167.46 ammo = $ 881.88 for the total package new, 

I will sell you the pistol with the accessories (everything in the box and 1 extra mag.) AMMO NOT INCLUDED, for $ 560.00 if you have a CPL or Purchase Permit, I will sell all the Ammo for $90.00 more, or the total package for $ 650.00. Thats almost $250.00 off the new price,

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for 
people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™,
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter
exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of
shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

I think this case has been to the range once or twice but that is it. Never in the field or been subjected to use or abuse.

SLIPITS are a new benchmark in knives, non-locking one-hand open folders with pocket clips. Bob T's SLIPIT has a CMP-S30V modified Wharncliff blade that to close must overcome the resistance of a small ball bearing. Bob calls this a Ball Joint non-locking system; he's developed and refined on many custom pieces for close to a decade. The Ball Joint also half-stops the blade when closing for safety. Behind the cutting edge he placed a finger choil/guard keeping the index finger away from the open blade and keeping the blade from closing on the hand when cutting. He also made the blade under three inches keeping it legal in most jurisdictions and countries (England and Germany to name a couple) for carry anywhere. Woven Carbon fiber handle and backspacer make this carry friendly SLIPIT both hi-tech and luxurious. Left/right pocket clip is nested in its' mounting and won't pivot or loosen. A folded leather lanyard comes with it, tied off with a silver crimp.

AR500 Armor® Carbon Nanotube Soft Body Armor is Ultra-Light, Ultra-Thin, and extremely Flexible. Carbon Nanotube Soft Body Armor is the pinnacle of soft armor technology. Utilizing the latest Carbon Nanotube technology and proprietary Non-Newtonian back-face foam, AR500 Armor® CNT body armor is the most robust, light-weight, flexible, and affordable level IIIA soft body armor in the industry!

Now available in 10"" x 12"" with our patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut! Equip your existing plate carrier with the latest technology in soft body armor. IIIA rated for pistol threats up to .44 Magnum, and .357 Sig, and compatible with any plate carrier capable of accepting Medium and Large SAPI plates. Our CNT body armor performs excellent in a concealed plate carrier stand-alone or in conjunction with AR500 Armor® Level III body armor for added comfort and blunt force trauma mitigation. While running in conjunction with hard armor you can simply drop your level III hard plates when you require a light weight and flexible IIIA armor system.

Carbon Nanotubes have finally found their way into body armor applications. AR500 Armor® is proud to lead the way with this new technology. Carbon Nanotubes are tiny strands with incredible strength, described as being as harder than diamonds. The addition of Carbon Nanotubes increases effectiveness in multi-hit capabilities and allows creation of a lighter weight, thinner profile, more reliable, and robust armor solutions than body armor that use only Dyneema, Kevlar, or Aramid. Soft armor consisting of only Kevlar and/or Dyneema often costs more, weighs more, and requires more layers making them thicker, less flexible, and less ergonomic.

Back face deformation is also a concern with soft body armor as it directly translates to what you feel in the event of taking a round. Existing soft armor on the market uses high density foam to increase comfort and decrease back face deformation. AR500 Armor® Carbon Nanotube soft body armor uses a Non-Newtonian foam, a material that instantaneously hardens under pressure which improves performance by decreasing back face deformation and more efficiently spreads energy throughout a larger surface area of the body armor. This results in less energy transfer through the soft armor, and less back face deformation compared to traditional, thicker, high density foams.

Specifications:

Size: 10"" x 12"", Advanced Shooters Cut -- Patent Pending (Right hand cut by default, Left hand by request only)

Weight: 1.0 lb.

Orientation: WEAR WITH ARMOR LABEL FACING BODY

Maintenance: AR500 Armor® Carbon Nanotube body armor is sealed in a durable rip-stop nylon sleeve. Anti-Microbial properties protect against odor, fungi, and bacteria. Simply wipe with warm damp cloth to clean.

Our new line utilizes the absolute latest advancements in soft body armor technology. AR500 Armor® will always stay true to our philosophy of offering the most reliable, and affordable body armor in the industry.

Our 6"" x 8"" Carbon Nanotube side plates weigh in at just 6.9oz per panel! These aren't just meant to stop fragments and low velocity pistol rounds like other soft side armor plates you'll find. Our entire Carbon Nanotube soft armor line-up is IIIA rated and capable of defeating heavy hitting pistol threats up to .44 magnum, and .357 sig. Fits in all side plate pouches able to accept 6"" x 8"", and 8"" x 8"" side plates; will also fit inside hollow cummerbunds such as the Banshee and XL plate carrier with the 8"" side in horizontal orientation, or they can be installed in traditional side plate pockets with the 8"" side vertical orientation. These are ideal for light weight platforms where mobility and/or concealment traits are desired over rifle protection. Minimal interference, improved mobility, and flexibility are reason enough to own a pair.

Tires are good on it. Would make a good first car, or reliable work vehicle/winter vehicle. The 4x4 works great.

Only things wrong with it that I am aware of is the rear trunk door is stuck shut. (I never use it often and recently the handle stopped working.) You can open it from the inside but not the outside. And there is a small bit of rust on the gas door. (Typical chevy)
