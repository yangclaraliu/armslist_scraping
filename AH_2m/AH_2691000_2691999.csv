Description: Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights. The full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components. The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

The SIG516 Patrol by Sig Sauer is one of the most advanced and versatile AR-based rifles available. The SIG516 Patrol rifles use the innovative Sig Sauer short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. The free-floating military-grade barrel is chrome-lined and phosphated, and the rifle features an adjustable four-position gas regulator. The SIG516 Patrol also features a free-floating M1913 quad rail and flip-up adjustable iron sights."

328,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2691328,For Sale:  Threading & Cerakote services,"Winston-Salem, Winston Salem, North Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Friday, May 2, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Turn down & thread rifle barrel.  Extend & thread pistol barrel.  All threading work is done concentric to the bore, indicated off the lands in a 4-jaw chuck.  More precise than a factory threaded barrel and accurate enough for a very tight bore silencer with no fear of baffle strikes.  Custom thread protectors to match can be included.  Threaded barrel extensions are 416 stainless steel unless another material is requested.  Barrels are re-crowned.  All threads cut single point

Cerakote finishing - see some samples of my work below.  From simple one color coats to patterns or camo.  

I have a 9-5 but still faster turnaround than sending your work off.

Pictures - threading work from L to R: Beretta U22 Neos, Sig P229, Remington 700, Beretta 92.  Closeup of extended, threaded P229 9mm barrel.  Examples of some Cerakote projects.

This ad generates many questions so maybe this will help you out:

1.  How much does it cost?
A:  That depends.  Many factors.  For threading, what specifically do you want done?  Do you want a thread protector too?  For Cerakote, how many colors, which colors, any patterns, and am I detail stripping and reassembling your gun or are you?

For ballpark pricing.... to extend & thread a pistol barrel for something like a Beretta 92 or Sig P220 would be around $70 + $10 for a thread protector.  To take your fully assembled 1911 and Cerakote it in one solid color I have to special order would be around $200

2.  Can you do my AK-47?
A:  Short answer is no.  I won't remove/install a barrel on an AK type action - I just don't have the right press/tooling to do that.  If you want to do that yourself, I'll work on it.  But I'd need a stripped barrel to thread it.  I'd need a detail stripped AK to Cerakote it and you will need to do the full reassembly.

3.  How long does it take?
A:  Generally a week - 10 days.  Depends on how busy I am with my 'real job' and how much other work I have in front of yours.  If I have to order a Cerakote color I don't stock that adds time too.

4.  Can you Cerakote wood/plastic/polymer/etc?
A:  Yes.  Certain things like scopes require the high temp Cerakote which is air cured and not as durable as the heat cured, but they can be finished in Cerakote. 

5.  My gun is beat to hell.  Can you fix gouges, scratches, dents, etc?
A:  Maybe.  Very light scratches or scuffs will be removed by the blasting process that's part of the Cerakote prep.  Something deeper may be able to be filled.  I can make it look better, but depending on how far gone it is I won't promise to make it look new.  Cerakote is applied 1 mil (0.001"") thick - it's not going to ""fill in"" or ""hide"" any defects.

6.  Can you custom match a color?
A: No.  Cerakote material is expensive and adding a little of this & a little of that until it's a perfect match - when cured - to something else would end up in a lot of time and material waste.  Check out NIC Industries website for all the colors offered & you'll find something real close to what you want.  I'll do a custom mix to lighten or darken a standard color.  I can also adjust the sheen on many colors to control how flat or glossy it comes out within the limitations of that particular color or mix."

About my business: I am a small, home based business that specializes in providing my customers with some of the lowest prices in the state of Utah on new firearms as well as providing excellent customer service and support. As a home business with no additional employees, I have very low overhead operating expenses, and as such, I pass these savings on to my customers. I sell ONLY Brand New, fresh from the factory firearms which are covered with full manufacturers’ warranties. I DO NOT deal with refurbished or remanufactured merchandise of any kind.

As a home business, I operate “By Appointment Only”. I am here nearly all the time, but I do have to occasionally step out to run errands.

I am available Tuesday through Saturday from 9:00am to 7:00pm. (closed for lunch and errands from 1:00 to 2:00 pm daily)

Today I am selling a cast aluminum propane simulation fire m2 machine gun. The barrel has been modified for easy transport and the entire gun was recently sandblasted and repainted.

I've also got a WWII era M23 equilibrium mount I can include for an additional fee as well as a robotic remote control power chair base that's ready to use.

Has the 5.4L Triton V8 engine. Has brand new Mastercraft Courser MT tires on it that were purchased and drove less than 200 miles on. They were a little over $800. Brand new battery was purchased just before Xmas. Dual 3.5"" exhaust. Light bar with 4x 100 watt lights, toolbox in the bed, and a system. The speakers and amp currently do not come with truck, but we can talk about throwing them in depending on price.

This is a work truck, not a show truck. The inside and outside could both do with a good cleaning and still won't look brand new. This truck won't win you a trophy at a beauty contest, but it will allow you to pull your buddy's import with his $5 fart cannon from Auto Zone out of a ditch while you have a deer strapped to your hood and 6 kegs in the bed with mud caked to every inch of the truck. It was made to tow, not to show.

The truck has sat for the last month or so, could use a tune up but ran strong. Brother lost his job and couldn't afford gas to keep chasing the girls. He needs to get into something more economical. Not looking for any trades, cash is king, no tire kickers or joy rides. Price is negotiable. Four wheel drive works as it should. The truck runs and drives fine, but if you want to drive it home you may want to bring some gas. He ran it pretty empty before parking it.

I've been doing business and have been on the internet long enough to sniff out pathetic scams. Waste not my time or your own."

(All of these models under 19,500 serial to be considered Pre Ban. Comes with everything in the box as it came from the factory. I even have the oil soaked cardboard wrap that was in the barrel! 2 original Colt 20 round magazines, factory removable carry handle with rear sight. Colt AR-15 Pre-Ban, 1989-Sept. 11, 1994 Mfg. w/blue label box. Production features include a small front takedown pin, internal sear block, reinforcement around the magazine release button, flash hider, no bayonet lug on 20"" models, A2 sights, brass deflector, and forward bolt assist. Models R6430 and 6450 do not have A2 sights, brass deflector, or forward bolt assist. Blue label boxed AR-15's were mfg. between 1989 to Sept. 11, 1991. This is the true R6700 20 inch H-Bar barrel with 1:9 twist, 600 meter rear sighting system in the factory carry handle, dovetailed upper receiver grooved to accept Weaver style scope rings. 8.5lbs. The intended purpose of this rifle was for hunting prairie dogs. Rifle was taken out and 200 rounds of brass 223 was run through it on 2 occasions to test it and sight in the factory sights. The prairie dog hunt never happened and the rifle was put back in the box and has set in the safe as it is now since 1994. The owners manual is inside the box but it has dried out and has some of the paper flaked out. It literally had not left the box and was locked in the safe and I'm not sure how the manual ended up this way, but it is how it is. Everything besides the manual is 99.999999% perfect shape for being 20 years old. The original box and all that came inside of it is in with the rifle. I will put the original box with all inside in another outer box to ship to whatever FFL you choose. You are responsible for knowing if this rifle is legal for you to own. The serial number is CH008085 so you can do your own research and verify whatever you need to. Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll do my best to answer. I'm a FFL and purely listing this for the original owner. He brought it over for pictures and took it back to his home. I will be handling all the shipping/handling/transfer etc. The round count is exactly 200 rounds 20 years ago. Bore is perfect and all trigger/action/etc. is normal Colt smooth! I am a FFL and will ship to your FFL where this is legal to own. AK, HI, and CA are extra. You must specify if you want shipping insurance. I will accept postal money orders and credit cards.

That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

This Adams Arms AR-15 A3 Base Carbine Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. This Base Carbine upper comes equipped with a 16"" melonite-finished barrel, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle, picatinny rail gas block, delta ring assembly and a set of polymer M4-style handguards. Additional features include a forged A3 flat-top configuration that's ready to accept the shooter's choice of optic and/or rear iron sight, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, and a carbine length gas system. 

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. 

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.

 Last year Indiana changed the casing length to 1.8 inches.  I have a gunsmith
 CF Gunworks LLC  that took  the 350 Remington Magnum  and shortened that casing to 1.8 inches
 Which is what this cartridge now is. You can’t  buy this ammo or the gun ,they 
 have to be custom made which is why they are expensive. The .357 and .44 magnums are just another example of Indiana Deer Legal cartridges that you can use. This is a High Powered Rifle that has been modified to meet Indiana specs and requirements . This rifle is 100 % legal to hunt with in Indiana .
Don’t wait for Deer season to decide you want one, you won’t be able to. This is someone’s chance to own
a very nice Indiana Deer Legal High Powered Rifle of which only a hand full are available.

I have a custom built Remington Model 700 That was a 350 Remington Magnum
it has been shortened to 1.8 inch. Indiana Deer Legal casing
the factory barrel has been bedded and set back to shorten the chamber.
It comes with Redding Dies that have been ground to match. 
I have brass and about 30rds of ammo that was made by C F Gunworks.
It is toped off with a leupold 3x9.
This rifle killed 3 deer at over 300yds this past season. It is amazing!!
I would like $1600 with scope or $1400 without.

This Rifle was custom built to Indiana Specs!!!!! And is referred to as a 350 JR
 This cartridge is modeled after the Remington 350 Magnum. They shorten the case
 to 1.8 inches, I took a picture so you can see the cartridge, bullet is 200grn
and clearly meets Indiana guide lines. I hope this helps with the confusion. 
Certain rifles like the .357 magnum or .44 magnum can be bought at walmart
and are perfectly legal. Indiana says you can't go below .357 magnum. This rifle can't

Spending as little as possible on a home-defense shotgun that passes years under the bed keeping the dust bunnies company isn’t a bad idea—a home-defense weapon essentially needs to be there when you need it and deliver lethal force with reliability. The Turkish-made 12 gauge pump-action shotgun that author Jay Langston recently tested does just that. The SARPASP has an 18.5-inch, drilled, steel barrel with a thorough hone job. The chamber accepts both 2¾- and 3-inch Mag. Of range testing, the author reports, “I burned up a wide assortment of field loads to ascertain reliability. I went through all 105 rounds without a malfunction.” To find out what kind of mayhem this $369 pump action delivered at 10 and 25 yards, check out the 2014 issue of The Complete Book Of Guns, available on newsstands and digitally on July 9, 2013.
