The laminate wood stock has nice checkering on the grip and forearm, a rubber butt pad, and a raised cheekrest. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. This rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

I will sell the rifle seperate from the scope, mount, caps, and rings for $650.00. For the Leupold scope, rings, caps, and mount, I am asking $425.00. For the whole package, I am asking $1000.00. You can keep the sales tax! Shipping is available for a marginal amount. Face to face transaction is possible.

It has a polychoke which lets you change from open, modified, and full choke with just a click, which is great for hunting. It has been used to hunt quail, dove, turkey, and ducks for most of its life. It has been used, but it still functions flawlessly. It doesn't have any cracks or major pitting. Everything works and looks good, still nice and tight. The reason I'm looking to sell or trade is because I'm looking for something more tactical and more practical for me. I'm open to trades and I'm looking for anything tactical, which includes handguns, rifles, or shotguns. I'd like to have a handgun like a glock, sig, fn, h&k, beretta. I'd also like to have a nice rifle like an ar15, ak47, ak74, long range rifle. Or a nice shotgun that I can use to hunt with or is tactical and don't mind getting dirty. I also would consider anything with a motor, dirtbike, fourwheeler, car, truck. I can put cash on top of my shotgun for anything that I like to even out the difference if you have something nicer. Try me, you never know maybe we could work something out.  Feel free to text or call me at 865-806-5351. Or email. I'm open to anything. Thanks and have a nice day."

I got this to try out the ergonomics and function on them. Ordered it several weeks ago and during the meantime I found my grail gun, a SW 686-4 .357 Magnum that I spent nearly $800 on. Wife says I don't get to keep both so the Beretta is for sale.

 This gun is amazing. The fit and finish is excellent and the design is pure Beretta awesomeness. It came in an expensive plastic case with padding and the gun's logo on both sides. Beretta quality is second to none, I trust my life on a 92A1 every time I carry it. 

 It comes with everything shown in the pictures. 20 round magazine, lock, case and I didn't even take any tags off of it. Included is 1100 rounds of Federal .22LR. I understand .22LR is impossible to find right now so it made sense to include a significant amount of ammo from my supply so that you can enjoy this gun. My two remaining .22LR guns don't see much action anymore anyways. Price is very firm at $450 and I will not sell the ammo without the gun. If you don't need the .22LR I will accept $400 cash. Private sale FTF only no tax and no shipping/paperwork. It has NOT been fired it is brand new.

 I am a safe person to deal with and can generate a bill of sale if you desire one. I also have an Oklahoma handgun license and am always responsibly carrying. Contact via email or call/text at 4zero5-4seven4-058five. If you are reading this it is for sale to first come first served."

1911 Magazine, .45 ACP, Full-Size, 7 Round, Lo-Profile Steel Base Pad, Black

  For the past three decades Wilson Combat has produced some the worlds best, most reliable magazine for the timeless .45 ACP. Considered a top tier magazine, they've been proven to be some of the most durable and reliable magazines in the industry. 

  Made form the highest tensile strength heavy duty spring wire, these magazines are able to remain fully loaded for prolonged periods of time without becoming fatigued and resulting in long service life. The springs are specifically designed to produce sure feeding and to prevent side-to-side movement of the ammunition within the magazine. 

  The magazine body is made of .027"" aircraft grade certified 17-7 PH stainless steel and heat treated. This process produces a precision magazine which will not hang-up when changing magazines, and the feed lips remain intact and don't crack even under severe duty use. 

  FEATURES:
 • Increased Reliability

• Resists Corrosion

• Thickest walls in the industry

• Maximum Durability and Service Life

• Fiber-filled Nylon Self-Lubricating Follower Provides Smooth Round Feeding

• Maximum Tensile Strength Heavy Duty Spring

• Enhanced Feeding and Positive Slide Lock Operation﻿

• ﻿Lo-Profile Steel Base Pad means easy Maintenance and Versitile Base Pad Options

• Rugged black MELONITE QPQ nitride surface﻿ treatment provides enhanced surface finish and lubricity; will NOT crack, peel or rust﻿

• Witness Slots on both sides for rapid round-count checks

• Extended skirt on follower prevents creep when magazine is empty

• ﻿Enhanced base pad provides sure grip when reloading providing faster reloads

Like no other pistol, Glock magazines of the same caliber permit almost unrestricted compatibility of the magazines. Higher capacity standard magazines, for instance, can be used in backup weapons; You can use .40 S&W caliber Glock 22 and Glock 23 magazines in your Glock 27, or use 9mm Glock 17 and Glock 19 magazines in your Glock 26. 

GLOCK magazines have a stiff metal tube encased in the proven GLOCK high-tech polymer. This resists deformation – even when dropped from great height or exposed to extreme environment conditions.

These features allow the user to carry concealed whether wearing professional dress clothes or shorts and a loose shirt during the hot summer months. Whether for use as a Principle Security Detail (PSD) mission duty rig, off-duty carry, or for descrete concealed carry, this is the new choice of professionals and law-abiding armed citizens alike.

IN STOCK OR YOU CANNOT ORDER IT FROM US!  When ordered from G Code or other dealers you will wait months to receive your items.  WE KEEP THESE IN STOCK!The all new G Code Kydex Single Magazine Carriers are ideal for either concealed carry, or tactical uses. Better than any other design, they have a close, compact profile making them easier to conceal and unlikely to snag or catch in close tactical environments. With a unique single screw tension adjustment, the wearer can adjust the magazine retention. These magazine carriers come equipped with the highly sought after Cobra Paddle designed and manufactured in house by G Code. Strong, durable, and extremely rugged, these magazines holders are refined enough to wear in any environment. Perfect for wear in casual, business casual, or even formal or black tie environments, any professional conducting Principle Security Detail (PSD) missions, plain clothes operations, and personal concealed carry weapon (CCW) applications can benefit from having this multiple magazine type carrier. Depending on which handgun magazines you use, one magazine carrier may hold several of your different magazines types. For example, the GSM02 model holds magazines for Glock 17, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27 and Glock 36s. With the single-screw adjustment, you fit 9mm, .40 S&W, .357 Sig, and the Glock 36's .45ACP single stack magazine in the same magazine carrier which provides you with more versatility when switching weapons and load out. Like the G Code Double Magazine Carriers, the single magazine carriers can also be configured differently to fit multiple roles and kit. We also carry products from EOTech, Sightmark, Firefield, G Code, Tactical Edge, Ruger, Glock, Sig, Aimpoint, HSG, Blackhawk, Magpul, P Mag, and even the G Code / Travis Haley INCOG Holster System."

I bought it for my 10-year old son for this past deer season. I zeroed the scope and he fired a few shots to get used to it including one that he got about a 75lb hog with. After that it was fired twice during Youth Special Season; 1 time on October 25th to take his first deer and 1 more time on October 26th to get his second. Both were one-shot kills. Neither deer took a single step, other than to fall, after they were hit.  
The rifle cost $229 new and the scope cost $259 new. I am also including the sling and cartridge carrier. The total, including tax, for all of these items is around $520.
The only reason I am selling this combo is that we hog hunt alot now and my son wants a little faster rate of fire."

The firearm is chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 16 inch barrel and standard A2 flash hider. One unique aspect of the Rhino Arms AR-15 is the addition of a reinforced magwell (easily seen in the pictures) which makes the rifle tough enough for extremely hard use, though i've babied it myself-- approximately 400 rounds have passed through the chamber (it runs steel cased ammo as well as it does brass). I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be. I purchased the rifle new in 2010 in stock configuration and proceeded to add the following accessories:

Stag Arms 6-position retractable stock
Blackhawk ergonomic Grip
Blackhawk quad rail
Magpul AFG2
Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight

Ruger LCP - LNIB, box, manual, spent factory shell, etc. low round count on this LCP. Very good ratings on this gun but just doesn't fit my hand well at all. I fired approx 70 flawless rounds through this gun with FMJ and JHP. I purchased an extra mag and have ran both mags through it with no issues. LCP was 349.99 +tax (still have receipt). extra mag was 29.99 and Uncle Mike's pocket holster was $12. I have 131 rounds of .380 (108 Winchester white box, 18 CorBon, 5 Hornady Critical Defense). retail on ammo, no mark up is $95. That's over $500 in package deal. 
-----$425-----

Remington 870 Super Magnum Express 12ga - 28"" vent ribbed Field Barrel, black synthetic stock, front bead sight, uses 2 3/4"" - 3"" shells, holds 4+1 2 3/4"" shells. this shotgun is in good condition. a few wear marks here and there but nothing serious. like all 870 shotguns this is a workhorse and shoots like a dream. great pump action. comes with an OD green shotgun sleeve and a 25ct box of Federal Champion 2 3/4"" 8 shot Target loads. 
-----$250-----

 Marlin Model 60 - 14+1 capacity, in really nice shape, gold trigger, flawless wood stock, desert tan ATI tactical Dragunov stock, brown and beige Winchester rifle case, .22lr ammo (177 Remington Golden HP, 100 Federal Champion standard velocity).

Medical issues force sale of this bullpup. Overall length is 26 and 1/4"". Barrel length is 16"" It's the most sought after rare ""sino-soviet"" model. Milled receiver; not a cheap yugo or what-have-you. Chrome-lined barrel with good crown. Was imported as a Cowboy's companion, but the wood stock was pitched when I installed the Bullpup kit.

It has had a trigger job and most of the trigger creep was removed. It now has positive sear engagement with an estimated 8 lb. trigger pull. It has medium trigger/sear springs yet, so no light strike issues. It was bought in 1993 before the Clinton ban, and I can confirm it has a low round count.

The crown is good and with the 1MOA Eotech, will give ~2MOA from a bench without a bench vise using Import steel ammo. Think Kalishnikov reliability but with better accuracy. It has backup flip-up Magpul sights.

The bolt has been modified to accept magazines with the bolt forward and the bolt does lock back on the last round, so if you're into the tactical/speed thing, that's a plus. You can change mags about as fast as an AK47..

The Eotech is model 511 F revision (fixed battery issue) and the glass has no scratches. Very minor marks on the protective steel hood. It's smaller than the 512 and weighs less. It is NV capable.

There are 5 20-rd Tapco mags with bolt hold-open followers and 1 40-rd steel mag that works fine. 400 rounds of Hollow point Wolf come with it.

I will sell the Eotech separately for $350 firm, but would prefer to sell as a package deal. Asking $1200 for all of it, including the ammunition. I have a ""tactical"" vest in Multicam that will hold 6 of the tapco mags if there's interest in that. Pic with computer is to show scale of how compact this package is.

Thanks for looking.

Mitch Rosen leather IWB holster. Originally bought as my CCW and then ended up buying a Glock 19.

13 rounds Hornady defense through it 
50 rounds Blazer ball

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.
