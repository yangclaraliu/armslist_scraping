98,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2811098,For Sale/Trade:  Percussion converted Revolutionary War Era De Culle .69 cal musket,"Chicago, Chicago, Illinois",$ 850,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 10, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is your chance to own a 200 + year old weapon. It was a revolutionary war period flint lock that was converted to percussion. This gun has been in my family since the 1940's. 

The name De Culle marked on the lock. The gun is clearly 1777 french patterned model similar to a Charlieville either Dragoon or Navy. I could only find 2 examples of a De Culle weapon on line. One was a Lock that was by itself and no info, the other was a converted 1822 pistol that was considerably newer with more markings. The full name on those samples where Mre Rle De Culle whereas this gun is Mre ump De Culle.

It is a .69 Cal. It was definitely a Flintlock when it was manufactured. The barrel length 40.5"" overall 55.5 barrel tip to top of butt plate. There is a cheek cut on the left side of the butt stock and there is the two finger grip ridges behind the trigger guard which where both constant with the 1777 French pattern. Further, the brass fittings including trigger guard are consistent with the Navy versions of that arm. Finally there is a casting mark on the inside of the front barrel band that appears to me to be 1780 or 1790 followed by 140, but it is quite eroded.  

We were told it was converted to percussion by the confederacy for the civil war. There appears to be inspector stamps (IC) on the lock, outside of the trigger guard, the front barrel band and very lightly visible on the stock just behind the brass lock screw backing plate (I am not sure what that part is called). 

The hammer and hammer retaining screw are not original as they were not on the gun when i got it. In the 70's I adapted a Springfield type hammer to get it fire-able.

I have included a good many detail pictures. I have these are available in high res. If you need others let me know.

It is similar in form to a WALTHER PPK but was manufactured by FEG, a well-reputed Hungarian company that improved on the Walther design by adding a firing pin block safety. It has a steel slide and titanium alloy frame. Built to last a lifetime.

The pistol measures about 7 inches long and 4.5 high. I have big hands and it's a very comfortable gun to hold and shoot. 7.65 Browning is the same as 32 acp which is a nice round for range shooting and is not to be sneezed at. (Hitler committed suicide with this round.) The European guns generally prefer precision Euro ammo made by companies like Fiocchi or Prvi Partisan which are excellent and cheap rather than Winchester or other American ammo that can be a hair longer.

This gun looks superficially rough but it only needs a little clean-up work to look really nice. There is a bit of holster wear (extremely superficial pitting near the front of the slide) and some fleabites on the front of the grip. It will greatly improve if it's stripped and re-blacked which is not difficult. It currently has silver coating on the exposed part of the barrel inside the slide opening that looks okay but should be stripped as well.  

I used it as a range gun and it was always very reliable and accurate. I haven't been to the range lately so it can probably use a little cleaning and fresh grease on the rails.

It is very easy to take down. It has the same kind of pull-down trigger guard as a Makarov then the slide lifts up and off. It's a low maintenance gun and with a little clean-up will be a very cool reliable pistol worthy of James Bond.

Nice cloth gun case is included."

The Franchi SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun manufactured by Italian firearms company Franchi from 1979 to 2000.  Only five percent (about 1,850) of the estimated SPAS-12 shotguns manufactured were imported into the United States. The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, adjustable for semi-automatic or pump-action operation. 
The SPAS 12 was designed to function primarily as a semi-automatic firearm, with the pump-action mode used to reliably fire low-pressure ammunition such as tear gas rounds or less-lethal bean bags. The firing mode is switched by pressing a button under the fore grip and sliding the fore grip slightly forwards or backwards until it clicks into position. 
The SPAS-12 has a magazine cut-off feature, which prevents loading a new round from the internal magazine when the gun is cycled. This allows the operator to load a specialized round into the chamber without firing the entire magazine first. A unique feature of the SPAS-12 was the hook on folding-stock variants. This hook could be rotated in 90-degree increments, so it would fit under the user's forearm when the stock was extended. With the stock supported under the forearm the gun could theoretically be fired with one hand, allowing the user to fire around cover or use their support hand for other tasks.

The rifle itself is very mildly sportarized ( a very small section of top hand guard removed). That's it. The action is slicker than that on most custom rifles and it comes with ammo because it's still a shooter. A relative took three deer with it less than five years ago. Not bad for the first modern bolt action rifle ever produced.  It comes with several boxes of ammoi as well. Serious Inquirys Only. Thanks.

$500 obo. cash or will look at trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

Not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know, I can add ammo, cash or??
Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool.
Daewoo 
FAL 308/7.62 
Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal.  
Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal
Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too. 
XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
1911 pistols
Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles.  A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.
Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage.  Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

Ammo in the popular calibers: .22lr, .22 mag., 9mm, .40 S&W, .45ACP, .357 mag., .44 mag., .223/5.56, 7.62x39,

.308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed.

Norinco AK-47 rifles are one of the highest quality AK rifles for the money hands down, they have a 1.5mm receiver (50% thicker) vs. 1mm on most AK rifles, a heavier chrome lined barrel and the FCG (trigger group) is very smooth as is, similar to the Tapco G2 trigger set after polishing the contact points IMO and they have a nicer blued finish vs. the black paint coating on most.  Bottom line they are built to last.

$900 obo. cash or will look at good trades.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

 Not in need of anything right now, but I listed some I would not mind having or having more of, but not limited to:

Eotech, maybe Aimpoint and descent magnifiers in the 3x-7x power, looking to finish off several rifle projects, so if you have multiples let me know, I can add ammo, cash or??
 Vepr 7.62x54 or .308 with barrel 20.5""-23"", maybe another PSL
 Quality uppers in 5.56 or 7.62x39 or a .50 Beowulf would be cool.
 Daewoo 
 FAL 308/7.62 
 Sig 556 or 556r ( only the newer model with the upgrades and bugs worked out)
 Will consider several quality stripped AR lowers, forged or billet as part of a deal. 
 Beretta CX4 in 9mm with rails
 AK-47 rifles like Norinco Mak-90, Arsenal or Saiga converted model or not converted, I can convert myself easily.
 Saiga 12 unconverted, may consider other calibers too if unconverted or converted if a good deal
 Beretta 92FS INOX, Brigadier, M9A1, 92A1, M9 and 92FS in this order, these are some of my favorites 
 Mossberg 930 SPX or 590A1, maybe 500 models, might look at a Remington 887 Tactical Nitro Mag. too. 
 XDM 5.25"" or 4.5"" in 9mm or .45ACP, will consider another XD Tactical 5"" in .45ACP, bi-tone preferred. 
 1911 pistols
 Quality higher powered optics in the 24x-32x range or similar for .300 Win Mag, .308 and .223 rifles. A Nikon M-308 would be a good one.
 Maybe more revolvers, Ruger GP100 .357 mag. 4"" or 6"" or other .357 mag. models, will consider .357 mag lever action, .44 Mag revolvers, maybe lever too.
 Bolt actions in .223/5.56 and .308/7.62x51 must be rated for both like Savage. Maybe a .22 Mag rifle too.

 .308/7.62x51, 7.62x54, .300 Win Mag., 12ga. in ""00"" & ""000"", same on ammo as firearms, I have plenty of everything, but I will consider more ammo to make a deal, depending on the value you place on the ammo.

 Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Plano area on occasion. Must be legal to own a firearm in TX. Will ship if needed.
