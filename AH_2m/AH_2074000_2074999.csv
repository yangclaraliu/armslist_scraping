The PMAG ($17.95 x 4)
The PMAG is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine with round-count windows. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.  The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine.

Angled Fore Grip (AFG) ($34.95)  
Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.  The AFG2 is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

XTM Rail Panels ($7.95 x 2)
These XTM Rail Panels are a two-piece design that attach anywhere on a 1913 Picatinny rail without having to remove previously-mounted accessories. The combination of design and material used in the XTM Panels ensures they will remain securely in place under all operating conditions, but may be easily removed using the tips of two rounds when necessary.

B.A.D. Lever.  ($29.95)  
Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.  Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

Battery Storage Core.  ($14.95)  
Internal core unit for the MIAD, MOE Grip, and MOE+ Grip designed to hold two (2) AA type batteries in a self contained waterproof unit.  Included internal spacer provides rattle free storage of either (2) AAA or (2) N size batteries (commonly used for EOTech sights).  Rubber cap has two sides with marking to identify ""spent"" batteries and can be opened with a push of the thumb.

The Magpul CTR buttstock ($79.95)
(Compact/Type Restricted) – Commercial-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability* and an ambidextrous QD sling mount that will accept any push-button sling swivel. The Commercial-Spec Model includes an extended 0.55"" rubber butt-pad to provide positive shoulder purchase and accommodates the longer, slanted back common to most commercial-spec tubes.

The MOE Grip ($20.95)
Provides Magpul quality, feel, and durability in an economical, drop-in upgrade for the standard AR15/M16/M4 pistol grip. The ergonomic, hand filling design combines aggressive texturing with storage core capability. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, the one-piece reinforced polymer construction provides simplicity and a reduced cost while still maintaining the durability needed to withstand operational environments. The MOE Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. All mounting hardware included.

EO Tech 512.  ($439.00)  
The Model 512 is the most popular model HWS.  This tactical optic is perfect for agencies that want the best in CQB speed and versatility, without the need for night vision compatibility.
AA Battery Model (supports Lithium and Alkaline)
Reticle: 65 MOA circle with 1 MOA aiming dot
Includes rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-less mounting bolt
Interfaces to 1” Picatinny (MIL-STD-1913) or Weaver rail

The GG&G EOTech ($40.00)
Lens Covers fit between the EOTech hood and the body of the EOTech housing. They are spring operated so that once pressure is applied to release them from the closed position, they spring open. The rear cover lays across the top, so as not to interfere with the field of view. The front cover opens and serves as a sun shield. However, if heavy brush etc. is encountered, the front lens will fold back so that it is not damaged. Because of the contours of the EOTech housing, these rifle scope lens covers are not 100% waterproof, but they do prevent most dust, debris, rain and snow from accumulating on the lenses. These unique lens covers for scopes can be easily operated with either hand to provide flexibility of operation. The design and methodology is so unique that we were awarded a patent

FSL-3 Laser System Smaller and Smarter  ($109.95)
Subcompact V3 laser by LaserLyte® is the company's most state-of-the-art, smallest and versatile rail mounted laser to date.  Now half the size of the previous model, the Subcompact V3 needs less than ¾-inch of Picatinny rail space to easily mount onto even the smallest firearms.  Constructed of T6 aluminum for extra strength and durability, this updated unit offers a smart, cost-effective auto-off feature. If left on for five minutes, the unit begins to display a unique flash for one minute, indicating to the user that the unit will automatically shut off soon. After one minute in flash mode the unit shuts itself off to extend battery life, prevent accidental activation and battery depletion. Press the unit's button at any time to reset this feature for five more minutes.  The Subcompact V3 easily mounts with a hex drive crossbar screw and features windage adjustment, elevation adjustment and programmable constant on and pulse modes. Additionally, the unit is ideal for left- and -right handed shooters with two separate activation buttons located on the backside of the laser. Not only will the laser fit nicely on the smallest of sub-compact railed pistols, it works great on modern rifles as well.

Everything listed on the link to Browning's website above with box and paperwork for you to register the warranty.     

Browning MSRP is $899.99 and I am looking for $700 obo cash, but what I am REALLY looking for is a complete upper receiver in a deer hunting caliber. 308, 6.8 SPC, 300 AAC, etc. to trade straight up or I will throw in some boot for the right manufacturer. I am also interested in any gun trades you have to offer (Nice deer rifles). I will entertain any offers just give me a shout!"

Bishop stocks went out of Business in the late 50's i think, so i'm guessing it was sporterized then. the bluing is in perfect shape, a nice deep, dark bluing. wood is, i'd say about 90%, a couple light scuffs is all. i'm only selling to fund a project on another .300 win mag i have for hunting season. this is a great gun.

i think my price is fair but shoot me an offer. i can only say no if its to low for me and wont be offended. also, i'm working right now, building a house near Helmville. i dont have cell reception nor any internet. so i wont be able to respond Monday through Thursday, sorry.  thanks for looking

Charge your mobile devices outdoors when a wall outlet or a USB power source is not available; great for outdoor sports, camping, and travel. Be prepared for the unexpected -- keep your mobile devices charged in the event of a natural disaster or power failures. The SOTG-5,000 is the universal charger that charges your mobile devices at home, at work, in the car, and outdoors when electrical power is not available.

•More Powerful:
The high capacity 5000 mAh battery charges FASTER and gives you MORE CHARGES than other portable chargers.
•Integrated Solar Panel:
NO additional solar panels to carry with you.
•Compact & Portable:
Easily fits in your pocket or purse.
•A Complete Kit:
Includes 5 adapters to connect to most phones and mobile device, a protective pouch to protect the charger when it's not in use AND a USB Wall Adapter with cable ($19.95 if priced separately).
•Stays Charged for Months:
The SOTG-5000's Lithium Ion Battery is manufactured specifically to SMS specifications: designed to carry 5,000 mAh of power with NO discharge so you get 100% battery efficiency.
•Protect Your Devices:
Built in surge protection to protect your phone and mobile devices from overcharging and short circuits.
•1 Year Replacement Warranty:
Guaranteed to keep you ""in charge"" or we'll replace it free of charge!

Internal Battery Designed For Portable Charging:
The SOTG-5000 contains a Lithium Ion Battery developed by Solar Mobile Solutions specifically engineered to hold 5,000 mAh, (milli-ampere-hours) of battery storage without discharge. This translates into 100% battery efficiency giving you maximum charging power when you need it. This battery is designed to last 7 to 10 years, so you will change cell phones many times over the years before you need to buy another charger!

Recharge Using Solar Power:
An integrated solar panel lets you charge the internal Ion battery with power from the sun when a wall outlet or USB power source is not available. The SOTG-5000 uses the most advanced Polycrystalline solar panel technology to charge the internal battery. Polycrystalline solar panels allow the SOTG-5000 to achieve an incredible 70% efficiency from sunlight. The solar panels have been integrated into the SOTG-5000 battery pack as 1 unit -- no need to lug around additional solar panels.

Universal Adapters:
The SOTG-5000 includes BOTH USB Micro and Mini USB adapters to charge your USB devices including phones, tablets, eBook readers, MP3 players, GPS and portable video game consoles. The kit also includes an adapter for iPhones and the iPad, an adapter for Nokia phones and a special adapter for the Play Station, PSP. All 5 adapters make the SOTG compatible with most portable devices*.
*Some products may require an OEM cable to connect to a USB port.

USB Wall Adapter with Cable:
The SOTG-5000 includes a USB wall adapter with cable to charge the Ion battery from a wall outlet when electricity is available. Many portable charging kits require you to purchase this cable and adapter separately. You can also use this cable to charge your USB device directly from the wall outlet so leave your other cable at home while traveling.

Compact and Portable:
The SOTG-5000 is compact, slim and lightweight. Measuring only 5 inches long by 3 inches wide, it is smaller than many of the newest smart phones on the market today. The SOTG-5000 is a mere ½ inch thick so it easily fits in your pocket and even with 5000 mAh of charging power, it only weighs in at 5 oz.

Built-in Surge Protection:
Don't risk overcharging or short circuiting your devices! The SOTG-5000 includes built-in surge protection to protect your devices from overcharging and electrical surges.

The hornady and federal is split up in 4 of the 5 mags, 15 rounds in each. The Usm is a box of 20 all in the box. Comes with box and all documents and a slide holster. This is an excellent example of the quality that FNH hand guns are known for. Very accurate, very concealable, and has been one of my favorite guns that I have handled. Just about zero recoil. I have honestly decided to consolidate calibers, and drink the .45 and Sig kool aid, and boy is it delicious. But enough about me... Lets talk about my package

I would prefer to sell, but will be open to trades and will be pretty picky, looking for 45s with ammo

Gun with 3 mags and holster- $600, with all 5 mags $650
If you want the jhp ammo in the mags: 3 mags $630, 5 mags $680

About 1200 rounds means that in the open box of 500, the bag with the rounds I can't remember exactly the amount in it, but the 500 round box of ga arms has 500 rounds in it

I don't mind selling the ammo separate and for the fmj, it will be $30 per 100
The Usm is $30 for the 20
The hornady and federal is $40 for 60

Now, the trade value for everything IS $1,100
Looking for 45's with ammo
If you feel so inclined to buy the whole package, I'll do it for $1000

And if you have made it this far, thanks for hanging in there and looking at my post.

Purchased years ago brand new. I fired 2 magazines (8 rounds per mag) to see how it fired, gave it an extremely good cleaning and lube, back into the factory box and into the safe.

Now, years later I would like to purchase something else and want to use this sale to finance my next purchase. 

Factory box; yellow envelope with casing that was fired at the factory; cleaning brush and everything that came with it originally including any paperwork.

Since it has been fired it can't TECHNICALLY be classified as 10 out of 10. But it sure as heck is 9.9 out of 10! Serious buyers need only respond and I'll send pics or better yet arrange a showing, we can meet and you can check it out.

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!


The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed (not included), and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

To begin this rifle is made with quality parts and not just anything I could find to throw together from unknown companies or a bunch of cheap Ebay add-ons.


The Lower consists of a Spikes ""Florida Hometown"" lower which was a limited run of 500 with a Daniel Defense LPK, Magpul MOE grip and Stock in FDE with a Magpul ASAP sling attachment.


The upper is a PSA with a 16"" FN MPI/Chrome Lined barrel, LMT Full Auto BCG, BCM Gunfighter CH, and a FDE Troy Flip-Up Rear Battlesight. The Rail is a Troy Battlerail Charlie, Troy's newest free-float rail that does not require the removal of the delta ring. The rail has a full set of FDE ladder rails, and a Magpul FDE hand stop, as well as a Troy QD sling swivel attachment. Topped off with a Primary Arm Micro Red Dot with quick detach mount to give it 1/3 co-witness.


To be included in the package is 5 Magpul Pmags all in FDE (tough to find right now, unless you want to pay an arm and a leg for them) 3 of which are still in the wrapper. Also to be included is roughly 300 rounds of 5.56/.223 consisting of 180 rounds of Winchester 62g 5.56 Green Tip, 50 +/- federal 55g .223, and 60 rounds of Silver Bear 55g .223. Finally I will throw in a Blackhawk Sportster tactical soft case with the rifle. Just FYI some of the ammo is already loaded into the 2 open mags, I can take it out but it will be loose.


I built this rifle before the panic, I am not looking to make a profit off of it or screw anyone over. I have shot about 400 rounds through it and cleaned it after every range trip. I am looking to sell the package for $1700, willing to negotiate a bit with serious buyers, but pretty firm, this price is fair for this package. FL DL is required as well of a Bill of Sale."

It holds 5+1 rounds, super clean, and has has 30 rounds put through it. I still have 70 rounds left of target loads and clays. I bought the gun new in March 2013. 

The shotgun is like new, and comes with: 
*** Choke 
*** Choke key
*** Owner's manual. 

***I'm selling it since the length of pull of the stock is too long for me.*** 

I am 5'6"" and can manage it, but not comfortably. After a single time out on my father in-law's range shooting clays, I have decided to give up my dream of going duck hunting on my fiance's farm... at least with this gun. I thought it was fine in the store, but I was wrong.

The gun is beautiful and is a blast to shoot (Haha, shotgun joke). It has been taken out once, and cleaned meticulously afterwards. I own 10+ firearms, and know how to take care of them very well.

I paid $317.93 for the shotgun, since it was a little bit over MSRP, then taxes... ($299.99 + $17.94 [WV Sales tax of 6%])

I will take 30% off of this price and sell it for $220. Remember, you're not paying tax on it during a private sale! :) :D ;)

I also have about 80 clays, and 70 3-inch target load shells left. I'll throw this in for ***another $20.***"

I just moved to south carolina and found out I can buy a M1014 which I could not own in California so I'd like to sell my mossy to help pay for the benelli.  I have fired about 2 dozen rounds through this brand new shotgun.  It is in perfect working order and virtually brand new.  I purchased the longer barrel that pairs with the 8 round tube/mag.  Switched the stock pump grip with a FAB Defense quick release 3 rail picatinny grip which I installed also a FAB Defense 180' adjustable forward/verticle grip (also has screw on base cap and compartment for storage, see pics).  This grip provides superior ergonomic feel and control and facilitates effective precision reflexive fire ability.  Installed a quad rail picatinny system which replaced the ghost ring rear sight aperture.  Mounted to that are Magpul MBUS AR flip up/lock down spring loaded front and rear sights.  Also mounted is a ATN Javelin J169W Tactical light with command push tab wire (still has original sticky tape, never got around to setting it where I liked it).  This Tac light is extremely bright and will temporarily blind anyone who looks at it directly for 10-15 seconds and should be used with caution.  Butt stock also has extra round holders that accommodates 2 extra rounds on each side so the shotgun can effectively carry 8+1 +4 rounds.  AR sights were designed to allow this shotgun to fire slugs at moving vehicles, ranged targets, during road blocks, etc with precision accuracy.  All of the parts mentioned are brand new and installed after I bought the shotgun.  It will also come with the factory Mossberg loop lock and 2 keys so you can properly secure the weapon when not in use.  It can fire the various lengths of 12 gauge shotgun rounds as well as slugs.  I've spent over $1100 on this Mossberg and hate to see it go, but I'd rather have a Benelli M4 that I can now own living in South Carolina which costs about $1600 new with zero mods.  This sale will help me buy the Benelli and I'm sure it will go to a good home.  I live in Mauldin and can travel up to 30 miles to make a deal or you can come to me.  This is my first sale on this site so if I have left anything out or you would like any other information I have not listed, please feel free to call/text email, etc.  Asking $850.  I'm also selling a HK USP .40 with some mags, holster, lock, etc.  I'd be willing to sell the pair and all the extras for $1200 firm.  Thanks for looking.
