The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

I bought it about a year ago and have only put about ~500 rounds through it with no failures or problems. It has been cleaned thoroughly after each shooting and stored in a dry temperature controlled gun safe. I bought it brand new from Gander Mountain in Kenosha about a year ago and I might be able to dig up a coupon for a free cleaning. I had to wait about a year and a half just to find one for sale locally. I payed 525 for it a year ago and am looking to get about $425 for it but I do have a little wiggle room.

This is definitely a reliable and fun gun to shoot and it is chambered for up to 3.5 inch magnum loads and has a useful magazine tube disconnect.

Thanks for looking and let me know if you are interested. I am willing to travel but not terribly far.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines

Started life as a 1996 gen 2 Glock 19. The slide was Cerakoted Magpul FDE and the grip was chopped to fit Glock 26 mags. So you get the best of both worlds with maximum shootability and concealibility. All the internal parts have been replaced with brand new Glock oem parts. The trigger has been polished and has a very nice 4-4.5# pull with a clean break and no slop. The grip had a slight reduction and trigger undercut and was finished with a clean stipple job. Finally XS Big dot night sights were added. One mag included and has a shaved baseplate to allow 3 finger grip without adding length and stippled to match. I have fired in the neighborhood of 400 rounds since the gun was upgraded and it has performed in typical 100% Glock perfection. Cerakote is starting show some light wear. To buy a Glock new and send it away for all this would cost you in the ballpark of $1000. Asking $555. Face to face deals only with legal to own Ohio residents.

Putting out feelers on this guy, not sure if I really want to sell it but could use some cash for other projects.

Israeli FAL kit built on a Coonan receiver with matching upper and lower serials. Only other non Israeli part is the top cover (HK), at least to the best of my knowledge. A former friend built this, needed cash and I bought it off him. I believe he only test fired it a few times to ensure it works, everything looks pristine, the gas system hasn't even been adjusted to the right setting. 

Includes 3 magazines, a gas wrench, and a hard case.

Was originally asking $1400 OBO, something came up so price drop because I could use some cash.
Looking for $1200, willing to *slightly* negotiate on the price.

Absolutely not looking for any trades!

Street price new for this gun is around $700, but I'm asking $575 OBO for the gun and the chokes included. This would be a great setup for any of the clay target games as well as an ideal field gun. 

Feel free to contact me with questions by text, phone, or email.

To help keep all this firepower under control, the Taurus Raging Bull comes with rubber cushioned grips, a heavy frame, and porting at the top of the barrel to help minimize recoil. Eight ports (four on each side of the front sight) vent gas upwards to help minimize the kick up of the Raging Bull.

Wife is having a baby and I need to both clear space and make some money for the pending new arrival.
This gun has only been taken to the range five times and I've put maybe 400-450 rounds through it.  For those that are unfamiliar, the AK-74 was the russian answer to the .223/5.56 and follow-up to the AK47.  It saw extensive use in Afghanistan in the 1980s and has proven itself to be a straight shooting, reliable, easy-to-fire rifle.  Ballistically, it is nearly identicaly to a 5.56.
These particular Arsenal AKs are made in America with Russian parts kits - they aren't some chinese or tajikestan knockoffs assembled by trained monkeys.  Every person that has fired this gun has commented not only on how well it feels when shooting, but how solid and well-built it is.  Not once have I had a failure to eject, failure to feed, or anything like that.  This gun just WORKS every time you pull that trigger.  Even though you could probably pour gravel in it and have it still fire, I have cleaned and oiled it meticulously every time we've come back from the range.  It's nearly 100% stock; the only things I have added are a Hogue grip and a sling.
Ammo can be bought by the case and is cheap (~ .20-25$ per round), making it arguably the cheapest rifle platform to plink with right now.  In truth, the reliability and cost of ammo were the two main reasons I bought it to begin with.  I paid $850 + tax/fees pre-obama; looking around now it appears they are in the $900-1000 range.

Included in the deal:
Arsenal SGL-31 AK74 semi-auto rifle with Hogue grip and sling
3x 40 round magazines
1x 30 round magazine
1x 10 round magazine
~600 rounds of ammo, still in the tin can (I can get you an exact count if you'd like, it's more than half full and I have some in the mags as well)
Original box, instructions (good place to learn Russian), and factory target.

I posted this at $900 and believe that with a nearly new gun AND a few hundred worth of ammo/accessories, this is a competitive price.  That said, feel free to send me (reasonable) offers.  Looking for cash, no trade or anything like that."

949,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2924949,For Sale:  LaRue Tactical OBR 16 inch in 7.62 New,"Washington, Washington, United States","$ 3,000","Listed On: Wednesday, April 9, 2014",Rifles,Larue Tactical                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is a LaRue Tactical OBR 16 inch in 7.62 caliber it comes with two twenty round magazines and hard case. LaRue Tactical OBR 7.62 Overview: The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. Machined from billet 7075-T6, the receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy. The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum. Barrel: The barrel is Stainless Steel Match grade in 16.1"" length. All gas blocks feature the unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). Suppressor Compatibility: LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not.I can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire. Internals: The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with max-staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage. The trigger group is the excellent Geissele SSA Combat Trigger. The SSA provides an average 4.5lb pull weight.(2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage). Furniture: Base Model comes complete with A2 Rifle Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip, A2 Flash Hider, plus two LaRue-made 20-round magazines."
