I know that the color affects the value in my favor, and am looking for fair offers. FEEL FREE TO ASK FOR PICTURES OF THE BOX, SERIAL, AND TEST CASING PAPERS, all of them state that this is an OD g19, and the serials on the weapon match all serials on the documentation. 

The light on the pistol is a CTC lightguard pistol illuminator, pushing out 100 powerful lumens. These retail at right around 200.00.

This pistol is equipped with bright night sights, and to top it off I am including six mags, two with pierce grip extentions attached. Glock mags run 35.00. Simple math, they add value. 

The holster for this weapon was custom ordered from northwestern tactical, and has been molded to fit perfectly with the CTC system. It ran me 100.00.

There is not a mark on this pistol, and it is a bit of a safe queen. 
I do realize that OD Glocks are extremely desirable, but I am pretty reasonable and ALMOST let this go without getting it evaluated... but as I had it with me at the range today, my mistake was pointed out pretty quickly. Lol. Now I feel kinda dumb. 

Let me finish by saying that all original factory stuff, as well as the box for the CTC laser is of course, included. 

Cash talks, but trades are trades preferred.

I bought these new last year & have never used them. I only took it out of the package to put batteries in & test that it work...which they did. Everything is included as if you bought them new: binoculars, carrying case, neck strap, manual & paperwork, cleaning cloth & I'll include the batteries.

The Yukon Tracker 2x24 night vision binocular allows for incredibly detailed observation ability under the darkness of night. The Tracker provides clear viewing in total darkness by utilizing a built-in IR infrared illuminator; when in use the illuminator emits a pulsing frequency that is so energy efficient it creates less battery drainage and prolongs battery life. The ergonomically designed rubberized body is surprisingly lightweight and can be taken on long expeditions both easily and comfortably. The Tracker utilizes the revolutionary Eclipse Lens Cover System which uses flip-up covers that can be easily clipped back against the body of the binoculars and rotated out of the user’s viewing area while eliminating lens cap hassles. Pin holes in the lens caps allow the Tracker to be used in the daytime when the caps are closed. Also featured is a dual diopter adjustment with central focusing knob and fully multicoated optics. The Tracker 2x24 is backed by Yukon’s Limited Lifetime Warranty.

I prefer a local, FTF transaction. I can meet anywhere in the WNY if needed. Shipping can be arranged, but buyer will pay actual shipping cost. Please email me via Armslist if you're interested or have any questions. I will respond to any inquiries within 24hrs. Thanks."

Unfortunately, it  simply doesn't serve my purposes as well as I need it to. The SIG SP2022 is one of SIG Sauer's best selling handguns, marketed as a cross between the famous P226 and P229 but with half the pricetag of its all-steel big brothers. 
This particular pistol is chambered in 9mm. I have a little over 1,000 rounds through it and it has never malfunctioned on me (except for a few user errors). Very well maintained, with a few small scratches from holster wear. The trigger is superb, very smooth and controllable in double and single action. Double action is about 10 lbs and single is about 4. The sights are great, big white dots that are very easy to acquire. Recoil is more than manageable (almost negliable really, at least for me) and target reacquisition is a breeze despite a heavy steel slide and a rather high bore axis. Great for home defense, competion or carry.
I have two interchangeable back straps, three 15 round magazines and a Blackhawk CQC SERPA holster to accompany the gun. I would prefer to trade for a Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm, a SIG P226 or P229 in 9mm, an AK-47, an AK-74, or an AR-15. Not necessarily looking for anything else but if you have what you think is a fair offer (perhaps a Glock 19 with extras) then by all means tell me and we can discuss it.  I will also settle for $750 cash, but I would really prefer to trade. Also, for increased trades and/or sales, I have two shotgun stocks that I can throw in, and a hard plastic Pelican pistol case, which is about $120 worth of gear.
Please have proof of Oregon residency, with no arrests or record of any felonies, and be willing to fill out a bill of sale for my personal records. 
Thanks for looking have a nice day."

Excellent condition, was recently thoroughly gone through and cleaned.
The scope is nothing fancy, it's a $50 22lr scope form Fleet Farm, but it does the job.
I also have the owners manual, sales brochure, and a couple original adds.
I don't shoot it enough, so it is time to pick up something different.
I am open to cash or trades, make me an offer, worse I can say is no.
Ammo is available for the right offer, more pictures available upon request.

They have a black serrated rear sight with 2 tritium inserts and a bright orange front sight with a tritium insert. The orange also charges during day light and glows at night. Even with zero sun light the tritium inserts will still glow in darkness.The guns's stock serrated trigger has been replaced with a factory glock smooth trigger like you find on full sized models and the trigger pull has been reduced to 3 pounds with a glock factory competition trigger spring and connector.

Got one for me and one for the woman and she does not share the love for the gun I do so this one needs to transform into a large frame hand gun with a higher capacity, prefer a heavier metal gun but not a old beat up Ruger thats worth 250 bucks. I have put 200 through the one I got for myself and with various ammo not a single failure and shoots better than any subcompact I have ever touched...I have owned many. In my loose pants or shorts this carries fine in the pocket but iwb you forget it is there unless you need it. With the slim under a inch width the sights are deadly accurate for a little guy and it drops right back on target with a quick reset for the next pull. Most shops are selling these for 500 or better due to demand. Thats more than MSRP so I am looking for a fair trade medium range price used gun. Brand new shield for a used full size and you will be one happy camper with this as a BUG or as your main carry. I do not feel the need for more than 8+1 of todays critical defense 9mm but if you do then make it your back up as you get the power of 9 in a perfect little package that fits even a large hand such as mine.

It states just ""model 60"" as opposed to say, model 60-2.
It has a pinned barrel. It, I am told, was a manufacturing process that required more time and craftsmanship. This ended in approx 1982. Pinned barrels are more sought after than non pinned and its been stated that the barrels are aligned better from the factory.
The model 60 was essentially a Chiefs Special in stainless steel. It was the first r
evolver made in stainless, beginning in 1965.

It was not my intent to mislead, and I apologize for any confusion. This is a 1897 pump-action shotgun with an external hammer and tube magazine manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The Model 1897 was an evolution of the Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning. The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and 16 gauge, and as a solid frame or takedown. The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28 inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20 inches, and as long as 36 inches. Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured it has been used by American soldiers,police departments, and hunters. 

This 1897 has the last patent date stamped as July 1910 and is over 100 years old. The finish is well worn, but I have seen similar aged guns sld for $2100.

This is the Sheriff and Deputy Sheriff Commemorative Edition. The American Historical Foundation is proud to honor our American Sheriffs by issuing a firing commemorative Thompson. They are highly desirable and sought after, especially by retirees and patriotic collectors. Unlike most modern firearms, all the major components are actually machined from massive, solid blocks of steel. The fit and finish are presentation grade. The precision-milled receiver is highly finished to highlight the etched and gold-gilt infilled commemorative inscriptions, including the famous Thompson ""Bullet"" trademark. 24-Karat Gold plating sight across the 24-Karat Gold plated rear sight, through the slot in the 24-Karat Gold plated actuator knob and over the deep cooling fins of the mirror-polished and blued barrel. Yet more 24-Karat Gold plating gleams across the mirror-polished Cutts Compensator, front sight and trigger. All the plating is to Jewelers Grade-Heavy thickness for lasting beauty and value. The deluxe walnut stock is beautifully finished to a high gloss to show off the three fired-enamel cloisonné inlays (one on reverse) and the 24-Karat Gold plated sling swivels, swivel mounts and screws which affix the sling (Not included). A firing semi-Automatic chambered for the readily available .45 ACP ammunition that American military men and shooters have admired and relied on since 1911. The gun has a special registry number. Each is made in the USA designed by the official maker of the famous Thompson, Auto-Ordnance Corporation, the company founded by General John T. Thompson. GUN IS UNFIRED with yellow accents and sheriff badge inlet into the stock. Slight (safe queen) dings and nicks. Not perfect, but in excellent condition. Small scratch to barrel (see pictures) and to the blueing and lacquer finish of the stock forearm and pistol grip. (See pictures or call) Gold colouring in engraved areas is light in some areas and perfect in others. All of this is being fussy on a very rare gun that does not show up on Armslist often (Can't remember last time seeing one). Also includes an extra magazine and Thompson Auto Ordnance range bag. Will not ship to anyone except your FFL or personal pickup in Milwaukee, WI . Call Jeff @ REDACTED 7am - 10pm cst if you want to make an offer. Cash is accepted on personal pickup. •Firearms may only be shipped to a licensed dealer (FFL Holder) - If you are not a licensed dealer, you must make arrangements with a dealer in your state to receive the firearm and transfer it to you."

This is a Kowa 88mm High Performance TSN-884 Spotting Scope with Kowa TE-10Z 20-60X Zoom Eyepiece, and Gitzo Carbon 6X Tripod for sale.

The 883 features the pure fluorite crystal “PROMINAR” 88-mm objective lens, the Kowa TSN-883 offers simply unsurpassed light throughput for the brightest, aberration free images. Despite the huge lens, the durable magnesium frame helps limit the weight of the Kowa TSN-883 to less than 54 oz. Kowa’s inner focus system shortens the prism box on the TSN-883 scope, giving it a compact 13.5 inch length. The Kowa TSN-883 spotting scope features a dual focus system with separate knobs for coarse and fine focusing, an eyepiece locking mechanism, and a tripod mount that adapts to accommodate either a 1/4- or a 3/8-inch mounting screw. With its superb optics and Kowa’s special adapters, the TSN-884 makes a great digiscoping rig. The Kowa TSN-884 scope is completely waterproof and nitrogen-purged to be internally fog-proof. 

The Gitzo tripod features a 6X carbon fiber tube, made of a unique structure of 6 crossed layers that maximises rigidity, vibration absorption and lightweight performance. 6X tube has a high density structure made of top quality ultra-thin carbon fibers (7mm or 0.007 mm). Built-in Anti Leg Rotation is now a feature of the whole carbon fiber range. Tripod also has a Gitzo G1177M series 1 Center Ball Head.

This combination is valued over $3,500. Asking $3,000

From a review in Accurateshooter.com by Danny Reever: 
One of my tests included a Snellen Eye Chart, just like the one at your optometrist office. Instead of it hanging on a wall, I placed the Snellen Chart at 500 meters along with some previously-shot paper Ground Hog targets. Conditions were hazy and humid with moderate mirage. My Nightforce 12-42x56mm Benchrest riflescope set at 42X could read line 6 on the chart and I could distinguish only a few of the 6mm bullet holes. My Pentax PF100-ED set at 60X (to match the Kowa’s maximum power) was better. With the Pentax I could read line 7 on the chart and see more of the bullet holes. With the Kowa set at 60X, I could read line 8 on the chart and see all of the bullet holes on the white parts of the targets.. FYI, line 8 on the Snellen Chart defines 20-20 vision at 20 feet. Reading that at 500 meters (1641 feet) is pretty impressive!"

GLOCK 21 GEN 4
Purchased new by me on July 27th of this year.
100rds fired through it with zero issues.
Has standard Glock sights.
The only mark on the gun is on the trigger guard. I sanded the one edge with 2000 grit sandpaper to eliminate ""Glock Knuckle"", if you are unfamiliar with that term Google it. It was not a hack job, does not affect the function of the gun, and does not look bad or horrible. I have included a pic of this area for those who are deeply concerned by this minor modification.

Comes with the following:
All factory components (box, papers, 3-13rd mags, backstraps - yes the new updated beavertail ones, etc.)
Glock brand Extended slide release (original included)
Blackhawk Serpa Holster RH-black (paddle and belt mount)

Winchester Model 59 WIN-LITE 12 Gauge Chambered 2 3/4"" Modified Winchester Choke
It has a few scratches and wear marks. This is a very light shotgun and is fun to shoot. Great for young kids trying to shoot 12 Gauge without it being too heavy. 
This is a $650 shotgun if it were perfect condition. But I'd let it go for $350 because it doesn't look new or restored. The wood is excellent with no cracks or chips. This is a great shooter and is a semi auto.

Wanted to buy,  Remington 788 in .243   Stock can be in any condition, I'll be replacing it.  Trigger can be crap - That's getting replaced too.

So - I'll settle for whatever 788 you have in a 243  in decent mechanical shape.      Paying $100 to $400 cash  depending on completeness and condition. Washington State residence, with CPL.

The United States Navy Mark 12 Mod 0/1 Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is a rifle in service with United States Special Operations Forces in Operation Enduring Freedom and previously in Operation Iraqi Freedom. SPR initially stood for Special Purpose Receiver, but that nomenclature has been replaced as the weapon became a stand-alone weapons system, and not just an add-on upper receiver assembly (part of the proposed SOPMOD upgrades). The SPR was eventually type classified by the U.S. Navy as the Mk 12. Note that the weapon was developed by a Navy office (Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division) for SOCOM units, not for use by units that fall under the conventional US Navy.

For more detailed information go to Wikipedia and enter> Mk 12 Special Purpose Rifle.

I can ship, also I will detach the upper from the lower and sell separate. This was a very exhausting clone to build. Nothing but the best parts currently used by the U.S. Armed Forces was put into making this, Knights Armament, Colt, A.R.M.S., Harris Bipod, KMW, Tool Craft, Precision Reflex Inc., Douglas Barrels, KNS Precision, Tactical Machining, Ops Inc., B5 Systems, Timney Triggers, and Sierra Precision. Good luck trying to track these parts down in todays market. 

The price reflects my time and energy finding these parts and putting this excellant rifle together. The upper was put together by PRI, and the lower by a Knights Armament armorer."

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The Aimpoint® CompM4s sight, with low battery compartment, belongs to the CompM4 series sights which are the finest sights Aimpoint has ever produced. Improvements include improved energy efficiency that provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery!"
