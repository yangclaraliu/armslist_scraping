Barrel: The 3.8” Steel, Melonite, match-grade barrel helps compensate for muzzle-rise when firing due to the shorter barrel and smaller frame; In turn, both aid in quicker target acquisition and tighter groups.

Sights: Sights are the top of the line (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex (RMR) on the market. The 6.5 Minute of Angle (MOA) adjustable LED allows your eye to focus quicker  and more precisely on your point of aim. Again resulting in faster target acquisition when firing.

The lower is a DPMS forged aluminum- I bought this as a complete rifle, then stripped and sold off all other parts except for the lower.  The LPK is from RRA with upgraded Spike's Tactical NiB coated trigger assy (NICE!) with RRA buffer tube assembly (commercial sized), spring, carbine buffer.  I added and staked a Noveske QD endplate.  Magpul MIAD (all inserts included) plus MOE triggerguard and MOE stock in Foliage Green.  I will also include the pictured Phase-5 Tactical 1-piece ambi bolt release (this is sex- I have a version on all my guns, similar to Magpul's BAD but no screws to come apart).  No gouges, not flawless but you'll see it is very nice.

Upper is a Del-Ton 16"" M4 that I bought new, 1x9 and Chrome-lined.  I installed a Troy lo-pro gas block, Magpul MOE handguard in Foliage green and just installed a YHM folding front sight assembly, HK style with swing swivel.  I have a Battlecomp 1.0 out front, does everything it was advertised to.  I would add it to my other rifles except they are all pinned and welded flash-hiders.  The upper has t-marks.  Includes Del-ton charging handle and BCG.  When I bought the upper I installed a BCM extractor upgrade kit, this gun has digested every type of ammo I have tried including steel cased Wolf and Tula.  Flings brass with authority, I have fired approx. 1200 rds, all flawless.  The ejection port cover is laser etched and reads ""Break Yo'Self"", kind of subdued but I thought it was fun.  Some edge wear on the FWD assist and some marks on the barrel, edge of the Battlecomp, etc.  Nothing major nor concerning.


I will include a basic type sling that I have used, 2 point nylon strap.

I have only shot paper and always cleaned after use.


**Not included:  Vortex Sparc Optic, Troy folding rear, stubby VFG and Flashlight in mount.  You will get the rail section that the light is mounted on.

The Tactical High Lumen Weapon Light, powered by just one 123A lithium battery, is a powerful, lightweight LED Weapon Light that mounts securely to any Mil-Spec Picatinny rail via an integral thumbscrew  clamp.  The LED Weapon Light’s shock-proof LED emitter and TIR Lens creates a tight 110-lumen beam with plenty of reach for longer-range applications yet enough surround light for close-quarter situations. The Tactical Weapon Light is activated by clicking the tailcap pushbutton switch or, for fingertip control without altering your grip on the weapon, by depressing the included pressure-activated tape switch. The ultra-compact, durable Tactical Weapon Light was built to withstand the rigors of tactical use without weighing your weapon down.  Fits directly to any Picatinny-style accessory rail; no tools are required.

•Compact CNC-machined aluminum riser
•4 x 32 lighted scope
•Anti-dry-fire system
•Compact bull pup stock design
•Precision aluminum alloy cam sets
•Picatinny rail system

With its slim design, this innovative crossbow is extremely maneuverable in tight spaces like a ground blind or treestand. It may be compact, but it produces speeds up to 355 fps and 119 ft.-lbs. of kinetic energy. The green anodized flight rail and carbon-infused limbs combine to give it excellent power, strength and accuracy. The mini-parallel CNC-machined riser allows the limbs to be drawn back to very slim-line 13-1/2"" axle-to-axle length. An all-metal trigger and safety provide smooth, consistent performance. The anti-dry-fire mechanism reduces chances of mishaps in the field. The safety system works great for both left- and right-hand shooters.  The compact bull-pup stock positions the trigger mechanism 4"" forward compared to conventional crossbows. 1"" and 2"" pad inserts allow you to customize the stock to your preferences.  Precision aluminum alloy cams, tunable bow strings and power cables deliver smooth accurate shots, time after time. The 9"" multiposition adjustable Picatinny rail system perfect for mounting accessories. Forearm is fully adjustable for personal comfort. Also includes a tactical foregrip with five positions for a custom fit. The entire stock is finished with a SilenTech™ coating that reduces vibration and dampens sound. The 4 x 32 Pro Deluxe Lighted Scope has red/green dual illumination for varying light conditions. 
Draw weight: 185 lbs.
Power stroke: 13"".
Length: 36"" +/- 1"" depending on if you add the long butt pad or remove it.
Width: 17"" uncocked, 13.5"" cocked.
Weight: 8.3 lbs. without accessories.

I've shot well over 300 rounds without a single malfunction of any type. 
The barrel and feed ramp is polished.  The pistol will not come with the coco-bolo grips in the pictures.  It will come with the standard rubber CZ grips.
Comes with the original case, brush, patch rod, 2-14 rd CZ mags.  This pistol is very hard to find and is a perfect CCW option.   I will ship to your FFL if your out of state...please make sure this pistol is legal for you to own before contacting me. Your FFL must be able to accept shipments from a non-FFL individual. Paypal/cashiers check only. Add 3.5% to total if using Paypal. If your FFL will only accept shipments from an FFL, add 35$ to the total.

Only issue that I can see with the pistol, is what appears to be a score in the finish near the trigger. It is not a gouge and is not even noticeable from 5 ft away. I will take pictures of the scratch and email them to those who ask for them(I just uploaded one on the listing).. Other than that, the pistol is in great condition and functions flawlessly.

331 Miles. Thats it. Bought it for my wife brand new and the novelty wore off real quick. Been in the garage, in my way ever since.
Clear title. 
The front fairing has a spot that is broken off next to the odometer. See picture.
Just put in a new battery. Got all the old gas out. 
She is running kinda rough. I drained all the old gas and ran some new through it with a bit of SeaFoam. Probably needs the carb bowls cleaned out. 
Black tagged it last year. No insurance on it at this time. So no test rides.

LARGE POST, READ ALL OF IT PLEASE
I post these on Facebook as well. Contact me there: Savage Dennis Lively or email me at REDACTED to order.

$20 each $6 priority shipping, tracking information included. buy 4 or more & get free shipping. 

I will ship anywhere in the continental USA

SPECS:

6 1/4"" blade
11"" overall
Full tang
3"" belly on the main body
Made from very hard Stainless steel that holds a great edge through the worst sorts of use & abuse. 

Yes they are made in china, but don't let that keep you out of a great quality blade. LOL, they DO manage to pop out a decent product from time to time.

In the sense of full disclosure, the sheath is fairly cheaply made, riveted nylon. BUT the blade is very well made and a good place to start a custom wrap/build. A sheath/case is fairly easy to make out of a piece of leather & some cordage. 

It is a solid handful, large size & it LOVES TO CHOP! I took down A 4"" tree down with mine to see if it could. Yep, it dropped it with no problem at all. Skinning/butchering, camping or general utility this is the perfect knife for any and all of those chores. Put one in each of your bug out bags. I have 1 in each of mine. I take my survival seriously and i'm willing to trust my life with this knife. 

ORDERING:

Message me your email address, how many you want and I will invoice you through pay pal. No PP account needed, you can pay with a credit or debit card. I do not see your card information, pay pal processes it for me, so your covered as far as data security is concerned. Remember buy 4 or more and get free shipping. 

Yours will come in the black nylon sheath with red scales. The others shown are an example of the sort of things you can do to customize yours.

These are replies I have received from folks that have purchased.

John F K**** III Blades are a very hard stainless steel. I had to heat one to a cherry red to enable a cobalt drill bit to enlarge the grip stud holes. I have started carrying mine every time I'm out on the property, more useful than a big knife, and way handier than a machete, or even my Woodman's Pal. Vines, briers, saplings, no problem!

Chris S****
Got the knife today . I agree very well made for the price..

Danny C******
I got the knife I bought from you today. Really love it. I'm going to pick up some more Paracord tomorrow to wrap the handle.

Hornady HAP, 1075 FPS - 5"" Barrel, 100/Box

The new Bill Wilson Signature Jacketed Match Load delivers economical match-grade GUARANTEED Accuracy and peerless overall performance to handgun shooters looking for the practical edge over the competition.

The Signature Jacketed Match uses the 125 grain Hornady Action Pistol (HAP) jacketed hollow point bullet-designed for X-Ring accuracy along with ultimate feed reliability. Low-flash, low-concussion powders and the HAP's encapsulated base create less visible blast and smoke during shooting than a typical full-metal-jacket bullet-a great advantage in dim-light or indoor conditions.

It includes everything needed to fabricate a MAC11 SMG except the lower receiver, which can be purchased elsewhere or fabricated from a receiver flat. Also included are two manuals, 4 Cobray Zytel magazines, 3 used metal magazines, Cobray magazine loader, thread protector, Cobray assault sling, front control strap, Cobray folding/collapsible wire frame stock and associated parts, all internal parts, bolt, threaded barrel, steel feed lips for the Zytel magazines etc. Nearly all of the parts are Cobray original parts or reproduction Cobray parts. Everything was purchased through FTF Industries and Cobray Company. All parts are new and unused with the exception of the 3 metal magazines. The blueing on most of the parts is imperfect and ideally would be refinished if built into a new firearm. There may be some light surface rust present as is the case if purchased directly from the aforementioned companies. The 3 metal magazines have some rust on the followers and should be blasted and refinished. The total retail value of these parts was right at $1500 and took several months to acquire for a project that I no longer wish to complete. My loss is your gain. No FFL is required for purchase as the serialized part of this firearm (the receiver) is not included. Please contact me with any questions you may have. This item is also listed for sale on GunBroker and therefore the listing may be cancelled at any time."

It is an older generation model, but has been very well cared for, and is in great shape.  There are some very light scuff and mounting marks, but really, this particular scope is very clean and good looking.  I had this mounted once and only once, on a mild shooting Savage 223 Rem target rifle back in the day, and once I sold that rifle, this scope has simply sat in a case as an extra scope for years, along with a bunch of my other unused ""toys."" I will throw in the 5 inch sunshade ( I think these sell for 30-50 bucks these days depending on size and brand)  With the sunshade, overall length is 22 inches, without it, it's 17 inches.  The same Bausch and Lomb Elite 6 x 24 but in their newer 4200 Series with a 50 mm front bell, sells for 630 these days, so this is a great opportunity for someone to pick up quality merchandise at a discount price from someone who takes good care of his stuff."

It was manufactured by the Military Armament Corporation in Powder Springs, Georgia. It has both ""semi"" and ""auto"" selector markings and would be the basis for a select-fire M11 .380 submachinegun build. The receiver would need the sides and rear to be bent up and a magazine well and triggerguard welded in place, serialized, and then hardened and blued. As it stands now, the item is not considered to be a firearm and is not serialized, therefore no FFL is required. However, to build a machinegun on this receiver, you would need to have an FFL and Class II SOT. I must emphasize that this is NOT compatible with MAC11 9mm parts and is much shorter. There may be some light surface rust as the piece is raw steel and ""in the white"", however this would be easily removed in pre-treating prior to blueing/coating. Please do not purchase this item unless you are fully aware of what it is and the legal requirements and consequences of its use. You may contact me with any questions you may have. Thank you!"

As the images show, the grip is substantially improved by adding this texture. When seconds count in a tactical situation, you want to give yourself every advantage, and this texture will significantly increase your gripping ability, making it less likely to drop or bobble your mag when it is most important. A standard, non-stippled PMAG is shown for comparison only, and it is not for sale. Item shown has been used once to test functionality but otherwise is brand new, it just has had the stippling process applied. $25 each, or buy three for $70 and save five bucks. You have to hold these to appreciate the improvement in grip. Each one is painstakingly prepared by hand. These aren't cheap stickers-this is permanent. Distinctive and usefully tactical, these mags will set you apart when you are on the range.

M600U-A
Compact and extremely powerful, the M600 Ultra Scout Light® uses a virtually failure-proof LED to produce 500 lumens of output, and it continues producing blinding tactical light for 1.5 hours on a set of batteries. This brilliant output is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens into a far-reaching beam with an intense 13,000-candela central area that also provides significant peripheral illumination, making it ideal for close- to longer-range applications. 

The compact size of the M600 Ultra—under 5.5 inches long—minimizes added weight, frees up rail space for other accessories, and increases weapon maneuverability compared to larger WeaponLights. It attaches by means of an integral thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. 

The M600 Ultra comes with two switches: (1) a pushbutton tailcap switch: press for momentary on, press further to click constant-on; and (2) a momentary-on tape switch with a 7-inch cable that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. 

Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for maximum light transmission, the M600 Ultra is O-ring sealed to keep out the elements. Like all SureFire WeaponLights, the M600 Ultra is built to withstand the rigors of combat. Available in Black. 

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. 

Features •High-performance, recoil-proof LED generates 500 lumens of blinding white light and continues producing tactical-level light for 1.5 hours 
•Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens creates intense, versatile beam with enough reach for longer-range applications and significant surround light for peripheral vision 
•Construction: Mil-Spec hard-anodized aerospace aluminum, optically coated tempered window, O-ring and gasket seals
•Ergonomic tactical switching: click-on/off tailcap and pressure-activated tape switch (both included) 
•Thumbscrew clamp securely attaches to any Picatinny rail
•Powered by two 123A lithium batteries (included)"
