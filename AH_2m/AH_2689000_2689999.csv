This is a two owner vehicle with the original owner having completely and professionally built this Bronco from the ground up with heavy duty 4x4 parts. He originally was going to build it to be a rock climber but after doing all of the work decided it was too nice to use as a rock climber. I have a file with the original window sticker and over an inch thick of other receipts for all of the things he did to it. 

I have just recently purchased, had replaced or installed the following (I have all of the receipts):
* Brand New Exhaust - all the way from the manifold back including CO2 sensor $795.00
* All new plugs, wires and distributor cap
* All new u-joints and ball joints
* All new flywheel, clutch, clutch slave cylinder, etc.

* New IAC valve
* New ignition switch assembly
* All new fluids
* Brand new heavy duty battery
* New wipers
* New front wheel and lock out hub bearings and service
* New fuel pump - had to pull gas tank to replace therefore had new fuel filter installed as well as completely cleaned out the tank and conditioned it with tank sealer

The Bronco is equipped with the following options:
* Power steering and power brakes
* 2.9 liter V6 which is one of Ford's best engines they have produced
* AM/FM / Cassette Stereo
* Cold A/C and hot Heat
* Lockout hubs

* Interior of vehicle is in really good condition considering its age - no rips or tears or major stains.
* KC lights (front and rear) on separate switches

While this might not be a show truck it is a very well built and reliable 4x4 that can be driven on the interstate or be utilized as a off road and/or hunting vehicle which is why I purchased it. I've had numerous 4 wheelers, atv's, utv's etc. and quite frankly I got tired being hot, cold, wet, etc. during hunting seasons. This vehicle will go wherever you want it to go and do it all while keeping you cool, warm, dry and with all of the creature comforts that only a nice 4x4 SUV can provide. I recently purchased a new truck and I'm going to utilize my older truck on our hunting property in lieu of keeping my truck and the Bronco II. I hate to let it go but I don't need both and will miss this Bronco as it can go places my full size truck can't go. Anyway, too many toys to keep them all. You can't buy a nice 4 wheeler and can't touch one of the UTV's for the price of this Bronco. 

I'm not desperate to sell the Bronco and can keep however long I need to in order to sell it. If the ad is up then the vehicle is still for sale. I will remove the ad as soon as the Bronco sells. Cash only - absolutely no other forms of payment will be accepted. Bronco is being sold As-Is. I will not respond to bogus emails or text messages. If you want to correspond with me either email me through Craigslist, call or text me. I will not respond to emails outside of Armslist. I prefer calls but will respond via email or text messages as long as they look legit.

Bronco is located in Franklin and can be seen most hours of the day or evening. Clean and clear title in hand. Bronco passed Williamson County emissions easily and is road ready.

This bike is a rare piece of history and is truly in unbelievable condition - pictures do not do it justice. I've done quite a bit of research on these bikes and according to the numbers on the engine and frame, this bike was manufactured in the early to mid 1980's and appears to be a MT-11 Dnepr. The MT-16 is the 2 wheel drive version of the motorcycle. The Ural's and Dnepr's were manufactured almost to exact replicas to the BMW's. Versions of this motorcycle are still manufactured to this date. The Ural's and Dnepr's are practically the same bikes just manufactured in different plants and locations in Russia. Motorcycle has all parts and pieces that it originally came with including mud guards for the front section of the motorcycle, original hand pump, sidecar leather cover, seat, etc. that are also in great condition. This motorcycle was in stored in conditioned space for many years and it shows. I've included a bit of history on these bikes below if you do not know much about them. In a nutshell, the Russians basically duplicated the WWII BMW sidecar motorcycles verbatim and most of the parts are exactly the same. I would love to keep this bike but I have too many bikes and don't have the room for this one. Please don't ask as I will not separate the sidecar from the motorcycle. 

This bike is equipped with the 12 volt system and reverse. All lights, signals, horn, etc. work as you can see in the link below to the video of the bike running and driving. 

You can look around a long time and not find a bike that this nice and that has been properly maintained like this bike has been. This motorcycle gets a lot of attention and lookers. There might be cheaper and newer bikes out there but to find one that is in this condition and well maintained is hard to find. This bike will hold its value for years to come.

HISTORY of the URAL
The history of the ""URAL"" brand motorcycle begins with the Russian pre W.W.II planning. Russia knew it would soon be going to war against the Third Reich, and Hitler. The military was ordered to gear up in all areas, including the ground forces that would be defending the Russian ""motherland"" from the invading German Panzer, ground troops, and German Special Forces. The German Special Forces had thousands of the BMW sidecars that the German Army loved for their maneuverability, reliability, economy and ease of maintenance. Carrying a machine gun and soldier plus supplies, the sidecar ""weapon"" was feared by the otherwise ""fixed"" Russian ground troops. The usefulness of the sidecar motorcycle was beginning its legend.

Back in the old USSR, in 1939, the Russian engineers in Moscow were busily dismantling 5 BMWs purchased from Germany through some Swedish intermediaries. The engineers copied the BMW design in all details and made molds and dies to produce their own engines and gearboxes in Moscow. (Incidentally, Harley-Davidson also copied the BMW and delivered about 1,000 Harley-Davidson model XA flat-twin shaft drive motorcycles to the US Army during World War II.) Soon a factory was set up in Moscow producing hundreds of Russian sidecar motorcycles. At this point the rig had no name. As the demand and function for the Russian sidecar rig spread in the military, the top Russian
strategists worried that the factory in Moscow was within easy range of German bombers. The decision was made to move the motorcycle plant further east, out of bombing range and into the middle of the resource rich ""URAL"" mountain region. 

A site was chosen in the small trading town of Irbit, located on the fringe of the Siberian plains. The only building on the site was a brewery and it soon was converted into the first R & D building to prepare for the construction of a massive new production complex to build the ""URAL"" motorcycle. Over 5,000 ""URALs"" as they came to be known in the military, (they still had no official name) were produced for the Russian Army during W.W.II. They fought against the Germans in many sectors and battles and must have mightily surprised the German sidecar gunners when they came up against Russians riding the ""look alike"" and even stronger sidecar BMW clones!

The history of the URAL had begun with the glory of helping to defeat the terror of Hitler's armies on the Russian and European battlegrounds. 

The URAL was built for the military only, up until the late 1950's when another plant in the Ukraine was built to take on that job and the Irbit Motorcycle Works (IMZ) began to concentrate on bikes for domestic consumption. The popularity of the rigs grew steadily with the Russian people and in the 1960's the full production of the plant was turned over to non-military production.

History of Dnepr 
(Russian: Днепр, Ukrainian: Дніпро; Dnepr) is the brand name of heavy motorcycles produced in Kiev, Ukraine. Motorcycles have been produced in Kiev since 1946 at the Kiev Motorcycle Plant (Kievski Mototsikletnyi Zavod (KMZ), Киeвский Мотоциклетный Завод, (КМЗ)). Initial production was of a 98 cc two-stroke model that was confiscated from the German firm Wanderer as reparations. The original design for KMZ heavy motorcycles, and their cousin the IMZ, is taken from the pre-World War II German BMW motorcycle R71, which the Soviet Union licensed in 1940. The plant and equipment needed to make the M-72 (the Soviet derivative of the BMW R71) was transferred from the Gorkiy Motorcycle Plant (Gorkovkiy Mototsikletnyi Zavod, GMZ located in the city of Gorkiy (Nizhny Novgorod) in 1949. The first batch of M-72 motorcycles was produced in 1952 with the supply of 500 engines from IMZ. In 1958 KMZ replaced the plunger framed M72-N with the swingarm framed K-750. In 1964, KMZ introduced a military model, the MV-750 with a differential two-wheel drive to the sidecar wheel. In 1967, to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, KMZ released their first OHV engine in the ""Dnepr"" K-650. Unlike the earlier sidevalve engines with their roller bearing crankshafts, this engine featured a sleeve bearing crankshaft as found in the World War II Zündapp KS750. The K-650 was superseded by model MT-9 650 cc, which was available in both solo and sidecar models (often referred to as the best ""Cossack"") as it was reliable and featured a new transmission with reverse gear and an automatic declutching mechanism incorporated into the riders foot pedal. The MT-10 was the first Soviet motorcycle to feature 12 volt electrics. The Dnepr is famous for its off-road capability. Armed services models equipped with sidecars had two-wheel drive and as much as 15 cm (5.9 in) of ground clearance. The present engine is a 650 cc OHV boxer twin. Modern models are sold with engines ranging from the factory standard 650 to 750 and 1,000 cc. These motorcycles have featured in many films like Indiana Jones and used prominently in the movie Garden State, with Zach Braff. Between 1973 and 1979 Dnepr was one of the makes marketed by Satra in the United Kingdom as Cossack motorcycles. Since demise of U.S.S.R. the factory had fallen on very hard times. Production decreased to only remnants of former glory. All shops were closed, and machine tools were taken out of the city limits.

Jeep has a new crate motor (in line 4 cylinder) that has less than 5,000 miles on it. Jeep is completely stock and has spent most of its life in the Southwest - very little rust at all and not on the body or panels. Jeep has been taken well care of and runs and drives great. Jeep is Navy Blue with tan interior.

Please note: The Jeep has over $1500 in heavy duty aluminum diamond plating installed on it. If desired, these panels can be removed but they protect all of the vulnerable areas and are virtually indestructible. These diamond panels are coming off white in the photos but look really good on the Jeep.

The Jeep has the following options: 
* 4x4 with manual shift into 4H, 4L and 2H
* Power steering, power brakes, intermittent wipers
* Heavy duty winch front bumper (no winch currently)
* All terrain tires with less than 10k miles on them
* Upgraded alloy Jeep factory wheels
* Full Hard Top
* Full doors with slider windows
* Two sets of half doors
* 5-speed manual transmission
* New crate 4 cylinder motor with less than 5k miles
* New clutch
* Heavy Duty Diamond Plating on the hood, rocker panels and all four corners of the vehicle
* Brand new heavy duty battery - just purchased one week ago

This Jeep has been taken very well care of and has not been lifted, modified, off-roaded, etc. If you are looking for a really well cared for Jeep Wrangler that is totally reliable and not a project, then this is your Jeep. Good Jeeps like this one are hard to find that have not been abused or heavily modified. This is not a project or beater and not even close to it. I would drive this thing anywhere and anytime.

Jeep is being sold As-Is with clean and clear TN title. Jeep is paid for and this is not a desperate situation. I'd be more than happy to keep it as long as needed. Cash only (if purchasing) - absolutely no other forms of payment accepted. I prefer calls but will accept emails and text messages as long as they are legit. I will not even respond to text messages or emails that look even slightly bogus. If the ad is up then the Jeep is still for sale. I will remove the ad as soon as the Jeep sells.

Bison Armory, Arp, wilson combat, lwrc to name of few.... Cost depends on options especially at Bison as he will pretty much build to order with whatever components you desire. Pretty much everyone uses the spc II chamber now, I think lwrc calls their chamber 6.8 x 43 but it's spc II ammo safe.... For the most part it's older rifles you have to be concerned about.....I would recommend 6.8forumns.com for more information. Personally I would go with Bison, Ben has great customer service and will walk you through a build no matter how basic or high end.... You decide.... But any of the manufacturers I listed will serve you well.

I have a ""Fowler's Peep Sight"" made by Southport Machine Co., 3829 Amigo Dr., Indianapolis, IN 46237.  It is 20+ years old.  I have never opened the box.  It says it fits Thompson Center Hawken and Renegade rifles.  I have not been able to find any reference to this sight on the internet and the company appears to be long gone.  It appears to be a good quality sight with a nice finish.  I am interested to know how rare (or not) these are, any interesting background information, value, etc.  Thank you."

This was made in 1972 when Colt fit, finish and accuracy were still outstanding.  Comes with original Colt box, manual and three headed Colt screwdriver.  (I bought this thinking I would shoot it, but after looking at it repeatedly, I could not bring myself to do it.  This is for a collector, and that is not me.)  I can supply additional photos for serious inquiries.  From a cosmetic standpoint, the only blemishes are small rub marks on the side of the grip safety from grabbing/holding the pistol, and the underside of the frame in front of the trigger guard has a couple small rub marks.  Very slight take down line.  Grips with gold Colt medallions are as good as they get.  Naturally, has the Elliason adjustable rear sight. Very low round count based on inspection.

You must have a handgun purchase permit or concealed carry permit in order to purchase this gun.  I will supply a basic bill of sale and request you supply a photo copy of your drivers license and permit.  Cash only. No trades, thank you.  Prefer to deal on a face to face basis, but can ship at your expense if paid in full up front.

Last thought.  If you look on Gunbroker.com and other web sites, you can find a Series 70 Gold Cup NM for a couple hundred less, if you are patient.  If you are looking for a shooter, you should look for one of those.  I seriously doubt you will find one in this condition for less than $2,000 online, and if one of the fine gun stores in the area had this Colt in their store, they would have it marked at $2,500 or more.   Thanks for looking."

Now with more than 3 years of custom gun stippling under my belt, I'm now opening the service to all interested.  I provide custom gun stippling for handguns, magazines, rifles, etc.

If you're interested in having a custom design done on your gun, just let me know.  I have quick turn around and excellent prices.  

For those of you that might not be familiar with gun stippling, it's a process where you manipulate the polymer portion of your guns to create a more aggressive grip and in some cases do so in areas that aren't textured from the manufacturer.

It's main purpose is to add extra gripping ability during all types of conditions, gives you better feel of the weapon during firing, which as you know makes for better accuracy.  

Doesn't matter if you have wet hands, sweaty hands, gloves on, etc.  My custom stippling and texturizing makes it easier for you to hold your weapon on target.  

Below you will see just three of the most popular designs, but I offer much more.  I can do designs specific to your needs as well.  My designs also take into consideration your shooting style, left or right handed and how you draw it from your holster. 

To get a quote, feel free to email me and I'll get you taken care of right away.

Thanks again and hope we can add that custom look and enhanced weapon control element to your gun."

Now with more than 3 years of custom gun stippling under my belt, I'm now opening the service to all interested. I provide custom gun stippling for handguns, magazines, rifles, etc.

If you're interested in having a custom design done on your gun, just let me know. I have quick turn around and excellent prices. 

For those of you that might not be familiar with gun stippling, it's a process where you manipulate the polymer portion of your guns to create a more aggressive grip and in some cases do so in areas that aren't textured from the manufacturer.

It's main purpose is to add extra gripping ability during all types of conditions, gives you better feel of the weapon during firing, which as you know makes for better accuracy. 

Doesn't matter if you have wet hands, sweaty hands, gloves on, etc. My custom stippling and texturizing makes it easier for you to hold your weapon on target. 

Below you will see just three of the most popular designs, but I offer much more. I can do designs specific to your needs as well. My designs also take into consideration your shooting style, left or right handed and how you draw it from your holster. 

To get a quote, feel free to email me and I'll get you taken care of right away.

I am so sick of seeing these ""money order only"" scams on armslist. I am hoping this doesn't affect my sale.
Sig 716 308/7.62x51 has around 60 rounds through and performs flawless. Condition is immaculate. I have an illuminated (red/green) 3x to 9x magnification scope, bipod, 3 mags (2 of which are still in pmag packaging) and around 100 rounds of ammo (some is ballistic tip) 
I am starting an HVAC business and am sacrificing this gun to get a low end work van. Priorities.... Ok I am starting to cry.... This rifle is a stinking dream. Nothing to improve on. I couldn't believe how light the recoil was for the caliber!

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine 16"" barrel length in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

We hope that our course can be educational and be found to be extremely valuable even if you never plan on carrying a handgun.

If you need a handgun for the shooting qualification, we have some available to use free of charge.

We will be doing the live fire exercise rain, snow, or shine as long as the conditions do not make shooting unsafe, in which case we will rescheduled for a later date or time.

It's apparent that, some time before I came into possession of the gun, a bit of the hammer broke. Specifically: the part that engages the rest of the action to cock for SA fire chipped off. 

So: no single action. Still locks up fine and shoots true. I've put a few thousand rounds through in the last seven years and she just keeps rolling.

Always thought I'd eventually spend the $39 for a new hammer, but never got around to it. So here it is, for anyone who wants one of these at a price that reflects that future $39 + shipping potential.

In addition to the DA-only thing, it shows signs of wear (holster or other) on the bluing, and the right forward corner of the right-side grip appears to have broken off and been repaired with some kind of adhesive."

No scratches or defects (he kept a cover on it when not taking rounds).  

It is the TA31RCO-M4CP: Trijicon ACOG 4x32 Scope with BAC USMC Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) for the M4 and M4A1 (14.5 barrel) 

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5 barrel). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

This Glock 19 has only been fired a few times and has seen almost no use.  Like New in Box.  Value all day long is $535.00 to $550.00 out of my shop.  The GLOCK G19 is a  safe action pistol is in 9mm and offers excellent out-of-the-box precision.  The Smooth design and simple operation of the GLOCK pistol allow quick drawing of the pistol and is very concealable.  Because of these advantages and especially because of its copact size and dimensions, the GLOCK 19 is the first choice and one of the hotest sellers of the Glock Family.  Standard magazine capacity is 15 rounds but there are options for more. 
Looking for a like new Glock 19 in 9mm but with a lower than new price?  Here it is.  This firearm was returned to me from a guy that bought it a few years ago.  I took him to the range and we shot this gun.  I showed him how to shoot it, aim, basic pistol stuff, care, field strip it and to clean it.  We put it back in the box and he took it home with him.  He called me a week or so ago and said he didn't want it anymore that he felt it was just too much a liability for him to own.  He never shot it again after that day on the range.  This gun is really nice.

I bought this as a safe queen and collectable as I was looking for one that was basically brand-new. This one is in great shape, has no carry wear and the frame is in almost-mint condition minus a small scuff on the nose. Everything is matching and original, up to and including the pre-upgrade black parts that Glock used in the early 1990's.

The reason I am selling it is because the slide lock notch has been worked on. Meaning, the notch that the slide lock lever locks into to lock the slide back has been filed to actuate an easier release if you use the slide lock lever to drop the slide. It is a small alteration, and does not impede function, however it is a modification that I didn't want as I literally wanted a 100% original, unaltered gen2 G19 for collecting purposes. See picture below.

I am looking for $600. No mag included as I don't have any prebans or 10rounders. I also have a Crimson Trace lasergrip (# LG619) that I am looking to sell separately for $175 which is in likewise excellent condition. If the buyer is interested in both I would do a package for $750 total. Many shops in MA charge $700 for just the G19 alone and often with carry wear.

Since I am a NH resident, this will need to be transferred through a MA FFL at the buyers expense. Buyer must hold a current/valid drivers license and Massachusetts Class A LTC, as well as agree to a bill of sale."
