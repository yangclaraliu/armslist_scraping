If your local it is still several hundred dollars cheaper when you factor in tax and shipping.

The 45'th Infantry invaded Sicily and fought up through Italy and southern France, fought at the Battle of the Bulge (Ardennes Forest) and liberated Dachau concentration camp.  Evidently a GI named ""Roper"" liberated this P-38 off a dead or captured German soldier.  The gun appears to have been carried in a wet holster (as can be expected of a sidearm carried during winter wartime) as the exterior shows evidence of pitting, but the bore (and internals) are in excellent condition.  Of course, this gun is not ""import stamped""."

After years of recommending various brands and types of ammunition, we decided to do things right and create our own optimized round for suppressor usage. Putting together a heavier bullet, a cleaner powder, a premium lube on the lead round nose projectile gave us consistent velocities and harder hitting performance at subsonic, suppressor friendly speed. The 42 grain lead round nose bullet is heavier than traditionally available rounds, but isn't so heavy as to cause instability. While ""harder hitting"" and "".22lr"" aren't usually associated together, steel silhouette shooters will appreciate the difference between a knockdown and a wobbling target that stays up! A designed velocity of 1020 feet per second ensures the heavier projectile remains subsonic speed in most all firearms without resorting to anemic velocities.

It is one of the few remaining private lots in the area and is mostly surrounded by thousands of acres of BLM land, with hunting and fishing right at your feet. It's bare raw land, mostly sage step brush with no water, power or anything else to get in your way. A great opportunity for the right person.

We used this land for Camping, Deer & Rabbit Hunting. It is great for that as you are all alone and is like owning 1000's of Acres for yourself. We hardly ever ran into anyone while out there. Also a good area for pheasant hunting but I didn't do much of that, I did do allot of target shooting and it's a great area for practicing that 1000 Yard shot! located in GMU 254 Saint Andrews if you want to look into the details. Great fishing nearby and close enough to hike to the lake to fish in the morning. Nothing like catching a few large Rainbows for Breakfast or Dinner!

I'm selling it for $6500 Cash, and this includes the transfer of title through Douglas County by filing a Real Estate Tax Affidavit, that's how I got it and it was much cheaper that way. If you really want to get a title company involved you will have to pay for that as it costs around $1500 or more.

I will be listing this in the spring with an agent and the price will go up due to agent fee's. Owner contract available for $2500 down, $100 a month for 5 years, or negotiable.

I'm willing to trade or do a partial trade for Gold and/or Silver rounds. 5 Ounces of Gold or 300 ounces of Silver, Also looking for a Barret 50 Cal or 308 AR 10... NO other trades are available at this time.

I will not be able to show the land to anyone as travel at this time is not possible, but your free to go out there and have a look around, directions and all the fine details will be sent in email along with copies of some of the pictures and documents. The area is probably covered in snow so a 4x4 would be a must right now.

You can also paste this into any map site and have a look around: The NW corner near the trail and large rock is: 47.674334,-119.609302

Improved materials and manufacturing methods have made the PMAG M3 magazine perform to a higher standard in all tests: durability, impact strength, chemical resistance, and exposure to extreme temperatures. Internally, a new low friction, 4-way anti-tilt follower and enhanced constant curve geometry further increase feeding reliability in adverse conditions. Externally, the M3 PMAG has been significantly strengthened in the feed lip and spine areas to better withstand direct impacts when loaded to full capacity. The Gen M3 10-Round PMAG's short overall length makes it ideal for use when shooting from a bench rest or prone position, and its slimmer, improved floorplate makes for easy handling and disassembly. The PMAG 10 Gen M3 incorporates additional external improvements to the magazine catch and bolt catch notch areas that have expanded its firearm compatibility to include more than the AR-15 platform alone. It is also fully functional with the FN SCAR-16, the British SA-80, and the HK416/IAR/M27 platforms. The drop-free characteristics of the PMAG were also improved to ensure compatibility with a wider range of magazine wells, including those with tighter tolerances than mil-spec. Made in the USA.

This Military Model Sprint features a conventional Military Model PlainEdge blade-profile with a flat-grind and oversized blade hole. Machined onto the blade’s spine and choil are sections of jimping that inhibit the knife from slipping forward or backward when forcefully cutting or sawing.

The blade is matched with peel ply grey G-10 handle and a Michael Walker LinerLock®. The lock's liner is nested into the scale which augments lock strength without having to rely on bulkier full-length internal liners.

Crucible Steel Company produces performance automotive, aerospace, defense, and consumer-products steels. They also manufacture high-performance steels for the knife industry. Recently they presented Spyderco the opportunity to be the first production knife company to offer CPM® CRU-WEAR® to the public. A CPM® CRU-WEAR® Military Model Sprint Run became a reality. 

CPM® CRU-WEAR® steel is an air-hardened powdered metallurgy tool steel. Crucible’s original smelted-produced CRU-WEAR® was created as an upgrade to A2 and D2 tool steels, both have earned longevity and respect in the cutlery business for their wear resistance and tough cutting performance. 

Powder produced CPM® CRU-WEAR® ups the ante. Through powdered steel technology, the steel is made easier to machine with improved resistance to chipping over the original smelted CRU-WEAR®. The powdered variety also attains a higher hardness factor through greater percentages of tungsten and molybdenum that result in a secondary hardening response."

The Glock 26, often referred to as the ""baby Glock,"" has created a true and practical auto pistol alternative to the standard five shot snub nose revolver.

The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) Trigger (aka: Combat Defense Action)
Developed especially for the U.S. government, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a USP DAO (Double-Action Only) model with a unique trigger mechanism. This mechanism improves the double action trigger performance and reduces the weight of the DAO trigger pull to 7.5–8.5 pounds-force (33–38 N), uses a stronger hammer spring, and shortens the trigger reset. Aside from the LEM mechanism, it is identical to the USP Variant 7 (DAO) model.
The LEM trigger is basically HK's version of SIG's DAK trigger and vice versa. According to the company, the LEM trigger allows for faster follow-up shots (repeat shots) on target than a standard double-action-only system, due to a lighter trigger pull (7.3–8.5 lbf) and shorter trigger reset than standard DAO trigger systems. The LEM trigger utilizes a two-piece ""pre-cocked hammer"" composed of a cocking piece and an external hammer. The hammer is pre-cocked when a round is chambered (slide is cycled). The LEM system supposedly also provides for more reliable primer ignition, since it utilizes a stronger hammer spring.
The LEM trigger can be installed on existing USP Compact pistols that were purchased before the LEM trigger came on the market—either by a certified gunsmith or by sending the pistol directly to Heckler & Koch. In addition, the USP Compact pistol can retain its external safety even with the LEM trigger—making it the only modified double-action pistol with an external safety.
Federal Flight Deck Officer
HK devised the Law Enforcement Modification variant to improve trigger quality and reduce the effort required to send rounds downrange; a 7.5 – 8.5 pound trigger pull vs. a “normal” double-action pull of 12 to 15 pounds. At the same time, the model’s stronger hammer spring improves reliability (by increasing the firing pin indent on the primer) and reduces the slide velocity when firing “hot” ammunition. 
In theory, “The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.” Seems too good to be true. Feels good.
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges. Based on the full size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot two finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly concealable pistol. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame"

The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"
