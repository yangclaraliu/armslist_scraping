They are milled out of a solid 2"" x 2"" x 5"" block of 6061 aluminum which is then hard coat anodized for strength and wear resistance and the screws are grade 8.
This innovative design uses a hardened, non-rotating ram riding on a hardened rail which allows for its use on other slides as well.

Description: The 6.8 mm Remington Special Purpose Cartridge ( 6.8 SPC, 6.8x43mm) was developed by Remington Arms in collaboration with members of the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit to possibly replace the 5.56 NATO cartridge in short barreled rifles.
Based on the .30 Remington case, it is midway between the 5.56x45 NATO and the 7.62x51 NATO in bore diameter and muzzle energy. It uses a .277"" (7.0358 mm) diameter bullet, the same as used in the .270 Winchester. It is particularly adaptable to current 5.56 mm NATO firearms platform, sharing the same cartridge overall length (2.260"")."

Pre Kahr - Auto Ordinance 1911 (Prior to 2001 made in West Hurley NY - ""BUT"" professionally enhanced).  I bought this gun off a guy in El Paso Texas (who worked at the DEA's El Paso Intelligence Center) several years ago who had had it professionally modified/enhanced.  He replaced the barrel and had it honed to an exact fit, strengthened the return spring and receiver, reworked the trigger, polished the receiver, replaced the sights with Wilson Combat sights, among other things.  I can't attest to how many rounds have been thru it, he said he had only run about 20 rounds thru it (sold it due to a divorce), and I put about 50 rounds of various types (Ball and half jacket) thru it with no issues.... so if pre Kahr is a problem for you then no sense getting into trade talk.  Barrel is clean with good crisp lands and grooves.  This weapon looks almost new with little or no wear on it as you can tell thru the pic's I've loaded.

Product Information:

Shop more Hornady products Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The boat tail creates in-flight stability for long-range shooting. Hornady's swaging process creates precise formation of the core around the tip of the bullet, creating a build-up of energy which contributes to its phenomenal performance. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles. This is not loaded ammunition.

Looks like it just came out of the box.
WINCHESTER - MODEL 94 AE BIG BORE 356 Win Caliber Winchester discontinued this caliber model in the 90's
Winchester Model 94AE ""Big Bore"" lever action rifle. Similar to the standard Model 94 but with a heavier, reinforced receiver designed to handle the higher pressure cartridges for which it was chambered. This rifle is chambered for the excellent .356 Winchester cartridge. The .356 Win is essentially a semi-rimmed .358 Winchester, which is itself a just necked up .308. Ballistics are very strong and the caliber is a great improvement over the old .30-30. This rifle wears a 20"" barrel and is fitted with iron sights. It has the angle eject feature and is factory drilled and tapped for scope mounting if desired.  This would make a fine deer rifle and is capable of elk and black bear too.

For this service, i will provide bolt milling, magazine adapter and 1 (one) 20rnd modified duckbill mag all for $200. I will also show you how to modify the duckbill mags so you can cheaply do it your self if you want more mags (it takes about 6-10min a magazine, little to no expertise is needed)

If you’re a shooter with any time in the sport - of course you have. And almost all of us have heard them mentioned throughout our shooting lives. And just about always, they're associated with the Federal Cartridge Company name.

Well, how about a deal on some original >> PRE-FEDERAL CARTRIDGE COMPANY << HYDRA-SHOK stuff!

I have two, partial boxes of it for sale. One in .357 magnum, and one in .38 Special (the original/original).

Here’s what I have…….

23 rounds of .357 Magnum. 
End flap marked, HYDRA-SHOK “125gr. SEMI-JKT COPPERHEAD”.  All cases stamped “HYDRA-SHOK 357 MAG"".  They have nickel-plated cases and contain the semi-jacketed HYDRA-SHOK (center-post) Hollow-point bullet.

34 rounds of .38 Special. 
End flap marked, HYDRA-SHOK “146GR. SCORPION”.  All cases stamped “HYDRA-SHOK 38 SPL.  They have nickel-plated cases and contain the original HS lead (center-post) bullet.  There are also 12 empty cases included.

Both are in original, shelf-worn, 50ct-size red boxes and marked “HYDRA-SHOK CORP., WATKINS GLEN, NEW YORK 14891” along with Hydra-Shok proprietary information on the box backside. 

The name ""FEDERAL"" doesn't appear - anywhere.

I have no firm idea of what this stuff is worth, but one just has to look at comparative places like the auction sites showing lesser stuff going to and from collectors for $5 - $7 a round, says something.  Again, this is pre-Federal cartridge company stuff, with a very enviable history (if you’re a cartridge). These are the ""Founding Fathers"" of the the whole Hydra-Shok line.

Entrepreneurs ... at even $10 a pop (your shipping charges not included) you’re looking at $570. Plus you have the boxes . . . and don't we ALL know about boxes!

I have for sale another stock and fore grip set. These were taken from an UNFIRED Mossberg 590. The parts are:

Speed Feed stock. This stock has places on each side that fits 2 shells each, making it hold 4 total. Bolt and washer used to attach the stock is included.

Mako-Fab Tri Rail Forend. The side rails are removable. Make sure your forend is removable and that your slide tube is 7 5/8 inches long!! Will not fit the shorter tubes without an extended castle nut!

Together purchased online would cost you around $130+ total. I am asking $60 for this set.

I am willing to meet locally at a public place. I will only drive so far, depending on distance. I have met previous buyers at a gun store called The Gun Zone in Mesquite (for your consideration). If willing to pay for shipping, I could ship these items to you, once we agree to a payment method (I prefer Paypal, it's much quicker).

A CMP purchased Springfield M1 Garand. Serial #29618xx. Birch stock in very good condition. VAR Danish barrel which means accuracy. Sling and cleaning kit in stock. This is a nice rifle at a VERY GOOD PRICE OF $600.00. 

The catch...? You have to buy the 2000 rounds of 30-06 ammo that comes with the rifle. It is NON corrosive Korean that was produced in the 70's and was selling here in the early 2000's. I will take .50 cents a round. The ammo is in (5)  50 cal ammo cans. About 1/2 in boxes and 1/2 on Garand 8 round clips in bandoliers. .That is $1000 for the ammo and $600 for the rifle. THAT is a DEAL. Those interested in M1 Garands know this to be true!

 if you can't afford the best - there are plenty of solid, decent firearms you can afford that will protect you and your family and be fun to shoot at the target range

 -- I will not give this away -- I have simply gone in a different direction (.45 ACP)  for my own reasons - so I would 'like' to sell this recent purchase, but I don't 'need' to sell - price is what it is!  Thanks for understanding.

I know you can get a P01 cheaper, but you'd spend way over $100 for a comparable trigger job to match this P02 -- plus tax if from dealer --- so this is a solid deal 

This is the awesome P-01 with the Omega trigger (labeled P-02)  Trigger is only difference between P01 and P02  -- CZ has not produced a Manual Safety P-01 in fifteen years  - you can carry locked and cocked like a good ol 1911

* has only been test fired by CZ  - target included -- tight 25 meter grouping - very very accurate!

I'm selling my safe queen Taurus Mountaineer 1 44 Magnum. It is in great condition and low round count I would rate it a 9 out of 10. They only made these for one year from 1996-1997 it is high polished stainless steel and must be seen to be appreciated. If you held onto a gun like this for a few years you would have a real collectors piece. I'm throwing in a Gun case Plus 100 rounds of Fiocchi 44 Magnum Ammo to get you started. I will do the sale at my local gun store and will pay for any transfer fee. Must have ccw or purchase permit. Asking $699.00 Cash and pickup. No trades. No shipping. This is worth the drive. Serious inquires only. Thanks for reading my ad. revolver"

It has Factory /26\ markings on it. From what I can narrow down, it was made in late 1956. 1956 was the first year factory 26 made the SKS. It has a six digit (all numeric) serial number. According to my research this means it is a late 1956 but I could be wrong. 

Has a Tapco T6 stock. I have not taken the original magazine off the gun in order to use the removable ones, I like the factory ten rounder just fine as it is extremely reliable. Have never had any feed problems. Not even once. If you buy this and want to convert it to use the notoriously unreliable removable magazines then be my guest. The stock is ready to take them. I just never felt the need to pull the factory one off. 

Comes with bayonet, cleaning kit and rod. I have the factory stock still packed in cosmoline, it is in rough shape and the upper handguard is broken in half (came that way when I got it from a local retailer). I even have the box it came in if you want that.

852,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2761852,"For Sale/Trade:  3 NICE GUNS: S.S. Kimber Ultra Raptor II, Ruger SR556 6.8 SPC., Custom Glock 27 Gen.4","Scotland County, Fayetteville, North Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, March 29, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have 3 very nice guns for sale/trade including 2 handguns, & an AR-15 Variant rifle. I will start with the rifle 

Its a Ruger SR556 chambered in 6.8 SPC. It is in excellent condition, and I have shot it around 100 times. It comes with the Troy Iron Battle Sights, Troy quad rail, and Troy rail covers. It's a 2 stage gas piston driven setup, and it's all chrome plated. The bolt carrier assembly is also chrome plated. I have 4 25 round mags for it as well. I will sale it like this for $1,500.00. I also have an Eotech EXPS2-0 for it, a Primary Arms 3X long eye relief magnifier Gen. III, a Troy B.A.D. (Battery Assist Device), and about 200 rounds for it from polymer tips, BTHP (boat tail hollow point), soft point, and FMJ. The magnifier does not have a mount for it yet though. Also have the original A2 Birdcage flash suppressor, and on it is a Shark Muzzle Brake. I will sell it with all this for $2,200.

Next is the Custom Gen.4 Glock that has more money in the modification than the actual gun cost. Some people thinks its dumb, and swear by there stock Glock. This Glock isn't for those people. I feel like this Glock performs better than a factory Glock, and the money was well spent, and done right. This is a smooth shooting accurate subcompact Glock that is perfect for concealed carry, home defense, and personal defense. The trigger is super light, and its balanced to handle recoil better, and get back on target faster. First, it has Trijicon night sights. It has a Match-Grade KKM Precision barrel that was match fitted, and is extremely accurate. It has a Double spring tungsten guide rod that's 5X heavier than a factory guide rod, and 2X heavier than a Stainless Steel Guide rod. It helps greatly with muzzle flip, and recoil. I also installed a Zev Tech Fulcrum trigger, and trigger bar. I put a 6lb. Enhanced trigger spring in , a Ghost Evo 3.5 lb. connector, Lightning Strike Titanium polished safety plunger with reduced power safety spring, a 6 lb. firing pin spring, (also have a factory setting 5lb. And 4lb. Firing pin spring to reduce trigger weight more if desired), and a polished skeletonized firing pin with Marine Cups to make the trigger very smooth and crisp with a clean break at 4lbs. All the slip and grittiness is gone from the trigger with this setup. I have it setup for self defense with a 4lb. pull, and the pre-travel is slightly shorter than factory with the after travel virtually eliminated from the trigger. It can be adjusted to be lighter with the changing of some springs or heavier, and the pre travel and over travel can be adjusted to be a hair trigger to a long trigger pull. I put a Vickers Tactical mag release, and slide catch to help with the controls of the gun. If you know about these modifications you know it's not a cheap setup at all. I also have 3 mag all with +1 Pearce Grip Extensions, and a Minotour Comp-Tac IWB holster for it. I really want to trade this than sell it. I would need around $1,150.00 for it. I have close to $1,400.00 in it. If you want a polymer frame gun that performs like a high end 1911 this is your gun. If you just want a Glock this isn't for you. 

The last gun is much more simple. It needs no upgrades or extra parts. It's a Kimber Ultra Raptor in Stainless Steel. It has 3 Stainless Kimber mags, and a custom leather IWB holster. It's in excellent condition, and around 200 rounds put through it. Very beautiful gun, and is very accurate for a 3"" barrel. I won't sale it for cash. It's trade only. I can trade it alone or in any combo with the other guns for the right deal."

-M1 Garand, Springfield Armory, CMP Service Grade (no longer available from the CMP!), with new CMP stock. Serial number 5.8 million (5,8xxx,xxx). Throat and muzzle both gauged 1+. I hand picked this rifle off the shelf at the CMP South Store in Alabama two years ago, when they actually had them in stock.

-850 rounds of Surplus M2 ball ammunition. Headstamp is HXP (Greek). This comes in four ammo cans. Non corrosive, reliable.

-46 rounds of armour piercing (the black tip) ammunition. 

-90 rounds of Hornady Match grade 168gr AMAX premium ammunition. This is incredibly accurate, top notch stuff.

-Ultimak M12 rail. This is an ingenius rail that mounts rock-solid to the barrel in place of the upper handguard. I do have the CMP upper handguard that came with the rifle with matches the rest of the wood.

- Leupold FX-II 2.5x28mm intermediate eye relief (IER) scope, known as a scout scope (2.5 magnification, eye relief is perfect for this application) mounted in medium height Leupold quick release scope rings.

-Beartooth Products stock comb raising kit. This is a properly sized neoprene sleeve that slides over the stock, holding a piece of foam in place, to give proper cheek weld and sight alignment with the scope (this is beneficial since the scope sits a little bit higher than the stock iron sights (which are still present, and usable by simply removing the scope with the quick release feature of the scope rings

-Limbsaver recoil pad, which softens the recoil and increases the length of pull. Slip on fit. Just like the above stock comb raising kit, this can be very very quickly and easily removed at any time and does not alter the rifle itself in any way.

-1 1/4"" USGI web sling, nylon, OD green

-An assortment of en block clips in 8 round, 5 round, and 2 round capacity. 

-Sturdy hard sided case


I have only fired approximately 200 rounds through this rifle since acquiring it from the CMP two years go. The appropriate certification/papers from the CMP will be included. Everything is in excellent condition. The rifle functions great and is plenty accurate. 


Asking price is $2,000.
