Product Description:

Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes. This Gander Mountain exclusive Buck Mark features the same great handling size of the Buck Mark Micro with a slightly heavier full round 4-inch bull barrel.

This is one of the lightest (if not lightest) tree stands of it's size (platform is 20x36) ever manufactured. It weighs literally just 10.0 lbs. Lone Wolf only dreams they could make and sell a stand of this size that is this light. I bought it several years ago to use when I took my kids out to hunt with me. I would go up a single person ladder and then quickly attach this stand, step onto it, and have my kids come up and sit next to me on the ladder stand. It worked like a charm but my kids are now big enough to use climbers themselves so I do not use this stand even once per year anymore. It has never been left out, just carried in and carried out three to four times. It's aluminum and the seat is very thickly padded and extremely comfortable. It hangs quickly with a 2"" top strap and then a ratchet on the bottom to tightly seat the toothed V-notch base to the tree. This is an incredibly stable stand. It also has a foot rest and a waterproof seat cover which is built into a zippered pocket on the front of the seat. The stand is completely camoflauged. If you want a very light, very stable, very comfortable hang on, then I defy you to find anything being manufactured today that is it's equal within $100 of this price.  You are more than welcome to come see it and we can carry it out to a tree in my yard so you can see just how quickly it installs and how immensely comfortable it is. Call Steve at REDACTED.   I am not interested in any trades please."

The wood stock is a beautiful medium walnut with only minimal handling wear. The bluing on the barrel is beautiful with only a few minor ticks at the tips of the front sight. (I'm being very picky here so, please look at the photos and you will see how nice this rifle is.) The butt plate is beautiful and shows no dings. The specifications on the 99M1 are as follows: 18"" barrel, overall length is 37"", 4 1/2 lbs, ramp front sight, adjustable open rear sight **often missing on others offered for sale**, grooved for scope mounting, tubular 9-round magazine, select walnut stock and 24K gold plated trigger, sling mounts. I believe the 99M1's were manufatured in the late 60's through the mid-70's. I have a reproduction owners manual which is included with the sale of the rifle. It shows how to operate and clean the gun. asking $225"

I bought this pistol new about a year ago thinking my wife was going to use if for CC. That has not transpired. We have put about a 1000 round though it and it has only jammed a couple times but operates very well for a 22LR pistol even with shit ammo. For a 22 with a short barrel it is impressively accurate. You are not going to take a 50 yard shot with it but at 20 yards I can get a 6 inch group.

This is a link to a YouTube video I shoot of me shooting it so you can see that it cycle well and is not broken. Just Copy and paste the link. The video is crappy, its hard to watch the camera and the sight but you will get the point.

The original box is in storage, as I have moved since I bought it. The pistol has an extended magazine release as well as an extended slide release. Included are two magazines with installed pinky extensions that add 2 rounds to the mag capacity making each hold 11. I also have the original mag floor plates.

211,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2648211,For Sale:  Tac-Con 3MR Rapid Fire/Match Trigger - FACTORY NEW - HARD TO FIND!,"Stanfield, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, February 3, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These triggers were just released at SHOT show a few weeks back and have been a huge hit ever since. I have included the manufacturer's comment below. But at its most basic this is a way to have an excellent rapid fire AR, capable of up to 700 round per minute, which is faster than some full-auto rifle cyclic rates. But at the same time you don't sacrifice any functionality in your rifle with ugly boxy stocks or rapid-fire only triggers. This will complete an AR build, to give you the best all around gun possible. In the patented 3rd position it uses the BCG recoil to give the shortest reset available on the market, allowing the trigger to be manipulated much faster than anything else. But left in normal semi-auto mode it has a 4.5 lb match-grade trigger that has been directly compared to Timney and Geissele units. These units are MAP priced at $495, which means we aren't allowed to advertise and sale them for any cheaper. However we are doing some special preorder deals on these, including free shipping or installation, among other things. Also ordering through us will not only be cheaper than buying online, the wait time will be much less. We can also build you an entire rifle with this trigger included. Contact us today for more information and to get on our initial order to ensure the special intro pricing offers. We are a FFL licensed dealer located in Stanfield, NC. 

From the Manufacturer - ""The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.""

The rifle has between 700-1000 rounds fired through it, and operates perfectly. It has a few scuffs as you can see in the pictures, but these are fairly minimal. It has a 16"" barrel, A2 flash hider, carbine length gas block, dust cover, forward assist, and a 6 position adjustable stock. I have also added a few upgrades over the years. It has a quad rail forend from UTG, an upright foregrip also from UTG, a rubber butt pad, a single point sling attachment with a Blackhawk sling, an aftermarket grip with storage compartment, and a Vortex SPARC red dot sitting on top. I do not have the original boxes for the add-ons, as I have moved recently and things like that are in storage in another state. The Vortex SPARC comes with a new battery and 4 extra batteries, as these are apparently hard to come by. The rifle has its original 30 round magazine, and I am including a black 30 round Magpul PMAG with the sale. I am also throwing in 200 rounds of Federal 55 grain FMJ ammo for your pleasure.

I have included the manufacturer's comment below. But at its most basic this is a way to have an excellent rapid fire AR, capable of up to 700 round per minute, which is faster than some full-auto rifle cyclic rates. But at the same time you don't sacrifice any functionality in your rifle with ugly boxy stocks or rapid-fire only triggers. This will complete an AR build, to give you the best all around gun possible. In the patented 3rd position it uses the BCG recoil to give the shortest reset available on the market, allowing the trigger to be manipulated much faster than anything else. But left in normal semi-auto mode it has a 4.5 lb match-grade trigger that has been directly compared to Timney and Geissele units. These units are MAP priced at $495, which means we aren't allowed to advertise and sale them for any cheaper. However we are doing some special preorder deals on these, including free shipping or installation, among other things. Also ordering through us will not only be cheaper than buying online, the wait time will be much less. We can also build you an entire rifle with this trigger included.

351,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2648351,For Sale:  Custom IWB Kydex Holster for the Walther PK380,"South, St. Louis, Illinois",$ 34,"Listed On: Monday, February 3, 2014",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This listing is for a very comfortable, and concealable Left Handed IWB custom Kydex holster for the Walther PK380. 

We at SSXHolsters take the following steps in creating each holster: 
First, we thermo-form our high quality 060 Kydex to the maximum pliability gradually, and without scorching the material with direct advice from the plastics industry leaders.    
Second, we hand press each holster up to 1200 lbs. psi. 
Third, we mill the holsters into the models shape/design, machine buff, then wet sand all edges to a nice smooth matte finish. 
All IWB holsters are fitted with a high quality metal belt clip attached at a single point with quality hardware and Loctite to provide a permanent bond while being forgiving of various body positions increasing comfort and ultimately more good people legally carrying their firearms on an everyday basis.  

Don't waste your money on the rest, spent it on the best!  

If there is ever an issue with your holster simply contact us with the information we provide with each shipment and we will either inform you how to address the issue easily, or we will fix it for you. We ask only that you pay return shipping. 

Why Kydex as opposed to other holster materials? 

Kydex®

KYDEX® (ACRYLIC/PVC ALLOY) SHEET

KYDEX® sheet is an extremely durable acrylic/PVC alloy extruded in a range of colors, patterns, textures, thicknesses, and grades to optimize long-term performance, appearance, and cost effectiveness across demanding and diverse end-use applications. Specialized grades of KYDEX® sheet are offered to satisfy requirements specific to thermoforming, membrane pressing, post-forming, brake-forming, and laminating, and to fit a broad range of specialized applications ranging from medical equipment housings and aircraft tray tables to retail store fixtures and trade show displays.

IMPACT RESISTANCE
No other thermoplastic sheet stands up to impact, and gouging like KYDEX® sheet. Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet offers Notched Izod impact resistance to 18 ft-lbs/in., and is available in thicknesses from .028 to .500 inch to withstand levels of abuse from moderate to extreme. Due to its high degree of toughness and resilience, KYDEX® sheet can also be stretched at room temperature to twice its original dimension without breaking.



FLAME RETARDANCY
Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet is available with fire ratings of UL Std. 94 V-0, UL Std. 94 5V; FAR 25.853 (a) and (d); FSTratings: ABD6031 D6-51377:FMVSS 302; Class I/A and others as described in the following pages.











CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
From sulfuric acid to brake fluid to carbon tetrachloride, high performance grades of KYDEX® sheet acrylic/PVC alloys are more resistant to a wider range of concentrated chemicals than any other thermoplastic. In fact, KYDEX® sheet meets the highest standards of chemical resistance for thermoplastic materials as defined inASTM D-1784 standard for Class 12454-C rigid polyvinyl chloride.



DIMENSIONAL STABILITY
Low water absorption and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion give parts made with KYDEX® sheet high dimensional stability.

CLEANABILITY
Tough stains, scuffs, and graffiti can be removed from KYDEX® surfaces using strong cleansers with no staining, fading, or surface damage.



DESIGN FREEDOM
KYDEX® sheet offers unprecedented design and manufacturing flexibility since:

Numerous grades are available to provide properties and certified ratings required for specialized applications.
An uncommonly wide variety of functional and aesthetic effects can be achieved since certain individual grades can be manufactured using a variety of techniques.
Many colors, patterns, textures, and thicknesses are common to grades intended for specific manufacturing methods allowing multicomponent end products to contain a wide variety of matching parts."

We at SSXHolsters take the following steps in creating each holster: 
First, we thermo-form our high quality 060 Kydex to the maximum pliability gradually, and without scorching the material with direct advice from the plastics industry leaders.    
Second, we hand press each holster up to 1200 lbs. psi. 
Third, we mill the holsters into the models shape/design, machine buff, then wet sand all edges to a nice smooth matte finish. 
All IWB holsters are fitted with a high quality metal belt clip attached at a single point with quality hardware and Loctite to provide a permanent bond while being forgiving of various body positions increasing comfort and ultimately more good people legally carrying their firearms on an everyday basis.  

Don't waste your money on the rest, spent it on the best!  

If there is ever an issue with your holster simply contact us with the information we provide with each shipment and we will either inform you how to address the issue easily, or we will fix it for you. We ask only that you pay return shipping. 

Why Kydex as opposed to other holster materials? 

Kydex®

KYDEX® (ACRYLIC/PVC ALLOY) SHEET

KYDEX® sheet is an extremely durable acrylic/PVC alloy extruded in a range of colors, patterns, textures, thicknesses, and grades to optimize long-term performance, appearance, and cost effectiveness across demanding and diverse end-use applications. Specialized grades of KYDEX® sheet are offered to satisfy requirements specific to thermoforming, membrane pressing, post-forming, brake-forming, and laminating, and to fit a broad range of specialized applications ranging from medical equipment housings and aircraft tray tables to retail store fixtures and trade show displays.

IMPACT RESISTANCE
No other thermoplastic sheet stands up to impact, and gouging like KYDEX® sheet. Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet offers Notched Izod impact resistance to 18 ft-lbs/in., and is available in thicknesses from .028 to .500 inch to withstand levels of abuse from moderate to extreme. Due to its high degree of toughness and resilience, KYDEX® sheet can also be stretched at room temperature to twice its original dimension without breaking.



FLAME RETARDANCY
Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet is available with fire ratings of UL Std. 94 V-0, UL Std. 94 5V; FAR 25.853 (a) and (d); FSTratings: ABD6031 D6-51377:FMVSS 302; Class I/A and others as described in the following pages.











CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
From sulfuric acid to brake fluid to carbon tetrachloride, high performance grades of KYDEX® sheet acrylic/PVC alloys are more resistant to a wider range of concentrated chemicals than any other thermoplastic. In fact, KYDEX® sheet meets the highest standards of chemical resistance for thermoplastic materials as defined inASTM D-1784 standard for Class 12454-C rigid polyvinyl chloride.



DIMENSIONAL STABILITY
Low water absorption and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion give parts made with KYDEX® sheet high dimensional stability.

CLEANABILITY
Tough stains, scuffs, and graffiti can be removed from KYDEX® surfaces using strong cleansers with no staining, fading, or surface damage.



DESIGN FREEDOM
KYDEX® sheet offers unprecedented design and manufacturing flexibility since:

Numerous grades are available to provide properties and certified ratings required for specialized applications.
An uncommonly wide variety of functional and aesthetic effects can be achieved since certain individual grades can be manufactured using a variety of techniques.
Many colors, patterns, textures, and thicknesses are common to grades intended for specific manufacturing methods allowing multicomponent end products to contain a wide variety of matching parts."

We at SSXHolsters take the following steps in creating each holster: 
First, we thermo-form our high quality 060 Kydex to the maximum pliability without scorching the material with direct advice from the plastics industry leaders.    
Second, we hand press each holster up to 1200 lbs. psi. 
Third, we mill the holsters into the models shape/design, machine buff, then wet sand all edges to a nice smooth matte finish. 
All IWB holsters are fitted with high quality hardware.

Don't waste your money on the rest, spent it on the best!  

If there is ever an issue with your holster simply contact us with the information we provide with each shipment and we will either inform you how to address the issue easily, or we will fix it for you. We ask only that you pay return shipping. 

Why Kydex as opposed to other holster materials? 

Kydex®

KYDEX® (ACRYLIC/PVC ALLOY) SHEET

KYDEX® sheet is an extremely durable acrylic/PVC alloy extruded in a range of colors, patterns, textures, thicknesses, and grades to optimize long-term performance, appearance, and cost effectiveness across demanding and diverse end-use applications. Specialized grades of KYDEX® sheet are offered to satisfy requirements specific to thermoforming, membrane pressing, post-forming, brake-forming, and laminating, and to fit a broad range of specialized applications ranging from medical equipment housings and aircraft tray tables to retail store fixtures and trade show displays.

IMPACT RESISTANCE
No other thermoplastic sheet stands up to impact, and gouging like KYDEX® sheet. Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet offers Notched Izod impact resistance to 18 ft-lbs/in., and is available in thicknesses from .028 to .500 inch to withstand levels of abuse from moderate to extreme. Due to its high degree of toughness and resilience, KYDEX® sheet can also be stretched at room temperature to twice its original dimension without breaking.



FLAME RETARDANCY
Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet is available with fire ratings of UL Std. 94 V-0, UL Std. 94 5V; FAR 25.853 (a) and (d); FSTratings: ABD6031 D6-51377:FMVSS 302; Class I/A and others as described in the following pages.











CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
From sulfuric acid to brake fluid to carbon tetrachloride, high performance grades of KYDEX® sheet acrylic/PVC alloys are more resistant to a wider range of concentrated chemicals than any other thermoplastic. In fact, KYDEX® sheet meets the highest standards of chemical resistance for thermoplastic materials as defined inASTM D-1784 standard for Class 12454-C rigid polyvinyl chloride.



DIMENSIONAL STABILITY
Low water absorption and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion give parts made with KYDEX® sheet high dimensional stability.

CLEANABILITY
Tough stains, scuffs, and graffiti can be removed from KYDEX® surfaces using strong cleansers with no staining, fading, or surface damage.



DESIGN FREEDOM
KYDEX® sheet offers unprecedented design and manufacturing flexibility since:

Numerous grades are available to provide properties and certified ratings required for specialized applications.
An uncommonly wide variety of functional and aesthetic effects can be achieved since certain individual grades can be manufactured using a variety of techniques.
Many colors, patterns, textures, and thicknesses are common to grades intended for specific manufacturing methods allowing multicomponent end products to contain a wide variety of matching parts."

If you know AK47s then you know about the quality of the Polytech AK47 variants over just about any other variant out there.  If you don't, just google ""Polytech AK Reviews"" and you'll see they're considered to be the finest AK variants to end up in the US.  Anyway, take a look a the photos and I'll be glad to answer any questions you have.  These rifles are superior to the US rifles in that they were assembled in factories and shipped over here complete, not some random mix and match parts kit from Romania assembled by some idiot at Century Arms.  The factory this came from built and inspected the firearm before it was ever shipped.  As such, the finish and fitment is unlike anything you can buy on the market today.  I'm not the original owner as this was a KFS Atlanta import.  

Like all polytech AKs, this rifle has run flawlessly and has the smoothest bolt and action of any AK I've ever held.  I own an Arsenal SLR which is a fine firearm, but honestly, this one is just smoother shooting. This AK was made in the famed ""Factory #386"" where the Polytech Legends were produced.  When I take it to the range, it shoots 3-4MOA with iron sights and would likely do better if I was a better shot, haha.  Rifle comes with 2 30-round magazines and sling, I can add more magazines or ammo to the trade at additional expense, let me know what you're thinking.

I prefer cash but would consider trading only for a New or LNIB Arsenal SAM7R with a fixed stock.  The only other trades I would consider are high end 1911s, MINT Sig P228 or P220 from W. Germany plus cash."

Will entertain a variety of different trades, although I am looking for a few guns in particular. No to Low round count CZ's, P-01 or SP-01 preferred. Lightly used HK's. Sig 226, FN FNX-45, or a nice revolver preferably a S&W 686, are also of interest. Have a few hundred rounds of 40 S&W to throw in if needed. Thanks for looking."
423,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2648423,For Sale:  Custom IWB Kydex Holster for the Springfield XDM 3.8 Compact .45,"South County, St. Louis, Illinois",$ 34,"Listed On: Monday, February 3, 2014",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This listing is for a very comfortable, and concealable Right Handed (Left hand draw is available) IWB custom Kydex holster for the Springfield XDM 3.8 Compact .45 

We at SSXHolsters take the following steps in creating each holster: 
First, we thermo-form our high quality 060 Kydex to the maximum pliability gradually, and without scorching the material with direct advice from the plastics industry leaders.    
Second, we hand press each holster up to 1200 lbs. psi. 
Third, we mill the holsters into the models shape/design, machine buff, then wet sand all edges to a nice smooth matte finish. 
All IWB holsters are fitted with a high quality metal belt clip attached at a single point with quality hardware and Loctite to provide a permanent bond while being forgiving of various body positions increasing comfort and ultimately more good people legally carrying their firearms on an everyday basis.  

Don't waste your money on the rest, spent it on the best!  

If there is ever an issue with your holster simply contact us with the information we provide with each shipment and we will either inform you how to address the issue easily, or we will fix it for you. We ask only that you pay return shipping. 

Why Kydex as opposed to other holster materials? 

Kydex®

KYDEX® (ACRYLIC/PVC ALLOY) SHEET

KYDEX® sheet is an extremely durable acrylic/PVC alloy extruded in a range of colors, patterns, textures, thicknesses, and grades to optimize long-term performance, appearance, and cost effectiveness across demanding and diverse end-use applications. Specialized grades of KYDEX® sheet are offered to satisfy requirements specific to thermoforming, membrane pressing, post-forming, brake-forming, and laminating, and to fit a broad range of specialized applications ranging from medical equipment housings and aircraft tray tables to retail store fixtures and trade show displays.

IMPACT RESISTANCE
No other thermoplastic sheet stands up to impact, and gouging like KYDEX® sheet. Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet offers Notched Izod impact resistance to 18 ft-lbs/in., and is available in thicknesses from .028 to .500 inch to withstand levels of abuse from moderate to extreme. Due to its high degree of toughness and resilience, KYDEX® sheet can also be stretched at room temperature to twice its original dimension without breaking.



FLAME RETARDANCY
Depending on grade, KYDEX® sheet is available with fire ratings of UL Std. 94 V-0, UL Std. 94 5V; FAR 25.853 (a) and (d); FSTratings: ABD6031 D6-51377:FMVSS 302; Class I/A and others as described in the following pages.











CHEMICAL RESISTANCE
From sulfuric acid to brake fluid to carbon tetrachloride, high performance grades of KYDEX® sheet acrylic/PVC alloys are more resistant to a wider range of concentrated chemicals than any other thermoplastic. In fact, KYDEX® sheet meets the highest standards of chemical resistance for thermoplastic materials as defined inASTM D-1784 standard for Class 12454-C rigid polyvinyl chloride.



DIMENSIONAL STABILITY
Low water absorption and a relatively low coefficient of thermal expansion give parts made with KYDEX® sheet high dimensional stability.

CLEANABILITY
Tough stains, scuffs, and graffiti can be removed from KYDEX® surfaces using strong cleansers with no staining, fading, or surface damage.



DESIGN FREEDOM
KYDEX® sheet offers unprecedented design and manufacturing flexibility since:

Numerous grades are available to provide properties and certified ratings required for specialized applications.
An uncommonly wide variety of functional and aesthetic effects can be achieved since certain individual grades can be manufactured using a variety of techniques.
Many colors, patterns, textures, and thicknesses are common to grades intended for specific manufacturing methods allowing multicomponent end products to contain a wide variety of matching parts."

Its not like the other mounts because it has a QD system so you can still clean your rifle without screw driver. It works well and is a solid system but I decided to go a different route. It hasn't been used but it has been installed. This resulted in minor wear in the front sight locking mechanism but it is hardly noticeable and unavoidable upon installation. This retails at $89.

*Kahr CM9 (9mm) LNIB Only 54 rounds fired.
Comes with everything it came with from the factory, plus extras.

I'm the original owner of this handgun. I purchased it to be my carry, but now need some money.  I purchased it brand new, cleaned it then have only fired it exactly 54 times (I keep records) then cleaned it again.  I never did carry it though that's what I intended to do, but I did keep it in a Remora holster and carried it in my back pack with my computer to and from work.

I paid $429.99 + $29.50 tax = $459.55
Also have 2 new Kahr 6rd mags that where $50.00 ea.
And a set of Pearce finger extensions for the mags that where $25.00 for the set.
Total I have $584.55 into it (not including the holster) and only shot it 54 times, it is like brand new !

This is a great little carry 9mm, I hate to sell but need the money and I'm asking way less than I paid for it and I don't think you will find a better deal anywhere. Buy my LNIB gun and save yourself a lot of money.

To be clear, this comes with:
* Everything it came with from the factory, 1 mag, box, paperwork, lock, etc..
* 2 extra 6rd Kahr mags
* 2 Pearce finger extensions
* I will also include the new Remora holster (not includied in the photo).
All for ONLY $425.00 !!!

***I also have 9mm ammo I can sell for $15.00 per 50 rd box (American Eagle) to whoever buys the gun.

Sorry, but I'm not interested in trades at this time, I need money.

I'm not a dealer so there is no tax when purchasing from me, but you will need to provide a copy of your DL and PTC/PTP and sign a Bill of Sale for my records, no exceptions. CASH ONLY !!!

Feel free to ask questions, I will reply as soon as I can.

The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability. While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out! ""Have neer seen one like this"" the weapon bears No refurbishment marks or other countrys arsenal markings! The metal has not a mark on it is stone mint!

This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine. This rifle saw little to no action its entire life, maybe an officers or political gaurds weapon

The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was apreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle."

Model: 870P Police Magnum

Caliber: 12 Guage

Location: Sacramento 

Will ship: NO

I have a very nice in nearly new condition parkerized Remington 870P Police Magnum. From the serial number on the barrel (LP) it appears that these guns were manufactured February 1995. Remington does cycles through their alphabet code approximately every 26 years, therefore there could be another possible date but with the low serial number on the receiver I think 1995 is the date, but please verify for yourself. This gun is all original and has not been modified in any way. 

Here are some differences between the Police and Express model:
• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer
magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.
• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.
• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

I have a very nice in nearly new condition ""State of California Corrections"" Remington 870P Police Magnum. From the tag and the hand scribed ""HDSP"" on the receiver my guess is that this shotgun is from the High Dessert Security Prison. You don’t see a lot of LE trade ins that have an actual tag. It does not appear by the condition that this shotgun was used much if any. From the serial number on the barrel (KO and PO) it appears that these guns were manufactured May and June of 1977. Remington does cycles through their alphabet code approximately every 26 years, therefore March of 1994 could be another possible date but with the low serial number on the receiver I think 1977 is the date, but please verify for yourself. This gun is all original and has not been modified in any way. 

Here are some differences between the Police and Express model:
• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer
magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.
• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.
• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.
• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

    Its a Striker-Fired Double-Stack .45acp powerhouse, designed in the image of Gaston Glock's masterpiece by non other than Springfield Armory. Not only did they improve upon Glock's horrible Field Stripping design, but they also added a 1911-style backstrap safety. Just to make it that much more 'Merican. And god d**n do I love America.        Then the gun was assembled by a bunch of foreigners in Croatia. Now I know what your thinking, and I hate foreigners as much as the next guy, but i'm assured the Croatians make a decent handgun.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens."

I bought the extra mags and holster new as well. I put about 500 flawless rounds through it and carried it for about a week. It was a little noticeable at work so I got something a little smaller. This one has sat on my nightstand since then aside from its monthly oiling. Last week I bought the full size version of the gun I carry for mag compatibility. It will be my nightstand gun now so this one has to go. I am located in Wichita Falls, TX. Reply by email. Thanks for looking.

This is the US made CMMG mag not the KCI Korean knock off, if you get a chance to hold them both you can tell the difference in quality right away.  The mag is very light unloaded and has even weight distribution because it loads from each side.  The mag has the height of a 20 rd magazine when inserted great for prone shooting.  This mag has the clear back cover that shows how many rounds are left.  The mag can be loaded and stored continuously for five years with over 60,000 loading cycles.  The mag pouch comes with belt loops for easy carry and deployment.  I wouldn't sell it if I didn't need the money right now.

The features of the new Kimber SIS have been selected with the job requirements of SIS and the training program of LAPD in mind. First, it is an ultra-reliable Kimber 1911 pistol. In .45 ACP, of course. Standard bushing and recoil-spring design–no full-length guide rods or bull barrels for the LAPD. The barrel is a Kimber match barrel, properly fitted to slide and frame. The trigger pull is clean and crisp, set in the five-pound region, and the solid trigger (aluminum, no extra holes) lacks an adjustable trigger stop.

The frame is checkered 30 lines to the inch, and the frame has the corners rounded. The sight is a specially modified Kimber fixed sight, with the front face squared off. The LAPD Academy teaches officers who need to do a one-handed slide cycle to do it by pressing the sight against their holster, duty belt or other convenient object. While members of the SIS do not work alone, and often use long arms, they specifically requested a rear sight that could be one-hand cycled.

Kimber, in laying out the pistol, figured a way to incorporate the “SIS” of the unit into the cocking serrations, If you look closely, you’ll see that the grooves are a stylized “SIS”.

On top of everything is the KimPro finish in dark gray over the stainless slide and frame. Why a baked-on finish on a high-end semi-custom gun? Well, Los Angeles is hot in the summer months. Sitting in plainclothes in their cars, it is a sure thing that officers will be sweating onto their sidearms, and no one wants a rusty blaster, now do they? It just doesn’t look right. And it might not work when you need it."
