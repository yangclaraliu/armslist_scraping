Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels. 


* No FFL required on the uppers as they are not the serial numbered part and not considered a firearm.
These can and should ship directly to the end user.

The COP 357 is a very rare pistol that is no longer in production. Made famous in the movie ""Blade Runner"" and seen in such movies as ""Bad Boys"", ""The Matrix Reloaded"",and most recently ""21 Jump Street"" the COP would be a welcomed piece to any collectors collection.  Easy to fire and easy on the eyes this rare pistol has 4 barrels which fire 357 magnums or .38 specials. The COP 357 is a 4 shot Derringer type pistol chambered for the powerful .357 Magnum round. It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is about twice as wide, and substantially heavier than the typical .25 automatic pistol (@ 1.75LBS)  - it is solid stainless steel.  Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 operates similarly to the Sharps rimfire pepperbox of the 1850s, in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.  This piece has a very light professional inscription (see pic) of the name ""Tom Balding"".  Comes with case and 4 rounds of .357.  $1000 or Trade.  Steve - Frisco."

This was my show car until I had kids then became my commuter. 

Tons of mods. Custom dash, hi power after market sound system, 500 amp alternator, racing cams, cold air intake, rear disk brake converison, custom body kit, wing and many more. 

She has 286xxx miles on the motor all highway ( buffalo to Springfield). It runs great only thing wrong with motor is an oil leak at the valve cover gasket. And the alternator needs to be rebuilt. The transmission is strong but due to alternator sometimes stalls on takeoff. Once alternator is fixed than the transmission will be OK. New tires, tie rods and ball joints as of November 


Now for the bad. The fiberglass body kit is ruined. I put new tries on it in Nov and Walmart dropped it off the rack. Broke front bumper in half and ripped off a side skirt. The drop also stripped out 2 bolts on the wing. 

I am selling because I got a new car with tax return. After having the neon for 12 years wanted something different.

Giving you the balanced performance of the big energy .40 S&W cartridge in a full size pistol, the GLOCK G22 closes the gap between the heavy hitting .45 and the internationally proven 9mm. GLOCK's corrosion-resistant, ergonomically ideal, stronger-than-steel polymer frame provides a strong base that dampens recoil. The durable cold-hammered steel slide and barrel are coated with GLOCK's high tech Tenifer 64 HRC surface treatment. Safe Action trigger system teams a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages. The barrel's rounded interior profile offer easier cleaning and longer lasting precision. Loaded chamber indicator. Built-in mounting rails for tactical lights or laser sights. Double action. Fixed sights."

I think you'd all agree that we love our country and we love firearms . With the years of warfare winding down , our veterans are returning home and the economy is improving at a good rate .

My father always liked springfield armory weapons . As they say like father like son . However, with the current state of the company he's rolling over in his grave . Springfield proudly proclaims they are the oldest firearms manufacturer in America . 

This is all well and good . However with our economy in the toilet you can't outsource jobs to places like Brazil and Croatia . They claim to care about America . There are thousands of qualified vets from gunsmiths to machinists looking for work . These guys aren't looking for a handout but a hand up . They are qualified and hard working . Instead springfield keeps their company HQ here to catch huge tax breaks while shipping jobs overseas .

The price point of their weapons should reflect what goes into them . This basically amounts to cutting corners and half assing things . All the while digging into our pockets and not putting anything back in the pockets of our brothers and sisters who want nothing more than to get back to work .

I came across this petition on change.org 
http://www.change.org/petitions/springfield-armory-stop-manufacturing-weapons-in-brazil-and-put-more-americans-to-work-here?recruiter=84921913&utm_campaign=signature_receipt&utm_medium=email&utm_source=share_petition
Please sign it . There are only two signatures so please share it . I believe this man is right I say we boycott springfield until some changes are made . Maybe they could have avoided recalls by hiring workers with higher skill sets . This is shady on springfields part . If they like Brazil so much move the corporate office to São Paulo .thanks for reading and your time please share the link . Let's get this ship back on course before it's too late . I understand a small percentage of their weapons are made here . Small doesn't cut it with me . We are the consumers if we demand things and stand together it will happen . 

I don't have a problem with paying 1,000 dollars for a weapon made here . I know that me purchasing American helped feed a family and kept them working here not in Brazil . Call me a xenophobe but America comes first unless of course you're the folks over at Springfield Armory .

This is one of the reasons why our great cities are crumbling . Cities like Detroit , Pittsburgh etc . I say we stop letting these manufactures buy Brazilian steel and create jobs there not here . We should not contribute to this I'm afraid the blame is squarely on us . Some may not care but this is a big deal . Who buys the most guns folks ?. Us so no matter what you think we do have a say in this ."

from the website:
The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries

For the specifics and for anyone that thinks I am price gauging.  I bought this ammo at different times for the past 10 years.  I paid anywhere from $8.00 to $15.00 a box. I don't know which ones I paid more or less or what price.  I have seen these go for ridiculous prices on Gunbroker. I am not Gunbroker and I am not trying to get rich. I know Mach 2 is hard to find and I am trying to help out a brother shooter.  
That said I think an average between $8-$15 should be fair considering I did use my time and gas to gather these over the years.  I also have Remington(Eley) for the same price and some CCI but don't know if I will sell the CCI. I have more than enough to last me and my son a lifetime. So if you want some text or call me at (859)494-964five (no emails please).  I will not drive far to sell 2 boxes but may for many.  The listing is supposed to say $12.50 for the price not $13.00 but for some reason I type 12.50 & it turns to $13??????
If you buy 10 or more you can have for $12.00.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine 16"" barrel length in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

This is the smallest, lightest, slimmest 45 auto on the market, and in spite of it all it’s remarkably easy to shoot.  I’ve carried this gun for about a year, shot it very little, round count is around 200 rounds.  It’s a great gun, slim, light and easy to carry, but I built an RMR equipped XDm 3.8 and am carrying that instead, so the XDS just sits in the safe now.

I sent this gun to Powder River Precision to have them install their spring kit, tune the mag release and perform their Carry grip work (actual grip texture, not the stick-on grip tape).  Trigger is a nice crisp #4.5.  It also features the factory fiber optic front sight.

The gun comes with the complete XD Gear kit, including 2 mags, holster, mag carrier, case, etc., etc. 

This is a pre-recall gun and I’ve chosen not to send it to Springfield for the optional modification.  There are a lot of people choosing to keep their guns stock and since there seems to be enough demand out there, I figured I’d offer the gun for sale unmodified.  Of course, buyer is welcome to send it to Springfield for free, and as a bonus, Springfield will also give you a free 7 round extended magazine when they return your gun.

Asking $750 OBO, FTF on FA-10 in the greater Boston/metrowest area.  Buyer must have Class A LTC.  All laws to be followed.

I will entertain trade offers, but the only trades I'm definitely interested in are a Beretta CX4 Storm carbine (9mm, 92FS mags), a Kriss Vector or a USGI M1 Carbine (IBM or Rockola).

Pictures are stock, will upload actual pictures as soon as I'm able.

*****

Standard Terms:
I am not a firearms dealer engaged in the business of buying and selling guns, I am merely a collector who occasionally sells a firearm from his personal collection.

All local, state and Federal laws are to be strictly followed. For those who are unsure of how to conduct a private transaction, I'm happy to answer questions and walk you through the process. However, any requests to violate the law will immediately end negotiations.

I prefer to conduct the majority of negotiations over PM, email or text. I'm not trying to be elusive, I just prefer a written record of our agreement.

I am happy to answer any and all questions to be best of my ability, however, please do your own research - I'm not a salesman.

All negotiations are to be conducted via email, text or phone call before the transaction. Once we reach a deal, negotiations are closed. If you show up to the transaction after we've made a deal and try to weasel another $50 out of me, I'll walk away.

You cannot ""try it out"" to see if you like the gun. I am not a walking show room. If we happen to be at the same range at the same time, and I have the gun that's for sale with me, I'll probably be willing to let you to try it out, but this is the exception, not the rule.

I cannot stress this one enough: when we reach an agreement (which could be as simple as ""I'll take it"" and ""it's yours,"") you've entered into a contract to complete the transaction. Unless the item is not as described (I take pains to make sure I fairly describe anything I sell, and I'll allow you all the time and leeway you need to inspect it), you're expected to show up when and where we agree and complete the transaction.

I reserve the right to sell to whomever I wish.

Please don't write ""call me"" with nothing else in your email. I'm not going to call you if I have no indication of your level of interest, if you want to make an offer, or what your questions might be.

Please don't ask, ""Is it still available? with nothing else in your email. That's just a waste of everyone's time.

I reserve the right to ignore ridiculous offers."

Surefire X300 Ultra Weaponlight LED 500 Lumens X300U-A

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X300 Ultra is also versatile and can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X300 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon.

I dropped it in the lower, it didn't fit, I took it out, as quick as that.

I talked to Timney tech support (awesome BTW) and they said that my lower is proprietary and the shelf is to prevent a normal trigger group from over rotating. Not an issue with the Timney trigger. They said this trigger is made to work with any millspec 308 lower, and mine is not millspec.

Looking for a new or used home defense shotgun. New or used is fine. Prefer Remington or Mossberg. Pump action or semi-auto is fine. Must have a 7-round capacity at a minimum. Ghost ring sights a plus. Not a fan of pistol grips for ergonomic reasons but I'm open at this point.

WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER:
I prefer to trade rather than pay cash, but I realize cash is king. I have lots of 9mm and 5.56mm ammo, as well as some Remington Cyclone .22 LR bricks. I also have a new Ruger 10/22 w/ stainless barrel and camo finish, and it comes with a 3-9x40 scope. Also have a brand new Beta Cmag 100-rd AR-15 drum magazine I'd be willing to part with. I also have .300 Savage 180gr soft point factory ammo to trade (Federal and Remington).
