What makes this one stand apart from all the other LCP's?

- 2nd Generation (most current 2013 model - no dash in serial) Ruger LCP 
- Viridian Reactor R5 High intensity Green Laser 
- Hogue Over grip and rear pin for ultimate comfort

- Trigger bar fluffed and buffed for ultimate smoothness
- Barrel Polished to a beautiful tungsten look and shine
- Spare factory magazine - factory only comes with 1, so you get 2 with this sale

Includes original box, Ruger zippered pouch, Viridian pocket holster, Viridian box and adjustment tools, all original factory parts replaced by the high performance ones, 4 spare batteries for laser, fired case, lock, & 2 flat magazine butt plates.

Never shot never carried!  Truly fits in a front pocket, even jeans.

My goal is to trade for a basic Kahr P380 which will cost me probably $550 out the door. If someone had a Kahr it would be a good trade for them, but as a cash buyer, I am aware it will take a special buyer to want to spend $550 or more on a Ruger LCP.  The Green Laser is the biggest single expense (after the LCP itself)."

Must have for the 10/22 collector, get this one while you can. These are the best tactical style .22 cal rifles made. Standard 10/22 receiver and internals inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis, with factory heavy barrel and free float handguard, all built this way factory right from Ruger. MSRP is $649 on this unique and hard to find model. You get the famous 10/22 reliability, plus all standard 10/22 mags (like the BX25) and other internal upgrades are totally compatible, since it has standard 10/22 internals. It is a very accurate package with the factory free floated heavier barrel. It is actually a .750 barrel to look and be exactly the same size as a standard AR15 barrel - a perfect compromise which is larger and more accurate than the regular 10/22 barrel, just as accurate (but still lighter) than a full HBAR (.920). I believe this is actually the only model from Ruger ever made with this ""intermediate"" sized barrel that mimics the specific size of the AR15/M16 barrel. It also has rails incorporated into the aluminum chassis and true free float tube, and even comes with the new Ruger brand flip up front and rear sights as well. I am including a link to this model on Ruger's website for info on specs and features. This is the model with the adjustable stock and threaded barrel with flash hider, not the ""ban-states"" model without those evil features. Brand new in the box complete with everything it came with, bought new by me, and never been fired once. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for the highest end handgun I can get for it, or a new Mossberg 930SPX. But I will also consider any of the trades that are listed below, or any other cool/interesting trades that you may have. I prefer something brand new since mine is brand new, but for the right trade that is not a deal breaker.

This pistol still looks brand new - you'd never even know I shot it, but I'm telling you I did because it's the honest truth and I'm a fair guy. After shooting, I cleaned it and oiled it like it just came from the factory. It comes with the factory hard case, two 17-rd S&W OEM magazines, 2 extra backstrap grips, paperwork, and I'll even throw in a new 25-rd box of Hornady FTX 9mm 135gr JHP ammo. Asking $450 cash OBO, which I think is fair given that it's in excellent condition, you're not paying for shipping or FFL transfer fees, and you're not paying nearly 10% in WA sales tax. I can meet anywhere up north (Bothell, Lynnwood, Mill Creek, etc.). I will need to see your valid WA ID and CCW before I can sell it to you (have to be sure I'm not selling to a convicted felon or non-resident of WA). I am not interested in trades...I already have a P226 lined up to buy as soon as this M&P sells. Email me if you are interested. I don't have pictures right now but when I get home I will take a couple. It looks like a brand new S&W M&P 9mm."

The wooden handle has nice dark brown patina. The blade is marked ""VC SCHILLING SUHL"" Its in decent condition considering its age. I put this bayonet in a cloth sheath just to protect it The WW2 Stag dress bayonet was manufactured by WKC. Which was a well renown company for the production of high quality edge weapons during the Nazi reign. The manufacturer's logo is placed at the base of the blade. In this case is the head of a knight armor. It is important to note that not all of the blades were marked by the manufacturer. Last is the WW2 The long style blade has a wide fuller design and the nickel plating is still bright throughout with some mild age in the surfaces but the blade still grades in great condition. The obverse ricasso is stamped with the knighthead logo having the firmâs initials beneath, âW.K.&C.â. The black checkered grip plates of this bayonet are in perfect condition and are retained by steel rivets having dressed heads on the obverse. The scabbard is straight throughout having fairly good original paint. There is some age in the lower obverse areas of the paint and there are also carrying signs throughout.
