Super clean with low round count (by appearance). The bluing is as beautiful as the day she left the factory in 1988. Wood grips are in perfect shape. Perfectly tight lock-up. Double action is solid, clean, and smooth while single action is light and snappy. Very nice example of an older 4"" Taurus wheel gun….in .357 Magnum. Comes with padded nylon snap strap holster (belt) and 65rds of mixed .357MAG ball/hollow and .38 wad-cutter rounds.

This dueling tree is built for rimfire ammunition! It is made with mild steel paddles that are more cost efficient than the AR500 targets. For a ton of fun on a budget, this is the target for you. A dueling tree is also an excellent training tool that will help sharpen your shooting skills. The unit completely disassembles, without the need of any tools, for easy transport and storage. Most commercial targets are either junk or way over engineered! Either option is a waste of your money! I have designed these to be highly effective without using alot of wasted material, which saves you money! Choose from either a 6 or 8 paddle version. This target is rated for .22 short .22 LR rounds. Please note that all high powered rifles and handguns can damage these paddles, this includes .17HMR ammo. I also offer AR500 trees for shooting high powered rifles and pistols. Please see my other listings for info and prices on them. I'm more than happy to meet you half way within reason. Please feel free to ask any questions. I've sold several of these and have had all happy shooters! Shipping is also available for a flat rate of $50. You can email through the sight or call or text me @ 931-312-912two

Rimfire trees:
6 paddle = $200
8 paddle = $225
AR500 trees:

The slide features our Clark style rib and wears a Tritium front sight and plain black snag-free rear. The sides of the slide have a nice brushed polish on the flats while the rounds are nicely sandblasted to match the matte forged frame with undercut trigger guard and smooth front strap. Grips are Double Diamond by Hogue. The Heritage is a great gun to get you started on the Dan Wesson 1911 experience and we are confident the Heritage will be handed down from generation to generation"

For your consideration, I would offer in trade the following:
Here is the info and a couple of pics....This pistol is in stainless steel and immaculate..This is a variant 3 featuring a DA/SA trigger system with right handed safety/de-cock lever.  It has a standard 3 dot (night) sight system, hard-case, and includes 2 factory 8 +1  round mags ( with two more mags enroute @ $75 each). Also has the rare grip with the ""USP Patent Pend"" on the grip....This gun is in immaculate condition and has less than 100 rds fired thru it....has a ramp and throat job and will fire most any ammo.....I also will include a new $70 leather holster (IWB), a new Fobus Belt holster $40 and will include 200 rds of FMJ winchester to begin shooting immediately ammo.....Will send pics....I unfortunately sold both my AR and AK two years ago and miss not having an AR....I've owned many pistols and most were either HK or Sig and this particular H&K is definitely one of the best and most accurate.....It is a great concealed carry with .45 ACP stopping power and fun to shoot. 

I would like to point out that the Pistol (itself) has a resell value average of $900, plus $150 for two extra magazines (that are being sent) and two new holsters (OWB+IWB) were over a $100 which equal $1150....I can include 200 Rds of .45, which is close to $100 and you have $1250....and I'll throw in $100....

Here is a nice MAS rechambered for 7.62 NATO. The finish is in great shape, with the usual wear expected from an old war horse. The stock was refinished at some point, but whoever did it did a good job. The bore was left uncleaned for a while, and as a result it is not mirrored but the rifling is still very capable (just a bit fuzzy in the grooves). Numbers do not match as it did go through a refurb process. Overall it is in great shape, and does not seem to have the issues that plague these firearms. I have not had ripped cases, FTF's or FTE's.

Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($299 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical situations. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $2400 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $1875. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping.

Awhile back I started making the transition from the AK47 to the Ar15/M4 platform, and this Sig was my last holdout. But, it's time for us to part ways as I have another project I want to work on and I have too many firearms as it is. 

Up for grabs is a gently used Gen 2 (not to be confused with the GEN 1) Sig Sauer 556r semi-automatic rifle. It is chambered in 7.62x39 (AK-47 round) and is very different from any other 556r you have probably ever seen before. 

This rifle was a custom build right from the start. At the factory, Sig added an optional aluminum quad-rail instead of the cheap looking plastic hand guard that typically comes on these rifles. I then went to work on it, adding various cosmetic/functional upgrades from top to bottom. Here is a list of everything that was added:

- Factory installed Aluminum quad rail ($299 upgrade option and worth every penny)
- Burris Fastfire III reflex red dot sight w/ Q.D. picatinny mount ($225) - currently zeroed at 50 yards.
- Single point sling adaptor and sling ($50)
- LWRC 'Rail Skin' rail protectors ($40)
- Front and Rear MagPul flip up B.U.Sights ($90) - Currently zeroed at 50 yards and perfectly co-witnessed with the Burris optic
- AIM Aluminum forward grip w/ Q3 Cree LED weapons light ($75) - 200 lumens if I remember right
- Additional 3 pack of rail protectors ($30)
- 10 total TAPCO 30 round magazines ($200) - all but 3 are brand new, unused
- BlackHawk Tactical soft carry case with ample room for magazines, slings, etc. 

*Also comes with the original box (including manual, lock, etc.), and a LIFETIME WARRANTY from Sig.

Overall, this rifle is used, but in excellent condition. I shot about 750 rounds through it and cleaned it after each use; it is barely broke in. Sig rates these rifles at around 40,000 rounds before servicing is recommended. It uses the extremely dependable gas piston system and has the Swiss style folding stock for tight spaces or other tactical needs. THIS IS THE FERRARI OF AK-47's. Clean lines, aggressive feel, and performs even better than it looks. 

I have nearly $2400 wrapped up in this package as it sits. I am giving it away at $1875. This is extremely fair for everything you are getting in this package. I cannot say enough how awesome this rifle is to shoot, own, and look at. 

To purchase, you must be 18 with a valid ID. FTF only, no shipping. I prefer to deal with CHL/CCW owners (like myself), but no required. 

I would consider full or partial trades for the following: 9mm Glocks, Hi-Point 995TS carbine, Pistol grip 12 gauge, .300 Blackout upper w/ threaded barrel, Ruger sr22 w/ threaded barrel, .223/5.56 brass cased ammo. I WILL NOT pay equal to or what I can get it for new, or new prices for used hardware. I have valued my items fairly and I simply expect the same for trades. 

I am not looking to, or interested in, splitting up this package up. Please don't ask me how much for just the rfile, the magazines, etc. Lowballer’s need not waste your time or mine. I know what this is worth, and if you know what it is, then you know what its worth as well. 

Thanks for looking. Can send more pics upon request.

I also have approx. 2,000 rounds of Hollow Point and Soft Point 7.62x39 ammo - made by Wolf, most are the polymer coated kind for better performance. Non-corrosive and recent production. The buyer of the 556r package will get 1st option to buy this ammo and I will not sell it prior to the 556r being sold. Please don't ask. If the buyer chooses to NOT purchase some or all of this ammo, I will list the ammo for sale accordingly. Thanks."

with the included choke and hevi 13 #6 and magnum blend it shoots a beautiful patterns at 40 yds. I however can't get used to the safety on the tang, so I am going a different route.
It's a great gun in great shape and considering the fact that it is already sighted in and patterned is worth 300+$ (Shooting 15 3.5 turkey loads in a day is not for the faint of heart)

I'm switching to a midlength gas system. That is the only reason for the sale.

The upper is a BCM 14.5 carbine length gas system that has had exactly 30 rounds through it. The barrel twist is 1/7 so 5.56 is run easily through her. The flash hider is pinned and welded of course to bring it to 16 inches.

The lower is a Spikes Tactical complete lower.


Here are the specs and extras on the riifle:

-BCM Mod4 charging handle
-Magpul ladder rails
-BCM BCG
-BCM Gunfighter stubby angled foregrip
-BCM Gunfighter MOD 2 pistol grip
-Magpul CTR Milspec stock
-YHM sling plate
-Haley Strategic Thorntail offset light mount
-Klarus XT-11 800 lumen weapon light (Insanely bright, momentary on and strobe buttons.) Look up reviews, great light.
-Midwest Industries 20G2 free floating rail (installed by gunsmith)
-Damage Industries QD sling mount


*Will not come with mags, ammo, case or sling as I am just switching rifles*



If you're not familiar with BCM, these are beyond milspec. If you're just looking for a plinker, I'd stick with a Bushmaster. But if you want a stick that will last you 20,000+ rounds, and never fail on you, BCM is your best bet. I've had three of them now and will never buy a different AR.

Price is firm at 1500 and please no trades. I have 1700+ in it so 1500 is a fair price for a brand new rifle. I have my IN ID and LTCH. Email or text if you have any questions. 740-358-6187. Thanks for looking and have a great day."
