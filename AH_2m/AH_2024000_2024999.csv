Essentially, the Combat Masterpiece was the K-38 Masterpiece, but fitted with a 4"" barrel and a combat style sight (known as the Baughman Ramp or ""Quick Draw"" sight, it was designed by an FBI agent, for whom it was named). There is a very slight difference in the frame contour, but essentially the frame of the K-38 Masterpiece and the Combat Masterpiece were the same.

The 5 screw frames, like this one, was discontinued in about 1956. This revolver is in Excellent condition and will carry some collector value and interest.

The Wiley Clapp TALO/Colt 21st Century Commander is nothing short of a modern-day classic. It has been said that for people to accept anything new, it has to be at least 50 percent old. If that is true, the gun-buying public should readily embrace one of Colt’s newest offerings, the 21st Century Commander. The Commander is a TALO exclusive Series 70 Style commander designed by Wiley Clapp, eliminating many of the problems associated with the 80 series.  Although the pistol is not a radical departure from the proven, 100-year-old O-frame design, it does incorporate a number of features that define a state-of-the-art carry M1911. The governing principle behind the design of the 21st Century Commander was, “Everything you need, nothing you don’t.” The gun that resulted from this philosophy was neither austere nor lavish, but was supplied with all the features needed for everyday carry.

 The Elite 6500 Series contains the world's most versatile riflescope, featuring a 6.5x magnification range, the widest in the industry. These scopes are ideal for hunters who want a scope they can use in the brush as well as on the wide-open prairie, from Georgia pine forests to the high peaks of the Rockies. Push/pull turrets with resettable zero make sighting-in easier than ever. The extended 80-MOA of windage and elevation adjustment travel (with .25-MOA clicks) make this scope a ""must have"" for the hunter who shoots a broad range of game and at distances that vary greatly. All models have a one-piecee 30 mm tube to deliver plenty of light for those perfect shots right before legal shooting ends, and up to five inches of eye relief. An ultrafine Multi-X reticle accommodates any shooter. These new 6500 models are flagship scopes of Bushnell's Elite line, with the highest resolution and widest field of view, as well as fully multicoated optics with Rainguard®, ensuring a consistently sharp, clear view even in the worst conditions. Rainguard® Bushnell¿s permanent, patented, hydrophobic (water-repellant) lens coating prevents fogging by causing condensation from rain, sleet, snow or even your own breath to bead up into much smaller droplets than on standard coatings. Smaller droplets scatter less light which results in a clearer, brighter view. Now the hunter won¿t miss the shot of a lifetime because of rain or accidentally breathing on his eyepiece. Elite® Bullet-Proof Warranty ""No Questions Asked"" one- year replacement (U.S. only)

Henry Repeating Arms is the current manufacturer.
  First designed by Armalite in 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.
  Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.
  This innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 2.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.
  When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the  AR-7 is ready for action.
  The AR-7 has a sturdy steel barrel covered in aluminum and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.
  Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments.
  It is equipped with an adjustable rear peep sight and a blade front sight."

When Taurus made the first PT-92 in 1980, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory in Sao Paulo with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. 

Taurus has specially designed a drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off.  They’ve also included a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA de-cocking lever. With the 3 dot fixed combat sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

In all aspects of its fit and machining, the Taurus is every bit as good as the much costlier Beretta Model 92FS it’s patterned after. The Taurus’ metal finish is smooth and even. And Taurus uses a stainless-steel guide rod rather than the Beretta’s plastic rod.

Smooth SA/DA trigger
Built in rail for mounting accessories

I have a new, never fired, never even had a round chambered in it, High-Point Carbine in 9mm with the updated tactical stock (Hi-Point model # 995-TS).  I bought this nice firearm this winter but have never had a chance to use it and have since moved on to other shooting interests.  I’ve added the stock-mounted, 2-mag holder which keeps the two extra mags conveniently at hand but out of the way.  Otherwise, this gun is just the same as the day it came across the counter at my dealer’s showroom.  All items shipped with the gun are included (except the cardboard box, at least for now; see below).
When I came to TN for the summer, I forgot to bring the original cardboard box for the gun with me.  It’s in my closet in AZ now and I’ll be going there on business later this month so I can bring the box back for you then.  To make up for that, I’m including the green, tactical gun case shown in the photos.  This case is designed to carry an AR-type weapon in breakdown mode, has a wide outside pocket for a second small rifle and three other removable pockets for mags etc.  It works very well for this gun.  IMHO, it’s a lot better than the cardboard box which you’ll get anyway.   
If you want it, I’ll also throw in 800 rounds of Winchester 115 Gr. FMJ ammo to help you have some fun immediately and get acquainted with this fine gun.

Not sure when he bought it but judging by the box of ammo he bought with it when new this pistol has some age on it (Marine was in his 70's or 80's).

Bought it from a retired Marine who bought it for his wife while he was gone(can see the little flower zip bag it never came out of) and he only fired 3 rounds through it to confirm it operated well.
