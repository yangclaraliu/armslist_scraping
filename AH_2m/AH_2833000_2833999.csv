I bought a brand new vehicle last year and have about 6k mikes on it, I have not added anything valuable to the vehicle, if I tried to sell it for thousands over the window sticker I'd be looked at as a moron."

I have a Brand New Taurus PT22 22/25LR pistol. It's a great gun and very unique as well. It offers a new or experienced a great comfort in the grips because they are thicker so works for men and women. Has a perfect style and size for a pocket or purse or holster. I have two and this ones never been shot besides the test fire from the manufacturer. It has a unique barrel that actually pops up and allows you to load a individual bullet into chamber by hand and then 8 rounds in the clip so it's 8+1 rounds. 


This gun is perfect for a older generation due to it's easy load round in the barrel and the safety features as well as size. The gun will not fire without a loaded clip it won't even let the trigger squeeze. 

It's highly accurate for a 22 and also is .22/.25 rounds and easy to function. Perfect self protection weapon with ability for multiple size rounds. It is Nickel in color with Ebony Rosewood grips that can be changed as well. 

The weapon is brand new. It Retails for $275-$400 depending on which color and package option you choose because it has a lot of color and feature options. This one specifically as is retails for $325-$375. I also have the handgun, the original box and manuals as well as 5 boxes of new 22 caliber rounds. Each box contains 40 rounds and are .22 Cal with 38 grain copper plated HP rounds. So I have the handgun brand new, the original handgun hard case, 200 American Eagle Rounds which is 5 boxes of 40 rounds each. The rounds of ammo are about $30-$40 worth. I am also willing to throw in a basically brand new safe by security safe it is fire proof for a little extra the safe is $69.99 retail. 

So all together the Handgun, ammo, safe and everything is approximately $430-$480 all together. I am looking to get $380 for everything and $350 without the safe, I am willing to consider reasonable cash offers. Also willing to consider some trades or partial cash n trade offers I like tons of stuff so nothing specific really just let me know what you have and your offer. I am also interested in possibly trading for a Glock or Larger Caliber pistol. So let me know if you have any questions or your offer and we can go from there! 

I will not shop, local cash or trade transactions only please. We will need to meet up in a public place for transaction simply for both parties safety.

I three brand new Ruger LCR 357 (model# 5450) coming in on tomorrow. http://www.ruger.com/products/lcr/specSheets/5450.html

These are hard to get, most places (including distributors) are sold out.  I was lucky that my rep saw I had searched for one the other day (for a customer) and called, asking me if I wanted one.  He said they'd probably be sold out within the hour.  I just checked, he was right; out of stock again.

- They are .357 mag (can also shoot .38 special)
- Made with Stainless Steel but Ionbond Diomondblack finish (black in color)
- Hammerless
- 1.875"" barrel
- Hogue Tamer Monogrip

MSRP is $599.  I'm selling them for $500 (and that's with a very low margin on my part).  I'm not going to advertise my costs on here, but I'm not secretive about it either.  I'm willing to discuss the breakdown of my costs if you need that information to help you decide.  Hope to hear from you!

P.S. I do transfers for $20, discounts for LEO, First Responders, Teachers, Nurses, and poor people (if you can justify it). Please check with me before you order online, I can probably match the price and get it in sooner, if not though, no worries; my transfer fee's are pretty reasonable!"

It would be an excellent concealed-carry gun. Test fire date is 12/18/13.


This is the non-external safety model, includes a Foxx IWB holster, 2x 10rd mags with flat-baseplates and pinky extensions, all box and manuals plus trigger-guard lock that came with it new. It has installed but easily removable traction grips in rubber texture.


I got it home and took it apart, breaks down super easy, cleaned it, hand-polished the feedramp(didn't remove material, just shined it and the chamber entrance up), lubed and reassembled. Trigger is a decent DAO with internal hammer, fired it a bunch with a snap-cap and it feels pretty good to me! Slide moves smooth and the grip feels great in my hand.


I read a lot on these guns and these Gen2 guns have a great rep, SCCY offers a forever-warranty that stays with the gun, doesn't need to be transfered: http://www.sccy.com/service-support

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not going to separate at this time, please do not ask.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock
- 3 x Original cleaning rods

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required. Again, I will not separate anything at this time, please do not ask. Thanks for looking. 

I have additional pics if desired."

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not going to separate at this time, please do not ask.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most is sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x  Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.). Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had the a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required. Again, I will not separate anything at this time, please do not ask. Thanks for looking. 

I have additional pics of the stamps and markings on the rifles (at least as best as I could get), if desired."

I purchased this gun used, and it shoots great, but is having some issues.  After 40-60 rounds it begins to fail to feed, but still ejects fine.  I have tried various mags and ammo, but the problem is consistent.  I have had several people look at the gun, and suggestions have ranged from getting a heavier buffer and spring, to replacing the bolt carrier group, to needing a whole new upper.  I simply don't have the time or the expertise to continue to troubleshoot this gun, but I'm sure that somebody that knows what they're doing could get it functioning properly.

Trading at values far below ebay value for a firearm, or possibly several firearms.

On your end, if you have a new gun (un-fired), I'll give you new or very close to new value on it. If it's used (50 rounds or 5000 rounds), obviously it lowers the value based on condition and other factors. I know how to use the internet and firearms value books, and am fairly knowledgeable. However if you can teach me something, I'm always eager to learn; just please don't try to tell me that your Century WASR 10 with a canted front sight and head spacing issues is worth $700, or that your bubba'd tacticool yugo is worth $500. Nothing against people who have a crappy AK or SKS.

Bottom line: I can't be held responsible if you over-paid for your gun. 

I am a FOID holder, and will follow all IL laws regarding transfers."

    Colt alone was $1200 after taxes. Everything is brand new. Gun has never been fired. Why buy at a gunstore when you can have an unregistered one that's new and nicer? Better price overall by far with all the features and don't have to pay taxes or fill out any forms except my personal bill of sale of which you get a copy. 
My loss, your gain.

These revolvers are a longtime favorite of security personnel and perfect for Homeland Defense Forces. With a choice of .38 Special +P (Model 82) or .357 Magnum (Model 65), this medium frame, 6-shot revolver features comfortable rubber grips and a deep, lustrous finish. With fixed sights and a custom Single Action/Double Action trigger for improved accuracy and speed, the 65 and 82 are the perfect partners for whatever trouble lurks around the corner. For even more firepower, the Model 66 steps up to the plate with an impressive 7 rounds of .357 Magnum.    Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun. 

   7 Rd Cylinder Feature
Some Taurus models offer our 7-shot cylinder. A shot above the rest. 

   Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

It's a Glock 29. Has had Glock brand night sights installed, and has a stipled grip, which is good, but takes getting used to.
Still pretty average, so far, isn't it? Not something you'd write home about.

But, I also have 300 assorted rounds for it, most are Underwood hollow points, all ammo is quality.

Sure, that's pretty good so far, but after you shoot those rounds, it'd be expensive to run, right? Nope. 
I have an aftermarket Lone Wolf 10mm-.40S&W barrel conversion. Along with just under 200 rounds of assorted practice ammo.

What about magazines? I have 4x10 round magazines for the 29, and 2 of them have the Pierce grip extension, for comfort and stability.
I have one 15 rounder for the standard Glock 20 (which, yes, it does fit in it's baby brother. It's a Glock.) Along with a sleeve for that, so it doesn't look stupid, and is comfortable to hold.

Then why not just get the full size G20, if that's what you want? I could just put the full size barrel by Lone Wolf on it, which is what I do.

This is a 92FS Reverse Tone. The barrel and slide are black and the frame is a lightweight aluminum with an anodized Inox (Stainless) finish. The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/single action provides a very safe and time-proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

If it still does not fire, then extraction by slide operation will insert a fresh round and revert to single action firing mode Automatically.

i bought this from a guy on here a year or so ago as a parts kit.  the kit was from ak-builder.com and had the front end already built and headspaced with a chrome lined barrel.  the guy also had a nodak spud reciever with it, i didnt realize untill i got home and looked closer that the receiver was for 7.62x39.  Well, i decided to just remedy the differences in receivers and built it.  i have since put over 500 flawless rounds through it.  the only reason i am selling it is because i need cash.  Its just the only gun i have im willing to let go, if i didnt need the money it would stay in my safe.  i paid $600 just for the kit and receiver, not including other little parts and labor.  i just want to get most money back, so im asking $550 firm."

If you want just the lower you can buy it, or have a custom AR built. Choose your caliber, barrel, trigger,...etc.
