Looking to sell my Gen 3 Glock 23 with lonewolf 40-9 barrel. Comes with two .40 mags ( one 13 rd and one 15 rd), 1 15 rd 9mm mag, and the lonewolf barrel. All mags are made by Glock. Like having a Glock 19 and 23. Also have 4 piece chrome set (not installed) slide release, take down lever, and two pins. This 23 is a bit older I believe around the year 2000 was when it was manufactured. The slide is the less slippery slide unlike most gen 3's. 9mm barrel has had around 200 flawless rounds and the .40 barrel has around 500-600 I'd say. All flawless as you'd expect from Glock. Internals look excellent, surprisingly smooth trigger for stock. Not in any rush to give it away, please feel free to make offers. Feel free to text or email me REDACTED. Will respond quickly to either one. Will ship on your dime.

AegisÂ® models are built in the Kimber Custom Shop for shooters with small hands. Thin grips, altered controls and rounded edges make them easy to shoot. A great single-stage 1911 trigger that breaks clean at under 4 pounds makes them easy to shoot accurately. Standard features include night sights, 30-lines-per inch front strap checkering and a premium two-tone KimPro II finish that is both self-lubricating and extremely resistant to moisture. Self-defense is no place to compromise. Carry the best. Carry a Kimber AegisÂ®.

Condition is excellent with 99% plus of the original finish with some slight handling marks. Wood is also excellent with sharp checkering and only two slight scratches / dings in the stock. Case is excellent.

I have been the only owner of this shotgun since I won it a few years back at the local DU banquet. I have shot it a dozen times just to try it out and almost all of its time has been in the case. I am frankly not sure how it even got the few very small scratches / dings. All of the metal and the barrels are pristine and look brand new. Action is very tight.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed
from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight
and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity
reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking
dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy
are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for
plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry
by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the
P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

I set this up to hunt with, but have neck/shoulder/arm issues that have been plaguing me. I had listed this a couple of weeks ago, but pulled it in the hopes of being able to keep it. I came to the conclusion that it is still just too much for me and thus picked up an SKS instead. Therefore, this is back up for sale. I am asking $350 for the package.

Atwood"" during WWII as the rifle was probably re-inspected by an arsenal for service after WWI for use in WWII.  There is also a very faint ""P"" proof marked behind the trigger guard.  The stock on this rifle is an original pre-WWI or WWI original finger groove stock and is quite rare.  The metal is solid but showing some wear to the parkerization.  The bore shows rifling and grooves but has seen some action showing some corrosive ammo use which was standard in WWI with some pitting.  Overall, this is a rare early WWI rifle that has seen some action.  I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country to an FFL."

I bought this weapon as a home defense gun, but my girlfriend was never really confortable with the AK platform so I switched to a different rifle.  This is a Bulgarian made new production gun with a cold hammer forged barrel and factory side folding stock, nothing but the best.  The 107CR has a gas block with integrated front sight, reducing the swing weight of the AK, making it quicker to target.  It has a faux conical recoil booster that covers up the 16 inch barrel, but if you want to remove the booster I threaded the barrel to accept a muzzle device (standard AK threads).  I changed the sights for meprolight tritium sights, they were installed a year ago so the tritium is very bright.  The weapon has a Solar Tac MFER mag well, which helps speed reloads up considerably by propperly aligning your mags during changes.  I changed out the pistol grip for a US palm grip, which helps you get better leverage on the gun than the standard AK grip to more easily manipulate the weapon.  I also installed a Krebs custom safety lever, which has a bolt hold open notch and allows for one handed manipulation of the safety.  The front forend was replaced with a Russian made grip, which has 1913 rails for adding a light.  I worked very hard to keep the weight down, unloaded this rifle is only 7 and a half pounds, it has very little recoil in firing and is already set up to be the ultimate fighting Kalashnikov.  This is the real deal, not some cheapo WASR with some Tapco crap bolted on to look cool, this gun will carry you through the Apocalypse.

If you would like, I also have a Russian made PK-A sight for sale that I will sell for 250$ in addition to the cost of the rifle.  The gun will come with the original 5 round factory magazine, but if you need more mags with the gun let me know, I have a ton of AK mags of various types and I will cut you a deal on the mags of your choice."

Taurus Model 605 .357 Magnum Revolver, 2in bbl, 5-Shot, Stainless

OLD SCHOOL = 1993 (94?) vintage; Pre-frame lock model ! ! !

I bought this new in 93 or 94. It was made WAY before the integral frame lock models came out. Round count is very low for its age, maybe 400? Pistol was carried a lot more than it was shot.

Shows some handling/holster marks, you can see in photos, but just surface marks, they are superficial, nothing into the metal. No rust, well maintained.

I bought this so long ago, I no longer have the box/manual. So I will deliver it to buyer in a Mil-tec Holster w/ 4 ammo loops. You can get a manual free from Taurus, I can even download one for you and deliver it with the handgun if desired.

You don't see pre-lock guns of this type surface for sale very often, $350 should be a fair price. They go for $430 new on gunbroker, plus shipping, plus a transfer fee, maybe plus tax depending on where you are."

It's a black gun and I'm not a photographer, so I'm not posting any pictures because I can't take one of this gun with my cell phone that's worth looking at.  If you search for Marlin XL7 will see what the gun looks like.  Mine has no damage.

I bought the gun new earlier this spring.  I can shoot quarter size groups at 100 yards and 2 - 4 inch groups at 200 yards (heavier bullets shoot better).  

This was done with a 22x Barska scope that's not included with the rifle.  I only mention this because a lot of people at my gun club wouldn't be caught dead shooting with a Barska scope, so this gun might shoot better with a Nikon or Luepold scope.

I would be interested in trading for a marlin .357 lever gun or a ruger 9mm carbine."

This MO version is double dated 1931/46.  The MO rifles are generally believed to be refurbished military rifles that were cleaned up rebuilt and then given to various Russian security forces for use.  The first date is the original date of manufacture and the second date is the refurbish date.  This means that the MO rifles typically have better finishes on the stock and metal surfaces than typical 91/30 rifles, and this specimen is no exception.  Like most MOs this one has been counter bored to improve accuracy.  This rifle comes with a sling, bayonet, oil can, multi-tool, and some other tools, cleaning rod, plus 200 rounds of 7.62 x 54r ammo.  I only showed a sample of the ammo in the photo, not all of the ammo is shown. 

This rifle has all matching serial numbers (9581).

I've had the rifle head-space checked by a gunsmith, and it passed with no problems.  I'm the original post-import owner, and I have cleaned off the cosmoline and lubricated the rifle, so it is ready to shoot.  I have fired approximately 25 rounds through it and it is a good shooter.  I've got too many of these Russian rifles and so I need to clear out the gun safe.  Here is a chance for a rare Mosin MO with a hex receiver and matching numbers in great shape with all the accessories you need plus ammo.  

I prefer FTF sale in or around the Winston-Salem area.  I'm actually located on the West side of the city, but could meet most any place.  Price is firm.  This is a great deal when you add in the accessories included plus the ammo, plus the rarity of the rifle.
