If you've ever wanted to shoot a full auto rifle but could never afford one of your own or get your hands on one to try out, here is your chance. First off, this rifle is ""Not"" an ""Assault"" rifle, it does ""Not"" shoot ""Full-Auto"", it ""Simulates"" full auto fire. It is a Bumpfire stock made by Fostech Outdoors. The Fostech Bumpski stock simulates full auto fire, with slight forward pressure using your forehand you will slide the gun forward engaging the trigger with your other hand, the recoil of the round being fired will reset the rifle and your continued forward pressure with your forehand will then engage the trigger again, simulating ""Full-Auto"" fire. There is only one shot for each trigger pull, therefore it is ""Not"" full auto. The rifle is very easy to use even for those that have never shot a bump fire stock. It is easy to control and empty a full magazine on target. The Bumpski Stock is made of aluminum, is adjustable from select fire mode to simulated full auto or Bumpfire mode,  and is adjustable for lefties or righties. This has been an extremely fun rifle to have, worth every penny because of the amount of joy myself and others got out of it. Everybody that has shot the rifle has had a smile from ear to ear. The rifle is in perfect condition and has less than 600 rounds through it. The rifle comes with a 1'' rubber recoil ruling butt pad, quick detach side rail scope mount, Magpul Angled fore grip, Tapco short vertical grip, tactical cammo soft carry case and (4) Tapco 30 rounds magazines. Asking $1,450.

I am being generous to the very few flaws that are present.  This gun is numbers matching.  The only thing I have done to it is have Kivaari give her a trigger job (with replacement parts and shipping I paid over $90 for this service).

I purchased this rifle on November 9th brand new in the box and I have fired less than one box of ammo through it. I would like to sell the two together, but I can sell them separately if needed.  I have the original box for both the scope and the rifle along with several added extras including a neoprene sling, a box of Remington Core-Lokt bullets (plus 5 loose rounds), and a black elastic 9 round butt stock ammo carrier. I also have a Limb Saver precision fit recoil pad with the box for an additional $25 if you are interested. I would be willing to trade for an AR, so feel free to let me know what you have. I am asking $850 for the pair including the items listed above. If bought together, everything included would cost over $950 after taxes and/or shipping, so this is a great deal if you don’t mind a few rounds being put through it. Below is a link to both items and their descriptions in more detail. Please contact me at REDACTED if you have any questions. Southaven, MS. Thank you.

 IWI TAVOR SAR 16.5"" Black right handed model. Chambered in 5.56 NATO/.223 REM. Sale will also include a COPY of the IWI TAVOR Armorers Manual. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

First introduced in 2000, nearly 300,000 CompM2 sights are now in use by many Armed Forces including elite Special Forces around the world. The CompM2, also known as the M68/CCO (when used by US forces), is the standard sight for the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as well as the armed forces of many NATO countries. Due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision device (NVD), the CompM2 is ready for use around the clock. The CompM2 holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, the CompM2 is completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2,5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use the CompM2.

Unique features for CompM2:

Compatible with every generation of NVD
CET technology allows up to 10,000 hours of daytime operation on one battery
100,000 hours of use on NVD setting

I have bullets, brass and dies along with a custom gun belt that will go with it.

.44 caliber percussion 1873 (Colt SAA clone/7.5'' barrel). Unfired, LNIB, and in MINT condition other than a barely visible turn ring around the cylinder. Comes with original box, papers, full box of .454 round ball, snail capper, & set of extra nipples. This still has the original packing grease on it. This is a nice color case hardened & blued model, unlike the cheapo entry-level models with the matte finish. 

$330 obo. FTF transaction, no paperwork required (as it is a muzzleloader). I will need to see a driver's license to confirm age (must be at least 18 years old). If you pick it up, I'm willing to work a little on the price. I'm not an unreasonable person, make an offer. I am taking a pretty hard hit on this one compared to what I bought it for a couple years ago.

These are super, super nice clones, and a great way to get into a legitimate piece of history. Unfortunately, I have to sell off a few toys due to health issues I'm not willing to disclose on the internet. 



Additional: Don't bother asking me to ship, if I was willing to ship, I would have stated that in the ad. Likewise, ridiculous, lowball offers are going to be ignored. This is not a $200 blaster. Go buy a Pietta if you want something on the cheap, otherwise, don't bother me."

This is a great deal if you don't mind it being mounted on a safe queen for a couple of weeks. Below is a link to tell you more about the scope. Please email me or contact me at REDACTED if you are interested. Thank you.

It is double action only w/ a protected hammer. The barrel comes ported from the factory and it uses a dual/twin recoil spring. Nice Nickel plate finish. No manual saftey.

It is a semi-automatic 12-gauge shotgun based on the classic AK action. Unlike many Saiga 12's, this has the correct number and orientation of gas ports and with its current configuration of gas plug, piston and recoil springs, it will cycle ANY ammunition- even birdshot. Saigas usually start to get more reliable after around the 350 round mark, this one has 500 rounds through its chrome bore- not a lot at all. I used the following parts to build this weapon:

- Chaos USA Quad Rail
- Chaos USA Warthog Muzzle Brake
- Gunfixr High Pressure Gas Plug
- Tapco Puck
- Tapco G2 Singlehook Fire Control Group, all contact surfaces polished for smooth trigger feel
- Jack Travers Engineering Mainspring, VERY light trigger- this gun can be run VERY fast, excellent for competition
- Jack Travers Engineering Action Spring
- Tromix Trigger Guard
- Jack Travers Engineering Extended Magazine Release
- Tapco SAW Grip in Black
- ACE Commercial Spec Fixed AR Stock Adapter with Ambidextrous Sling Mounts
- Magpul CTR Stock in Black
- Krebs Axis Pin Retaining Plate
- Safety Lever slotted for BHO use
- OEM BHO rounded outwards so it can be used as a Battery Assist Device, simply push up on it with the trigger finger while cycling the action and the bolt will lock to the rear, push down on it and the bolt will return forward.

Included with sale:
- Two Surefire Gun Mags 13 +1 Round Magazines, unlike tube fed shotguns, Saigas actually prefer the larger, more powerful three inch shells
- Original Russian Five Round Magazine
- Hard Carrying Case
- One bottle of Hoppes #9 Lubricant

Feel free to message me any questions or requests. To be honest I dont want to see this gun go, it runs like a champ and its definitely the most fun and ridiculously powerful thing I've ever shot. That said, it mostly just sits in the closet and I'd get more happiness out of a motorcycle right now so... Priorities. Similarly equipped S12s go for a few hundred more on Gunbroker regularly, but this has cosmetic wear and Im not trying to rip anyone off so I think a few hundred off list price is fair. I will not consider lowballs or trade offers. There is not a more awesome Christmas present...

Price is $999 FTF in Houston or $1099 shipped to your CONUS FFL."

This is an awesome package deal that will make all of your friends jealous. The pieces of this package will not be sold separately.

This item is in stock and ready to ship. Since it is in high demand and will sell fast, please email to inquire about availability. 


This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

SR-15E3 IWS LPR
The KAC Light Precision Rifle (LPR) is the answer for 5.56mm shooters who want a light match system. The LPR utilizes an 18” Match Stainless Steel barrel with a Custom Match chamber, along with our IWS lower. Shooters will find that this weapon system offers a capable Competition System or Precision Perimeter Weapon for the Law Enforcement Sector.

E3 Enhanced Bolt
The E3 Enhanced Bolt from Knight’s Armament features a number of components designed to make this bolt the most durable and reliable bolt available. It is a proprietary bolt specifically designed for our SR15 and 16 models. The E3 Bolt boasts several features that add to the its overall performance such as the enlarged bolt face, rounded lugs, reduced cam pin, and proprietary extractor and firing pin designs.

This E3 Bolt is manufactured with an enlarged bolt face that provides more positive engagement in the chamber and lugs which are rounded to help to reduce chipping, cracking and snapping. This strengthened design helps to increase the life of the bolt and ensure a proper seating each time the weapon cycles.

The E3 Bolt’s extractor design is also a unique achievement that helps to provide an extremely reliable component. It’s shaped like a rounded ‘T’ and sometimes referred to as a ‘butterfly’ shape. The pivot point of the extractor is shifted forward to help balance out the extractor and apply constant pressure on the shell which reduces cases of extraction failures. Another strong feature of the unique design of this extractor is the use of two full size extractor springs, as opposed to the standard micro spring. This allows for a reduction of relative compression while the extractor is in motion and provides a failsafe in case one spring fails. The bolt will continue to function properly and afford a user the opportunity to continue with their mission or firing schedule.

The E3 Bolt is designed with a thinner Cam Pin and Firing Pin whose overall size has been reduced. The thinner Cam Pin allows for a thicker bolt web which is a common failure point in normal bolts. The reduction of the Firing Pin size is to accommodate the thinner Cam Pin.

The full capabilities of the E3 Bolt are realized when exposed to full auto or extremely high cyclic firing rates yet the bolt performs gracefully under casual firing conditions. This component was designed to be exposed to the most stressful and unrelenting conditions and exceed expectations for durability and service life

Ambidextrous Controls
Knight’s Armament designed this system to give shooters the maximum amount of options in their controls. Under this design all of the weapon’s major controls can be accessed from either side of the lower receiver. Left-handed shooters see the immediate benefits of being able to access the weapon’s controls in a more intuitive manner; however, there are a number of other benefits that right-handed shooters will enjoy under this system.

Competition shooters benefit from these controls from the increase of speed that is achieved through components such as the right-side bolt catch. Trainers enjoy the variety of options because they can watch their trainee from either side of the weapon and even manipulate the weapon’s controls from the non-operating side. KAC has also introduced modifications to the design such as the scalloped safety selector switch. This allows a lower profile for the selector switch on the non-operating side of the receiver which helps to relieve any interference between the switch and a shooter’s glove or hand. For the maximum amount of configuration and operation options, Knight’s Ambidextrous Controls offer a sure solution.

Two-Stage Match Trigger
All of the weapons available from Knight’s Armament come equipped with a 4.5lb, 2-Stage Match Trigger. This type of trigger mechanism uses a system where, during the rearward squeeze of a trigger, it cycles through two stages of resistance

The first stage is a ‘no-poundage’ stage where hardly any resistance is felt during the rear-ward squeeze. There is a center point at which point resistance is felt and the second stage of the trigger begins. At this point, 4.5 pounds of force is required to squeeze the trigger through the second stage and cause the weapon to cycle.

Our 2-stage trigger is meant to inform a shooter of exactly where their weapon is going to fire. This bolsters a firer’s confidence and can also assist in reducing trigger jerk, thereby increasing accuracy. The 4.5lb 2-Stage Trigger from Knight’s Armament is a highly calibrated and smooth component that is sure to be a welcome addition to any setup.


Universal Rail Extending (URX)
The evolution of the Universal Rail Extending (URX) begins over 20 years ago with Knight’s Armament pioneering the Modular Weapon System. Knight’s URX is a lightweight, free-floating, continuous top rail system that was designed to give a shooter the most diverse amount of placement options for any accessories they deemed helpful.

In an effort to relieve all weight, contact and stress from the barrel, the URX component was designed to be free-floating. This means that your barrel is not supporting or coming in contact with the rail system other than at the receiver. Under high firing rates, when the weapon’s barrel is heating up and undergoing greater amounts of stress, this system ensures accuracy is not affected by mounted accessories or a shooter’s manipulation of those accessories.

Several variations of the URX are available depending on your needs. They come in a variety of lengths, from our URX Carbine at 7” to our URX 3.1 7.62 at 14”. Knight’s latest systems are the URX 3.1 systems which feature a flat continuous top rail, several inches of mounting rails at the fore and rear ends of the sides and bottom, and slick sided portions in the middle sections. These slick sided portions provide a slimmer diameter for grip as well as an overall reduction in weight. Some of our other models, such as the URX II variations, include full length side and bottom rails and integrated front sights. These components provide the most amount of options with the least amount of interference."

Very early gun made by RPB, probably in 1978 (first year of production), given the low serial number.  If not, then it is a very early 1979 gun.  RPB used a ""9"" prefix on their serial numbers to denote 9mm in their early guns and the following numbers are sequential, so this is the 254th 9mm they made.  It comes with four of the very desirable Walther M10 steel mags and two Cobray Zytel magazines.  The Walthers hold 32 rounds and the Cobray hold 36, if I recall correctly.  The Walther mags command a high price - lowest you can usually find them is $100 each with some searching and patience, but they are more normally priced around $125-$150 retail.  The gun also comes with a factory shroud.  It is in very good condition overall, showing the rough machining and finish these are known for.  There are scattered marks and dings in the finish, as seen in the pics.  The shroud has some discoloration in the finish around some of the vent cuts, which I assume is related to heating of the metal during the cutting affecting the final color of the finish, as is is only around the cuts towards the rear.  Nice, early gun and not the easiest to find.  ATF banned manufacture of them in 1982 and subsequent guns had to be made with a closed bolt.  The existing open bolt guns, like this one, were grandfathered.

Gun is in excellent condition, no holster wear on it, only a few hundred rounds down range, and meticulously maintained. 

Has been to Springfield for the recall upgrade and will include the paperwork as proof of the completed recall. 

I have a custom kydex IWB holster for the gun. It was made to work with a Crimson Trace laser, but as I disliked and sold the laser some time ago I have been using it without the laser and it works just as well like that. (bonus is you have an excellent holster if you decide to purchase a crimson trace for the gun)

Includes the factory case, all the original XD-Gear (holster, mag carrier) both size grip backstraps, 2 7-rd magazine, one has a Pearce pinky extension on it (have the factory base plate as well) and 2 9-rd extended mags with both size grip sleeves to work with either backstrap. 

I'm not going into how much I have in this gun, as I purchased it new when they were still very new on the market, but suffice to say I am pricing this at a loss. To buy this all new, the cheapest I could find everything online, including shipping (and FFL fee on the gun itself) was $670. 

I am asking $540 for everything (that's less than I paid for the gun when it was brand new before tax). I am willing to consider trades, but my trade value is going to be closer to what it would cost to buy this new. ($600 trade value). Please do not insult me by offering me any less than that, there is absolutely no way you could get this kind of a price for what I am offering buying it new. If you think you can get a better deal, please, do us both a favor and go get your better deal rather than bother me with questions you already know the answer to. 

I am willing to consider all trade offers, although all my guns are in 9mm, 45acp, 380acp and 357mag, so I don't really want to trade for anything outside of those calibers. 

If your trade is worth less than mine I am going to expect a reasonable amount of cash to come close to my trade value, I will do the same if your trade is worth more than what I have. 

Email for pics, I will try to take some and have them posted this evening.

I live near Phoenix on the west side. I am willing to travel a small distance, but I am not driving out to Scottsdale, Tempe or anywhere further east than the 51 or south of the 10.

This is a special edition gun with a factory Jim Martin custom tune job. The serial number is JM###. These guns were a special run of production guns that were custom tuned by Jim at the factory before they were sold. It has the smoothest action of any single action gun I have ever felt. The case hardening is flawless and very beautiful. Asking $675

I bought this gun a few months ago with the intention of using it for Fast Draw competition. After purchasing I realized the gun is too tight to be fired with a loose or floating primer. Normal ammunition functions perfect. It's a shame it doesn't work for my intended purpose.

This sale includes an extra set of wood one piece grips. Both sets of grips are beautiful and fit better than any single action I have ever seen. I really hate to sell it but I just don't have room in my safe or my budget for a safe queen like this that I won't shoot.

Please note that the first picture is the gun I have for sale, the second and third pictures are just images depicting the detail and quality of fit that I poached from Google. If interested, please PM with a telephone number and I'll call you back.

Yugoslavian SKS Rifle ""Yugo"" 7.62X39 for sale.

After the improvement of M59 to the M59/66, M59/66A1 was further improved at the Zastava factory in 1966 by installing a flip on front sight with night sighting aids fitted to the front and rear sights.  M59/66A1 also has a rubber recoil pad fitted to the butt.  All milled parts come with folding blade bayonet.  Note: This is the hard-to-find version M59/66A1 with matching front and rear flip-up Tritium night sights (some refer as the M59/66A2).  There is a ding on stock, which is an easy touch-up, that probably came this way out of the crate; other than this, the rifle is in excellent condition.  Stock is original brown wood.

Barrel: 19.7""  Overall:  43.9""  Approximate weight: 8 lbs. 8 oz., 10 round internal/fixed mag.

Very well made, known to be better and more accurate than the AK-47.

Fitted with an integral NATO spec. grenade launcher, flip-up grenade sight, hooded front and notched rear rifle sights and 11.5"" blade bayonet.  Also comes with two manuals.

There are so many videos and much information on this SKS Rifle available on the internet.  Note: The brown specs on the metal in the pics are Cosmoline. 

I can provide more pics if needed (only three are allowed per listing). I live in Millville, NJ which is in South Jersey, the Cumberland County Area.  Please ask if you have any questions.

The interior is in good shape, has a Pioneer Radio. It does run and drive, you could drive it home. only major dent in it is passenger door.All glass is good.AC works, In its current state it wont win any beauty contest but i figure a running car for a 1000 bucks isnt a bad deal, if you do the research these engines last forever and someone with good mechanical know would have great reliable car on their hands.

Includes manual and test target in German. Magazines are zipper design. Search around for one of these and if you find one let me know. I have searched myself and you can find some P220 45's but not the 226. This is for a Sig collector. The price is firm and no trades. I have plenty of guns. I will list locally for awhile then going on Gunbroker. Will send additional photos upon request of serious buyer. Thanks for your time.

Item 4A (305gr. Hard Cast gas Checked LFN) is designed for super deep penetration on large game. The big flat nose keeps the bullet penetrating straight and thus deep. You can expect a good three + feet of penetration in normal flesh and bone. The flat nose also does considerably more damage than a round nosed type of bullet as the flat nose cuts and smashes it way through living matter, while round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing much less damage along the bullet’s path and achieving more shallow penetration due to getting sideways while “slipping and sliding” through matter.
You’ll note my below velocities from over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.

Shoot More, Pay Less With .22 LR Ammo For Practice

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.
Durable Melonite QPQ Finish for increased wear resistance."
