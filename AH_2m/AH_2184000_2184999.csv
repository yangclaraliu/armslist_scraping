It comes with the original case and all paperwork along with 6 sig sauer 30 round magazines. all the mags come with sig couplers so you essentially have 3 - 60 round mags. I am the original owner and it has been very well taken care of. If you're not familiar with this model, it is very close to a Ak-47 platform. It is more modern and refined but the only other real difference between the two is the sigs recoil spring and piston are one piece whereas on the Ak, the spring rides above the piston. These are no longer in production...replaced with a much lighter (and way less solid) sig M400...don't miss out on this incredibly sweet and increasingly hard to find battle rifle. Asking $1200 and I will include some quality ammo with the deal. looking for cash to fund another project but I would consider a partial trade on a nice 9mm or .45acp handgun.

Similar in many respects to the Walther PPK and TPH, the TP 22 has a blued finish and employs a snag-free rounded hammer. This pistol features two-piece plastic grips, fixed open sights, and a 7-round magazine. This gun does show wear from pocket carry but is very reliable. The bore is in very good condition.

All are for sale until one or two of these sell.  The rest will be pulled and no longer for sale. 

1.  Remington 700 VTR 308 Winchester.  About 500 rounds through it.  Comes with a Simmons Scope and bipod.  Also has an extended mag to make this an 8 round bolt action rifle.  Will include original floor plate to make this 4 round capacity.  $575.  Sold as package.  If you don't want the scope, take it off when you get the rifle home. 

2. Glock 23 Gen 4.  Bought this early September new.  Fired two mags out of it.  Comes with everything in the box (grips still in package, 3 mags) and 40 rounds Winchester PDX1 defensive rounds might toss in abox of target ammo to.  $550. Remember your getting $40 of ammo for free at this price.

3. Gen 3 Glock 19.  Box and 4 15 round mags.  2 of these are new and are Gen 4 mags.  This has seen about 500 rounds.  Don't know for sure as I have more than one 9.  I have a box of Critical Defense I can toss in  $525

4. Ruger Super Blackhawk 44 Mag.  Brand new, never fired. I bought this on Tuesday.  Stainless steel with 7.5"" barrel.  $600 and I am eating the tax I paid 3 days ago. 

The only trade I am interested in is cash.  I have the opportunity to buy a rifle that does not hit the shelves that often so I need the cash.  My prices are fair and firm.  If you can find it cheaper on gunbroker, then you should probably buy it.  The ad will be pulled when two have sold.  I would like to see your PTC/PTP and matching state issued ID so you can prove to me that your are able to own legally.  Must be willing to meet at least half way. For $40 more Ill deliver it to you within 90 minuets of Mankato.  Diesel is kinda spendy.  No shipping FTF only.  I can send you pics if you want them but Im sure you have seen a Glock before. The pics below, the rifle is the actual rifle for sale, the Ruger is a photo pulled from the web but it is the same gun."

Second series (with transfer bar) and Pachmayr grips.  Very Good condition.  This model manufactured from 1978-1996 and reintroduced in 1999.   Respected gun author Gene Gangarosa, Jr. wrote in the Complete Guide to Service Handguns on the Taurus Model 66:  With the Model 66 Taurus has created  a versitle revolver.  In addition to being extraordinarily well built, the Model 66 with a wide target hammer, grooved trigger and adjustable sights is easy to shoot. Our ten foot group measured 1.6 inches across, 25 foot group 3.0 inches across (at 50 feet the result was 4.6 inches).  The model 66 worked well with both .38 Special and .357 Magnum rounds. The Model 66 is a good choice as a defensive handgun for those who prefer features of Smith & Wesson's Combat Magnum revolvers  but can't afford them."

The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted
to different needs. The Px4 features an exclusive, Beretta-designed locked
breech with rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise.
Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease
of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect
the rifling. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced
polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a
custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both
ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

Have put several hundred rounds through it- no misfires, jamming, stovepipes, anything like that. Accurate, fun, and simple to use- like a Glock. This is a great gun but we just don't shoot it anymore- getting away from 9mm altogether. 
Have 4 mags or so, also a holster for it- maybe 2, but I'll have to find the other. I also have the original case and a light to place on the rail.
I have ammo that I can sell with it as well.

Weight
12 oz

Polyester taffeta

Perfect alternative to a tent and sleeping pad for the light and cost-conscious traveler

Mildew-resistant, machine-washable fabric will stay strong and clean for years

Weighing in at a mere 12 ounces, the Grand Trunk Ultralight Travel Hammock won't exactly weigh your pack down. It packs into its own attached stuff sack, but when you need it, it unfolds to a 9.5 length and will hold up to a 250-pound person. So you could bring a three-pound tent and sleeping pad on your next warm-weather trip . . . or you could skip those altogether, couldn't you?

Also, I have a verified PayPal account, and am willing to mail this anywhere in the US if you pay for shipping.

I've also added an Tac-47 auto-plug to ensure the gas system can cycle everything from light target loads to heavy slugs.

Also included with the gun are 4x5rd magazines, 3x10rd magazines, and a 12rd drum.

It comes with all the goodies they ship with when you buy them; ammo pouches, bore brushes and oil can, sling and I have thoroughly cleaned all of the cosmoline out and refinished the stock. Dispite the counter-bored barrel, this gun shoots accurately and is fun to shoot. My favorite thing about this gun is that it is a larger centerfire caliber and provides centerfire recoil at 19 cents a shot! The ammo included is mostly military surplus with a little ""consumer"" grade ammo mixed in. I literally just counted every round and came up with 273 rounds, so I figure I will state 260 rounds and if I messed up in  counting, you gain get some extras. Asking $200."

Great Deal, hate to part with it, need the cash...

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

With a near unlimited service life - you will experience The Future of Fun™ and a great day at the range. Camping, hiking, exploring the world -  ZiP™ adapts to any mission.

Exceptionally affordable and with more features and functionality than any weapon ever delivered to date. 

The ZiP™.22 L.R. brings a whole new meaning to the term gun of the future.
 A futuristic weapons system where the unique arrangement of the principal components enables overall compactness and results in a new form factor. Multiple platform enhancements including the ZiPPIC™ Rail, ZiPNite™ Rail -or- the ZiPSBR™ Rail allow attachment of ZiP™ to your AR. (Approved ATF Form 1 Permit Required.) This makes ZiP™ The Future of Fun™ while delivering the compelling new “ZiP-Action” at an incredible value.

ZiP™ has a new and efficient form factor which makes possible the new ZiP-Action™ and 5 safeties, including a traditional cross-bolt trigger safety, a new modern sear safety improved by the development of a new linear trigger, and no winding trigger bar (also eliminating any dependency on the tiny coil spring in the rear of those dated striker designs) and lastly, a striker block which remains closed for nearly all of the trigger travel – opposite of all modern striker guns – making ZiP™ one of the most advanced platforms ever offered.

These improvements will have significant benefits for future ZiP™ family weapons design and delivering unmatched value to consumers.

The next generation of future weapons in a light, compact form factor. Simple in design, ZiP™ is a new Modular Weapons System, delivering amazing features with performance and upgradeability. With a near unlimited service life - you will experience The Future of Fun™ and a great day at the range. Camping, hiking, exploring the world -  ZiP™ adapts to any mission.

Exceptionally affordable and with more features and functionality than any weapon ever delivered to date. 

The ZiP™.22 L.R. brings a whole new meaning to the term gun of the future.
 A futuristic weapons system where the unique arrangement of the principal components enables overall compactness and results in a new form factor. Multiple platform enhancements including the ZiPPIC™ Rail, ZiPNite™ Rail -or- the ZiPSBR™ Rail allow attachment of ZiP™ to your AR. (Approved ATF Form 1 Permit Required.) This makes ZiP™ The Future of Fun™ while delivering the compelling new “ZiP-Action” at an incredible value.

ZiP™ has a new and efficient form factor which makes possible the new ZiP-Action™ and 5 safeties, including a traditional cross-bolt trigger safety, a new modern sear safety improved by the development of a new linear trigger, and no winding trigger bar (also eliminating any dependency on the tiny coil spring in the rear of those dated striker designs) and lastly, a striker block which remains closed for nearly all of the trigger travel – opposite of all modern striker guns – making ZiP™ one of the most advanced platforms ever offered.

These improvements will have significant benefits for future ZiP™ family weapons design and delivering unmatched value to consumers.

I bought this new a few weeks ago and went out to shoot it for the first time last week, and a bad cartridge swelled badly enough in the chamber that it wouldnt come out and the tip of the extractor broke off as a result.  The extractor broke on round #41, so less than 50 rounds total through it.

Aside from this I was very pleased with the gun, it is exceptionally thin, weighs less than a pound, has a VERY smooth and clean breaking DAO trigger (far better than a Ruger LC9) and is exceptionally accurate as I was making 1 inch groups with it at 7 yards.  In the little time that I carried it it served very well in that regard and it is one of those guns that will really slip into your pocket and be forgotten about.

Still usable and firable in its current condition, but needs the extractor replaced obviously.  You can get one for free by calling Kel Tec's service department, order one for $4 off their online catalog, or send it in to Kel Tec and have it replaced for free.  I recently picked up a different carry gun so I wasn't planning on keeping it anyway and have no desire to mess with it.

The cheapest these sell for in town is $265 at P4 Firearms.  I'll sell it for $200 and throw in 50 rounds of 9mm for the trouble of the broken extractor.  Price is FIRM however, any less and Ill keep it and fix it myself.

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout cartidge was designed with sound supression in mind, and with subsonic ammunition results in surprisingly quiet shooting.

It has a 16"" Cold Hammer Forged, Magnetic Particle tested barrel with 1:8"" twist. A Geissele SSA two stage trigger is installed. The Mil Spec upper receiver has M4 feed ramps and a flat top Picatinny rail. The Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail 12.0 tubular handguard is free floated with top mounted Picatinny rail and modular Picatinny rail segments and has a shotgun-inspired grip. A MOE 6 position butt stock is installed.

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout cartidge was designed with sound supression in mind, and with subsonic ammunition results in surprisingly quiet shooting.

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
