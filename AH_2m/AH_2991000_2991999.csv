Caliber: ..40 S&W

Location (city or county): Daly City, San Mateo County

Price: $560 OBO (Or Best Offer) (Feel free to make a reasonable offer. NO LOWBALLERS PLEASE)

Will ship (Y/N): YES - To the FFL dealer of your choice. (Buyer is responsible for all shipping fees.)

Other info: I'm the second owner. I bought this semi-auto pistol back in 2009. When I bought it, the previous owner never used it, so it was pretty much Factory New. Since it's been with me, it's only seen about 120 cartridges shot through it. After every session, it was field stripped and cleaned fully.

I never really brought it out to much as I never really got used to using it due to the increased recoil of the .40 S&W cartridge. It would throw off my aim because I was used to shooting my 9mm and .45 ACP handguns (also Glocks). With that being said, this Glock 35 never saw much range time, simply because I favored the Glock 17 and Glock 21 pistols that I own as well.

The Glock 35 has an adjustable rear sight and only includes 1 (ONE) spare magazine (it originally only came with one when I bought it). Lone Wolf Decal Grips, an extended slide release and extended magazine release have been added and it also includes a Bore Store for the pistol (altogether an $80 value). Also includes the original 'tupperware' Glock factory box it came with, along with the cleaning brush (not pictured).

Truly a marvel of engineering and easily one of the most dependable semi-auto pistol designs ever created. If you get an aftermarket barrel from a company like Lone Wolf Distributors, you can use a different caliber like 9mm. All you have to do is have the correct barrel, correct magazine and swap out the barrels to fire a different caliber altogether! No gunsmithing needed. Just drop in the parts, change the ammo and you're good to go.

Now, about the price. I'm asking $560.00 OBO for just the Glock 35, magazine and the case, cleaning brush + added 'upgrade' accessories that come with it as well as the Bore Store. 

I have extra .40 S&W ammo available at $25.00/50 Rds/Box (Winchester, 4 boxes available)

I'm not really open to any trades as I'm pretty much happy with the firearms I already own.

The set is in excellent condition, with only some minor wear on the outside of the barrel (see pics) due to being cycled and fired.

NOTE: BUYER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL SHIPPING COSTS AND DROS, FFL TRANSFER FEES AND ANY OTHER UNFORESEEN FEES WHICH MAY OCCUR IN ORDER TO HAVE THE FIREARM TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW OWNER. 

I AM ALSO WILLING TO DRIVE WITHIN A 50 MILE DISTANCE/RADIUS FROM DALY CITY IN ORDER TO DO A FTF MEET TO CONDUCT THE TRANSFER. ANY DISTANCE FURTHER THAN THAT WILL HAVE TO BE ARRANGED AND AGREED TO BY BOTH PARTIES (SELLER AND BUYER) ALONG WITH ANY FEES OR CHARGES INCURRED, SUCH AS GASOLINE CHARGES AND BRIDGE TOLLS. (I only state this because I've had some people ask me to drive 100+ miles to their location and then decline to even offer compensation in way of bridge toll fees and the gasoline that I would use to drive 200+ miles round trip)

It's a Savage 99 in .300 Savage.  What makes it unusual is that it has both a tang and lever safety which are connected to each other.  I've read that there were a few ""transition"" models which had both when Savage changed from the lever safety to the tang safety in 1960.  However, I checked the serial number on the savage99 Website and this gun is from 1946.  The tang safety is clearly factory (not aftermarket) as the tang has an S (afety) mark on the tang from the factory.  So I'm not really certain what this is--an early prototype perhaps?  Overall condition is excellent.  The stock has probably been refinished but the bluing is original.  Just a very slight amount of carry wear on the bottom of the receiver.  I have a couple boxes of shells for it too.  As I don't know what it is, I'm taking offers.  Any insights would also be appreciated.  REDACTED"

This is a factory side folder, government bayonnet in SS that was made in July of 1981, comes with the letter from Ruger to confirm this. This one is super clean, has the light wood and appears to have been fired sparingly if at all. It comes with a sling and a 30rd SS mag. If I had to grade it I would call it a 9.7 or so, this is not an AC556 so no tax stamp is required. The last one of these sold on GB for $2500 with a broken up box so I know the price is right. I am asking $2000, I will entertain reasonable offers and trades. The first picture is a generic but the last two are of the actual rifle as well as the letter from Ruger, if this makes it to gunbroker Sunday I will have better pictures taken.

It has minor holster wear but other than that, it is in great shape. Aftermarket polychoke rib was added.  It comes with a size 44 pistol belt and crossdraw holster. That may seem big but I wear a size 38 pants and it fits me fairly well. The belt holds 24 rounds. Also comes with 105 Remington soft point .41 magnum bullets. This would be a perfect farm/ranch gun...especially if you ride horses. Also great for deer hunting if your state allows the use of high powered pistols for hunting. Also a great for bear. It is an outstanding single action cowboy gun. I love this gun and want it to go to someone who will also appreciate it. I'm just selling to fund a much wanted AR-15.

XTP pistol bullets continue to set the standard as the bullet of choice for hunters and law enforcement officers who understand the value of a pistol bullet which will perform over a wide range of handgun velocities. Most pistol bullets are designed to work only at a factory specified velocity and a specific range. At these predetermined specifications, the bullets work just fine. But when bullet velocity begins to change, surprises can happen. Many factors cause velocities to change-gun type, barrel length, distance to target, barriers and more. That's why you need a bullet that you can depend on to perform over a wide range of velocities. You need the XTP."

The scope power is adjustable from 3.5-10X and the objective diameter is 50mm. The lenses are perfect with not even a fingerprint. The optics are beautiful and crisp. The condition of the rifle is mint. No scratches that I can find on the laminate wood stock either. The laminate wood stock has nice checkering on the grip and forearm, a rubber butt pad, and a raised cheekrest. The heavy varmint barrel length is 26 inches. Capacity is 5 rounds plus 1 in the chamber. This rifle easily shoots 3/4"" groups with quality ammunition. This rifle comes with a two piece steel Leupold base, two steel Leupold rings, Butler Creek flip up scope caps, and original paperwork. I have the mount and ring boxes as well as the original Remington receiver screws. I have fired this less than 100 rounds, have taken maybe a dozen ground hogs, but it has spent most of its life in the safe. I'm selling only to fund another purchase. 

I'm willing to possibly use as a partial trade on a Kriss .45 ACP carbine, and willing to pay extra in cash if you want to trade one for my Remington.

I will sell the rifle seperate from the scope, mount, caps, and rings for $650.00. For the Leupold scope, rings, caps, and mount, I am asking $425.00. For the whole package, I am asking $1000.00. You can keep the sales tax! Shipping is available for a marginal amount. Face to face transaction is possible.

The Ruger® SR-762™ is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is an ideal rifle for those who appreciate the familiar and ergonomic AR-style platform. The .308 Win./7.62 NATO cartridge is perfect for hunting medium and most large-sized game and enhances the capability of the AR-style platform in defensive or tactical roles. The SR-762™ retains the features of the original SR-556® that make it a solid performer among modern sporting rifles.

Features:

Chrome-Plated, Two-Stage Piston
Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.

Ergonomic Handguard
Round, smooth-sided Ruger® Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail at 12:00 position that extends the full length of the handguard. Drilled and tapped for additional rails at the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions (two additional rail sections included), providing ample space for mounting sights, lights, lasers or other accessories.

Sights
Folding backup iron sights include a windage adjustable rear sight and an elevation adjustable front sight. These sights provide a solid, reliable aiming system that can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.

Telescoping Buttstock
Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock is mounted on a Mil-Spec diameter tube.

Hammer-Forged Barrel
Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity. Fluted barrel (for reduced weight and improved barrel cooling) features an SR-556®/Mini-14®-style flash suppressor mounted with a 5/8""-24 thread.

Just the gun. No paperwork, box, etc.

Based on the serial number (35192x), flat cylinder latch, and diamond grips, this Model 36 can be dated to between 1962 and 1966. That's as close as I've been able to get on the date.

1962 - starts at 295000
1969 - ends at 786544
1968 - diamond grips end
1966 - flat cylinder latch discontinued

I really have no idea how to rate this thing, so I tried to get some photos that would accurately represent it's condition. I'd say it looks pretty darn good for it's age, but I'm far from an expert on these older guns. I thought about using some bronze wool to clean it up a bit, but I didn't want my first attempt to be with this gun. I'll leave that to someone who knows what they are going. While it isn't in perfect condition, it appears to have been shot very little. 

As far as the price goes, they really seem all over the place. I tried to go with something in the middle. If I am way off (either way), please feel free to let me know. 

$450 OBO - I prefer cash, but am willing to listen to possible trades.

I am located in Springfield, but am willing to meet within reason. I work out of Nashville, and travel throughout Middle Tennessee during the week. As me if/when I'm in your area.

Please excuse the pictures. No matter how much I wiped it down, there were always streaks."

902,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2991902,For Sale:  Really Nice Egyptian Maadi AK 47 7 40 round mags,"Ponte Vedra, Jacksonville, Florida","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, May 4, 2014",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Really Nice Egyptian Maadi AK 47 for sale along with 200 rounds of ammo and 8 mags.

I originally had a saiga and sold it to get this because they are crapy hunting guns. The only reason Russia can import them because they are not assault rifles. They are sporting rifles built for hunting. The insides do not look the same at all. 

Everything is smaller and cheaper then the real aks built for war. The bolt is half the size of this Maadi bolt because maadis are made for heavy use in war. The barrel on the Maadi is very heavy and the bolt, the spring and the frame are all designed for automatic fire. The saigas cost cheep because they are built cheep. 

If you are looking for the ak that will last a life time and not fall apart under heavy fire then go with a real ak like this one. Has a tri rail on the front for lights and lasers and optics bi rail in the back for a red dot or scope. Can also mount something on the back side rail. Comes with a killer single point sling too. The riffle will lay under your arm along your body comfortably but when you need to swing it up, it slides into your natural firing position so fast you will love it. 

The synthetic stock allows the sling to slide like glass up to your shoulder in one second. This is by far the best Gun I have ever owned. Selling it only because of expensive wedding. 

 I also have one 30 round steal mag and seven 40 round theramold mags. They say for police and gov use only but they are very legal that was from the Clinton ban. Needless to say they were made to government standards are are brand new.

 You can't find them anymore but they are 100 times better then promags because they are not plastic. They are extremely durable polymers that don't wear down like plastic promags and can't be broken. Removing the bottom to wd40 the spring takes 5 seconds. 

Add 50 for the really nice soft case that holds five 40 round mags in Velcro pockets on the other side. Big enough for two guns and 8 mags plus looks cool on the range. 

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Buying a gun like this can be sketchy make sure you find a seller you can trust like me! 

Florida driver license and clean backgrounds only, you guys know the deal. 

Thank you for your time!"

I feel like I don't really even need to give a description of it. If you're looking at this pistol, you know what you're getting into.

So, let's get the important stuff out of the way. I purchased this gun new about a week ago ($589.00) only to find that I like my full size better for carry. As previously stated gun is new in box unfired and has the factory case, paperwork, all four backstraps,  three mags, lock, cleaning brush, and speed loader. I am also including in the sale a Peirce grip extention ($11) which is also new and installed on one mag as well as a full box of Hornady Custom .357 SIG hollow points ($39). For those of you who are quick with numbers can see that I have $639 in this package. Also pictured you will see a Shark Tac kydex/carbon fiber holster. For those of you unfamiliar with Shark Tac holsters, they are hand made and come with a lifetime warranty so if you ever have any issues they will fix or replace the holster at no charge to you. The one pictured below is a newer product that simply covers the trigger and trigger guard which is excellent for concealed carry. New this holster ran me $138 making the total expense on my end $777. I will sell the holster with the rest of the package for an additional $50 to the buyer. My price for the package without the holster is $500 FIRM or $550 FIRM with the holster and that is FIRM. If I cannot sell this within a few days I will simply put in back in the safe until a later time. No I will not include the holster in the $500 price, no I will not come down on my price, no I will not drive to make a sell, and no I will not trade. I don't mean to seem difficult but I have delt with too many individuals on here that want something for nothing . If you don't like my price please move on to the next ad. Buyer must be willing to meet at Middletown Walmart location and cash only please. If you are interested or would like additonal pictures please feel free to text me at REDACTED. Thank you for your time and for looking"

I am willing to do this because I have other firearms to carry also..

M&P 9c Purchased New in Aug 2013.. In mid to late 2013 S&W began installing a new trigger group to improve tactile and audible trigger reset, this M&P has that trigger group.  

This M&P also has the optional thumb safety, it is easily removable my removing one pin and lifting the rear block where the safety can be lifted out. its a very simple mechanism. When engaged it blocks the trigger bar from moving rearward. during carry I have never had the safety engage on it's own. I used it to holster..

The barrel has been polished cosmetically, just for looks. the locking points were not polished. the sides and top of the chamber, and the muzzle back to the chamber is polished to a chrome-like finish. I love the contrast on a black firearm.

This M&P has functioned 100% from day 1, never had any failures..


WHAT YOU GET IN THIS PACKAGE..
everything pictured including the 17rd genuine S&W Mag and fitted X-grip sleeve, and a Fox Hybrid IWB holster.. around 450 rounds through this M&P, the lug under the slide is still black and not worn from cycling rounds.. SEE PICS
carried very little, no holster wear also..
