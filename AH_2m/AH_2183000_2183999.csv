If anyone has or heard of one available please don't hesitate to let me know. My ""requirements"" have flexibility. The most important thing to me is that it was a service carried pistol and parts match. Wether used in combat or not. I know I could be looking for a ""phantom"" but I thought I'd try my luck.Thanks everyone,Tom"

We have one left so if you want it you better hurry before this is gone—who knows when we will see another one!! These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and all factory paper work and cleaning kit. From IWI: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

It has a couple of after market modifications done to it. It has a brand new free floating E.R. Shaw Bull Barrel with a 1/10 Right Hand twist. When ER Shaw installed the barrel they also Trued it to the receiver meaning that the barrel/chamber now sits perfectly in the receiver and lines up perfectly with the bolt face. I have put the barrel through the initial break in of firing one round then cleaning the barrel with Hoppes solvent repeating the process for 10 rounds. Also the rifle comes with a H-S Precision kevlar composite M24A1 stock that is equipped with an aluminum bedding block. The scope is nothing special. It is simply a cheap no name scope that I picked up from Gander Mountain. It also comes with the Bipod but not the sling. This rifle will stack rounds through one ragged hole at 100 meters. However, I have not had an opportunity to push it out there on the range. That being said I would not be surprised if this rifle is capable of hitting a 1 minute target at 600-800 meters, and I am pretty confident that it can be done with this weapon in the hands of a capable shooter. Slap some good glass on this bad boy and maybe an aftermarket trigger and you have a true sniper rifle chambered in 30-06. With all of that being said, I by no means have to get rid of this rifle; I just really want to see what else is out there. Please no low ball or crap offers. The barrel job and stock on this rifle alone are worth $900 in their current, like new condition. If you'd like to make an offer, I'd be interested in pretty much all firearms, especially pistols, AR's, and other long guns. I can be reached by phone call or text at REDACTED ask for Jake. Worst I can say is no thank you."

- Gun with factory box and literature

- Streamlight tlr-1 light. Its new and on the gun but never been carried or shot with. I have the factory box, literature and all the parts it comes with

- Safariland 6004 drop holster in foliage green. This holster originally fit the gun with a Surefire x200 but has been gently and cleanly remolded to fit the tlr-1. I have the factory package and literature as well ad the second leg strap that isn't in the picture.

The Public defender is a much more concealable revolver than its full-sized brethren, hiding well in a belt or shoulder holster. The sights consist of a square notch in the frame for the rear, and a fiber optic front dovetailed into the barrel rib. The bobbed hammer is grooved to facilitate thumb-cocking the weapon for single action fire, and has the Taurus Security System key lock at the rear of the hammer.  The Public Defender shown here is made primarily of stainless steel, and wears a satin finish. The cylinder holds five shots, and can be loaded with any standard .45 Colt or 2 ½ inch .410 shotshell load.  The barrel/cylinder gap measured five one-thousandths (.005) of an inch, and the single action and double action trigger pull weights measured four pounds, ten ounces and ten pounds, eight ounces, respectively.  The single action pull is very crisp, and the double action is smooth and even throughout its travel. This weapon has been fired a total of 6 times with 4-10 shells and a total of 15 times using 45 long colt cowboy-action rounds. The price is set at $400.00 but is fully negotiable."

This is a German made Sig P6 9mm pistol in beautiful original condition. If you have seen the quality of the P6 pistols that have recently been imported, you will recognize that this one is in markedly superior condition. The barrel, frame, & slide have matching serial numbers. It's a traditional DA/SA with a decocker. With the pistol you will receive the original factory box, owner's manual, 8 factory magazines with Brad Davis flush front base plates, and an extra factory recoil spring. The pistol has had all new springs & pins installed at the Sig factory. Additionally, this pistol was produced in December 1995 and as such, has the barrel with the improved feed ramp that reliably feeds hollow point ammo. I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have."

I have made two major purchases in the last 6 months; bought my first house and bought an engagement ring. Bad news is, I'm broke as a joke. Thus, I must sell my pride and joy: 

Springfield Armory TRP 1911 in ArmoryKote black. I love this pistol, accurate and gorgeous. I replaced the 2-piece FLGR with a GI setup from EGW, both the plug and guide rod are SS. I also removed the ILS components as they are crap and I felt they adversely effected the trigger pull. Last, I removed the ugly VZ grips and replaced them with some B-E-A-U-tiful rose wood grips. The guns has been meticulously maintained and has about 2,000 rounds down the barrel. 

 The pistol will come with 5 CMC 8-round magazines, 2 Springfield Armory 7-round magazines, 100 rounds of Lawman .45ACP, a BlackHawk IWB holster (in pic), an Uncle Mike's kydex holster, and the usual magazine and holster SA ships out (all in the original box).

This premium, state-of-the-art rifle stock is designed to get maximum performance out of both rifle and marksman. It takes full advantage of modern engineering, design, and manufacturing technologies, resulting in a level of precision that nears perfection. 

We believe that the rifle stock is one of the most important components of a firearm.  A stock with the right geometry, the right ergonomics, and precisely made parts in the right places, combined with a good quality commercial-off-the-shelf rifle, can give exceptional performance.  Given the level of quality and reliability that are found in the rifles produced by today's firearms industry, you don't need to spend thousands of dollars on a custom rig in order to obtain a highly accurate precision rifle.  Our test rifles are all over-the-counter guns, and when shot with factory loads out of the Stealth Chassis they all shoot half-minute groups.  We don't attribute all of this performance to the Stealth Chassis system, but we certainly have taken a good measure of error out of the equation.  So, now you have the four main components of an accurate firearm readily available to you: quality commercial rifles, premium optics, excellent factory load ammunition, linked to the marksman with the fourth component, the Stealth Chassis.  We believe that the Model 11 provides you with the perfect man-to-machine interface.  And of course, it needn't be said that this chassis is also meant to bring a custom rifle up to its full level of capability.

We make no apology that this chassis is not for everyone.  Simply put, it is what it was meant to be; it is simple yet sophisticated.  Cut out of billets of aluminum, we achieve great accuracy through a considerable amount of time spent by each and every part on state-of-the-art milling machines, cut to exacting tolerances.  Materials and components are appropriately chosen for their role in the overall structure, and all aluminum parts are finished in hard anodized field colors.  So we invite you to compare this to a fine sports car, or to a high-end optic.  Study the number of parts and their level of refinement, and you will see that the Stealth is offered at a fair price and provides a good value.

Our focus is on simplicity, reliability, and accuracy, with just the right features to give you a versatile platform and an excellent interface with your rifle.  Eberlestock has been at work on this project since the early 2000's, when we developed one of the industry's first modular chassis systems.  We now think that its time has come."

This premium, state-of-the-art rifle stock is designed to get maximum performance out of both rifle and marksman. It takes full advantage of modern engineering, design, and manufacturing technologies, resulting in a level of precision that nears perfection.

We believe that the rifle stock is one of the most important components of a firearm. A stock with the right geometry, the right ergonomics, and precisely made parts in the right places, combined with a good quality commercial-off-the-shelf rifle, can give exceptional performance. Given the level of quality and reliability that are found in the rifles produced by today's firearms industry, you don't need to spend thousands of dollars on a custom rig in order to obtain a highly accurate precision rifle. Our test rifles are all over-the-counter guns, and when shot with factory loads out of the Stealth Chassis they all shoot half-minute groups. We don't attribute all of this performance to the Stealth Chassis system, but we certainly have taken a good measure of error out of the equation. So, now you have the four main components of an accurate firearm readily available to you: quality commercial rifles, premium optics, excellent factory load ammunition, linked to the marksman with the fourth component, the Stealth Chassis. We believe that the Model 11 provides you with the perfect man-to-machine interface. And of course, it needn't be said that this chassis is also meant to bring a custom rifle up to its full level of capability.

We make no apology that this chassis is not for everyone. Simply put, it is what it was meant to be; it is simple yet sophisticated. Cut out of billets of aluminum, we achieve great accuracy through a considerable amount of time spent by each and every part on state-of-the-art milling machines, cut to exacting tolerances. Materials and components are appropriately chosen for their role in the overall structure, and all aluminum parts are finished in hard anodized field colors. So we invite you to compare this to a fine sports car, or to a high-end optic. Study the number of parts and their level of refinement, and you will see that the Stealth is offered at a fair price and provides a good value.

Our focus is on simplicity, reliability, and accuracy, with just the right features to give you a versatile platform and an excellent interface with your rifle. Eberlestock has been at work on this project since the early 2000's, when we developed one of the industry's first modular chassis systems. We now think that its time has come."

In trade, I'd love a beater Garand but that's probably too much to hope for. Otherwise a KP/M31 Soumi 9mm, Keltec SUB-9/2000 9mm, Glock mag preferred, VZ-58 7.62x39, or any AK pattern rifle preferably in 7.62x39, .308 or 5.56 but will consider others. Also would be interested in a CZ-97, CZ Clone, or double-stack 1911 in either 9mm or .45ACP. Single-stack 1911's would be considered. In shotguns I'd consider a Winchester 1897 original or repro, Browning A5 or similar, maybe a mossberg 590a1. I have a Glenfield Model 60 I'd be willing to throw in for the right trade, or make a cash offer on both. See my user page for the listings.

Description	This rimfire rifle sports an AR-style look and is modeled after the legendary original Colt M4. A ""Tactical Rimfire"" rifle, the M4 Ops is an upgraded version of the .22 M4 Carbine. Instead of the standard forearm found on the carbine, the Ops has an RIS, or Rail Interface System, that provides tactical railing on four sides allowing for you to mount a variety of available accessories. Additionally, the carry handle that's on the carbine is also replaced by a detachable rear sight making the M4 Ops an ideal optic-ready rimfire rifle.

I've killed 13 deer with this rifle, 12 of them using only one shot (my first deer I was so excited that I just unloaded). When people say .243 is underpowered for deer you might tell them to try using an accurate rifle to place the bullet where you want it. Savage's do. Adjustable Accu-trigger, and 4 round internal magazine.
I'm selling it because I want a smaller caliber varmint rifle which will be more useful on my farm. The stock has some scratches but hey, that's because it's seen action in the woods.
I appreciate honesty so I'm going to tell you the one thing that I've found wrong with it over the years: it doesn't like Remington ammunition. Winchester, and Federal work perfect. That's all. Have a nice day."

Looking to build my funds for my next gun purchase and am interested in selling a 1908 Ansley H. Fox double barrel shotgun.  I'm not into older shotguns so I figured someone else may enjoy it more than me.  Its a 12 gauge, 30 inch barrels, got double triggers, its hammerless, has extractors and an extremely low serial.  The thing that really sets this one apart though is it comes with Krupp barrels which was an upgrade at the time.  Ive not seen any others listed out there with these fluid barrels. Its an A grade as denoted by the serial.  Its serial is in the 78XX range.  Not looking to make a lot on this one, only interested in serious buyers.  Gun has been safety checked and cleaned by a gunsmith and it still has the service tag on it.  The pics don't do it justice. Selling it cheap to move it fast.
