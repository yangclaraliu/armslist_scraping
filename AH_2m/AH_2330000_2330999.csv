Weapon is in perfect shape minus the normal safety lever scratch on the finish. Have fired approximately 300 rounds through this weapon and it is very fun to shoot. The compensator defintely makes it handle great and makes it a literal blast to shoot.

I completely disassembled it down to the bare frame and slide. The following was painstakingly performed:
 1. All parts received an acetone bath and thorough cleaning, 
 2. Replaced all springs,
 3. Polished all internal firing parts,
 4. Completely lubricated using a combination of high-end products,
 5. Completely refinished entire pistol in matt black,
 6. Night sights.

 This pistol is incredibly accurate - ragged holes at 7 yards! Additionally, the action is very smooth because of the polishing it received.

 I hate to sell it because of the work I put into it. But I will sell it to anyone who will provide it a good home and who: 

 1. Is a resident of Wisconsin, 
 2. Will execute a bill of sale,
 3. Is not legally prohibited by Federal or State laws from owning a firearm, 
 4. Affirms that the following is true: 

• Is at least 21 years old,
• Is not a convicted felon,
• Does not have felony or misdemeanor charges pending, 
• Is not a fugitive from justice,
• Has not been dishonorably discharged from the military,
• Has never been convicted of domestic violence,
• Is not the subject of a court ordered harassment injunction,
• Has never been adjudicated mentally defective nor has ever been committed to a mental institution,
• Is not in the US illegally,
• Has never renounced their US citizenship,
• Will not use this firearm to commit a crime.

 When you factor in the current market price of an 84F, background fee, taxes, cost/shipping of four spare magazines, three sets of grips, and labor - this is a value deal. Thanks in advance for your interest!"

It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

Also comes with a locking hard case and soft case.

Oh and it has a Galloway percsion all metal rod and new springs

I would like 370 for all this. I dont care if you claim you can get one for 200 bucks at a local store you do that if you want the grips and slide alone for this are 40-100 dollars each never mind the work I have added to it. And I really dont want to break all this up. I will sell the grips and slide without the gun but that is it .

Also I do need a way to reach you so no phone number for calls/txt no response .

I cant ship this or travel to met you . Must met locally to me . And it goes without saying but you must be able to own a gun and be over 18 .

This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy.

With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. I have listed the factory factory features and if you have any questions feel free to call or shoot us a email, our contact info and address is at the bottom stop by and check out our large selection!

Larue Tactical CompM2 mount w/M2 Aimpoint 
Magpul MBUS 

i can switch out lowers at random. RRA with a hogue grip, bushmaster with a magpul MIAD, either with a normal grip, etc.... all will have RRA parts kits and 6 pos. stock, your choice. none will have more than 300 rounds on them. 

all told there's about $1800 dollars in the gun as it sits. i'll take $1600 shipped and throw in some additional goodies for you or i can take off the aimpoint and magpul and add a carry handle to it for you for $900. (not a cheap POS) 

everything is practically brand new except the lower receiver. has approximately 15 rounds of 5.56 through it for function testing and approximately 25 rounds of .22lr via conversion kit through it for sighting in the aimpoint. aimpoint came from the SKD group buy and has only been in my posession since 9/30/10. 

the round count may sound like bullshit but you can ask gloftoe, zhukov or any of the TX crew how much i actually shoot

The rifle is in the original condition as it was recovered and taken home after the war. Rifle is chambered in the 8mm Mauser caliber. It has the Hungarian army shield stamp and the 43M marked on the receiver. Im not a history expert but what i do know is that these were made in Hungary prior to german occupation for their troops. Once Germany captured Hungary, the made the factory switch the rifle to 8mm and start using various Mauser parts on it such as the mag plate and stripper clips etc. at which time it got the 43M stamp. The action is very similar and very smooth as a Mauser but slightly different. Most of these guns were stamped with nazi eagles etc. but some like this one was not and this makes it slightly more rare. Anyway, down to the nitty-gritty. Rifle action, bolt and mag plate, etc are all in really good shape for their age, only minor wear from use. The barrel and receiver are in good shape too but do show signs of blue wearing and minor cosmetic flaws such as tiny scratches or dings etc. but for being over 60 years old its in great shape. Id say blueing is about 80% or so, but im not appraising expert, thats just my opinion. The stock is in bad shape...its warped from age, and its missing the top handguard piece that mauser type rifles are known for. All metal is there such as sling swivels, butt plate and screws, screws etc. Screw heads are worn though, and bayonet mount is missing. Otherwise its a solid piece that does shoot and operate well. It could be restored with the addition of a new stock or used as a parts rifle as it is intact parts wise. Its a real piece of WW2 history that isnt very common from what i have seen/read. I just have no real use or desire for it and would like to sell/trade it to someone who does. Includes a box and a half of 8mm ammo. More pics available upon request. Contact me with any questions or offers........

Bullpup design. Sling attach points, air/watertight carrying case, one five round magazine, 1913 accessory rail, and detachable adjustable bipod.


The Model 95 may weigh in at a smaller class, but packed into its convenient bullpup design are the intense power of a magazine-fed weapon, the pinpoint accuracy of a bolt action rifle and the effortless functionality of a perfectly designed machine.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

Model 95 in action
The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time.

The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. The ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. This careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

The Model 95 provides the discerning shooter with bolt-action accuracy and magazine fed rate of fire.

The Model 95 is what you expect in a Barrett. Innovative. Purposeful. Rugged.

Haven't shot many rounds through this rifle, all that were was brass cased, FMJ, factory ammunition. Have not modified any of the rifle, only thing I have done to this rifle is adding new Magpul Foliage Green furniture to the rifle. I have had zero issues with this rifle, no FTF, no FTE, nothing. 

 Reasons for selling this rifle: I am about to ship off to basic and since I won't have any access this rifle for quite a long time I am going to sell it.  Rifle comes with DPMS hardcase, factory cleaning kit, manual and factory 30rd magazine with a Magpul on it, and a Winchester sling.

I also have all the original factory furniture as well.
All the Magpul furniture is Foliage Green MOE furniture, the grip is the MOE+ K grip, that one with the comfortable rubber grip opposed to the base plastic MOE grip.

 I am not interested in trades, sell for cash only. You are welcome to inspect the rifle before buying it.

 If you'd rather just have the original factory black furniture I can swap it all back off, and I will sell the rifle for only $875.00 with the black furniture then.

 Feel free to email me if interested and I will get back to you as soon as I can, thanks!"

See Q & A below.

This is a Colt AR-15 chambered for 9mm in excellent condition. It comes with a Pulsar 550 Digital sight. It also comes with a SightMark mini reflex sight mounted on the side of the pulsar for quick target acquisition. Includes the original, unopened Colt goody bag with two 32 round magazines, manual, cleaning kit and strap. The scope includes a case, manual, allen wrench and unopened video out cable. I'm also throwing in 4 rechargeable AA batteries for the scope, 2 additional 32 round magazines and 500 rounds of ammunition.

This gun is a native 9mm rifle with a low maintenance, 1 piece bolt. It is cycled by inertia alone--no gas tube, thus the gun is easier to maintain. With a decent suppressor and subsonic ammo the sound of the bolt is louder than the sound of the shot.

Q & A

Usage? The gun has had 2-3 thousand rounds through it. It's seen no hard use and has only been fired at the Isaak Walton shooting range. It has and still does work flawlessly. The digital sight has been used less than 2 hours.

If it's so great, why are you selling it? I have another one to which I've added a suppressor and after shooting that one, I'll probably never want to shoot this one again. The digital sight is good and has some advantages over the traditional night sight--it's lighter, much more flexible and there is no real limit to how far you can see. It has no warm up or cool down time like the traditional night sight and you won't be blinded if a light turns on while using it. It really excels at very low light viewing over a distance of 20 - 200 yards and more. However, the system I wanted was for operating at short distance, in doors, in total or near total darkness. The digital sight works in that situation with its built in infrared light, but the magnification is a little too high for quick target acquisition. Also, it requires some work with settings to get a good image in different situations so I went with simplicity.

How well has it been maintained? I'm studying gunsmithing and have a good grasp of how to care for a gun. I have a workbench and a cleaning rest. I use brass cleaning jags and Tipton nylon cleaning rods. It has never been completely disassembled. 

I will consider selling the gun and the sight separately if I get offers for each. I'd bee looking for $750 for the gun and $600 for the sight."

the specs are: 

Bravo Company Manufacturing midlength upper 
Bravo Company Manufacturing bolt carrier and charging handle 
Larue Tactical CompM2 mount w/M2 Aimpoint 
Magpul MBUS 

i can switch out lowers at random. RRA with a hogue grip, bushmaster with a magpul MIAD, either with a normal grip, etc.... all will have RRA parts kits and 6 pos. stock, your choice. none will have more than 300 rounds on them. 

all told there's about $1400 dollars in the gun as it sits. i'll take $1200 shipped and throw in some additional goodies for you or i can take off the aimpoint and magpul and add a carry handle to it for you for $900. (not a cheap POS) 

everything is practically brand new except the lower receiver. has approximately 15 rounds of 5.56 through it for function testing and approximately 25 rounds of .22lr via conversion kit through it for sighting in the aimpoint. aimpoint came from the SKD group buy and has only been in my posession since 9/30/10. 

the round count may sound like bullshit but you can ask gloftoe, zhukov or any of the TX crew how much i actually shoot  

ETA: aimpoint has sold seperately, it will now sport a RRA A3 handle or the MBUS in the pic. your choice, i will now ship one of those ways for $875. 

ETA2: $850 shipped and i'll throw in some extras but that's as low as it's gonna get 

ETA3: i am now willing to sell the upper seperately for $520 shipped complete with A3 carry handle or MBUS (your choice) or $480 without rear sights"

This gun was exported and reimported by CAI in Georgia VT and the barrel has been marked this way. It isn't very noticeable and does not affect function at all. It's a shooter in great shape, just a few handling marks and a turn ring. It doesn't appeal to have been shot very much at all. I added a Crimson Trace laser grip, LG-307 designed for this gun.

The PPK/S .22 blends the iconic PPK design with the fun and cost savings of the .22 L.R. The PPK/S .22 is identical to its PPK brother in .380. But you can shoot the .22 rimfire for pennies a shot and recoil is minimal. The PPK/S .22 is great for the whole family. As a quality firearm, you can be proud to own it and someday pass it on to the next generation.

It also has a Neuspeed rear swaybar on it, I had it laying around from a previous jetta, so I installed it. Other than that, the car is completely stock. It will come with some spare parts I have that fit the car, including a set of front strut mounts/bearings(the ones on it are fine) and a set of snow tires with tons of tread left. It will also come with any other parts for it that I come across in the garage. The car is in very good condition, however, it does have a couple of rust spots on the drivers side rear door. The car has been very good to me and it runs great, but I no longer need it and could use the money instead.  I am looking to get $2000 OBO for it. Or could maybe trade for a nice 1911 and cash.

Built with the same exacting standards as the 01980XSE, this gun is an enhanced version of Colt’s popular Government series. I really appreciate what Colt did here with the engraving; I’ve seen versions of the Ltd. Editions that can get really gaudy but this one is actually done tastefully in my opinion.

Sure there are othe pink guns out there but are they steel/alloy or are they plastic? Obviously plastic costs less to produce. What good does it do to buy a cheaper firearm if it has so much recoil that shots aren't accurate? This is a smith and wesson folks

 This is a compact 9mm but this gun is all steel or alloy so there is less recoil  - I think it is the perfect concealed carry. Non original carry case included an 2 original mags

Your choice of brown or black PG.

Selling because I live in NY State and I can't get an effing receiver for the damn thing and even if I could I'd have to register it which goes against the laws of the gods.

I am asking 300 shipped for the kit. 59 bucks less than what I paid for it because I want someone to enjoy this rather than have it sit in a box forever. I pay shipping. Priority USPS with tracking provided.

Next up is a set of Toth Tool AK tools. Selling for the same reason above.

FULL DISCLOSURE BIT: The brass piece for the barrel press is beat to hell and back. Hasn't affected functionality but I did bust it up pressing out a Norinco barrel. The square bit for for the trigger guard rivet tool has been WECSOG'ed to clear the center support. Did this on a Nodak Spud receiver build. Have built a few and the tools work well.  Being I am in occupied territory the chances of me ever building one again are exactly zero so I hope someone will get a lifetime of use out of these.

I am asking 275 shipped for the tools. Again 60 bucks less than what I paid and it'll make someone happy. Figure that's fair especially considering shipping costs for these beasts. Priority USPS with tracking provided.

Will sell as a package deal for 550 shipped as described above. 175 bucks in savings over retail- WHOOPEE!!!!
