Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

I'm seeing what kinds of offers I'd get for it. I'm open to just about anything gun related.

The Sr40c operates fine. I picked it up used from a man who wanted something smaller. I've put about 300 rounds through it with no problems except one of the magazines was defective. I've got two Sr40 15rd magazines, and an adapter piece to make the Sr40c accept them fine. I also have the 9rd magazine, but that one is junk. Plus box, papers, and I think 100 rounds of ammo. I'll send the ammo loose since I bought the ammo cases that currently holds them and I intend to keep the ammo cases.

What I'm really looking for is a revolver, a 22 pistol, an m&p9mm, pretty much any full size 9mm... I don't plan on any cash added to the trade, I like a simple gun for gun deal. I just buy sell and trade often, and the Sr40c isn't one of my keepers, so I figured I'd see what you guys will offer

If you want to buy it outright, I'll take $400

Oh and be aware that I drive a semi truck for a living and I stay out driving circles around the US for 2-3 weeks at a time. My next hometime isn't scheduled yet so I've got plenty of patience. We'll work the deal when I find an interesting trade and you've got probably a week to think it through before the trade"

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
Also included is 3 10 round mags and 1 13 round magazine. This pistol does have sig night sights. I am also including a black leather in the waistband holster from Stoner holsters."

Heckler & Koch
45T ""Tactical""

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!


Originally developed for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition the new HK45 “Tactical” comes standard with a threaded barrel and Meprolight three-dot tritium night sights.

The full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK’s American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components.

The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories.

The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An “O-ring” on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger.

The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting.

Factory Description:

Designed for use on all AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube. To install remove the factory pistol grip and replace it with the provided Interface Block. SSAR-15 replaces the factory adjustable stock by sliding onto the buffer tube. All tools required to install are provided. Shooter activates the firing mechanism by moving the upper assembly forward. As a result of the forward movement required to discharge each round the shooter naturally corrects their point-of-aim for each shot and prevents recoil from pushing the firearm's muzzle upward in an unsafe direction. Constructed of premium reinforced high strength polymer. Compatible with Mil-Spec and commercial buffer tubes. Some sling plates may not be compatible. Includes SSAR-15 SBS , interface block, hex key and instructions.

This is in fact, Berry Moss.  I am thankful that we live in a country where a man has an opportunity to defend his reputation.

The ""scam alert"" ad comes from a man who offered me 15% less than retail on my bersa 380, and my bodyguard 380.  Sounds reasonable, right? He then quoted $300 for the bersa as retail, and $330 for the bodyguard.

So, let's take a look at the figures. 300 minus 15% is $255. 330 minus 15% is $280.50. 
I declined his off respectfully(which I am entitled to do). He wrote a few anti-Semitic comments(and while I am not Jewish, it is still not very good business practice). I admittedly responded harshly, rather than turning the other cheek.

Might I ad that my advertisement reads, ""For Trade"".  

The intention of this ad is to defend my reputation, not to put down the person who insulted me.  He shall remain nameless, simply because I respect others' privacy enough not to place their names in a public forum.

Should there be any persons out there who were considering doing business with me, and were swayed by his advertisement, I will gladly forward you the transcript of our email conversation leading to this slanderous post regarding my business ethics. I will also provide references for persons I have done business with in the past if you care to speak with them(after receiving their approval to do so, of course).

Thanks for reading.

Best Regards,

I'd prefer to sell the whole lot all at once, so if interested, please get in touch with me and we can discuss a price as I'm negotiable and not an ""ammo hoarder"" as so many of you on here like to say.  I just have no use for it anymore, so might as well get it to someone that does.

If you have worked with him before make an ad and shut this pity party down by flagging that post.
The worst part is mr moss is prolly going to write me and tell me to take this down. thanks yall."

Thought I'd give this a shot on here as I'm willing to trade for firearms or do partial trades for firearms plus cash, whatever.  I have a stellar reputation as both a seller and buyer on this forum, so everything below is guaranteed 100% true, no bullshit whatsoever.  The moderators can attest to my activity and reputation if needed.  So here goes, please read entirely:  

For sale is an ""as new"" 2006 Yamaha Banshee YFZ 350 in absolute pristine condition. This bike has less than 4 hours of total run time on the original motor, frame, and suspension, in other words, it has not been rebuilt or tampered with in any way, shape, or form. The only performance modifications (detailed below) that have been done to this quad are the usual modifications most Banshee owners perform immediately to maximize performance without jeopardizing the integrity of the original engineering. 

I had the extremely rare opportunity to purchase this bike new from an estate sale this last summer, the original owner purchased the Banshee in early 2008 (it was the very last of the 2006 stock) from Bob Lanphere's Dealership off Highway 217 (verifiable via VIN JY43GG0306C067666). The individual had purchased the bike and then unfortunately passed from cancer shortly thereafter, so the quad was never ran, just stored in his garage out in Oregon City. I decided to make it a project of mine, and after months of hard work and monetary investment, below is the finished project. Please note all parts were purchased new, not used, and I have original receipts for everything listed. The quad is absolutely perfect, no rust or damage whatsoever, showroom floor condition and isn't even technically broken in yet. 

Here is a comprehensive list of all modifications performed on the bike, all installed professionally by Banshee mechanics with years of experience, I spared no cost, as you can see:

Please feel free to either email or text with further inquiries, I have plenty more pictures and can provide any other details you may require. I've also noted the VIN above, so please also feel free to do any research on your own accord to verify the quad. Asking $4500 cash or reasonable trades + cash on side, or full trades, I'm open.  I will entertain all reasonable offers, not looking for another quad or street bike in trade, reason I'm selling this one.

This AR is comprised of a factory built Spikes Tactical upper w/ spikes tactical BCG, mid length gas system and the much desired 1/7 twist. The lower receiver is a factory built Del-Ton Inc. This AR is chambered in .223/5.56 NATO. This is just a Plain Jane, bare bones AR-15 ready for Magpul furniture and a red dot optic of your choosing!

 There is no wiggle or wobble between upper and lower receiver what so ever. I checked myself before purchase. I am prior service military(Army), a rescue diver for the sheriffs office and a local volunteer fire fighter.

 You're more than welcome to give it a thorough look over prior to the sale or trade. I haven't had time to buy a rear sight or any ammo, so therefore it is technically still new and unfired. 

$1,000 cash or best offer, I might trade, but please don't waste my time! Interesting, tactical and practical trades. Gun(s) plus cash, multiple gun trades, car hauling/utility trailer, gooseneck trailer, tractor with brush hog or with out, four wheeler ATV, paint and body work, PVS-7 night vision goggles, Lincoln 225 Ranger shop welder or similar set up.

 Ever since its introduction in 2006, LEVERevolution ammunition has brought grandpa's lever action rifle out of retirement and turned it into a firearm everyone is shooting. Featuring a soft polymer flex tip, it's tough enough to stand up to a jacketed bullet, but soft enough so it won't dent the primer of the round in front of it or cause accidental firing in a lever gun. This new technology makes LEVERevolution cartridges safe in tubular magazines. 

LEVERevolution ammunition features up to 40% more energy than traditional flat point loads and travels up to 250 fps faster. Feed your lever gun with a box today! This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

I then sent it to AI where they hand crafted a beautiful pice of AAA+++ walnut stock contrasting tip and grip cap. They then sent the stock to have the Flure de Lure checkering to San Francisco where it was done by a lady who does nothing but custom rifles and has had her work featured in guns and ammo magazine. This rifle has amazing fiddle and color running the complete length of the stock and a hand rubbed oil finish. Also has engraved floor plate with AI logo. The pictures do nothing at all for it. Needs to be seen in person. Also has a one of only 200 made NRA Comerative  hand made sling. I have shot this rifle 18 times where it put two Accumarks in 338 Lapua to shame at 600 yards. Can be seen in Charlotte NC. Over 4000 invested.
