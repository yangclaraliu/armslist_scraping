The rifle is a norinco sks paratrooper. It came from the factory with a 16"" barrel and is accepts factory ak mags. I acquired it with a cheap plastic folding stock which is included in the sale. I procured a conventional but older and now discontinued olive drab stock used by K Sports when they imported a small number of SKS's many years ago. The stock is very sturdy and tight fitting and makes a huge difference in how the rifle handles. The prior owner of the stock shortened the length of pull somewhat and refit the buttpad. The rubber pad shows signs of being refit but it is fully functional.  I replaced the rear sight with a Tech Sight adjustable model peep sight. It places the rear sight at the back cover and extends the sight radius several inches. I also replaced the front sight with a more narrow standard post for better sight picture and coupled with the rear peep sight it allows for more precise shooting than the factory sight picture. I had the muzzle threaded by a local professional smith. It is threaded 1/2-28 which is standard AR thread. Currently there is no muzzle device attached. I will include a standard AR-15 A2 flash hider which is usable on the 7.62 round.  I planned on using a muzzle brake but honestly the rifle shoots softly so it's overkill. 
    Overall the rifle is in good condition. The action is smooth and the bore is bright. I will include the original rear sight, a replacement plastic folding stock, 1 ak magazine and a ak-47 style ak cleaning kit. I don't have the cleaning rod, sorry. 

Asking price is 625.00 FTF. I will ship to an ffl if needed. I will consider trades as well. Email or text 843-798-74 eight eight."

I will not respond to email inquiries asking if this is still available (I don't have time to deal with scammers wanting me to buy vacation property or any other fly-by-night propositions).

I do not have a smart phone or mobile internet connection, so initial contacts will be via email until a meet is scheduled.

I picked up two 1000-ct double-packs on 5/16 for $75/1000 from a fellow Armslister, plus wear and tear and gas on my truck to go from West Chester to the Ohio River and back during Friday afternoon traffic (OK, so I’m not a gouger… just someone who possibly needs a shrink)

Price for Winchester M-22 22lr Black Copper Plated Round Nose 40-grain Rimfire ammunition in 500-count factory boxes is $50/box. Selling three boxes for my cash investment, and keeping one box for my time and gas and wear and tear.

I'm dealing with the 1st person who says they will commit to an ""A.S.A.Please"" (Si Robertson, Duck Dynasty) transaction (meaning, I'm not going to hold items without a firm commitment on time and place of completing the transaction)!

Cash is King... DL proving age and eligibility required. 

I live in the Turtlecreek Twsp. area near Traders World Flea Market and the new Racino.

I work 1-mile off I-75 and Union Centre weekdays, and I head north on I-75 between 4:00 and 4:30

I can do daytime transaction around West Chester / Union Centre Blvd area.

If you have to wait a day or two, this may be gone (I'll put you on my waiting list, but I will not hold ammo for an extended period of time---you want it, come get it... no limit on number of boxes like the stores, who by-the-way do not offer ""layaway"" on ammo)

After 4:00 and weekend hours: The closer I can meet someone near the Monroe (29) and Middletown (32) exits off I-75 the better.

myself. You can do that, but you will not be compensated
for your time and gas but when you do. I have my American
lazy butt right to demand that you sell it to me at barely
over cost or I will cry like a little girl. You have it
and I do not, because I am not going to waste my gas money,
Getting up way early and spending hours of time in line
to get this my self. I have better things to do with my time!

You do not have a right to charge me a price that would
justify all your time and gas acquiring this. 

Hmmm, I think I will go ahead and just get 4 bricks for $100

If this ad disappears soon it's because I was flooded
with too many offers of people wanting to sell me these 
bricks for $25 each."

This pistol features a 3.8"" match grade barrel, delivering the accuracy serious shooters demand. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XDm's match grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a level unrivaled in the firearms industry. The forged steel slide has a satin silver finish for a classic two tone look. Aggressive front and rear chevron-shaped cocking serrations allow confident operation in any environment. The ideal grip angle offers intuitive point-ability, and the comfortable contours and high tech texturing are designed for maximum control. Interchangeable backstraps are included to customize comfort for the shooter's hand. The frame has an integral Picatinny rail, readily accepting tactical lights, laser sights, and other accessories. Trijicon tritium night sights are fitted for accurate shot placement in any lighting condition.

Springfield's USA, or Ultra Safe Trigger, system guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. This trigger also has one of the shortest travels of any currently available polymer framed pistol, along with a similarly short reset, keeping you on target with greater ease, for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. A visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator allow the shooter to be completely certain whether the pistol is loaded, and whether the striker is cocked. A standard grip safety, unique amongst polymer frame pistols, ensures that the pistol can only be fired when gripped at the ready.

Two ""Mega Capacity"" 19 round magazines are included. The XDm series has the highest factory capacity magazines of any production polymer framed pistol. A holster, speed loader, safety lock, and magazine holder are also included. This pistol ships in a padded hard case.

I have invested quite a bit of money and time converting this rifle to a true AK-47 setup. I bought the parts for the conversion from Carolina shooter supply. There are a laundry list of aftermarket parts in this rifle; an arsenal buttstock and UTG pad, MFT pistol grip with storage compartment, Tapco trigger group, Machined bullet guide, custom trigger guard, and a RPK rear sight with windage adjustment. I also had the entire rifle Cerakoted at O'sheas aqua dipp here in Helena in a beautiful deep OD green, this is a military grade baked on finish that is matte and extremely durable (much better than what your average ak comes with). I also have 4 10-round Saiga factory magazines, and 3 30- round ak mags (two of them Tapco) and comes with 50 rounds of ammo. 
I know I am asking quite a bit for this rifle and it will take the right buyer but I assure you it is worth every penny! I have put 100 rounds through it just testing it out, and having a little fun, it ran perfect! 
here is what I have in it: 
original gun price: $480
Parts Kit: $150
Cerakote finish: $220
Magazines (factory): $60
Magazines (30-round): $45

-Best trigger I've ever felt on a factory 1911 that wasn't $1500+, and I've felt quite a few. No creep, and extremely minimal over-travel and reset.
-For $50 I'll throw in 200 rounds of factory Winchester 230gr FMJ ammo, and can add Remington Golden Saber 230gr JHP defensive ammo for $20/box of 20, I've got 6 boxes of that.

With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols."

Sig RSSGH24B308P SSG 3000 Patrol Bolt 308 Win/7.62 NATO 23.5"" 5+1 McMillian Stk The heavy-contoured, hammer forged barrel is fitted with a flash suppressor/muzzle brake to provide greater accuracy with reduced muzzle signature. Both the barrel and the receiver feature a black oxide finish to eliminate glare. The short, smooth 60 degree bolt throw allows for rapid operation and, like the safety release, the bolt action is quiet. A massive six-lug lockup system is used to give the SSG 3000 greater strength and accuracy, while the lightweight firing pin means an extremely short lock time in the range of 3 milliseconds. The steel receiver and bolt are both precision-machined to exact tolerances. The bolt locks directly into the chamber, eliminating headspace concerns. The ergonomic qualities of the SSG 3000 are also exceptional. The tough McMillan composite stock is designed to put the user in a natural shooting position that facilitates comfort and concentration over long periods of time without fatigue or distraction. The SSG 3000 is designed with a comfortable pistol grip and fully adjustable stock to give the shooter a custom fit. The trigger is adjustable for trigger position, trigger take up, let-off point, and trigger pull weight. The receiver on the SSG 3000 features a dovetail that will accept a wide range of sighting systems, including a factory available M1913 rail. The SSG 3000's modular design not only provides ease of maintenance, but also the ability of the end user to easily replace the barrel eliminating costly gunsmithing expenses.

It features CZ's omega trigger system allowing you to switch between a deckocker or a safety to carry cocked and locked, both ambidextrous.  It's a very soft shooter thanks to its low bore axis and has a very smooth double action pull for an accurate first shot and light single action pull for on point subsequent shots. Comes with everything from the factory  (2 mags, case, paperwork, etc).  This gun was carried and does show minor holster wear but is functionally perfect. Estimated round count: 400 rounds.

Maybe even a reliable home or personal defense weapon? This is a rare find in today's world because of all the newly made laws and regulations to disarm the people. Since this gun folds in half making it not only compact but also storable, you can take it anywhere (as long as you aren't retaking the law). Whether you are shooting at the range or defending your home from an intruder, another plus is the fact it is both accurate and semi-automatic--so after each shot, the next round is automatically loaded into the gun for the next shot. The great thing about glock mags is that they are interchangeable--this platform is made to work with the glock 17 magazines but will also accept hi-cap glock mags giving the shooter every possible advantage. 

This gun was purchased at the very end of 2013 and hasn't been used or abused--it has simply sat in the safe while I've been away at college. Comes new in original box, which includes the manuals and locks from the manufacturer still sealed in their original plastic. Gun is 9mm and accepts glock mags. Will include the glock 17 mag that came with the gun, but also two extra hi-cP mags that hold 31 rounds each. 
If you want something compact and versatile, this is the gun for you.The Sub2000's folding capabilities makes this the perfect 'truck gun' or allow it to be slipped in a backpack for a camping trip. This is the perfect fit for any scenario. 
Email me at the address listed if you are interested in taking a look and if it would be easier, include your contact information and I will give you a call to work out details.

This is a complete Beretta Nano package for sale or trade. The gun was purchased on 6/29/2013. The pictures below show the entire package. The Nano has Trijicon night sights installed ($105 upgrade). It has 3 extended mags - 8 rounds each (3 x $35 = $105 upgrade). It has the two additional frames at the top of the picture so you can change the actual frame color (2 x $39 = $78 upgrade). The gun, with a flush magazine (6 rounds), was $389 when I bought it last summer. Right now they are going for between $390-$425 new. $389 + $105 + $105 + $78 = $677 plus tax is what I have invested in the gun. It has been fired about 100-150 times at the most. It is still covered under the Beretta warranty if anything should go wrong. Comes with the original Beretta plastic case and cardboard box.

It has exactly 170 rounds through it. I have a very good leather holster for it. Can't think of the bran name at the moment but it cost like 50 bucks. I fired 150 rounds of Remington 115 grane and a box of hornedy hallow points. It fired everything great with no problems. I purchased the sig in December so its way past the problematic ones. One thing I have to mention is that out of the whole 6 rounds my brother fired through it he had a little misshandling. He picked it up and it slipped out of his hand and landed on my shooting pad witch is the reason I have one. I said to him your lucky. We'll turns out it landed on a spent casing. It didnt put a long scratch in it, its more like a dot or a ding. He had offered to buy it off of me right there and I told him nah don't worry about it. Its not bad and its a carry piece. If it were one of my 1911's then I'd be mad but then again I hate when there's even lint on them. I feel its important to mention this because some wouldn't and would let you travel and waste gas to find out it wasn't in showroom condition as it should be with only 170 rounds through it. I think I'm making it a way bigger deal then it really it but its somthing I'd like to know. Its not a deal killer or a price dropper but I'm just letting you perfectionist like me know its there, but don't let it scare you its not bad by any means I'm just being anal about it.  I will have pictures up as soon as I whip out my camera. The ding is located on the right side rear of the pistol at the top within the cocking surrations above the extractor.   The reason I'm selling it is because it just sits in my safe and I still carry what I always carry. I'd sell it to my brother but what do ya know he went shortly after and bought one. My number is REDACTED. Thank you for reading."

Although it's been mounted and used, it looks as good as it did the day I got it. I have been impressed by how well the finish has held up. 

The base stock was foliage green, so in areas where the hydro dip didn't reach (like inside the storage compartment) that's the color visible. 

The XTM rail covers came from the same place and match the color tones of the stock. They have a few chips here and there from being removed from a rail - MagPul deffinitely designed them to stay put - but they aren't really noticeable in my opinion, and I'm pretty picky about those things.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

It will have our 'City of Louisville' logo on the front of the slide. The right rear corner has all the finish worn off, the night sights were almost dead, and the right side of the grip is chewed up from the seatbelt...
I had to leave on a disability retirement after being injured on duty and had to turn in my issued weapon. To add insult to injury, I missed the chance to buy back the G22 I had carried daily since 1998! 
I have traced it as far as being sold to a dealer in South Carolina, who has since gone out of business. I had this same gun in my hand when I received my career-ending injury, so you can imagine the sentimental value it has for me.
If you have this Glock, or know where it it, pleas contact me!
Thank You!"

Parkerized finish (black/blue slide and grip). No more than 40 rounds through it. Excellent Condition. $225 OBO.

Gun description from the Kel tec website:
The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."
