great bag for hiking, prepping all your needs.  I have two and this one has never been used.  sits in my closet.
This is a 2,975 cubic inch capacity waterproof, gas-tight amphibious rucksack - designed to meet the requirement of swimming, diving and submarine lockouts. It provides protection via DUI’s 3-bag concept. The waterproof bag is heavy duty nylon butyl rubber trilaminate. A 1,000-denier Cordura stuff sack is included to store the equipment in to protect the inside of the waterproof bag. The outer Cordura bag takes most of the abuse. All of the straps are sewn to this outer bag so the least amount of stress is placed on the waterproof bag. The bag also includes a zippered weight storage area that incorporates DUI’s patented quick release weight system in the event the weights had to be ditched. This bag is ideal for water and land use."

These are known by many sportsman as the best american auto shotty of them all. These are not rare guns, but the 20 Guage version is a bit harder to find. The only catch is that my dumb arse didnt realize til I got home that someone had swapped the original buttstock for the shorter ""youth"" size. Someone probably gave it to their kid. These were ahead of their day (and price range) with extremely fast cycling, high vent rib and screw in choke. There are many of these for $400-$500 online, but none of them have a near perfect finish like this one. They were affordable so most people just used the heck out of em. This one was obviously put in a safe mostly. The pic makes it look like there's wear on the receiver which there IS NOT. It's just flash smear. The blueing is deep and pretty much perfect. Fantastic gun for the money. Now $300 Cash!

I have for sale a Llama model Xi-B. These Llama pistols were very well built spanish guns that took the 1911 and made it better, namely with slide robustness and simplicity. They are known as very accurate. They never cost all that much I think bc people were skeptical of spanish guns back when most 1911's were only made in America. Those who own them know how well made they are. I know the Llamas are not worth much in the blue book, but I will tell you that amongst all the guns they made, the Model Xi-B was and is the rarest gun in 9mm. They made many 1911s in 9mm, but not the Xi. As in hundreds made, not thousands. It features a 4.5 "" barrel and is between a commander and govt length 1911. It is sporting it's original grips in excellent shape, box and manual. Clearly this one wasnt shot much as it's extremely tight and the blueing is deep and superb overall. A couple small scratches, that's it. The spot in the pics is just the flash. The finish is excellent. Includes one original mag. $425 cash

 Cash only.  The tan or FDE version is a complete factory combat koted finish covering the entire gun. For those who don't know, this is NOT an ar10. It obviously is in the same form factor and will take ar 10 accessories. But, like the sig 516 compared to the sig m400 this gun has an ingenious self adjusting gas piston system that has fewer moving parts. Runs clean. Put a can on it and it runs even better.
NO TRADES. $1860 cash

This turn key bench / varmint Ruger based 10-22 (mfg prior to 2008) comes with the original metal trigger housing (not junk plastic) will out shoot you as it sits. New owner still has the option to bed the action and float the barrel if he/she sees fit. I ran a variety of match and bulk pack offerings through factory Ruger 10 round and 25 round magazines with no issues, fail to fires, fail to feeds etc.  Since this gun was built it has a low round count (approx 200 rounds) I shot paper at 50 yards and small reactive targets at 100 yards. It's been a safe queen in my modern climate controlled Liberty Gun safe. I'm willing to remove the bi-pod, scope, and rings from the deal other than that this gun is staying together! I have some excess ammo and stock Ruger internal parts if you want to work that in at the time of sale. Gun comes with two factory 10 round and two factory 25 round mags. This gun is in mint condition and ready to serve many fun filled years if treated properly.  Thanks for stopping by my listing.

It was highly sought after when updated from the 1900  model 8. in 1936. This is a 1938 model 81 and she's a rare beauty, from one end to another, bore perfect, action smooth as a baby. This rifle was a legend in the logging and hunting camps of the northern territories and great north West, and along the Canadian borders on both sides before WWII. It was bought by my Granddad in Salem Ore in 1938 and my dad passed it to me. I don't hunt any more, legs gone and Ill have to let her go .  My dad cherished this gun, now he's gone, and its time to move  along. Hope someone will appreciate this old northern legend, and take care of her as we have.

This is a really amazing revolver. It’s incredibly lightweight, but recoil is still very manageable, especially compared to a small frame revolver.

I’ve had no trouble with it at all, and would love to keep it, but just have too many handguns right now.

it got wet during a nasty day of duck hunting this year, which left a light surface rust coating throughout most of the exterior of the firearm. i tried to remove the surface rust with CLR, which blemished the bluing coating on the shotgun pretty good. while it does NOT affect the performance, if you ask me it does look like hell. i cant afford to get it re-blued or dipped right now, so i just assume post it up for sale and let someone motivated make a project out of it. 

that being said, i believe that $300 is a fair deal for someone to snag up a reliable legendary 870 super magnum. if you disagree, we can negotiate, but please do your research before sending me a jackass offer.

I just don't have the time to fix her up like she deserves. It was an old British military radio truck. It has a 24volt electrical system, dual fuel tanks, brand new battery's, and tons of room. It cranks right up every time and runs and drives great. The frame is in very good shape for its age with only a few rust spots. The British military used the equivalent to rhino lining to protect the underside. The top of the floorboard near the fire wall does have rust holes and the window topers will need replacing.

The shotgun originally had a Poly Choke on the end of the barrel, but one of the fingers of the choke was broken off and barrels are not cheap for this gun. So I cut the choke off before the threads, filed it even and reblued the crown of the barrel, so it is a cylinder bore shotgun now. I already have two other twelve gauges and don't really need this one, so that's why I'm getting rid of it. The gun functions good, cycles and feeds great and recoil isn't bad at all. Crossbolt safety, light trigger and the big barrel bead make it a good setup for anyone. I believe springs have been replaced in action because they're stiff like a new gun. 2+1 setup for hunting so you're good to go for the field. Based on the productions numbers, it looks like the gun was produced between 1939 and early 1940, but the numbers are hard to follow. I've seen shotguns like this in rougher shape go for a lot more. Bluing is in great shape, wood stock is in okay shape, it would be easy to refinish. I can even refinish the stock for a cheap price if you'd prefer."

Germany) in great condition. It would make a nice addition to your Browning or SIG collection. Apparently these are fairly scarce pistols. It is roll marked on the left side of the slide ""Browning Arms Co. Morgan, UT & Montreal P.Q."" and on the right side of the slide is the serial number and ""SIG-Sauer System Made in W. Germany"". It has Browning molded into the right side grip and features a European style heel magazine release also.

The short history as I've read on various sites is that Sig Sauer contracted with Browning to import them as the Browning Double Action or BDA. Browning imported these guns from 1977 to 1980 in fairly small numbers until Sig decided to import to the US on their own. They are basically the predecessor to the P220 series that Sig imported themselves after 1980. The most to least common (SIG) BDA was chambered in .45ACP (used by the Huntington Beach Police Department with much success during that time), then the 9mm (2,740 made), and the least common is the 38 Super (753 made).

This SIG/Browning comes with two magazines and an owners manual."

684,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2586684,For Sale:  Linn Creek Military Surplus Shoot Off,"Camdenton-Linn Creek., Missouri, United States",$ 20,"Listed On: Sunday, February 2, 2014",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SATURDAY MARCH 1st Starts at High Noon. 

This is a monthly shoot, held on the first Saturday of the month and always starts at noon, please try to be there on time. Held at the Centerpoint Gun Club. Located on A rd in Linn Creek (between Camdenton and Osage Beach) See below for directions.

PRIZE RIFLE: See below for details

HOW DOES IT WORK?

You bring your military surplus rifle (any rifle issued to or used by a military anywhere in the world) this includes anything from a revolutionary war musket to any weapon made pre 1957. If you have a question weather your weapon was issued, please feel free to ask. 

~~~~~Bring YOUR Military surplus rifle and ammo. 5 shots, 100 yards, open sights. Bi pods and rests are now allowed. (No full sleds, you have to hold the rifle yourself). The top score takes home the prize rifle. It's that simple.

Tickets are $20 each, 3 for $50. You can enter as many times as you like. You can pre pay via pay pal or pay cash at the time of the shoot.

Rather than going 1 shooter at a time like last year, we will be going at it with banks of 4 shooters per round. This will speed everything up quite a bit. A pair of complaints from last year was it took so long to cycle everyone through the same rifle and going in cold with an unfamiliar weapon just kind of sucked. SO, going this route. knowing your own weapon, and a bank of shooters will more than likely ramp up the speed and excitement of the events.

A spotter will still be provided. If you have a spotting scope, please bring it with you, we can not have enough of them there. 

Our faithful Range master will score the target. His word is the final say in any disputes over whatever may come up. There has never been a problem to date with score disputes, but I just wanted to put that out there for the record. 

Also, bring camp chairs or something to sit on. As always I'll bring the water for everyone & am working with a couple of people to sponsor/provide hot food as well, but that's not guaranteed yet. It's still in the works. If you are a food vendor/restaurant owner and want to talk sponsorship, please message me.

That's about it for the Milsurp portion of the shoot.

Questions? Message or call me. My contact info is below.

_______________________________________________________

The next event held immediately after the Milsurp Shoot is what we call Run What'cha Brung. 

This is open to any and all rifles, any caliber, milsurp or not. Scoped or not at your preference. Bi pods and rests are also welcome. The same rules apply as above. 5 shots, but this one is out to 200 yards, top score takes home 1/2 of the entry fees. 

Slots are $10 each. In the event of a tie, the target will be moved out to 300 yards. In the event of another tie we'll do what we did at the November 2013 shoot. 5 16 oz water bottles set up at 300 yards-5 shots, whoever takes the most out wins. It's that simple.

After both events there will be open range time for everyone to shoot and have fun. There are pistol pits as well as the 300 yard range. Bring your big kid toys & lets have a great day!

_______________________________________________________

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO BRING ANY TRADE/SALE GOODS YOU MAY WANT TO MOVE ALONG TO A NEW HOME. 

Bring anything you like that is related to shooting/hunting, survival/personal defense and the like along. I'm sure someone will be interested. I would like to see this portion build up to a full scale trade/barter show some day sp lets get out there and do some tradin'!

'Odd' calibers like 7.7 Jap 7.5x55 Swiss and similar are always in demand. As are more common calibers like 7/8mm mauser, 30/30, 30-06, .45 in all flavors, 9mm ...you get the idea. 

If it's legal, bring it out. 
_______________________________________________________

This is a casual and relaxed shoot, so please no 'rules lawyers' or nit pickers. This is for fun more than anything else. Relax & have a good time. Safety, however is paramount.

Eye and Ear protection are mandatory and are non negotiable. If you refuse to wear them, you will be asked to leave. Again, it's that simple. We generally have spare foamy ear plugs for those who forget theirs and an extra pair of glasses or 2 just in case.

This is a family event and we encourage you to bring them along, we love kids & everyone needs a personal cheering section..lol 

Every so often we will mix things up a little and add an extra event like a poker shoot, bowling pin shoot, shotgun/skeet/trap and whatever else we can think of. If you have any thoughts, comments or suggestions please message me or comment on the pinned post on the primary shoot off page.

DIRECTIONS:

Off of Hwy 54, Take Hwy A/ A rd to Garrison, (approx. 4 1/2 miles from 54), make a right. (Garrison is just across the road from the MO Trap Shooters Assn.) Down Garrison hill. across the low water bridge, 75 yards up on the right you will see the range. Come on in and introduce yourself to the group & have fun. 

My phone number is 573 286 4 zero 9 zero if you get lost or need any more information. 

PRIZE RIFLE: The first place prize rifle will change every month, It depends on what I find and what the group decides they want. Last year it was Mosins and Mausers. I will do my very best to find a variety of quality rifles to keep it fresh and interesting. The first prize of the year will be a Mosin Nagant 7.62x54R. I have set up a group buy for a crate of Mosins and get the first selection. The best rifle from that crate will be the prize at our first shoot. The crate has not yet arrived so I do not know what exactly it is yet, I will update this post after it lands here.

I hope to see you there.

You can find us on Facebook by searching Linn Creek Milsurp Shoot Off.

We have pics of past shoots and a great bunch of folk having fun on the group page. Drop in and say howdy."

All records from 1907-1961 were destroyed in a fire at the Winchester Headquarters in 1961 so This is as accurate a time frame as can be given. Gun is complete and would be rated as above average condition based on patina, lack of repairs and general condition of wood and metal (Little original bluing is left, little to no pitting in metal, most corners are still crisp and present, wood is original walnut base model with no noticable damage/splits/rot and all original parts are present and in working order) Barrel length measures 26"" (from muzzle to face of closed action using a wooden dowel down the inside of the barrel) this indicates the barrel is a custom length from the standard 24"" barrel. Barrel is full octagonal, bright and shiny inside, rifling looks superb. All model 1873 made after serial # 525923 are NOT considered antique, hence any purchaser will have to use a liscened FFL receiver to ship to (if you aren't sure how this works, ask me) Rifle uses 32 WCF ammunition.buyer pays for all shipping costs."

300 H&H MAGNUM-- THE MOST VERSATILE MAGNUM 

300 H&H MAGNUM RIFLES ARE SCARCE and must be custom built if you want one.
The .300 H&H Magnum Cartridge was introduced by the British company Holland & Holland as the Super-Thirty in June, 1925. The cartridge won the 1000-yard Wimbledon Cup Match at Camp Perry in 1935, and the international 1,000 yard competition in 1937.Winchester chambered the Model 70 in .300 Holland & Holland Magnum in 1937.
The cartridge offered superior Ballistics to the .30-06 for long range, and the .300 H&H is almost as versatile with all bullet weights and types, especially if well-developed handloads are used. It excels with the heaviest .30-calibre bullets in the 180–220-grain range."

From the manufacturer:

The PPK established a defining influence on the design of concealed carry
firearms. Its elegant lines and precision engineering have a timeless
appeal. And a PPK has the solid feel of pure quality. PPK/S is the 1968
""Sport"" version, with longer grip, based on the legendary 1931 design. The
top strap is cut with a wave to reduce glare. It contains a loaded chamber
viewport for quick status inspection. Rear slide serrations are equipped
for non-slip grip and classic Walther styling. A manual safety engages a
firing pin block for confident, safe handling. The internal slide stop
reduces external snags. It has fixed steel sights and classic Walther
checkered grip panels. The double action trigger has a 13 lb. pull while
the single action has a 6 lb. pull. The magazine finger extension improves
shooting comfort.
