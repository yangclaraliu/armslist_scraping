This is a full power+ 300 Win. Mag. load that is designed to shoot targets such as deer and sheep well past 500 yards with precision, yet the bullet will give ample penetration for large elk and moose. This load can also be used for such tasks as 2,000 lb bison, but only if you stick with broadside/double lung shots.

As always Buffalo Bore derives it published velocities from real world firearms and refuses to get involved in the industry wide duplicitous practice of advertising velocities that can only be achieved in extra long laboratory barrels, which the customer will never realize with stock rifles in the field. Notice our below velocities.

3100 fps -- Kimber Montana, 26 inch barrel
3064 fps -- Savage Mod. 116, 22 inch barrel
3021 fps -- Mauser Action with 22 inch Lilja barrel
You’ll notice that my 26 inch Kimber gives only nominal gains over the two other 22 inch barrel. This particular Kimber barrel is a “slow” barrel for a 26 inch barrel and should be generating velocities of roughly 100 fps faster than it is."

My shooting has slowed down a lot lately and I need to trim some fat.

This is a DPMS Sportical slickside upper. Chambered for 5.56 with a 1-9 barrel twist.

I painted the handguards OD green to match the grip on my lower, you can see some wear on the paint in the pictures. I also removed the crappy gas block that was on it and added an Armalite clamp on A2 front sight, functions exactly like a pinned on A2. It also has a thread protector pinned on. It has a cheap rear flip up sight on it too, I think it is zero'd for 50 yards as a backup.

I have used this upper to shoot bullets between 55 and 72 gr out to 300 yards no problem. It has some cosmetic wear from field time as I used it to hunt deer and coyotes with. It has taken a few deer.

I cleaned it after each range trip and hunt and it functions great with any kind of ammo I have tried through it. 55 gr handloads group fantastic. Probably 1000 rounds give or take a few hundred through it.

It also has a Primary Arms Compact 3x scope with etched reticle, can be used with or without the red light on. I can sell it with or without the scope, but the upper buyer gets first dibs on it.

I would be willing to ship, but buyer will pay actual shipping cost, shipping insurance, and a $5 handling fee. I would prefer FTF in the Cortland area if possible.

This is a sale for parts only, buyer is responsible for knowing the NY state laws before installing any parts onto a lower receiver.

Step up to one of the world's most powerful handguns: the .50 Action Express, considerably larger than .44 Magnum. 

I got this pistol last year.  After shooting it some, I decided it needs a younger, stronger owner.  It's got the ported barrel, and the recoil isn't ridiculously bad, but firing it hurts my wrist after a few  rounds, so I think I will pass it on and get something else.

Very good condition, with some minor handling marks and marks along the frame from slide travel.

Weight: 46.2 oz
Length: 10.75 in
Barrel Length: 6.5 in

Includes one new box of Hornady Custom ammo - 300 gr XTP/HP with 17 live rounds and 3 empty cases.  Includes 2 magazines (1 shown in pic)

FTF only, cash only

It's a quite rare handgun - no others listed on Armslist in entire USA,  There's only 1 of these listed on GB and it's $2000 BIN, so this is quite a bargain, plus no shipping, no delay, no 4473.

Here's some info about the gun, if you're not familiar with it:
The AMT Automag V is a large single action semi-automatic pistol made by Arcadia Machine and Tool (AMT) in Irwindale, CA.  The weapon was created by Harry Sanford, who also invented the original .44 AutoMag pistol. One of the extremely small number of handguns that fire a .50 caliber cartridge, it is also one of the few semi automatic guns that fires the .50 Action Express cartridge, it is said to be ""the most ergonomic and lightweight of all of those autoloaders"".   Its built-in compensator ports in the barrel assist in keeping muzzle rise to tolerable levels. The recoil, however, is still surprisingly brisk even for the most experienced shooter. The Automag V has a 5 shot magazine capacity (5+1 total) and is, like all of the AMT pistols, made primarily of cast stainless steel."

I am letting go of it at the wholesale price because of the tool marks in the barrel near the throat.

So, if you are planning to by a new PPK/S, you can at least save some money, as it appears that all currently produced guns are the same.

In NV mode the red dot sight can only be seen with a NV device (GEN I-GEN IV), the real deal and works great with my Bushnell Gen I NV Mono (see pictures)!! In regular mode it has 20 brightness setting including auto-shut off of either 4 hours or 8 hours on AA Batteries or Lithium! 
 This is a bad a** combo for your AR-15, AK47, PS90, FN FAL .308, M1A1, or any other weapon you choose to mount it to that has a rail. 
 The Sight Mark 3x Magnifier is crisp and clear and brings your target closer for that far away shot. Flip the magnifier to the side and use the EOTech alone for those up close shots. 
 This is the real deal in EOTech's for Military or Law Enforcement. The sight is used and shows some scrapes on the outer protective hood (does not affect it's operation)! Both work perfect!! I'm asking $500 OBO for both as a package deal (that is a savings of $160 from new!!!). I may consider cash with a partial trade depending on what you have to offer (see below). Price is OBO but within reason, if you want the best combat sight out there this is it!! I used one of these in Afghanistan and have depended my life on EOTech before...trust me when I say they work in combat and are well worth the price!! I have two and only need one now.

All matching numbers gun. I removed the stock and meticulously hand sanded every blemish out of the beautiful Baltic Birch. Then I applied 15 coats of Tung Oil Gloss Finish. (one coat per day for 15 days) Between each coat, I buffed the entire stock with 0000 steel wool to get a beautiful resulting high gloss and durable finish. This is the kind of Finish put on very high dollar rifles. You will not find a more beautiful SKS, anywhere. The firing pin was replaced with a Murray's stainless steel firing pin and spring set. The gas valve was replaced with a Murray's stainless steel gas valve. The original parts that were replaced come with the rifle upon sale. I sent the trigger assembly to Bill Springfield , (http://www.triggerwork.net/sksrifles.html) and he did a great trigger job, reducing the length of pull and removing all grittiness in the trigger. Also he reduced the trigger pull from over 8lbs. to just a hair over 4lbs. Needless to say, this SKS shoots like a dream. By far the smoothest, most accurate SKS I have shot in 40 years of shooting. Included are : a Tapco 20 rd. magazine, one dust cover scope mount with a no-name 4x scope, and another dust cover scope mount with a BSA Red Dot scope. Personally, I prefer the stock sights, but to each their own. You wont find a prettier, smoother shooting , or more accurate SKS. The bore shows very little wear and the accuracy proves it. Comes with original web sling and original magazine. This is the model with grenade launcher , grenade sights and phosphorescent night sights, original blade bayonet, and correct cleaning kit (in the buttstock) and cleaning rod. I know I am asking a premium price, but when you see this rifle in person, it is a gem."

As this is going to be a fist firearm for him, I want to get something reliable and simple to maintain. He is planning on getting a .22 handgun at some point down the road, so I'd like to get him something a little bigger, hopefully something that's easy to find ammo for. If you throw in a case for the weapon and some bullets, or any other bells/whistles, that would be wonderful.

I have budgeted $300 for the gun, and I assume that I need to set aside another 50 for the things that it needs to come with. I'll probably just share my cleaning kit with him, so I'm not worried about that in particular, but it would be awesome if someone is willing to throw one in.

I live in Seattle, and work in Bellevue. If you are willing to meet in either of those cities, that would be great.

The TAVOR is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to an 18"" Mil-Spec Cold Hammer Forged Chrome Moly Vanadium Chrome Lined barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. Adjustable back-up sights are integrated and can be folded down in to the Picatinny rail, and the front post is Tritium for improved visibility. All metal parts are treated for corrosion resistance. A rubber butt pad is integrated in to the stock to reduce felt recoil. The Tavor is assembled in the USA from US and Israeli manufactured parts. Caliber: 5.56mm NATO / .223 Remington Capacity: One 28 round magazine included Barrel: 18"" Cold Hammer Forged, Chrome Lined, Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel, 1:7"" twist"

This turn key bench / varmint Ruger based 10-22 (mfg prior to 2008) comes with the original metal trigger housing (not junk plastic) will out shoot you as it sits. New owner still has the option to bed the action and float the barrel if he/she sees fit. I ran a variety of match and bulk pack offerings through factory Ruger 10 round and 25 round magazines with no issues, fail to fires, fail to feeds etc.  Since this gun was built it has a low round count (approx 200 rounds) I shot paper at 50 yards and small reactive targets at 100 yards. It's been a safe queen in my modern climate controlled Liberty Gun safe. I'm willing to remove the bi-pod, scope, and rings from the deal other than that this gun is staying together! I have some excess ammo and stock Ruger internal parts if you want to work that in at the time of sale. Gun comes with two factory 10 round and two factory 25 round mags. This gun is in mint condition and ready to serve many fun filled years if treated properly.  Thanks for stopping by my listing.
