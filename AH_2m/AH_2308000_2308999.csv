Heckler & Koch
MR 762-A1

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!

Like its 5.56 mm counterpart, the MR762A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416/417 series, only in a semi-automatic rifle configuration developed for civilian users.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.

Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.

The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components.

The MR762A1 uses many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips, mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” type rail system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.

Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1 uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for the HK417; a 5-round magazine is also under development. MR762A1 rifles are well-suited for a variety of applications including law enforcement tactical, police patrol, general sporting, and hunting (a 5-round magazine is under development).

This rifle is like new about 200 rounds fired total. Gun comes with Tasco Pro Point red dot 3 magazines 2-12 rd. and 1 20rd. Comes with Sling and soft case. UPS shipping 20$ flat rate. The Ruger Police Carbine is a pistol caliber carbine designed as a companion to the Ruger P Series pistols. As of 2007, Ruger has discontinued production citing low demand. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series 9mm and .40 S&W caliber pistols. Both the PC9 (the 9mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol (see internal ballistics). The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol. The Carbine has some unique design features. The action is a simple blowback design, which requires a fairly massive bolt to handle the pressure of 9mm and .40 S&W. To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; the main body of the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine. These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars. The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well. Another unique feature is the bolt lock. Since blowback guns of these calibers require heavy bolts, the inertia of dropping the gun can cause the bolt to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until the bolt is manually closed all the way. To prevent this, the Carbine uses a lock that locks the bolt securely closed so that a fall will not dislodge it. A slight pressure on the trigger or on the bolt handle, however, will disengage the bolt so that it can move for firing or clearing the action. In addition to caliber, the Carbine also comes with a choice in sights. The standard model uses notch and post sights, while the GR models are equipped with ghost ring sights. The ghost ring sights cost more, but they are generally considered better for defensive purposes, as they allow faster sighting under poor lighting conditions plus a longer sight radius for greater potential accuracy. The Carbine also has Ruger style scope bases built into the receiver, allowing optical sights to be easily and securely mounted."

This was the original moonclip revolver, but .45 acp can also be loaded directly into the cylinder, if you don't mind manual ejecting the shells as there is no rim to catch on the ejector star.  

This was made in 1918 and was a WWI issue combat weapon w/ US government proof marks and property stamps -- this is the US issued model, not the more common and less valuable Brazilian model.  Condition is perhaps 70-80% with some bluing loss near the end of the barrel, top strap and cylinder edges, w/ VERY TIGHT lockup and smooth action vintage Smith action.  Timing is good, there is no gap between the crane and frame, and the forcing cone is clean and sharp. Overall it is in great shape, and doesn't appear to have been shot all that much -- pretty amazing given that is is almost 100 years old.   

It is a valuable weapon, and somewhat rare -- similar things on gunbroker are going anywhere from $1000-$2500.  I put its value on par with a top quality revolver or 1911."

The gun has never been fired and is in the original box with the original paperwork and cleaning kit.  Also has some full and half moon clips.  The gun is almost perfect. There is a slight cylinder turn line mostly from just cleaning and safety checking it over the past decades. Also on one side of the edge of the barrel there is a faint scratch about 1 1/2"" long. Otherwise the wood and bluing are in new condition. Now I am not necessarily looking to sell or trade unless it is of something of interest to me.
I am not looking to trade for a gun I can go buy at any dealer.  Except for 1 gun I am looking for is a high quality bolt action rifle such as a Browning White Gold Medallion A-Bolt with the octagon barrel.  I had 1 of these and needed to sell it at the time and wished I never would have.  But this gives you an example of the type of gun I am looking for.  I do not care for rifles with synthetic stocks, I like nice wood.

Moved out to 100 yards fired it 5 more times. 3 of them was to see what kind of group it would shoot. Under half inch easy with factory loads. I have 75 remington swift scirocco rounds 165 grain bullets that Im will to sell with the guns as well for an additional $100. All emails go right to my phone so please leave a number and ill be glad to call you back. I want $1550 for the gun. Not interested in trading. Thanks for your time. Travis

Christensen has created an incredibly lightweight AR-10 that gives the shooter a new level of long range precision in a rapid-fire semi-automatic rifle. The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has an 18” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs.

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.

Comes with two Remington factory barrels (28"" and 18.5"") and some other minor upgrades.

Must meet at FFL (preferably Turner's in Pasadena, CA, but definitely nothing further than an hour outside of Los Angeles.  I can ship to an FFL as well, but you will be paying $5.00 extra for packaging, and actual cost of shipping.).

Some details:

The removed the stock recoil pad and upgraded it with a Remington Supercell Recoil pad.  It isn't an exact fit, as the bottom extends about a quarter inch past the wood stock.

The 18.5"" barrel is like new, only about 20 rounds through it.  It is a parkerized Remington barrel with a fixed improved cylinder choke and front bead sight.

The original factory 28"" barrel has about 500 rounds through it, but is has been well maintained.   It is a parkerized vent rib barrel with the factory modified choke tube installed and a front bead sight.

There are a couple small marks in the wood from normal handling - hardley noticeable.  The gun is in great shape and has only seen light use.

Lastly I also installed some Uncle Mike's QD swivel sling studs (stock and magazine cap).  The gun is sling-ready!  I will include the other original parts that came with it, and the manual too.

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

Only the finest premium ingredients in this build.  I've built several of these and the Rock River bull barrel will drive tacks at 300 yards with slightly higher loads (they prefer to eat 62 grains in my experience, but every one is a little different). The upper alone was over $1000, and takes 9 months to get from RRA.  Asking $1400 or best reasonable offer.  It's the top rifle (with stainless barrel) in the attached photo."

Differences between an Express 870 and a Police Magnum 870:

The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market. It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality. All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences. It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models. Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.

While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police. To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance.

Synopses of the variances are provided below.
870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.
All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.
All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.
Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.
A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.
A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.
Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.
The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks. The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.
The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.
The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize Parkerization. The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.
The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.
The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization.
Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

First off, my friend's father carried this 1911 in Korea, it was passed down and ultimately I purchased it from him. The frame was manufactured in 1913, which is validated by Colt archives (frame serial # 30,4XX). The front of the grip was made 'rough' by the US Army, before the pistol was used in Korea (prevent slipping from the hand). The frame has the original wooden grips and is inscribed with ""United States Property.""

The slide of this 1911 is dated by Colt to have been produced during 1955-1970 - there is no serial #. The reason the slide is different from the frame is that my friend's dad went on (after Korea) to become a competition shooter in the US ARMY; the current slide has adjustable sights. I have shot approximately 80 rounds through this 1911, it is a TAC-DRIVER! The slide has inscribed: ""Government Model COLT Automatic Caliber .45"".

The bore is bright and shiny with some wear (to be expected). Considering the frame was produced in 1913, and the slide was produced as early as 1955, this pistol is in outstanding condition. There is some very minor pitting and a tiny bit of rust, but all of the internals are in great shape."

Get it now, or miss out on the opportunity to own this pristine condition 'classic' Pre-Ban American manufactured AK.

If you know Ak's - you know that Arsenal makes the most expensive, and best, with the tightest tolerances - aside from ordering a custom AK from Rifle Dynamics... which can't be touched in this price range! This rifle is stamped Arsenal Las Vegas Nevada USA, is in pristine condition and currently owned by a gunsmith.


This Arsenal Pre-Ban SAM7A1R 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market.


From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable flash hider/muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7A1R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service.


The SAM7A1R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.


Each SAM7A1R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.


Summary: SAM7A1R - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, 2 30 round magazines, sling, and cleaning kit.


FEATURES 100% new-production parts and components. Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber Removable muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads. AK scope rail. Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.) 922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines. Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.


SPECIFICATIONS Caliber: 7.62 x 39 mm Total Length: 927mm (36.5”) Barrel Length: 415 mm Weight without Magazine: 3.67kg (8 lbs.) Muzzle Velocity: 710 m/s Rate of Fire (practical): 40 rds/min Twist Rate: 1 in 240 mm Effective Range: 400 m Max Effective Range: 1350 meters/4430feet

Made in Germany.

USP Compact 45 Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP.

The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters.

The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

HK USP 45 compact Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame.
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life.
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes.
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish.
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves.
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel.
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories.
Ambidextrous magazine release lever.
Extended slide release.
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Still has original box, manual, and brush. It's only had about 200 rounds put through it and still runs like a dream. Has a rail under the barrel so you can attach your favorite flashlight or laser. 

If you don't know about the Rhinos, they have their barrels aligned with the lowest cylinder, so the recoil from each shot goes straight back into your wrist and reduces muzzle rise. A rhino will have much less felt recoil and muzzle rise than a conventional magnum revolver. .38 specials out of the Rhino feel like .22lr's and you can go through a box of .357 mag without having sore wrists afterwards. Designed by the same man who designed the Mateba Autorevolver, the Rhino shares a lot of the same characteristics, mainly the lower axis barrel. 

I'm in no hurry to sell this pistol, I just don't have the time to shoot it anymore and would prefer to have a semiautomatic pistol for home defense. 

I'd prefer to trade this for a HK 45, HK USP (or compact), or a double stack 1911, Sig Sauer 1911, but will also take $900 cash for it. Contact me via email with offers, worse I can say is no and will respond to all offers.

Hi Points are known for being virtually indestructible and I can say with around 500 rounds through this I've never had a FTF or FTE using all kinds of ammo. It's also +P and +P+ rated, although I've never personally shot +P. I'm anal about my weapon's maintenance & this gun is squeaky clean (& I always use Frog Lube).

I'm firm on price (and it's a fair price to start with) as I'm torn on selling it and really don't have to -- I purchased a left handed 9mm carbine & I shoot that mostly now so this gun rarely gets used.

If this posting is up, the gun is available.

For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.
The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil."

She shoots great, and has been used on deer and elk all over the states of WY and ID. The rifle has iron sights, but they will put your about 6 inches high at 20 yards due to the rear adjusting tool being lost years ago. Two rails have been drilled and tapped so mounting a scope should not be a problem.  I'm happy to answer any questions you might have, just shoot me an email."
