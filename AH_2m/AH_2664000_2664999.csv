Rifle is in perfect new condition, total safe queen. Fired for function check only and she is a shooter. All components are NEW and it shows. This thing is stunning in person. Fires the infamous 300 BLK 7.62x35 round and uses all AR15 mags and components. Optic ready. All black but the stainless 16” bull barrel that just barley peeks out from under the 15” modular free float rail. Will let her go for an absolute steal at $950 cash only FTF in Spring. This is a really good deal on a truly badass rifle so please don’t waste both of our time by trying to haggle over $50. If you don’t live in or near Spring TX don’t bother contacting me. I’ve had multiple deals fall through due to people who live out of town wanting me to hold it for them until they can meet next week so please don’t ask. I will not part out so please don’t ask. I will not let you and your buddy shoot it first to see if you like it so please don’t ask. Quality parts, quality build, great deal. Need cash, baby on the way.

I bought this new a few months ago back in November. Test fire date April of 2013. Approx 300 rounds downrange, all flawless. 

Factory night sights (really nice, defined sight picture!), fully ambidextrous controls, great texture on the grip, flat and curved backstraps (natural pointer for me with the flat, like a 1911 with flat mainspring housing or 3rd gen Smith, love that!)... I can't really say enough good things about this gun. 

I actually feel that this is put together more robustly than a Glock (gasp!), kinda over-built (guess that's what you get from a military arms manufacturer!). 

But I have (finally?) realized that I just prefer compacts and sub-compacts for my guns, and that's that. This FNS grip actually fits my hands better and feels better than any other full-size gun has - but I just want something smaller. For someone bigger than me, or for range or dedicated HD use (or you OC guys and gals!), with its 17+1 capacity, it's great!

Here's a couple of videos that do a great job showing off the FNS (although both of them are manual safety models, mine's without):

This Military Model Sprint features a conventional Military Model PlainEdge blade-profile with a flat-grind and oversized blade hole. Machined onto the blade’s spine and choil are sections of jimping that inhibit the knife from slipping forward or backward when forcefully cutting or sawing.

The blade is matched with peel ply grey G-10 handle and a Michael Walker LinerLock®. The lock's liner is nested into the scale which augments lock strength without having to rely on bulkier full-length internal liners.

Crucible Steel Company produces performance automotive, aerospace, defense, and consumer-products steels. They also manufacture high-performance steels for the knife industry. Recently they presented Spyderco the opportunity to be the first production knife company to offer CPM® CRU-WEAR® to the public. A CPM® CRU-WEAR® Military Model Sprint Run became a reality. 

CPM® CRU-WEAR® steel is an air-hardened powdered metallurgy tool steel. Crucible’s original smelted-produced CRU-WEAR® was created as an upgrade to A2 and D2 tool steels, both have earned longevity and respect in the cutlery business for their wear resistance and tough cutting performance. 

Powder produced CPM® CRU-WEAR® ups the ante. Through powdered steel technology, the steel is made easier to machine with improved resistance to chipping over the original smelted CRU-WEAR®. The powdered variety also attains a higher hardness factor through greater percentages of tungsten and molybdenum that result in a secondary hardening response."

Surefire M720V Raid LED Weaponlight 

P/N: M720V-BK NSN: 6230-01-590-2412

P/N: M720V-TN NSN: 6230-01-592-9028

The variable-output M720V RAID WeaponLight produces brilliant 150-lumen white light or 240 milliwatts of infrared output for use with night vision devices—with no need for IR filters or spare lamps. Simply push and twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between white light or IR illumination—or select the ""disable"" setting to prevent accidental discharges. In either spectrum mode, the M720V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for close- to medium-range applications with sufficient peripheral illumination for situational awareness. The highly efficient LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. 

The M720V comes with a pressure-activated SR07-M720V tape switch (with a 7"" cable) that can be positioned where you choose. If your remote switch becomes damaged or disconnected, rotate your RAID WeaponLight's white-light selector switch to "";flashlight"" mode and activate it directly via its integral pushbutton dome switch. (This same pushbutton switch provides low navigational white light when ""flashlight"" mode is not selected.) This selector switch also lets you choose three different white-light output settings: high, medium, or strobe. The IR selector switch, located on opposite side, offers high-, medium-, and low-output settings when IR mode is selected on head. 

The M720V attaches solidly to your Picatinny rail via our Swing-Lever™ clamp, which self-adjusts to out-of-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from recoil or impact. Built to withstand the rigors of combat, the M720V is constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission. It's also O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture.

I keep all my stuff nice, please no lowball offers, no trades either at this time, thanks for looking!  I have flawless feedback on AR15.com forums and Fleabay.


1)  Selling a Burris Fastfire 3 with Picatinny mount.  I got this as a gift and have no use for it unfortunately.  Never mounted by me, doesn't appear to have been mounted at all.

Top-loading battery compartment is an improvement over the Fastfire 2.  The only flaw on this unit is the prior owner marked up the battery cover (my guess was he/she tried the adjustment screwdriver to tighten the battery cover so there is a mark in the slot for unscrewing it).  Check it out in pics, its not too bad and does not interfere with operation.  The body and glass is flawless.  Does not look like it was ever used or mounted, except for that aforementioned mark in the battery cover.

This includes everything as new including box and battery, picatinny mount, sunshade, adjustment screwdriver, cleaning wipe.  You will need to snap up a riser (I've seen 1/2"" rail risers recommended for a simple solution) or AR-specific mount from Burris (they call that the AR-F3 mount) to mount at the proper height for an AR15.

Its a damn nice sight, I just don't have anything to put it on. Rather sell and put monies towards a new setup.  $205 Shipped, Paypal gift or you cover fees,  $200 picked up cash.

2)  Selling clamp-on YHM folding front sight and gas block, YHM-9394-H. This is HK-style sight and has a bayo lug on the bottom. Note there is no swing-swivel and a small mark on the tab that you can install one if you so choose. This includes gas tube as shown for a carbine.

The tips of the ears were shaved by the prior owner 2-3mm and touched up with a bluing pen, very imperceptible and done so he could fit it inside a Troy MRF carbine extended rail.

This is the Winchester model that Theodore Roosevelt made famous in his around the world hunting exploits. Made & shipped in 1902 it is truly a special order rifle which has remained in near new ORIGINAL condition for over 100 years. Copy of Winchester Cody Firearms Museum record pictured for this gun....it letters right down to the special order sights! This gun was ordered in the powerful .35 Winchester caliber. The grain and figure in the fancy checkered buttstock and forend is fantastic..plimented by the original OIL FINISH. Hard rubber shotgun buttplate. Minor handling marks are present in the wood commensurate with 100 years of gentle handling. No cracks or chips or extra holes. The original blue on this gun is nearly all there with a slightest amount of wear on the right side of box magazine where the lever mechanism has travelled a few times. The receiver of this gun has the deepest rich blue that I have ever seen on a Winchester. The Winchester factory craftsmen who worked on this special order rifle obviously spent extra time with it's polish. All edges & corners are razor sharp & crisp! Screws are untouched. This gun still retains the case color on the hammer and brilliant case color on the trigger block mechanism which I have never seen remaining on a Model 1895. The special order Lyman sights add to the charm of this near new Deluxe. At some point long ago the sight filler blank on the barrel was upgraded to a proper Winchester rear sight. This is a wonderful opportunity to acquire a nearly new Deluxe rifle. It is a ""blue-chip"" investment grade Winchester for the advanced collector. A special order gun in this condition will continue to appreciate for a collector OR savy investor."

It has ben brought to my attention that this ammo has been recalled. I did a little homework and found that a symbol# on the side of the box above the barcode  must be S22LRT which this box is because it is the M22 type but then you must open the top lid and the 2 parts that stick down to keep it closed, the left one should have a lot # on it stamped upside down.  The lots that are affected are GD42L & GD52L.  The 2 lots could have a double charge and damage your firearm.
Just wanted everyone to know that I have checked this box and it is perfectly fine. Its lot # is 2GG80L.  As a matter of fact I was just at the range last week and shot half of the other box that was in the twin pack with this box.  Just FYI"

I have a 10/22 in about every config, so just no use for this one.  Looking for something to train up my girlfriend with that would be hers.

Will trade for others like it, plus cash or ?. Looking for same caliber. Maybe a rifle like the Remington 597 and a pistol like the Mosquito or Heritage arms 22lr/mag revolver.  You get the idea. Considering those are going for about $200 a piece you come out at least $100 ahead.

I have an Advantage Arms .22LR conversion kit for Glock Model 17 and 22 Gen3 Pistols.   Repeat:  Conversion kit only, no pistol is included.  I sold the Pistol and no longer have use for these items.   I did enjoy shooting this kit, and it works great with the Remington Goldens, CCI Mini-Mags, and other high velocity ammo.  Standard velocity ammo is not recommended.  Shooting accuracy of this kit is more than acceptable, and I have done 50 yard plinking with the Goldens with good success.

Items included: 

1 Slide with factory Glock Sights
1 .22 LR Caliber Barrel with approximately 1000 rounds down the pipe.
1 Guide Rod & Spring
3 Ten-Round capacity Mags

Entertaining offers for the entire package only.  I will not break up the package, its an all or nothing deal.  For the right price, I may have another bucket of bullets to sweeten the deal.

All serial numbers match and it has a chrome lined barrel, a polished chrome bolt and a pinned muzzle brake.  It has had approximately 80 rounds thru it and has been ""Battle Zeroed"" at 25 yards, so the rear sight when adjusted will produce good results at any range.  Or one can use the military method of under and over aiming based on the battle zero.  Comes with everything you see in the pictures.  The pictures really do not do justice to this rifle.

I also have a new factory Sig Sauer laser that can be negotiated into the price. The laser is very small in size and attaches directly under the barrel. You can see the laser in the pictures.

I may consider a trade for a Ruger Mark III target pistol with 7 inch barrel or possibly a full size 1911 pistol.

First introduced in 2000, nearly 300,000 CompM2 sights are now in use by many Armed Forces including elite Special Forces around the world. The CompM2, also known as the M68/CCO (when used by US forces), is the standard sight for the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as well as the armed forces of many NATO countries. Due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision device (NVD), the CompM2 is ready for use around the clock. The CompM2 holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, the CompM2 is completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2,5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use the CompM2.

I am having to clear some space in the cabinet and have 3 pieces of the collection up for sale/trade. I am looking for either cash, Mosin Nagants, or German Mausers.

1) 1944 Turkish K. Khale 8mm Mauser. Typical Turk mis-match. One of the smoothest actions that I've ever had. It passes the bullet test with plenty of room to spare. Strong lands with shine, and darker grooves with very light frost in places (unfortunately standard for many Turks). It does have a cleaning rod, though no bayonet or sling. Stock has only a few minor marks on it, and shows darker in spots from honest handling. Bluing is ~90-95% **has excellent head spacing** Asking $300

2) Early 1980s pre-ban Norinco import SKS with spike bayonet. All matching. Only ~400 rounds through it. Still has cleaning kit in stock, but missing cleaning rod. Asking $400

3) Mauser 1908 Brazilian long rifle, mfg - Deutsche Waffen UND, Munitionsfabriken Oberndorf aN, in 7mm Mauser, original matching numbers on barrel and bolt. Still retains capture screws. 80% overall blue, very light beginnings of patina developing on floor plate, trigger guard, and receiver/bolt. Otherwise, receiver is still in the white. It has a strong Brazilian Star crest, very good ++ bore-bright & shiny-strong lands and grooves. No import mark but no cleaning rod. Very good walnut stock with a German-style ring for bolt dis-assembly rather than the standard disk, has the usual dings and dents but still solid. Slight damage, likely from moisture, at the top of the butt plate. **good head space and no import mark**Asking $400"
