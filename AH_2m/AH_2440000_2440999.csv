This listing is for a very used but great shooting Jennings 22 lr pistol. this gun has heavy finish wear, but has been tweaked so it will actually shoot golden bullet and thunderbolt rather reliably. Most of these only will feed the real high velocity stuff. I would really prefer to trade this instead of sell, but since a value is needed i gave one. This will come with the gun itself, one mag, and the little nylon mag pouch. For the right trade offers I could include ammo or other extras on top. All this gun really needs is a decent cleaning, or just shoot it like it is. I had it at the range tuesday and didnt have any real problems at all out of the 300 rounds of thunderbolt I put through her. Shoot any offers or questions to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal"

For sale, a Sig P220 Military threaded barrel.  I purchased this gun from Bud's Gun shop in July of 2013.  You will receive all paperwork, original box, P220, two 10rd magazines and original Hogue G10 grips and lock and key.   

I sent the gun to Sig to have the feed ramp polished, they polished the upper and lower ramps. I've fired about 750 rounds through the gun.  A joy to shoot with a suppressor.  I am selling because I am trying to save up for my Pizza truck business and I need cash.  No trades at this time, just cash.

I will not leave Gilbert AZ to sell this gun.  
I can't meet you in Flagstaff (175miles away), seriously someone asked.
I will not meet you at 10pm at Home depot, yes someone asked.
I cannot mail you the gun to Ohio and pay with paypal, yes someone asked.
Please be ready to prove to me that you are an Arizona resident, I cannot sell to an illegal immigrant or non-resident, yes someone tried.  

If I can't sell this gun I'm going to donate it to the Police.  When you donate guns to the police people start to lose control of society.  When people lose control of society you have to flee the city and live by a fire in the desert.  Don't make me donate this gun.

This will be an in person sale, using american dollars, no pesos, riyals, shekels, dinars, baht or pieces of paper with the words I OWE YOU written on them.

As you can see in the pictures, a long chamber Krink style flash hider was spot welded on the barrel end to make it legal length of 16 inches. The actual barrel length without the legalizing tube is 10.5 inches. The wood was sanded and stained then coated with 3 urethane clear gloss coats (bottom pic)! The Underfolder is tight and locks up in both positions very nicely! If you choose to legally SBR it, all that is needed would be a 1 minute grind with a dermal of the small spot weld to remove it. It is a genuine M92 Krinkov Yugo factory virgin kit that was put together on a correct 1.5mm Nodak Spuds M92 Krink Receiver by Red Jacket Firearms (top pic when I got it back from them)! I have ONLY fired two 30 round mags through it sense I had it built by Red Jacket just to test it out! All 60 rounds fired wonderfully without any problems at all!! It has a deep base sound unlike any other AK when fired. This is an awesome AK and truly one of a kind, it is unmatched in quality hands down! These are collector item Krinkov AK-47s that are very hard to come by! Virgin Kits alone will run you $800-$900 without a receiver and build costs for in stock sites (if you can find one at all)! As you can see in the picture with a Romanian WASR 10/63 the Krinkov (top) is absolutely a beautiful work of art for an AK. This is not an M92 ""pistol"" by CAI...this Krinkov is the real deal and worth every penny of what I am asking! 
     It will come with a hard case, Yugo military factory sling, cleaning tube kit and a Yugo military mag carry pouch. I added a small Magpul rail in between the rear sight and the cover hinge for a micro red dot (not included). Sorry, as per the B.S. Colorado magazine Ban law I can't give any complete mags with it...however I have two Complete Tapco 20 round mag ""repair"" kits that I will throw in with it. The 20 round tapco mag repair kits come each with a magazine body, spring, floor plate and follower (so that you can repair every part your pre-owned ban magazines with.) I am fairly firm on the price and am not looking for trades. 
    If you are interested you can respond to this add and I will give further contact details on which gun store we can meet at. You must be legal to own it period! This is my baby and I hate to see it go but Christmas has drained me. If you know what a Krinkov AK is then you know what they are worth, I won't except low ball offers, serious offers only!Thanks for looking!  $1500 OBO!!"

Item 4A (305gr. Hard Cast gas Checked LFN) is designed for super deep penetration on large game. The big flat nose keeps the bullet penetrating straight and thus deep. You can expect a good three + feet of penetration in normal flesh and bone. The flat nose also does considerably more damage than a round nosed type of bullet as the flat nose cuts and smashes it way through living matter, while round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing much less damage along the bullet’s path and achieving more shallow penetration due to getting sideways while “slipping and sliding” through matter.
You’ll note my below velocities from over-the-counter revolvers and rifles.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. 
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. 
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. 
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. 
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

DESCRIPTION:	 	 	 
The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. 

The Nanos extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nanos magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. 

The Nanos sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. 

Made in The U.S.A.

Id say gun is in like new condition almost perfect. Can't say that I know of a scratch on it. It eats any ammo you put through it and is far more accurate than a traditional AK. It has selectable gas ports and it comes with a sig red dot. I also have the sig rail sections for it. And sig hard case and original mags.

Operations Command, Detachment One (MCSOCOM Det-1) 1911 pistol
for sale. These were specially made and procured for MCSOCOM Det-1
upon the unit's activation in June 2003. The unit was eventually disbanded
before Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command (MARSOC)
activation in 2006, and Kimber offered members of the unit an
opportunity to buy a few through Kimber before being deactivated.
Approximately 375 of these pistols were ever produced and roughly 110
of them still remain in the USMC arsenal, the rest were sold to the
members of the unit. This is one of the rarest 1911 pistols ever produced.
This has the ""DET1-3XX"" (serial numbers) and ""US Military Property
USMC"" markings on them. ""NO OTHER"" 1911 in history has ""EVER""
been produced and stamped with ""US Military Property USMC"" markings
on them and on top of that, this was a very small production run. Look it
up and research it for yourself, these already are hard to find (especially
NIB/NF condition) and sought after by serious gun collectors. You can
confirm that these are authentic by contacting Kimber. Per Kimber, this
one was manufactured 3/30/2006. You'll get the pistol + 1 Kimber
magazine, 1 authentic colored patch, an extra set of Black Gunner G-10
grips, original Kimber case with the “USMC” and “DET-1” stickers with
matching serial number on the case, and the unit letter from the Base
Commander at Camp Pendleton. This one is considered “factory correct”,
meaning that it does not have the added Dawson rail. Not $12,500.00
Not $10K, Not $7500.00, Not $5K   Asking $4500.00"

This is also the one that has the loaded chamber indicator (nice) as well as the manual external safety.  A lot of guys are turned off by that, but just keep it off if it bothers you.  Its disengagement is opposite of most guns so that it will not automatically turn the safety on when drawing under stress.  I like having the ability to put it on safety when I'm not carrying it.  These are next to impossible to find.  I paid $758 plus tax, shipping and FFL.  I'm looking for $700.  Comes with box, two magazines etc.  Can send pics upon request."

It has a modest appx 3000 round count, having been through two 2-day Basic Carbine courses, and has never had so much as a hiccup. It has been run hard at class, but never abused in any way. For those who know LWRCI rifles, 3000 rounds is barely breaking the gun in, as the barrels have a 20,000+ round life expectancy. This rifle comes completely ready to go for any tactical or defensive use, missing only an optic.

FYI, this is an older generation rifle with the two piece BCG. Included is a complete second BCG, so you need not ever worry about upgrading or damage to the primary BCG, though I cannot find evidence of an LWRC BCG failing.

Upgrades and extras included:
Standard (not OTB mod) complete 2-piece BCG
Spare Piston Spring
Samson Evolution 15"" rail
Samson Evolution Sling mount
Tactical Link Z-360 rear sling mount
VTAC wide padded sling
Magpul AFG 1st generation, stippled
Magpul MOE pistol grip, stippled
Magpul MBUS
IWC Drop Wing Scout Light mount
Surefire M600C Scout Light with pushbutton tailcap

Again, no optic or magazines are included. Everything you see in the pictures (except the magazine) is included. Also, the Team America patch has been replaced with a green and black US flag patch. This was added to the rail after the first class, as my grip position is right over the gas block and got quite hot. The patch gives an insulated point of contact for those using more of a c-clamp grip.

With a base asking price of only $1900, additional upgrades to this gun add up to a total of just over $2900. I'm asking $2200 face to face through an FFL in Northern Virginia. If anyone has any questions, please send me a message."

This knife goes on ebay for 250 to 340 dollars, look for yourself. Can send you more detailed pics if you are interested.."

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

This is a package deal and a pretty good one I think.

42 inch flat screen insignia TV. Has dual HDMI inputs, computer input and auxiliary input as well. Had for a little over two years and have not had an issue with it at all except that one speaker is kinda getting fuzzy but that problem has been solved with the next item on this package deal.

LG Smart Surround Sound system. Has five speakers and a sub-woofer that is extremely loud. I've never been able to crank it all the way up because of neighbors so it has been very gently used. Has wireless internet access and has netflix and a few other apps already on it so you can watch movies streaming online or watch your blue rays of DVD's as well. Also has an Ipod dock so you can plug in your phone or whatever else you have.

Last is a TV stand. I made on small cutout at the bottom of the back piece to run HDMI cords and other wires but aside from that it's in the same shape as when I got it.

The pictures are of the TV and TV stand minus the soundbar in one and the other is of the surround sound system minus the shoes and glass stand.

Also included is a remote start system, brand new and unused

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.
