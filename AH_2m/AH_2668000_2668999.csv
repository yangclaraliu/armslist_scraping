About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun.

This is also the same model that is standard for military units such as the 10th Mountain and Stryker divisions not to mention it is the selected model by ATF, FBI, and the DEA.

Due to the EoTech having the dot within a 65 MOA circle reticle nothing is faster on targets up close.  I have found that I am able to quickly and easily hit a 10"" plate offhand at 300 yards with the central 1 MOA dot (match ammo in a 1/2 minute capable rifle holding 4-5 inches over with a 50 yard zero). This model, though not a true QD, will mount in seconds without tools and if placed on the same slot as the one used to zero will return to zero (I have never been able to detect a zero shift at the distances it's intended for which is 0-200 yards).

This unit has been on my training rifle for several years and it has the nicks and scrapes to prove it. Even though it shows that it has been used it functions in every way as it should. That is why people who put their lives on the line use these. 

This model EoTech sells for $569 new. $300 is my price and I believe that it is very reasonable.  If you are thinking about a lowball offer don't wast your time, I will not respond.  I am generally not interested in a trade but I have been offered items in the past that have changed my mind.

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

She was walking down the center of the road on Thursday morning (Feb. 6).  She is wearing an olive drab colored dog collar with no tags, of course.  We've called the shelter, animal control, Greeneville Sun, neighbors, etc. and so far no luck locating her owner.  We fear that she was abandoned and she's too nice of a dog to turn in to be destroyed.  We already have 2 dogs and 2 kittens, so a third dog is a little too much for us right now.  The dog shows no signs of aggression whatsoever, but she is very excited around the kittens.  She'd be great in a home with a little bit less going on than in ours.  She has been introduced to our two labs and she hasn't snapped or growled at them.  She is already learning to ""sit"" and ""stay"".  She seems very trainable.  We estimate her to be pretty young; maybe 2 years old; tops.  She is in heat right now and needs to be spayed.  If you are interested in adopting her and you can't afford to get her spayed, I will help out.  It's worth it to me to get her into a good home.  Please call or text Matt @ (732)21three-7ninefour6.

This is magazine extension is not legal for resale in Colorado. We will ship to any state where it is legal. Check out the features and specs below:

XRAIL System is an auto index loader which expands the round capacity of your shotgun. 
XRAIL System - Compact Versions 
•Black Nylon tubing, hard coated black annodized aluminum housing 
•Load capacity up to 14 + 1 rounds (13 + 1 Benelli)
•Weight - 2 lbs empty
•Ammo size - 2 3/4"" only
•Recommended: Barrel length of 22"" or longer for XRAIL to be flush with end. XRAIL Systems on barrels less than 22"" will function as designed, but we do not recommend due to safety reasons as the XRAIL System will stick out past end of gun: x = (22 - barrel length of your gun) inches. 

** If your gun is new and never had a magazine extension on it, it may have tabs in the mag tube that will need to be removed. These tabs would need to be removed if any magazine extension system was added on the gun.  

•Lubricate the bolt carrier rails with 3-4 drops of good lubricant and dry cycle the action 25-30 times before firing. Reapply the oil every 100 -200 rounds. 

 Note - By switching to a light recoil spring (we tested one from Wolf®) we were able to see consistent performance using lower dram ammunitions that varied gun by gun. Knowing your gun and your style of shooting will help you determine which ammunition will perform best for your needs

This has the McMillan copied stock with factory digital camo, an oversized, tactical bolt knob and fluted bull barrel. I have put about 1,000 rounds through this rifle as I used it to train in place of my McMillan stocked model 12 in 308. I've become quite proficient with it and recently purchased a Magnum Research built 10/22, so I no longer need the rifle. 

The rifle sells new for $450 plus tax. I'm asking $350 for the rifle with rings and bases, or $500 as it sits with the scope and Caldwell bipod. I may negotiate a bit on cash, but trade value is a firm $500.

It has a 18.5 inch barrel and all internal components as well as a pistol grip and synthetic stock.  The only problem that would prevent it from working and functioning correctly is the trigger has the plastic clips broken on the front.  This is a common problem for mossbergs apparently- no big deal on mossbergs today just send it to the factory and they can fix it.  In the interest of full disclosure you cannot go out and buy a new trigger for it and install it because it is an older type of trigger no longer made by mossberg (or so they tell me, might be wrong).  It has been collecting dust and I am just looking to trade it for something cool.  If you have one of the old westernfield guns and want some backup parts it would be perfect for that.  Everything except the trigger as far as I know is a stock mossberg 500 part (see pictures of internals), so if you need a parts gun or want to convert you hunting gun to a self defense gun,these will do the trick.  I'm just curious if anybody has anything cool out there they might want to trade for it.  Im interested in guns, ammo, all types have my concealed and can add cash for the right deal.  I can ebay all the internals for parts and probably make asking price for the whole gun, but that would take time I don't want to waste.  If you need the stock, pistol grip, and the barrel, then you could make money just selling the left overs.    Offers certainly entertained.  Thanks for looking."

More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it's a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America's most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. This latest addition to our world-famous line of lever-action repeaters was built with the traditional deer hunter in mind. Like its predecessors, it's both lightweight (just 7 to 8.3lbs.) and maneuverable (39"" long), - the perfect combination for hunting in dense timber and heavy brush.

Like every Henry rifle, it's 100% American made, with its select American walnut stock and forearm, it is a masterpiece of finely crafted gunsmithing. The Henry H009 has a steel receiver and a round blued steel barrel that is machined with state of the art multiple groove rifling.

Our lever gun offerings have progressed from .17 and .22 caliber rimfires, to pistol cartridge centerfires and in 2011 to the most popular deer-hunting caliber of all - the .30-30. Now for 2012 we are introducing a new model chambered for a famous cartridge capable of handling even the largest game in North America. That's right: We now make .45-70 lever actions!

Introduced by the U.S. Army in 1873, this cartridge was first known as the .45 Government. As it made its way into commercially produced firearms the name .45-70 appeared, because it was loaded with a 70 grain blackpowder charge with 405 and 500 grain bullets. Virtually all rifle making companies of the late 19th century chambered their single shots and lever actions for the .45-70. As those companies and their rifles faded away, the .45-70's popularity did not. Factory .45-70 ammunition has been cataloged continuously since 1873 but never in the variety of loadings available now, in the 21st century. They range from 405 grain lead bullet, low-velocity loads for deer hunting and target shooting to high-velocity 300 to 400 grain jacketed bullet ones meant for large game.

Our new Model H010 .45-70 can handle them all. Its receiver is blued steel fitted with an 18.43"" round barrel underneath and a tubular magazine of four-round capacity. Its pistol-grip buttstock and steel-capped forend are crafted of beautiful American walnut and cut with checkering to provide a sure grip. The buttstock wears a soft rubber pad to help shooters handle .45-70 recoil from a 7.08 lb. rifle. The model H010 will be factory issued with XS Ghost Ring rear peep sight with blade front. Because the receiver is drilled and tapped, scope mounting is an easy option.

If you need a handy yet powerful lever gun capable of fast repeat shots in the bear country of Alaska, or just a short, light rifle for deer hunting in the mountains of Pennsylvania, our new Model H010 will provide the accuracy and reliability you can count on.

I'm willing to negotiate a little bit but i'm not in any real need to sell so please no low ball offers. These Russian gems should do nothing but raise in value being at any moment they can become illegal to import. I'll only deal with Ohio residence with a valid I.D. that are legally allowed to own firearms. CCW's will take priority.

This rifle was built in Izhevsk, Russia (and this is stamped on the receiver) at the Izhmash Factory in Izhevsk (SAIGA brand) - the same factory that builds AK-47s and 74s for the Russian Government - and was imported by Arsenal, Inc. of Las Vegas. I purchased this rifle new in July of 2012 and have fired 360 rounds through it. Like all of my firearms, I have cleaned the rifle meticulously after each range outing. The finish on the rifle remains in perfect condition except for slight wear at the magazine well. The rifle has a cold-hammer-forged (CHF) barrel with a chromed bore and chamber. The rifle does have the side accessory rail for mounting optics. The rifle has the traditional Warsaw-length stock. The rifle has the traditional two-stage trigger which I have always found to have a very clean break and positive reset. I have made no modifications whatsoever to the rifle and like all Arsenal rifles it has matching serial numbers for all numbered components. I have never experienced a single malfunction with the rifle and there is nothing wrong with it; I am selling the rifle to help fund an IWI Tavor.

Included with the rifle is:
-OD Russian Military Sling (sold by Arsenal)
-Arsenal front-sight adjustment tool
-60 rounds of 7.62x39 (WPA brand)
-6 magazines (1 Arsenal 10 round magazine; 1 polymer Tapco magazine; 4 polish steel magazines (two of which are unused and still in original packaging) - all magazines were purchased brand new)

The two-tone look and new custom grips rounds out the build to create a thing of beauty. Nearly any gun can be customized. (Glock slides CAN be nickel plated or blued.)
