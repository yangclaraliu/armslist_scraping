I am leaning toward wanting a billet lower, but I will consider any offers.  I have zero interest in dpms, bushmaster, anderson, spikes, etc that you can find everywhere.  If you offer these or anything poly, no offense but you probably wont get a reply unless you are asking for quite a bit less than retail.  I have cash, or I have a few trade items like a ruger LCP and a complete color filled spikes punisher lower with punisher magpul grip and trigger guard"

The magazine capacity is 4 for standard calibers, 3 for belted magnum calibers, and 2 for WSM calibers. Unfortunately, all of the BAR Mk. II triggers that I have ever tried are creepy and too heavy; this is something that the factory should correct.

The top of the line Safari model has an engraved, forged steel receiver and a genuine walnut stock and forearm with generous areas of diamond pattern cut checkering. All metal surfaces are highly polished and deep luster blued, and the wood has a beautiful high gloss finish. The Safari has the best lines, best finish, and is by far the most attractive BAR Mk.

Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.  Stocks on the NHM-91 are of a one-piece thumbhole design with integral pistol grip, and are thicker and longer than the standard AKM/AK-47 buttstock the NHM-91 buttstock lacks a separate pistol grip, though the rifle may be retrofitted with a separate buttstock by simply cutting off the lower portion of the stock and grip with a band saw, OR install a third party stock and pistol grip then fitting a new pistol grip. Like its RPK counterpart, the NHM-91 does not come equipped from the factory with a bayonet lug. However, the front of the barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector. By removing the thread protector, a muzzle brake can be fitted.  Nice shooter, do not really want to sell but need to fund another rifle so this one and two others must go.

The lower on this is a Core 15 lower with trigger work. The grittiness in the trigger has been removed and this has a very nice smooth trigger pull that you will see on many more expensive rifles. The stock grip was removed and a CAA Tactical grip was installed. The front and rear back strap on the grip can be changed to the shooters hand size. The stock on this rifle is a Magpul UBR, the front quad rail is a 12 inch floating aluminum rail. The barrel is 16 inch 1/9 twist Sota Arms chrome moly barrel with a standard cage flash hider. This rifle has a carbine length gas tube. The bolt carrier group is also from Sota Arms. This rifle comes with one windowed Magpul magazine with a 3 pack of helpers. 

When we were putting the floating grips on we did scratch the retaining ring. The scratch is very minor and can be seen below in the pictures. We have deducted some money from the price due to this minor flaw. Again all parts on this are new. 

Please contact us with any questions or if you would like to see more pictures.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

The most famous of all Weatherby Rifles is the Mark V Deluxe. The most distinctive feature of any Weatherby rifle, and especially the Deluxe, is its unique Monte Carlo stock, designed specifically for powerful magnum calibers. Its comb slants down from back to front so that recoil moves the comb away from the shooter's face. Weatherby Deluxe stocks incorporate a cheek piece and a small amount of cast-off for quicker and more precise mounting. The butt area is generous, and the recoil pad is top quality. The forearm is cleverly shaped and tapers in three dimensions for a very secure grip under heavy recoil. The bottom of the forearm is essentially flat so that it is easy to shoot from a rest. Weatherby's wood stocks are reinforced with a steel bar in the pistol grip, and steel pins are located throughout the action mortise and epoxied in place to increase structural integrity.

The unique Weatherby stock was designed to look good, but also to minimize the recoil of powerful rifle cartridges. My impression, as the owner of a trio of Weatherby Deluxe magnum rifles, is that the weight of the rifle combined with the well shaped Weatherby stock really does minimize the effect of recoil. I find the Weatherby more pleasant to shoot from a bench rest than any other production bolt action rifle of comparable power.

The Mark V Deluxe features a select Clara walnut stock with a rosewood forearm tip and grip cap set off by line spacers made from thin slices of maplewood. The pistol grip and forearm are checkered in a French skip-line point pattern, and there is a maplewood diamond inlay in the pistol grip cap. A durable high gloss finish shows off the wood to maximum advantage.

It is a strikingly handsome stock, but the careful observer will also note that the inletting and bedding are very precisely done. There are no wood to metal gaps, and the barrel is not free floating.

The Deluxe action is polished and metal work receives the famous high luster Weatherby blue. In 2006 the Mark V Deluxe was offered in Weatherby Magnum calibers .257, .270, 7mm, .300, .340, .30-378, .416, and .460. Cartridge capacity is 3+1 for most calibers and 2+1 for Weatherby Magnum calibers based on the huge .378 case. The Deluxe is a very classy rifle, and a rather expensive one. MSRP in 2006 starts at $2063 for calibers from .257 to .340, and runs $2428-$2853 for calibers based on .378 case.

Along with the Walther I have 10-15 miscellaneous critical defense rounds, a like new Passport Shoulder holster and a like new Ankle Holster. This side arm is is decent shape for being my daily carry for the past two years. The bluing on the slide is in great shape, the composite lower is clean and scratch free. The action is smooth and shoots phenomenally. Now for the negative, while out in the field shooting the white dot in the front sight seems to have been dislodged and was not recovered, other than that it was a great weapon for CCW or home defense or just for a day of shooting. 

Secondly I have a Stevens Auto Model 310A .12 ga pump, its a Mossberg 500 clone. It is in pretty decent shape. It has been modified for home defense, the barrel has been shortened to flush with the magazine tube and it has a Houge pistol grip with sling attachment slot running on the top. The factory stock and hardware is included, the stock has a couple scratches on the right side (shown in photos). This Weapon has less than 60 rounds through it, action is smooth and cleaned. The end of the barrel has some tool marks from where it was cut but when your clearing a room or throwing rounds down range its about performance, not aesthetics.

It has been carried a bit so it has a few light marks and a little wear on the bluing of main spring housing and where the safety and slide release rub the frame but nothing major or photographable to speak of. Any shiny spots in the pics is Slide Glide Lube.

The sights are original and the tritium is starting to dim a bit. I had a magwell on it at one time and put a set of blue Carbon Creation grips on it. Magwell has since been put on another of my 1911's and in it's place is a blued metal Wilson Combat mainspring housing. I have thr factory grey plastic mainspring housing which is included. I'm not sure where the factory wood grips went.

I have the original factory box and advertising literature but no idea where the owners manual went.

It has 1 factory 7rd mag and I will include the 8rd Wilson Combat mag pictured.

I dont have any particular trades in mind but know what it is worth. Any trade offers +/- cash should include the cash figure.

Mainly interested in other handguns, I have enough hunting bolt actions but may consider a smaller caliber rifle or custom rifle of equal value with +/- cash as needed.

The G33 3x Magnifier from EOTech offers all the features of the Gen II magnifiers with some outstanding additions. This ruggedly built magnifier transforms your EOTech Holographic Weapon Sight into a lethal medium range optic at the flip of a finger. The G33 features a revolutionary Switch to Side mount that keeps the magnifier in place with a rock solid detent and when a sudden CQB situation arises, with the flip of a hand, the detent will disengage and re-engage when the magnifier locks into place out of the line of sight. With an updated appearance and the same top end quality you expect from EOTech, the G33 is the ultimate red dot and holographic sight magnifier. It offers ample eye relief, features finger adjustable windage and elevation adjustments, wider field of view, adjustable diopter for precision focus and is more compact and light weight than the G23 magnifier. The G33 works with all EOTech units and includes a 7mm riser to accommodate raised sights."

534,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2762534,For Sale:  Mag Tactical MG-G4 AR-15 (Flat Dark Earth/Tan) with Midwest Industries handguard and other high quality parts,"South Nashua, Nashua, New Hampshire","$ 1,500","Listed On: Tuesday, May 20, 2014",Rifles,no type,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Hello, and thank you for viewing my listing.  I am listing my MAG Tactical Systems G4 AR-15 style rifle.  This is a rifle I built up myself, and I love shooting it.  It is one of my favorite rifles I have ever owned.  That being said, I am always looking to change things up and try out new things, so I have decided to put it on the market.

This is a fairly light AR-15, much lighter than most you are going to find at your local gun shop.  This is primary due to the MAG Tactical MG-G4 lower receiver, which is advertised as being 35% lighter than your standard AR-15 lower receiver.  The Midwest Industries SS-2 handguard is also very light and smooth, with removable rail sections to allow you to put accessories where you need them.  Per my bathroom scale, it weighs 6.4 pounds (unloaded).  

I also built this rifle to be (mostly) ambidextrous, with the Troy Industries ambidextrous selector switch, MagPul B.A.D. Lever, and the Rainier Arms Ambidextrous Raptor Charging Handle.  The only non-ambidextrous function is the magazine release.

Additionally, this rifle has a high quality Geissele SD-3G flat trigger in it, making every trigger pull a smooth dream, with awesome reset.  If you have shot a mil-spec AR-15, you know the trigger can be a little rough - the Geissele trigger makes shooting an AR a hundred times better.

The Troy front and rear folding sights are some of the best on the market, but this gun would be even better with a cool optic (maybe something like a lightweight Aimpoint Micro?).


Here are the rifle specs -

This rifle is (in my opinion, obviously) awesome, and really fun to shoot.  I am asking $1,500.00 (OBO) for the rifle, for sale face to face in New Hampshire.

I am willing to entertain offers, but please *think* before you send an offer.  I will not take $800.00 for the rifle – if you want a cheap plinking rifle, look elsewhere.  I am not interested in your rusty snowmobile.  I want cash or firearms related items ONLY.  In fact, I am specifically looking for the following:

-	Heckler & Koch P30 in 9mm with LEM trigger
-	Bushmaster ACR, enhanced, preferably in Coyote
-	FN SCAR 16S, preferably in Flat Dark Earth
-	Qualify manufacture (except Kimber) 1911 in 9mm or .45 ACP

I am also always looking for anything firearms related that is interesting or unique.  I am interested almost exclusively in modern firearms, so a newer .308 bolt gun might get my attention, but an old .30-30 lever action probably will not.

I am willing to add, or work with, any deal to make it work.  I have other items I can add to include slings, gear, optics, lights, magazines, and/or ammunition.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.  Again, thank your for looking and reading through my listing."

I've decided to put it up for sale because I want either a longer barrel AR or a M1A. Got this not to long ago and it shoots great. I've taken it out to the range and put about 200 rounds through it with no issues whatsoever. As it is pictured in the first picture is the original setup minus the flip-up sight. I have instead added a UTG Model 4/16 Complete Match-grade Rear Sight which works great for it. The only other part I've added is a MAGPUL ambi-bolt release. As it is pictured in the first picture I'm asking $1000 for the original setup.
 Here are the specs for the original setup:

Laser Engraving of Bushmaster 25th anniversary crest on the magazine well of the lower receiver, Special 25th anniversary ""XXV"" serial numbers, Flat-top (V Match) Upper Receiver. Nickel plating on ejection port cover, forward assist plunger, pivot and take down pins, magazine catch, trigger and bolt catch, B.M.A.S. solid four-rail free-floater forend with swivel sling stud, 9 rubber rail sure-grips, 16"" fluted, chrome-line, chromemoly barrel with 11 degree competition crown muzzle and milled front sight base, B.M.A.S. flip-up front sight, Ace tubular skeleton-style stock. 

In the second and third picture I have the full setup, with and without the scope. The extras I have added are as follows:
1. MAGPUL PTS AFGTM Angled Fore-Grip (Black) FDE
2. Magpul MIAD Gen 5.56 Receivers Black 1.1 Grip Kit FDE
3. MAGPUL ACS CARB STOCK MIL-SPEC BLACK FDE
4. Magpul XT Rail Texture Panel, Flat Dark Earth in one piece and four small pieces
5. UTG 30mm SWAT 3-12X44 Compact IE Scope with AO Mil-dot, 36 Colors EZ-TAP with 1'riser mount.
6.UTG Tactical OP Bipod - SWAT/Combat Profile Adjustable Height

All Extra parts are in perfect condition and really make the rifle look great. The Holographic sight in the picture is not included. For this full setup I'm asking 1500$ and will throw in all the original parts as well so you can configure it however you like. Also included is one FDE P-mag with either deal. Just to be clear I'm simply looking to sell to build/buy another setup and don't need to so I'll entertain offers/trades if they are of equal value. Feel free to email me for more pictures or text/call REDACTED to ask questions."

The gun shoots incredible (I've cranked maybe 100-125 rounds through it) and looks tough while doing it. 

// Below is the breakdown of what I have:
 • Taurus PT1911-AR Black: $645+tax (around $683)
• SigTac holster made specifically for this gun: $30 or so
• Hogue Grips + Extra magazine (8 rounder) + Wilson combat bolt buffer (cheap upgrade but it makes shooting it even better): $40 or so. 

I don't expect new prices on USED guns - but I typically just compare guns that are same in condition at the new prices, its just easier that way to compare the prices. I value this setup around the $700-725 range in trade. I'll list what I'd like in trade below - My main thing is just making sure were all happy if we do a trade. 

• Location: Berea - Not looking to make a deal too far away because of no shows. 
• Trade Value (again): Right around $700-725 or so range (I listed the prices of everything above)
• Condition of gun: Very lightly used as far as the appearance and functions right up there with my higher dollar 1911 (Sig) for performance. 

• For a cash sell i'd be at $625 on everything.

So im selling my rifle, and well I don't think ill be needing this guy anymore. Took him out to 1 range trip, less than 50 rounds id imagine. Anyways I bought it new and there's nothing wrong with it, I just figured cash or trades would do me better. Its a second focal plane scope with a Mil-dot reticle in moa and same with the adjustment knobs. Very clear glass. No scratches or anything. I literally bought this like maybe a month or two ago. The rings are Vortex precision med height rings. they are supposedly made by seekins precision but under Vortex's name. 

Scope cost $460.00 

Rings cost $130.00

Rear butler creek scope cover $10.00


Im asking $550.00 obo Im just trying to regain some of my money. 
No I will not part out. Everything was torqued down to manufactures spec.

Trades are welcomed, although cash is king.

Trades: Guns (no lever or bolt guns please), Other high quality scopes or red dots(eo techs? Trijicon? Aimpoint? Vortex viper pst 1-4 ?), Gear like a lbt 6094a in cb or what ever else, no china crap please. And depending on what you got, I may ask you to add cash or maybe ill add cash to make the trade even. Im open to anything.

Upper is machined from 7075-T6 forgings that are hard coat anodized for wear and scratch resistance meeting MIL SPEC

Barrels drilled, reamed and buttoned from 4140, 4150 Chrome Moly, Chrome Moly Vanadium per MIL –B-11595E or 
416 stainless gun quality steel then stress relieved prior to contouring and chambering. 

Twist rate is 1 in 9. The barrels are chambered in the highly desireable .223 Wylde and therefore chambered for and suitable for firing either the Nato 5.56 designation or the .223 Remington commercial round. 


The head space is set and the barrel is tested for straightness using a 6” drop pin gage. 

The steel barrel assemblies are Parkerized to eliminate rusting. Bolts machined from tool steel, hardened and tempered 
to provide maximum wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. 

Bolt carriers machined from 8620 gun quality steel, heat treated and tempered to maximize strength and wear characteristics then Parkerized to eliminate rusting. These work great with our complete lowers...

The barrels on these are made from 4140 cold rolled steel and are rated at a barrel life of approximately 150,000 rounds. They are very top end. 

They are not chrome lined as most AR-'s are not. Chrome lining on modern rifles is typically used where there is a high probability of corrosive ammo being used such as AK type rifles chambered for foreign calibers... 

Since chrome lining may slightly affect accuracy, and since most AR-15 rifles are designed with accuracy as a benchmark, 
and since virtually all .223 / 5.56 Nato is non corrosive...most AR manufacturers do not chrome line barrels.
