This one hails from the Cold War era, as evidenced by the ""made in west germany"" stamp on the side and DIANA logo on the receiver. These are no longer available and the build quality on the old DIANA rifles must be felt to be believed. I purchased this one used from B and B Supply in south Minneapolis and have tuned and rebuilt the piston with new grease and a new piston seals. This process involves mirror polishing the inside of the piston cylinder and reassembling the action with new grease, seals, etc. This gives the gun a very smooth and consistent power stroke. Additionally, I have installed a lighter weight Beeman muzzle brake (which required modification to outer barrel sleeve for fit), added a heavy duty scope base that can withstand the recoil of the spring piston and mounted a 3-9x 50 red/green illuminated reticle mil-dot scope. 48/52s have an adjustable trigger and an automatic tang mounted safety. Checkered Monte Carlo stock. Please contact me with any questions, rifle will sell with everything pictured, minus case. Will remove scope/base to sell separately if you already have one in mind, otherwise would like to sell as package.  Thanks!"

Both are recent vintage though 2012 and 2013.)

Premium price due to a few factors - sure, retail 92fs's go for less but consider...
1. ""Made in Italy"" vs. ""Made in USA"" - very hard to find the Italian made Beretta's these days since they stopped allowing them imported.  Big nostalgia factor!
2. Completeness and extra mags
3. Inox is VERY hard to find ""made in Italy""
4. Extra walnut grips - interchangeable on both but looks nicer on the Inox IMO.

Black is COMPLETE with box, papers, lock, 2 mags as well as serial number matched outside cardboard box.

Inox is MOSTLY COMPLETE  has the blue beretta box, papers in Italian, 4 mags, and extra set of maple Hogue grips, no lock. 

I love them both but curious what you might have to trade for them?  They were very hard to find.  I value them both at 900 each  based on the fact that you cannot get the made in Italy imports anymore very easily, the superb condition and the extra mags."

The trigger is nice but heavy. If you like you can watch many vids on how to get the heavy trigger down to a 3 pound trigger by simply replacing the trigger spring with a clicky style pen spring. I have done so and it makes a huge improvement but reverted it back to factory spring to sell.

It has beautiful wood. The Mum is scratched off but all other markings are flawless. It's from the 21st series of the Kokura Arsenal in 1940. The bayonet comes with the sheath and is also from the Kokura. The bayonets were serialized differently so there is no way of knowing whether they match. However it's in great all around shape. If you know your rifle history you know this was the first mass produced rifle with a chrome lined barrel. This isn't a 1945 last ditch version. It's a great piece to add to any collection. I also have 1 box of 7.7 JAP to go with it and a few boxes of brass. Text Sean at REDACTED or email if interested.

This stuff is round nose target profile, copper plated, high velocity ammo, specifically designed to feed reliably in semi-auto .22's that are finicky. (.22 ARs are known for being really picky about what ammo they will feed, and this ammo is designed specifically with those needs in mind) Like all of CCI's products, it is superior in consistency and accuracy to most other brands of rimfire ammo, especially when compared to the value packs from remington, winchester or federal. Asking $50 OBO, also open to trades, preferably gun, motorcycle or photography related, but will consider anything.

1 box Winchester .22 LR Sub-Sonic 40 grain truncated cone hollow points. These are the best sub-sonic pest control ammo you can get, they feature a softer composition paired with a MASSIVE hollow point... its wider than any other hollow point .22 I've ever seen, they are not really pointed at all, they're more like a hollow cylinder, lol. These are the only .22 ammo I use for hunting, their stopping power is that good. They are absolutely devastating on small game in a way that no other .22 ammo seems to be, possibly with the exception of CCI's hyper velocity 'segmented-HP' which is impossible to find and is noisy as hell. $15

1 box Remington .22 LR Sub-Sonic 40 grain Hollow Point. The standard sub-sonic ammo for plinkers. $10

This goes for everyone selling these. You guys are idiots. You can go buy one brand new for $539 at Fin Feather and Fur. Last time I checked guns didn't gain value when used and resold. 

Here's a good example. Look at the picture. Claiming it's only been test fired by Glock. That's a lot of residue for only 2 rounds fired. If he wasn't smart enough to clean the outside before taking the picture then you now he didn't field strip it and clean the inside either. Remember the phone number and don't get ripped off. People like this make the site a joke by reposting their overpriced guns everyday because they can't sell them. 

UPDATE - The guy saw this post because it's clean and ""never fired"" now in the new picture.  Looks like I'm not the only one who contacted him about his ad being a lie because he contacted me thinking I was someone else and saying he ""uploaded the wrong picture"" and it has been corrected. Does correcting it mean cleaning your used gun that claim has never been fired? I guess he must have another gen 4 that he took a pic of in the same box on the same table right? You failed again buddy."

This model is a decocker version of the basic CZ 75 B model. The decocking lever mounted on the left side allows the hammer to be easily lowered on a loaded chamber for a safe ""hammer down"" carry. CZ 75 B is used by more Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts). High capacity double column magazines. Hammer forged barrels. Ergonomic grip and controls. Unparallel accuracy, slide-in-frame design for better recoil control, 3 dot sighting system (Tritium night sights available). Smooth double action and crisp single action."

These were reconfigured into parade/honor guard rifles. They were nickel plated and made to look like the Philippine Constabulary rifles. Most have bad bores from firing blanks, but these are great, with a light grey color and shine. The Top one was made in 1902 and has a dovetailed front sight, has a circle P cartouche. The bottom one was made in 1903 and has a banded front sight, with a circle P cartouche and the # 10 on the top of the stocks wrist area. They both have the same thin leather sling in white. I was told the top one came from the American legion in Canton Ohio. These are not some garage made sporters with a 1000 rounds through them, they are clean , the nickel plating has protected the metal for decades. These are some of the last years for the krag. Both have a small crack in the hand guard. I have not fired these. I'm asking $600.00 each, send an offer. Need FFL or C&R with US postal money order or certified bank check for shipping.

This auction is for a NEW SUB-2000 9mm self-loading carbine.  It comes New in Box with one 17-round Beretta 92 / M9 magazine and the owner’s manual.  One of the best features of this carbine is that it uses standard Beretta (model 92 / M9) magazines, which are readily available, making this a perfect gun for Beretta handgun owners.  

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun.  The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range.  The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.  This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.  The SUB RIFLE-2000 has been developed from the SUB 9 rifle.  

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle.  The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear.  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.  The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection. 

Specifications:

Caliber:  9mm Luger
Weight unloaded lbs.: 4.0 lbs. 1.8kg
Length Open:  29.5""  749mm

This is a package deal, so I am not willing to sell just the rifle or just the ammo. Send me an e-mail if interested and I can send more pictures upon request. I may entertain cash offers if they are good.  I expect you to have a valid FOID and to fill out a proper transfer record per the FOID act (see back of FOID card).

For anyone who is curious, I am trading because I want something with a little more pop. I love this rifle and don't really want to sell it, but I already have a .223 so 5.45 is kind of redundant for me."

Unsure how many rounds have been through it. I'm selling this for my sister-in-law. The gun was a gift from her ex-husband and she wants it gone. 

This gun currently is selling for $329 - $360 online. Please remember this price doesn't include shipping (some ship free, most charge $25.00) & FFL transfer ($10-$20). Not to mention the week or two waiting for delivery. If you are lucky enough to find this model gun in a local store for these prices, you can add 8.5% in Charleston county ($30) for sales tax.  All this might sound like common sense but in my experience most people forget this when shooting out their low ball offers. 

PRICE IS FIRM!!! I am asking less then 99% of people selling this exact gun on the entire Armslist website. If I can't get $260 then I'll just keep it myself for a backup. So to all the ""low ballers"" save your offers."

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years. 

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers."
