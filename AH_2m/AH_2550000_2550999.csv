The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other p­istols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

The state of the art Vympel State Production plant is the manufacturer, that makes this ammo to the Golden Tiger specs. The plant is also a manufacturer of Russian Military ammunition, so you can rest assured you are receiving quality ammunition."

This is a WW2 Nazi German Mauser K98. The Karabiner 98 Kurz (often abbreviated Kar98k, K98, or K98k) was a bolt action rifle chambered for the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge that was adopted as the standard service rifle in 1935 by the German Wehrmacht. It was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser military rifles. Although supplemented by semi- and fully automatic rifles during World War II, it remained the primary German service rifle until the end of World War II in 1945. The dot code is the German Wartime code for Waffenwerke Bruenn, Bruenn Plant, Czechoslovakia. The nazi stamp is a Waffenamt (WaA) which was the German Army Weapons Agency mark.  It was the centre for research and development of Germany and also during the Third Reich for weapons, ammunition and army equipment to the German Reichswehr

SALES ON 300 BLACKOUT BRASS mixed headstamp lots $135/1000 
7mm mag and 300wsm brass $70/100 limited supply


I am currently located in central wi but have done a lot of business in the mid south. I used to work with K&A ammunition LLC and hope the reputation carries over

I am now running my own reloading components company(ghost munitions and supply) selling brass and bullets.

The Ghost munitions difference. At ghost munitions we shoot a lot and we know that brass prep sucks so we set out to offer the best prepped brass at a fair price after all don't we reload to save money? So why pay either a lot for brass or spend a lot of time processing it. Did I mention our customer service is amazing? 

PAYMENT OPTIONS

We normally do checks or postal money orders
however we also take paypal and are proud to announce we now accept visa and master card. via intuit go payment 

PACKAGING most of our brass is bulk packed but for small orders of 5.56, 300AAC blackout and 7.62X40 we will be offering ammunition boxes and trays free of charge it just seems to make sense to have somewhere to put your ammo once you loaded it we can do this on any caliber and quality for a small charge extra I just want to offer something extra for people that don't load a lot or are new to loading that might not have boxes 

For 1000 pcs orders it's about $20 extra for ammunition boxes not a bad investment at all cheaper than mtn cases

The magazine carriers are a 2 mag single stack carriers, 1 is a black Blackhawk polymer, the second is the factory 1911 polymer double mag carrier and the last one is a coyote tan 5.11 double magazine pouch with MOLLE attachments. The 1911 comes with the factory paperwork, most of the factory parts to keep as spares, a magazine loader, as well as the factory carrying case and aside from slight holster wear, the gun is fantastic.

This Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. This revolutionary precision rifle offers sub MOA long-range performance that others can only dream about. Its straight-line design allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots that can tame the beast when hunting large game.

This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

The Model 98B rifle's aluminum upper receiver boasts a full length M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.Bolt action repeater. Fully adjustable match grade trigger.

A month ago my girlfriend and I moved out of my parent's home with our 4 month old son. I come from a decent middle-class family and allowed my girlfriend to talk me into moving into a low income area, it was the worst decision of our lives. Gun shots can be heard every few days, fights in the cul-de-sac over who gave the mail man the best oral sex last night between the local women is a monthly occurrence, and every gas station owner in the area says they've been robbed at gunpoint at least twice.

I decided to go about posting this ad after some thug attempted to rob me at my car with a kitchen knife last Thursday night in a McDonald's parking lot. My girlfriend and I have tried a Maverick 88 at the range and the thing kicked her in the face and bruised my shoulder up pretty good, she refused to use it for any kind of defensive situation. We are now in search of preferably a semi-auto of both the rifle or shotgun variety to lessen the recoil, however, I will gladly consider any and all offers.

We're both 18 and we also only have about $200 dollars to spend, its the most we can save in a month and is quickly spent by the next month. If anyone would like to get rid of a rile or shotgun that's just collecting dust, is too small for you, won't sell for a reasonable price, or is just hurting your eyes to look at, I will buy it off of you if your willing to take $200 for it. I would prefer to meet during daylight hours in a public place and will show you proof of my age if needed. If you have any questions, I will gladly answer them."

From the factory:
The P-32 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

For sale or trade.
As I have heard it, there were only about 500 of these ever brought into the country.
Rifle has a heavy barrel with a 1/7 twist, flip up night sights, chromed bore, an adjustable gas system, bolt hold open, and an AR style flash hider. Will come with 7 mags, two sets of furniture (original wood with custom pistol grip, and Hogue handguard set-does not come with US Palm grip), and a soft paratrooper case. 
That was the good, here's the less good. The receiver is an NDS and was not finished to the same standard the Yugo parts were. It could probably use a cerakoting. 
Other than that, it's a tightly built rifle, shoots great, recoil is just about non-existent."

Based on the immense success of the original Nano, we decided to offer additional versions. The Boker Plus Nano broke new ground with its remarkable concept and design by David Curtiss. The Nano clearly shows that size and utility value are not always correlated. Due to its ingenious ergonomics, the Nano sits perfectly in the hand despite its compact size of just 4 3/4"", and can handle any cutting task with ease, while providing a superior grip. The structure of the Zytel scale enhances the slip resistance, and the plain edge blade of 440C stainless steel ensures comfortable handling with its large opening. An added bonus is the pocket clip - David Curtiss, who runs a company for water jet cutting systems, also supplies the same pocket clip for custom pieces. The sturdy steel handle features a frame lock mechanism and removable pocket clip (tip-up/tip-down carry). Blade length: 1 7/8"". Overall length: 4 3/4"". Weight: 2.9 oz.
