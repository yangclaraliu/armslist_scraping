Buffalo Classic Rifle
Big medicine for those born 100 years too late. The sporting tradition, American history and good ol’ fashioned quality craftsmanship come together in this big-bore rifle built to celebrate a legacy that began in 1871. Modeled after the Frank Wesson tip-up rifles that were first made in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1850s. Chambered for the 45-70 Gov't. cartridge, this rifle reflects true 19th century styling with antique color case hardening on the frame and a crescent butt plate. Its handsome American walnut stocks and fore-ends are accentuated by cut checkering.

Buffalo Classic Rifle
Traditional styling and aiming stability were foremost in its design. Offered in 45-70 Gov’t., its 32"" midweight barrel helps this big-bore cartridge develop full velocity and accuracy potential. It also provides the necessary sighting radius for long-range matches. The Williams receiver sight is complemented by a traditional globe-style target front sight with eight aperture inserts.

Cougar 8000 series pistols are recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. These pistols use a relatively rare rotating barrel locking system, in which the barrel rotates on recoil to unlock itself from the slide. The rotating motion of the barrel is controlled by the stud on its bottom, which follows the cam track in the steel frame insert.
The frame is made from lightweight aluminum alloy. The basic version of the Cougar pistol is the F model, with double action/single action trigger with exposed hammer, and ambidextrous safety/decocker."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

His words were ""Damn, you need to start building rifles"". I will post some groups to show this is a real rifle..... not just showing the best groups out of a year of benchrest.

This is an OUTSTANDING semi-auto precision rifle. This rifle has been to Woody's DMM match twice, and shot at my local range for a total of 400 rounds. I will provide load data to the buyer, but I am consistently pushing Hornady 178gr BTHP bullets from LC brass at 2740fps (this is the load used to create the groups in the pics). This Lothar Walther Var-Tac barrel is FAST! The LW50 stainless is harder that 416 and the velocities show it. The rifle has always been cleaned with MPro7 using a bore guide, rubber coated rod, brass jags and brushes. I also run MPro7 oils on the rifle.

The trigger is a Bill Springfield custom, the gas system is completely stock, but I have inserted a Tubb Weighted Carrier insert to slow the cycle rate down and help absorb recoil from the 7.62 and reduce brass abuse. I can meet a local buyer if serious to see rifle perform in eastern Gaston County.

This unit is a conversion for the Glock 17 handgun into a Pistol Chambered Carbine. It's been shot three times and was fun shooting every time. The only time it ever malfunctioned is when I fed it crap ammo (Blazer). It connects seamlessly with the Glock 17 Lower and obviously uses any Glock 9mm magazine (I prefer the factory 33 round mags.). The pictures show the unit having a red dot sight...that is not for sale, but any optic can be mounted to the M16 sight handle or the rail that the sights are mounted to. As stated, the sights are M16 style sights and are fully adjustable. Mech Tech requires that you purchase what they call the ""Glock Block."" It's essentially the device that makes the whole system work. I am including that device (seen in the last photo) for NO CHARGE. It will be included in the $375. It's been a fun firearm, but I'm looking for the extra cash to purchase an SKS. I'm knocking about $185 bucks off since it's been fired. $675 with the Glock Lower, if so desired. Will trade whole configuration for a Kel-Tec SUB 2000 9mm Carbine, or will consider trading the conversion for a complete upper assembly of G17 (Gen 3).

Bought this new, cleaned and lubed it. Has been in the safe ever since. Includes factory box and paper work. There is a timeless appeal to the Model 1887 lever action shotgun, and this latest rendering of the famed Winchester scattergun made by AmriSport Chiappa offers a great many modern-day advantages — some of which didn’t exist in the 1880s when the original Winchester was the most feared shotgun on the American Frontier. 

A true sawed-off shotgun with both a shortened barrel and cut down stock, is easy to maneuver in close quarters, and in a sudden encounter, presents less of an opportunity for an attacker to block or disarm by grabbing the barrel. The sawed off 1887 stock configuration also makes it easier to use a strong side butt stroke in close quarters self defense as there is no shoulder stock for an assailant to block and the you have the full force of your body behind that rounded off walnut knob. 

Given the exceptional quality of the Chiappa 1887 and its authentic detail, fit, and finish the most important difference between it and an original, aside from collector value, is the capability of loading this with modern ammunition. Beautiful blued steel, quality smooth walnut, and awesome craftsmanship. Quality materials and action make this in line with my Benelli shotguns. 

These actually work as compared to the cheap Chinese copies. This gun is perfect for zombies, cowboy action match, or for a badass home defense piece. Need money for another project. My loss is your gain. Good luck finding one of these anywhere else. 

This transfers as a regular shotgun as it has an 18.5 inch barrel although some mistake it for a sawed off. This is a 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shells. Holds five in the tube, one in the elevator, and one in the chamber. 

This is the gun from Terminator 2. Act now before I change my mind. 

From Chiappa: 1887 MARES LEG Item Number: 930-019 A fine version of the 1887 Lever Action Shotgun,with a capacity of 5 shots + 1 and a 18,5” smoothbore barrel. The 1887 Mares Leg features a walnut grip and forend, and color case hardening finish"

Included in this package are 5 magazines, the original grips, and the factory case.  This is a great gun that has long been trusted by the US military. 

From the Beretta website: 

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS. 
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them."

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.
A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.
Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

A favorite of many hunters and shooters, the Short Rifle (saddle ring)was fast to the shoulder, quick-swinging, lightweight and a pleasure to shoot. It was a favorite of the range rider who could snatch it from his saddle scabbard and fire faster than prairie lightning. The new Winchester® Model 94® Short Rifle has a compact 20"" deeply-blued round barrel and a straight grip walnut stock. It has a rifle-style forearm, black grip cap and a full-length magazine. It’s drilled and tapped for scope mounts, and a hammer spur extension is included with the rifle. The sights are traditional with a semi-buckhorn rear and a Marble Arms® gold bead at the muzzle. With the new Short Rifle Model 94 there’s a lot of fun waiting in the saddle, in the field or at the range.

The gun is full of extras. It is chambered in 5.45x39 and not in .223/556. The round has the same ballistics and is a fraction of the cost. The only reason I am selling is because I have two of the exact same gun and don't shoot enough to keep both of them. 

The upper is a piston system. The piston system and barrel have been treated with salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The bolt and bolt carrier have also been protected by using an ion bond finish. All this done from the Adams Arms factory. The way this upper is made allows for very little recoil when shooting. Makes for a very accurate shot. This has the magpul heat shields and magpul foregrip in FDE.

The Lower is a Rguns lower with a upgraded LPK for a real crisp pull. Butt stock is a magpul adjustable in FDE color. Also has FDE magpul hand grip, magpul b.a.d. lever, and fab defense mag well grip installed. 

The gun will come with a carrying case, 1 magazine, and roughly 500 rounds of ammo. I have shot this gun maybe a total of 100 rounds and shoots flawlessly. These uppers are very hard to come by and offer a great way to shoot a cheaper round since they will fit on any mil-spec AR lower. Asking $1500 obo. Email me for more info or pics"

Taurus 94 22S, L, LR 5"" Revolver - 9rd Blue: TI940051The ultra-compact 94 and 941 give you your choice of either .22 LR with a nine-round cylinder or the .22 Magnum with an eight round cylinder. We'll repeat that, 8 or 9 shots. This impressive innovation has become a favorite of shooters, writers and editors everywhere, as both the 94 and 941 feature single/double action triggers, adjustable sights and an extended ejector rod for faster reloading. Consider one for your nightstand, tackle box, or for endless plinking in the summer. 2-inch Ultra-Lite® models are also available.
Taurus Security System (TSS)
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

913,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2275913,For Sale:  ****CUSTOM STIPPLE WORK & COLOR FILL****,"STATESVILLE\CHARLOTTE, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 7, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"HEY GUYS 

We are now Offering custom frame work to the following
*polymer handguns
*magazines 
*knifes
*grips 
*rail covers
 If its polymer we can add a custom texture to it!!!! 

The process is called STIPPLING. 
This process is done my melting small devotes, holes , lines etc.. In the polymer this caused the edges of the holes,lines devotes to be raised giving texture.

 This is a permanent alternative to grip tape or the grips that slide over the handle. Grip tape eventually wears down and can be an hassle to remove and install new grip tape. It also isn't very eye appealing on some guns especially on FDE or OD green guns at least in our opinion.
 Doing this stippling to your weapon will give you flawless manipulation with it. If you think you can manipulate your weapon just fine under any situation try putting a small amount of soap and water on you handgun then try racking the slide or doing speed reloads. Even holding the handgun can become difficult. 
***(EXAMPLES)****

GLOCK 17 $50.00 
S&W M&P 40 (FULL SIZE) $50.00

*WE ARE OPEN TO ALL POLYMER BASED FIREARMS AND MAGS AS WELL AS KNIFE GRIPS AND SHEATHS...BASICALLY ANYTHING POLYMER THAT YOU WANT STIPPLED IT CAN BE DONE 
**************************************************************
We also offer color fill option. This is where I will fill in the engravings on the slide of a handgun with our custom Powder coating gear.
 We can also do AR15 etc etc.. If its an engraving we can fill it with color!!!

 In some instances the engraving depth isnt enough and won't come out as clean as the others..leaving a thin color rather than a nice bright clear color..
 so please send us pictures and we will let you how it will more than likely will turn out. Glock's and M&P's come out great. As do most AR lower receivers

Prices are to be determined by the type of weapon. So please call text or email with any questions...

There are many different ways to do the stippling so please email for a quote   
Thanks we look forward to earning your business 

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING ORDERS OUTSIDE OF OUR GENERAL AREA AT THIS TIME BUT STILL FEEL FREE TO CALL US TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE MAY BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT WITH SOMEONE IN YOUR AREA!!!!

* also as a special thank you for using us for your custom stippling work we invite you to try our color fill option for free (white only) unless we work another deal out
you do not have to accept the offer but it is free with any stipple work (a $20.00+ value!!!!!)

 Wheels are in good shape, some have a small ding or two right where the tires meet the wheel but nothing on the chrome part. The tires still have a lot of tread on it, I measured 9/32 and they come new with 12/32. These tire get great reviews for tire wear so I would guess they still have over 50,000 miles left on them.

 The tires new run around $225 (Wal-Mart) and I couldn't find the wheels for less than $400 each. So new would cost around $2500
