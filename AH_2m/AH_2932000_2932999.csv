The gun comes with one 6 round magazine, lock, and all factory literature. 

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

Up for sale is a rare Ruger sp101 in .327 Federal Magnum.  

With the .327 Federal Magnum you get much more than a 9mm or .38 Special in the same gun; you get six shots instead of five, and you get it at much less recoil than the .357. This gun can also safely shoot 32 Smith & Wesson, 32 Smith & Wesson Long, 32 H&R Magnums, and semi-rimmed .32ACP. 

I bought this new for the home but my wife thinks it is too much gun (I love it).  It comes clean with everything it came with new, all in original factory condition, including warranty card and original grips (has Hogue grips on it on). We did not even shoot a whole box (25) through it.  The below pictures were taken today, what you see is what you get.

Please email with questions, you must be 21 and Ohio resident with ID. I can't drive to meet you, and this is a cash deal.  Priced for quick sale and if you can find this model for less buy that one, this one's price is firm.  If this ad it up it is still available.

I removed the stuff that you want to customize on the rifle and to reduce price. This is a similar rifle issued to the DEA. it is built to last and insanely accurate. with my eotech i hit 25 cent sized groups from 100 yds, and the iron sights are dialed to me so it should be very little work for you to zero them to you. the rear sight is excellent and includes a 3 type view aperture. (small large, and ""three point pistol style"" sight options) I have only put 500 rounds through this which is nothing, considering the barrel quality. 

I'm selling all that is listed above for 1400 firm. medical bills suck. I will part the upper alone for 900. and if you are curious, this lists at 2,200. Rock River's are phenomenal quality.

the following are NOT included/or you can purchase for more
Eotech (500), magpul foregrip (25), flashlight rail mount (surefire style) (25)

I have 223, just ask how much you want and i'll give you a fair market price, and cheaper if you purchase it with the rifle.

I require a current CPL/WA Dl and bill of sale that says I transferred the firearm to you. I just keep a personal record that I sold it.

I am only making a local sale through FFL, no other offers. 

I am relocating to New York in July and it turns out their gun laws are even stricter than here in California. Due to their gun laws I am unable to legally take a handgun into the state until a handgun license is obtained there. 

This handgun was purchased new by me in 2013. 
It has only been fired at the range on two occasions which I'd say totaled up to about 200-250 rounds fired. 

It comes with the original case and lock, and the handgun already has night sights on. 
There is no thumb safety, the safety is on the trigger. 

I am not interested in any trades due to the reason listed above.

Offering an exciting multi-caliber option, the Omni AR-15 provides superb firepower
and exceptional durability in any situation. The military specs lower is constructed
of sturdy and comfortable reinforced polymer, and is compatible with most AR-15 parts kits, grips, and stocks. This is an incredibly versatile rifle for the field or at the range.

American Tactical sets the new standard in polymer AR lowers by introducing the new Omni-Hybrid AR-15 lower.


The new design is a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.

This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower.


“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” says Joe Calabro, Director of Marketing for American Tactical. “We feel like this new manufacturing technique will help set the standard for AR lower manufacturing.”

Ak reliable and durable, never had one malfunction whatsoever. Has a hogue grip installed but I also have the brown plastic oem grip. 4-30 round mags and 1-20 rounder (all fully loaded). Also comes with 200 rounds of boxed brown bear ammo and ~700 loose rounds of Tulammo in an ammo can (1000 filled it up so my best guess is 700 are left, see pic). Mirror bore, and perfect function, only small flaw is a chip out of the stock by the rear tang, other than that the blonde wood is excellent. $800

This rifle was basically fired for sight in and function and it is extremely accurate. No flaws, no problems, no issues. That being said:

I don't need to sell it, so don't BS offer me even up for a used Glock, a high point, overpriced ammo, pump shotguns, Xboxs, PS3's, tablets, or anything else that isn't firearms related. I have enough money to go buy what I want right now, BUT I figure if someone else is realistic and wants to trade for what I'm looking for I would just keep my cash. If not I'll just go buy what I'm after. Keep this in mind when offering trades. It's worth what it's worth. Cash value and trade value are the SAME."
