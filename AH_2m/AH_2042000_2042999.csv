Bolt action, model 1500 chambered in 7mm Remington Magnum. It includes a Leupold Vari X III - variable zoom scope 2.5X - 8X 36mm This firearm is in good condition: It shows some wear as you would expect of a regularly used hunting rifle. The wood stock is in good condition as you can tell from the photos with a few minor nicks and scratches. The condition of the blue finish is fair to good. The barrel is in good condition with a few minor scratches. The bolt action is smooth and cycles cleanly. This is a quality rifle and is ready to go into the field hunting, or to the range and is a tremendous value. On its last trip to the range a couple of weeks ago, it was dead on at two hundred yards. Lately, this rifle spends most of her time in my safe and I am purchasing a new rifle without the magnum caliber. She needs a new home where she will get lovingly used and cared for, and not end up a safe queen.

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.  Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.  The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components...

Using the HK-proprietary operating system, the MR762A1 is gas operated and uses a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the common gas tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons.  Pioneered by Heckler & Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417; this method virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The service life of all parts is increased substantially.  The MR762A1 uses a barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process. This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing facilities from both American and German-made components."

Blackhole Weaponry Barrels employ the use of 416R, match grade stainless steel. BHW Barrels specialize in Polygonal rifling; The shape of the lands and grooves are based on a circle, so there are no sharp corners or edges for the bullet to conform into. This means there is a tight seal and thus less bullet deformation. This rifling form is unique in its ability to allow the bullet to be centered and fully supported by the barrel’s bore.This arc shaped rifling has long been held in very high regard for its accuracy, increased velocity, reduced gas cutting and ease of cleaning.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This new load is designed for only certain revolvers that have the cylinder length to handle it. They are as follows; Ruger Red Hawk, Ruger Super Red Hawk, Ruger Super Blackhawk or Vaquero, Freedom Arms Model 83, Taurus Raging Bull, Colt Anaconda and Dan Wesson Revolvers. Suitable rifles include T/C Encore, ""modified"" Marlin 1894, Winchester 1894, any rifle with a falling block action and the Handi Rifle. 

What do we mean above by ""modified"" Marlin? Marlin (for an unknown, not well thought out reason) is using a very slow rate of twist (1/38 inches) on their 1894 chambered in 44 mag. Because of this slow rate of twist, the heaviest bullet that the factory Marlin will stabilize is about 270grs. Other firearm makers that chamber for the 44 mag all use a much faster rate of twist so that their guns will stabilize and therefore accurately shoot bullets over 300grs. Many folks today want their 44 magnums to be able to utilize the heavy 300gr. and heavier bullets - Marlin has not figured this out. If you want decent accuracy out of our new +p+ load in a Marlin, it will need to be re-barreled with a twist rate of roughly 1/20 inch. I have Dave Clay re-barrel all my Marlin 1894's with a faster twist barrel. A 44 magnum that wont accurately shoot 300gr. or heavier bullets is useless to me. Call him at REDACTED for pricing.

This load brings a level of power to the 44 mag. that has never before been known. 

The below velocities tell the story.

The direct description for the pants is as follows..
.........................................
This pant is ideal for situations where discretion is important. The Elite Concealed Carry Chino has the clean profile of a standard pair of pants with no external cargo or utility pocketing, but offers the added advantage of a hidden chamber pocket strategically constructed to reduce printing.

Comfort waist with elastic side panels

3-Ply, dual chamber pocket bags.

Inner chamber is accessable through invisible zipper and allows for discreet carry option.

Outer chamber provides conventional pocket function and additional benefit of reduced printing.

Two knife openings

Reinforced Crotch

Easy care: machine wash, tumble dry and cool iron as needed.
.........................................

I got these direct from Woolrich based on the size I wear in my other Woolrich pants, but they seem more like a 32'' length than a 30''. Perhaps if I was wearing a sizable boot they'd be okay, but I have to wear a dress shoe and that would lead to me stepping all over the pants. They're great quality, look very nice and everything, they're just too long for me.  One pair is brand new in the bag, the other has been laundered once and tried on. I'm valuing the new pair at $40 and the washed pair at $35, going off prices online and factoring in that you won't be paying shipping or anything. I'm in the Battle Ground area, regularly get to Delphi and Brookston, with Monticello and/or Lafayette not being out of the question."

Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver.A parts kit means you will have to assemble this kit yourself or have a qualified gun smith do it for you.You can do this yourself at home with a minimum of tools.All numbers match.All the parts are in great shape.Small parts Refinished in duracoat.The furniture looks great with some very small handling marks.This AK comes with the factory 5 round mag.(not in pics)The only part missing is the trigger guard and you can get it at brownells for $8.00 on the net.I am in lake mary florida.Msg me if interested.$500.00.I can ship this parts kit anywhere in the USA.Will take paypal only if out of state or cash if local.will be shipped USPS Priority with tracking and full insurance."

The Remington 870 Wingmaster Classic Trap shotgun was released in the year 2000 as a special limited anniversary(50 yrs)
 This is another one of those target guns like the Remington 1100 Classic Trap that is a mantle piece gun in my opinion. While you may take it out and shoot it every once in awhile its too nice to be an every day gun. Why? Well for starts is has fine gold engraving and a gold plated trigger....yep a gold plated trigger.
This is a Like new Shotgun, was told it was never fired... just beautiful...
I just cant sell it for new due to being a FFL

With an MSRP of around $1400; This gun could definitely be a piece that is handed down over generations if properly taken care of.

In addition to the gold inlay it also has a very nice high-gloss coat, and a polished blue receiver.

From website:
Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount. Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space 
Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours
The XPS2 is not Night Vision compatible, for Night Vision compatibility see the XPS3 sights.

prices are for cash (US)

First up is a M37 lightweight J frame, this I would rate at 65% due to heavy holster wear.  It wears a pair rubber boot grips.  Very nice action and 100% reliable.  This would make someone a very good pocket pistol for not much cash.
Price $350

Second, is a 638-3 with Crimson trace grips (model 105), this J frame was carried allot by myself before I switched to a semi auto recently.  I would say the the finish is about 85% due to pocket carry.  This has only about 200 rnds though it and locks up tight.

Taurus no longer makes a 3"" 608, and no longer makes a no-lock 608. This is a rare firearm, and if you want one, NOW is your chance. 

For sale near Winston Salem,  NC/DL, Pistol Permit or CC Permit, plus bill of sale required.

This would make a FANTASTIC truck gun, or ""backpacking in Alaska"" gun, or whatever you might want to use an 8-shot 357 magnum for.  Firing 38 special ammo through this produces recoil like bunny farts. The trigger is smooth, the lockup is great. This is an awesome revolver. 

IT DOES have a few small cosmetic nicks and scratches - and it is a BIG revolver - (Think Ruger Redhawk, S&W 629, or maybe Taurus Judge size) - but this is an incredible, rare, unique revolver, and offered for a very fair price. 

 $500 firm.

I'd prefer to sell this, but might entertain trade offers. If you want to make a cash offer, feel free, but if you want to buy this, make it a cash offer for $500."
