Being sold without title for parts or if you can file and get one that's up to you.

Very tight tolerances and super smooth shooting. This is a very accurate 1911, the barrel and bushing fit are the tightest I've ever seen in a production gun and the slide to frame fit has no wiggles and fires very smoothly! The Range Officers are built using national match parts and i really feel they did a spectacular job. Comes with all factory parts except original grips. Round count is 100, no issues.

I put on a set of Simonich Gunner VZ Grips, VZ custom grip screws with rubber o-rings, and also added a Fusion Custom Proffesional series mainspring housing/mag well. The MSH has a chain link pattern cut. All springfield factory stuff included, box, 2 factory mags, holster, mag

Two from C.A.S. Hanwei, and one from Strongblade. The Strongblade is their ""deathbringer: mercenary sword"" model. It has been both tempered and sharpened factory. This one includes the scabbard and is in extremely good shape. A new one of these is $148. 
The first Hanwei is their ""bastard sword"". It measures 50"" long with a 2"" blade width at the base. It is the antiqued model, not the natural one. This sword is also in very good condition, no rust or nicks. A new Hanwei bastard sword is about $230 new.
The third sword is a Hanwei side sword. This sword is a traditional cut and thrust type and is in very good shape. A new Hanwei side sword is about $300 new.
All three of these blades are in very good shape. No rust or nicks, and the scabbards are all three in good condition. I have roughly 10 years experience as a sword smith and I have also personally tested and strengthened all three swords. All three are sharp and functional, all with treated high carbon steel blades.
I would like to sell all three swords. I simply have too many. I will sell them together or separate, just make me an offer. I can also send pictures if you would like.

The slide and front of frame have a slight bit of slide wear from concealed carry. The gun itself shoots lights out. It has had 2 coatings of frog lube so it should be good to go for about 6-8 months depending on round count. This gun has a bull barrel making it extremely easy to break down and clean without having to fuss with a bushing. I have put 200 rounds through it for target practice since I bought it brand new from Cabelas about a year ago. The great thing about a gun from STI is that they are located in Georgetown and honor their warrantee even if you are not the original owner, so if you run into any issues with the gun other than pure idiocy on your part, they will cover the repair. For the record, this gun has never been sent back because there is no need. I also have a Galco King Tuk IWB holster for it if you plan on carrying concealed. I'm asking $1050 trade value for the gun and holster. Possible interest in trades would be a sig p227, smith and Wesson 686 revolver or any other interesting revolvers in .357, xds .45, Glock .45 or 10mm, HK in .45, Rossi rio grande stainless 30-30 lever action, or other interesting lever action rifles in 30-30. Plus or minus cash depending on trade value. MSRP plus 8% tax in Texas puts this bad boy over $1200 out the door, so save some money and make an offer on this lightly used little baby.

Also would trade for a different AR-15 or AR-10 but they need to be loaded as mine is. Anyway if youve got any question shoot me an email or txt at REDACTED.

This one is also a little larger than most other I do believe. I bought this one off of John himself at the knife show in Cambridge OH several years back.

Anyways, it has John Grecos standard construction, 8670 steel, black coating, leather sheath by Sherry Lott, Micarta Scales.

Really really solid piece. It has seen some use and I have rebeveled the edge with my Edgepro. The coating has seen some wear in the middle of the blade and the rest of it, including sheath, has a scratch or bump here and there.

Would really make a great user for someone. Hell, kydex a sheath for this one (Something I never got around to) and it would make a hell of a tacticool blade you can actually use.

Overall I would rate the piece at 80% but has tons of life left in it.

I am asking $145 shipped USPS Priority with insurance to anywhere in the USA.

Next is a Koster Survivor in A2 with a brown kydex sheath that has a large TekLock on it.

A2 steel. In really good condition but the blade does have some marks/discoloration on it (see the pics).

This has been used and the only reason Im selling it is Im moving away from large chopper and into the axe/small knife combos.

The balance and fit/finish on this knife are both really awesome. Dan puts out a really solid knife when you can get them.

Lets put this one at $325 shipped USPS priority with insurance anywhere in the USA.

Last is a Bark River (BRKT) North Star EDC in CPM3V. Black canvas micarta scales. This one has only been used to break down 2-3 cardboard boxes but otherwise is mint. Has a few minor scratches/streaks on the blade but has not been sharpened or anything.

Lets but this one at $145 shipped USPS Priority with insurance anywhere in the USA.

This rifle is a Marlin Model 1894 chambered in .357 Mag. Cal. The barrel length is 18.5"" with an excellent bore. It's an earlier model WITHOUT the hammer block safety mfg. circa 1979-84. The gun retains 95% or it's original metal finish and has no rust or pitting. The wood rates 95% also with no chips, splits or cracks. The Marlin ""Bullet Logo"" is missing from the underside of the stock as the photos show. There are also some non factory holes drilled in the left side of the receiver. I can only speculate that there was a ""Peep Sight"" mounted here at one time. The top of the receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounting and there are screws present for mounting the bases. All of the mechanics worked fine during test firing. This is a great little rifle that can be shot with either the .357 mag. cal or 38 Spl. for economic shooting. Thanks for looking."

Our 357 mag. ammo adds more power than ever before to the 357 mag. This ammo is safe to shoot in ANY all steel 357 revolver - this includes J frames. This ammo is no harder on your gun than any other normal 357 ammo. Please don't phone us and ask if this ammo is safe in your gun. It is, providing your gun is in safe condition for use with any normal 357 ammo.

We don't recommend this ammo to be fired in super light alloy revolvers as bullets may jump crimp under recoil, but the ammo itself wont hurt these super light weight revolvers. These revolvers are simply so light that the recoil is severe enough to cause crimp jump.

The below velocities are offered so that you can see what guns/barrel lengths give what velocities with this new 357 mag. ammo. You'll notice that new S&W revolvers with short barrels are often shooting faster than older S&W revolvers with longer barrels. The new S&W revolvers are very good and are made with equipment that makes them more consistent and faster than the S&W revolvers of yesteryear.

It resembles a brush stainless look but it increases the defense against rusting(designed for use in applications with salt water). I have never taken this near a body of water or planned too, the mariner coating made it a little more valuable. This Mossberg action is the one the Army decided to go with and is very reliable because it will not jam if the action is ""short-stroked"".(unlike the Rem870, which will jam). I purchased it used and put a few boxes through it, then in the safe it sat. Need more room in the safe and cash to spend on another toy. 

Comes with a sling/bandolier, shell holder(holds six on the side of the action), an adjustable rear ghost sight and Hi-viz front sight. No gun smithing or tinkering has been performed, it is 100% functional like it was out of the box).

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

Let get real guys the prices on some of these guns are ridiculous,  why does everyone cry about the price of 22 ammo the guys are making a $50 profit??? People are asking crazy amounts for used guns way over high retail and no one is flagging these ads???

As most of you probably already know, PSA (Palmetto State Armory) is widely considered one of, if not the, best mid-level AR-15 manufactures on the market. These ARs meet or exceed the quality of Colt, Rock River, etc. at a better value. Completely Mil-Spec. Check out the durability test that was done on the PSA AR15 rifle on youtube (link below), it is truly amazing. How many other AR15 rifles you think could pass these tests?

Serial number 100. This Rolling Block rifle is in the rare 38-56 caliber. It looks like a necked down 45-70.  It has a 30 inch barrel and is the round barrel with ½ octagonal from the receiver.  I hate to rate it as there can be so many different ways to interpret the rating. I would give it 9o%. The finish is OK with a few very small scratches (none through the blue) and a very few small dings and minor scratches in the wood finish. The butt plate has a little degradation from sitting in a corner for years.  Dave Higginbotham built these Remington Rolling Block rifles for the Lone Star Rifle Company in Texas.  He was known as the finest Rolling Block builder out there. This example is one of his early guns and is not like his later work. This one has an early receiver and is blued, not case hardened. Since his tragic death, these rifles are going up in value fast.    I am selling this for a friend. Make me an offer or trade.  I have been accurate in my description.
