•This is no stripped-down basic pistol. The Hi Standard Crusader Compact has an excellent set of steel Novak-style combat sights that are very easy to see, and offer a good sight picture for target work. They are dovetailed into the slide, and the rear sight has a set screw to loosen to make windage adjustments. Another feature usually found only on more expensive pistols is the beavertail grip safety and skeletonized Commander-style hammer. The feed ramp is polished, and the barrel is throated to feed hollowpoint ammunition. The trigger is a good-looking partially skeletonized unit, with a crisp trigger pull that feels lighter than its measured five and one-half pounds"

I am located in the Northeast corner of Illinois in Winthrop Harbor. I can do a face to face transaction or can have it shipped to your FFL from my FFL. If the sale is done face to face a Bill of Sale will be written up to protect us both.

If you live in Wisconsin there is a local FFL that holds licenses in both Illinois and Wisconsin so they could do the transfer with only one fee as opposed to two as well as eliminating any shipping costs that would be involved.

The car has 155k miles on it and it is a great running car that has been nothing but dependable, but it is not without problems. First off, it leaks oil. Also the check engine light will occasionally come on, then go off the next time you start it. The low coolant light also will blink on it, although it is not low on coolant and does not overheat, even in the summer. It has a bit of rust below the back door on the passenger side, it has a dent in front of passenger door. The paint is fading as is the interior. The biggest problem is the AC, the compressor leaks and needs replaced. This is a great running and driving car, I'd like to fix it and keep driving it but I have a company vehicle now, so it's going to sit and I may as well sell it. These V6's are great motors and you will easily get another 100k out of it if you take care of it. Email, text or call. I'm also willing to trade for motorcycles or firearms/ammo."

http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/cdp-ii/ultra-cdp-ii

This is a pristine Kimber that has only seen 200 rounds and no mechanical malfunctions. It came with 1 mag, a plastic case and the usual fare, so all that's included in the sale.

I'm including the VZ grips (and factory grips), 2 more mags from Wilson Combat, a cheapo IWB holster and a Blackhawk Serpa OWB.

These typically sell for $850 with 1 mag and rosewood grips and unknown maintenance and round count.  This one includes about $200 in accessories and hasn't even been broken in yet.
My asking price of $900 is a good deal, however I MIGHT be persuaded to take a partial trade + at least $400 cash.

I will also send the pistol with a soft case, two magazines, a box of 50  FMJ rounds, a serpa paddle holster and an extra set of hogue finger groove grips.  This isn't a pistol for the boring range goer with a collection of safe queens, this is for the man or woman that carries a pistol daily and developes a relationship with their weapon.  This 1911 is super reliable, and has eaten every type of ammo I've given it with a smile, and asked for more, including every type of hollowpoint I could find. The slight holster wear, adds to the character of the pistol, and shows that it has been loved and carried often.  This is a single owner gun, which has been maintained by myself - a US Marine. If you know one of us, you know how serious we are about weapons maintenance, and should find peace concerning the care of this 1911.

They supply after market AK, Ar15, and SKS parts and offer full design modifications using their parts. This steel body straight sided 30 round box magazine is marked ""SKS Clip/Pat. Pending"" and ""D.C. Engineering, Inc./Detriot, MI."". This over designed Detroit magazine is hand welded in two separate locations and shows repeated tooling marks. How can you make any money if it takes an hour to make one working magazine? Detroit! The D.C. Engineering 'Dragunov' stock lists retail at $185.00 and on their web site they offer a complete Dragunov SKS rifle, I figure this is one from a previous years assembly using new Norinco rifles, the trigger group on this rifle is several rifle numbers off as they probably had several rifles in disassemble with their Dragunov stock replacements (Their current SKS offering is $875.00). The rifle we are offering here is in factory new condition plus ten rounds. DC engineering also offers a magazine adapter, not included here, to use AK47 mags. $450.00 Cash only at this time.

a frame-mounted crane arm. The cylinder falls to the right side of the
revolver when the cylinder pin is pulled forward to release it from the
frame. With the cylinder to the side, the cylinder pin actuates an ejector
star to eject spent cartridges. The addition of these new features to the
Sidewinder has increased the weight of the revolver by only a fraction of
an ounce in comparison to the standard .22 Mag. mini, but reloading will be
a much faster and simpler process. Features include a stainless-steel frame, laminated
rosewood grips, a bead front sight and a newly developed cylinder shroud.

Excellent concealment pistol with a heck of a punch. Very easy to control and shoot, this little powerhouse is very sweet.

Price is cash/check/money order discount, credit/debit cards will have 3.5% added to total.

Arkansas residents are subject to 8.5% sales tax.

Shipping to your dealer is a flat $18.

Is in overall good shape, has a little bit of surface wear but in great working order.  Deceptively compact and lightweight, same size as a Glock 19 if you're looking for something compact.  Has a beautifully light and smooth SA/DA action and is exceptionally accurate because of this.
Will come with two factory mags and rail mounted light along with its box.  Will accept inexpensive CZ75 magazines as well.

I'd like to trade for a different compact or full sized 9mm handgun.  I'm primarily interested in an XD 9mm service model or a basic blued model Beretta 92 or 96, maybe a Walther PPX or Beretta PX4.  Open to other possible 9mm or .40 caliber handgun trades but no Tauruses or Kel Tecs please with the one exception being possibly a PT92 AF.

If you have a .40 caliber trade I have a large amount of 9mm ammo I can trade for .40 ammo or possibly sell.

The Uzi Pistol is a semi-automatic, closed bolt, and blowback-operated pistol variant. Its muzzle velocity is 345 m/s. It is a Micro-Uzi with no shoulder stock or full-automatic firing capability. The intended users for the pistol were various security agencies in need of a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol, or civilian shooters that wanted a gun with those qualities and the familiarity of the Uzi style. It was introduced in 1984 and produced until 1993.  A 32-round extended magazine is the standard.  The weapon was designed and manufactured in Israel and imported into the United States.

Because it was previously owned it must be classified as used firearm but make no mistake, it is just like new. I can’t say for sure but I think it has not ever been fired.

In fact this entire shotgun is as close to 100% condition as you will ever see because it has probably lived in its original box since 1974 when it left the factory in Belgium."

This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability.

I bought from an Air force officer out at Nellis who had bought it new and put the first 500 rounds through it. I bought the rifle and a bunch of ammo for it for a Labor day camping trip last year to teach my nephew how to shoot but unfortunately, he is still a little young it scared him so we were barely able to shoot it and it has been sitting since. Maybe in a couple more years he'll be up for it but for now, I don't need it or have room for it in the safe so it's gotta go to a good home where it will get used, etc.

""Husqvarna made firearms?"" you say to yourself. Here's some factoids if you so care to know...Husqvarna is the second oldest firearms maker in the world, following Berretta. Husqvarna only made firearms until the political/social atmosphere of Sweden began to shift in the 70s to a less gun friendly place, compounded by new bullshit import laws by our own government, thus resulting in them moving into other ventures and dropping firearms production all together (sound familiar...CA, NY, MA, CO) The Swedish steel used in their firearms is considered second to none, and their rifles are considered some of the finest in the world. Back in the day Husqvarna use to ""battle it out"" with Sako of Finland, and if you are familiar with Sako, you can get an idea of the quality you are dealing with. If you would like to know more, shoot me a message or just do that Google thing. On to this rifle...the metal and bluing is perfect; the bore is fantastic, and the action smooth as butter. The stock has handling marks, some compression spots in the checkering on the forearms and pistol grip, and the toe of the stock is chipped. As far as the chip, it can be left as is, the stock can be cut and a new soft grind-to-fit butt pad can be installed for as little as $60 locally, or I can give you an extra slip on pad that you can put on yourself. This rifle is TOP NOTCH and a great opportunity to join the Husky club. Located in Enterprise."

It comes with TWO EXTRA extended magazines as well as TWO additional holsters (an inside waistband and an outside - $150 in holsters alone).

It's only been lightly used, and cleaned thoroughly after every range trip. It's in immaculate condition, you wont find a newer looking piece. 
It does include the case, as well as all of the cool XD Gear. It's an absolutely complete kit. This has been probably my favorite pistol, and I wouldn't be selling it unless I absolutely needed the cash for it.
Asking $600. Price is pretty firm, but make a reasonable offer. Cash only, no trades please.
Thanks for taking a look!"
