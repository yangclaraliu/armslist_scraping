It has the 18.5"" modified heavy barrel (fluted).   
This rifle is rated by the manufacturer for both 5.56 and 223 caliber ammo.
In addition it takes AR-15 magazines.
Included are the original box, lock and 2 additional E-Lander 30 round steel magazines, which are in unopened packages.  
The barrel was cured according to a procedure described by Larry Potterfield (AKA MidwayUSA Larry) using Federal 55 grain FMJ ammo.
In addition to the Federal 55 Gr FMJ's, I have used a few Federal 62 Grain 5.56 ""green tip"", and a few Wolf 55 grain FMJ's.  It fires and ejects all 3 types just fine, and the gun shoots quite accurately at 100 and 200 yards.  I hate to let it go, as I was hoping to take it to 300 yards soon.  (Then came that pesky lay-off.)
It came with a no-name scope which got replaced by a Nikon Buckmaster (selling separately).
So - just in time for hunting season, I'm selling a very nice rifle.  My loss is your gain.
This is the latest model, so you can get specs, etc first hand at the Mossberg website.
I can provide several more pictures via email if you like.  Email me."

I have a Mint condition Ruger LCR 357 that I'm looking to trade or sell. About 100 rounds through it. I'm looking for an equal or greater value 357 with a 4""-6"" barrel. I am willing to add a little extra cash for one of greater value. The only other trades I might consider would be a Springfield XDs Bi-Tone in 45acp or a ridiculously long barreled 357.

This LCR is a great pistol for concealed carry and I will include a Leather DeSantis IWB holster to go with it. I also have the box, manual, zipper pouch, keys, etc. All the stuff that came with it originally.

If I was to sell it outright, It'd be $500 firm. I don't need to sell it, so no lowball offers.

This has been in the safe since the day I got it, aside from the 100 or so rounds I've fired through it over 2 separate occasions, I never actually used it as a carry gun so it's still in mint, like new condition.

The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed, real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters.

I'm always in between Milledgeville (college), and alpharetta (home), as well as most weekends traveling in Georgia to different cities for rugby games so I'm kind of open to a buyer out of any city. My only problem I've had with the gun is that the magazine is OEM, so considering the spring in the mag is 70 years old, it'll push the rounds in, but when you get to the last 2 or 3 rounds it doesn't have the strength to push them in. Nothing a new magazine, or a new spring for a magazine wouldn't fix. Fires 303 british, gun cap is 10+1, and has the good old queens markings on the barrel. Shot probably 50-60 rounds out of it since the time I bought it. Looking to keep the scope but I wouldn't mind selling it along with the gun anyways if we come to an agreement on the price.

This rifle comes with a Bushnell (3-9x40) waterproof scope and a tilting/pivoting bi-pod. It is very accurate and has a nice trigger pull, I can put together 1.5 MOA groupings at 100 yards quite easily. I recently bought a different caliber hunting rifle, so everything I have for this rifle (including ammo) is being packaged up and sold.

Including everything mentioned above, this package also includes 680 rounds of .308 ammo. Almost all the ammo is brass cased, although a few boxes are steel cased soft point. There is plenty of high end hunting ammo mixed in this bunch as well. There is easily $450 in just ammo alone, assuming about .65/round, which is pretty much impossible to find these days. All the ammo was purchased within the last 12 mths.

Price for the whole package is $600. This is extremely fair and is priced to sell, therefore the price is firm. I am not in a hurry to sell so lowball offers will be discarded with no response. Will not separate, package deal only. Must be at least 18 yrs. old and have a valid Ohio ID to purchase, NO EXCEPTIONS!!! FTF sales only, no shipping. CCW owners preferred (like myself). Willing to meet in, or around, the Akron area. 

Although I'm not looking for any trades, feel free to try me. Please don't ask me what I want or what I'm willing to trade for. If you have something you want to trade, let me know what it is exactly, and I will politely accept or decline."

Used to be a carry gun of mine, but I have moved to carrying semi-autos only now. Gun runs flawlessly. Trigger is very smooth in double action and has a very light and crisp break in single action. (I have put three rounds through a single hole at 25 feet shooting in single action at the range) Very accurate little gun. The only negative to this gun is that because it was used as a carry gun there is finish wear on the front of the frame and a little on the exposed part of the grip. 

Included with the gun are 2 HKS speedloaders, 2 Bianchi speedstrips, 1 Don Hume black leather IWB holster, 1 Galco leather holster that has been converted into a pocket holster, and 1 EDH holsters Hybrid horsehide/kydex IWB holster(bought it and stopped carrying the gun before it arrived, so this one is completely unused). I will also include the 20 rounds of Remington Golden Saber 38+P ammo I have in the loaders in the safe. 

I have taken into account the light finish wear when determining my price. My price is absolutely firm, so please do not email me offering me less, I will not take less than what I am asking, the holsters, loaders and ammo included would cost you about $150 to purchase alone, so the gun is essentially being valued at $275 if you think about it that way. 

Asking price is $425 cash, and I will not break the package up, it's all or nothing, sorry, but I don't feel like having all this lying around trying to piece out the leftover gear from this gun. I am willing to accept trades, but my trade value is $475."

Comes with canister, lenses, waterproof bag, pmcs check list, straps, and carry bag. Has some scrapes on metal around lens. The U.S. ARMY M40A1 Field Protective Gas Mask has been in use by the military of the United States since 1992 to protect from field concentrations of chemical and biological agents, along with radiological fallout particles. It still remains in U.S. Military service today.

The M40 series was reworked with a better nose cup and a new Butyl protective hood that covers the head and shoulder area. The new hood required a rubber ""second skin"" that covered the entire mask's face piece This new design offered a higher level of protection against penetrating NBC agents and also made it easier to don the protective hood.

The M40A1 Field Protective mask features two voice-mitters, one on either the right or left side, and one in front. A voice-com adapter may be placed over the front voice-mitter to amplify the user's voice. The respirator can be adjusted in the field to accept the filtering canister on either side, so that a weapon may be shouldered.

Kit includes M40 gas mask configured with all accessories required for the advanced M40A1 configuration - second skin and quick doff hood. Also includes a C2A1 NBC filter, carry bag, and tinted outserts (lenses).

 This is the second version of the MCU-2/P gas mask. The MCU-2/P was used extensively during the Gulf War along side the U.S Army M17A2.

This FS2000 has had only 2 mags through it (60 rounds), and has been in a safe ever since. It's in excellent condition. 

From my experience on the forums, the Gen 1 FS2000s were selling for between $3,000 - $4,000 (before the discontinuation).

Other Notes:
I am moving on from this rifle not because I dislike it, but I found that I never really swapped the barrels. So the useful and unique aspect of it was somewhat lost on me.
This rifle was recently recalled. It has been fixed and has returned from the factory.

This is a fairly rare Frank Pachmayr accurized Colt 1911, probably done in the 1970's. Features include a new bushing housing at the front of the slide that replaces the factory unit and in addition to the new front sight, also houses a unique Messerschmidt type self aligning bearing, which serves as the new bushing for the matched barrel. The rear end of the barrel to slide lockup is accomplished by a square link and a fitted pin, which gives a broad ""foot"" of support and assists in a solid lockup of the barrel lugs and hood. Also secured to the frame via the fitted link is the patented slide guide. The lower rails of the slide are beveled to a 45 degree angle and fitted to the beveled upper edges of the guide. Another patented modification is a unique headspace take-up device, which is essentially a spring loaded plunger mounted above the firing pin hole. The plunger presses against the cartridge head when in battery and ensures uniform headspace from cartridge to cartridge. An adjustable Smith & Wesson rear sight has been milled into the slide. The trigger has an adjustable overtravel stop installed. The slide is engraved ""Pachmayr Signature Model"" on the right side filled in white and the Pachmayr trademark is stamped just below the serial number on the right side of the frame. The slide guide is marked ""Pachmayr ACCURIZED Los Angeles U.S.A."" on the left side."

This is a fairly rare Frank Pachmayr accurized Colt 1911, probably done in the 1970's. Features include a new bushing housing at the front of the slide that replaces the factory unit and in addition to the new front sight, also houses a unique Messerschmidt type self aligning bearing, which serves as the new bushing for the matched barrel. The rear end of the barrel to slide lockup is accomplished by a square link and a fitted pin, which gives a broad ""foot"" of support and assists in a solid lockup of the barrel lugs and hood. Also secured to the frame via the fitted link is the patented slide guide. The lower rails of the slide are beveled to a 45 degree angle and fitted to the beveled upper edges of the guide. Another patented modification is a unique headspace take-up device, which is essentially a spring loaded plunger mounted above the firing pin hole. The plunger presses against the cartridge head when in battery and ensures uniform headspace from cartridge to cartridge. An adjustable Smith & Wesson rear sight has been milled into the slide. The trigger has an adjustable overtravel stop installed. The slide is engraved ""Pachmayr Signature Model"" on the right side filled in white and the Pachmayr trademark is stamped just below the serial number on the right side of the frame. The slide guide is marked ""Pachmayr ACCURIZED Los Angeles U.S.A."" on the left side."

45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living.


The below velocities were fired from my Colt Gold Cup Govt. Model (5 inch) that was converted by Garey.

1. Item # 45S185-----------1330 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. Item # 45S200-----------1235 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. Item # 45S230-----------1131 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. Item # 45S230FMJ----1133 fps (230gr. FMJ-FLAT NOSE) 
5. Item # 45S255-----------1090 fps  (HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)


As always with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give you real world data and results.

All our 45 Super ammunition is loaded with flash suppressed powders so that if you have to fire in low light (when the criminal element is out) you will not be blinded by your own gun fire at the worst possible moment.


All three of the JHP loads were designed for anti-personel use and for hunting small big game like deer. The two solid bullet loads were designed for breaking large bones like a bears shoulders or skull, but will work for anti-personel use as well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls.

It was built using a Palmetto State Armory lower parts kit and stock kit. It has a flat top, optics ready upper, a 6 position collapsible stock and a front flasher hider. The barrel is stamped 5.56 and has a 1:9 twist. It comes with 1 black Gen 3 Pmag that has been loaded, but never fired.

I had this rifle built by an AR15 shop, and I know they test fired it to make sure that it functioned properly. I brought it home, stuck it in a BUG out bag and there it has sat. I haven't put a single round through it. Unfortunately, I now need some cash, so this has got to go.

I only  bought it to help out a friend and my son loves his Pump shotgun. 
This particular shotgun has the Benelli action. This gun was produced when Benelli and beretta merged and this why it has this particular Benelli action.  Very smooth action , little recoil and very easy to clean. This gun is perfect for a younger hunter who is ready for an upgrade to 12 ga.

Stock is hand engraved and very detailed - Beautiful. I'm not sure of the value of this rifle, so I'm willing to see what offers come in. I have been told that the rifle itself is worth a few hundred, but with the fancy stock on there, it should be in a museum or art gallery. Let me know what you think and if you want more or specific pictures, I can send what you need. This is my first listing on ARMSLIST, so be patient with me if I don't get back to you right away. Thanks for looking!

I found out this is a British Enfield rifle but made by Winchester around WWI. The stock was engraved in Japan. I took it to a gun show last weekend and everyone who looked at it said they had never seen such an amazingly detailed stock.

Make me an offer. Let me know what YOU think it is worth."
