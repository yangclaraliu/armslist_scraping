This is the next generation in high performance duty ammunition. HST offers consistent expansion and optimum penetration for terminal performance. A specially designed hollow-point tip won't plug while passing through a variety of barriers and this bullet holds its jacket in the toughest conditions. HST is engineered to provide 100% weight retention through most barriers and impressive expansion.

 I talk to younger and even some older gun owners that claim they're not ""into knives"".
In my day we were given pocket knives, hatchets and BB guns as kids.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required.

I have other things going on that I need to focus on, although I am really going to hate to see them go. Here is a list of everything included in this package. I am not looking to separate at this time.

- (3) Mosin Nagant rifles. 1 - Tula (Soviet Union) M91/30 1939, 1 - Izhevsk (Soviet Union) M91/30 1943, and 1 - Romania M44 1955. 
- Approx. 1,300 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo. Most are sealed and a majority is the silver tipped armor piercing. 
- 3 x Bayonets (2 are removable, and the other is attached to the M44)
- 2 x Original ammo carrying pouches
- 1 x Oil can
- 1 x Tool kit
- 1 x bore snake cleaning tool
- 1 x Original M91/30 stock
- 3 x Original cleaning rods

All 3 rifles have been professionally inspected (bores, chambers, rifling, etc.), and all passed. Both the M44 and the 1939 M91/30 are in original condition. 

The 1943 M91/30 has had a modern stock, scope mount, scope, and muzzle break all professionally installed by a gun smith. The bolt on the rifle with the upgrades has also been ""bent"" to allow it to work with the scope installed. This was also done by a professional gun smith. The original stock is included. The scope that was added is a Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 6-24x40mm Mil-Dot (paid $200 for it). I have taken this rifle to hunt Hogs down south, and it is incredibly accurate and powerful (twice I took down hogs weighing in excess of 500 lbs with one shot at over 100 yards).

Everything (including the rifles) are in excellent condition given there age. Each rifle fires exactly as it should with no issues that I am aware of. 

Price for the entire package is $800. I feel this is an extremely fair price considering I have well over $1000 in this package, not including most of the accessories. Must be 18 to purchase with a valid ID. Will not ship, FTF only. I am a valid CHL/CCW holder and would like to do business with a CHL/CCW holder as well, but not required. Again, I will not separate anything at this time, please do not ask. Thanks for looking. I would consider trade offers, please be specific on what you have and what you expect to get out of it. Cash either way as appropriate.

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

One owner gun. I bought this gun brand new last summer (2013). Test fired, and shot less than 30 rounds through it without any problems. It could pass as a new gun, but I'm not going to. This is a very nice gun (pictures does not do this gun justice, it's my fault I'm not a good photographer), and I like it a lot, but I need a smaller handgun for my wife and money more than this gun. Originally came from the factory with a hardcase, 2-7rd stainless finished mags, black rubber/plastic grips, cable security lock, warranty papers, and owner's manual. But I bought and added some extras for the gun. You (buyer/trader) must be at least 21 years old, or older to buy/trade this gun and a Kentucky resident, and have a valid KY Driver's License. KY CCDW preferred. Thanks for your time, and thanks for looking.

UPDATE: (3/21/14)
I received several emails in response to my gun posting/ad, some good, some not so good. I appreciate the kind and nice words about my gun, and some really good offers. But, please don't email to offer me way below my asking price, and I am NOT GOING TO SELL THE GUN BELOW $1,050. FIRM IS FIRM. Please read all my ad/posting before you reply. Evidently some people can't read English, or English is their third, or fourth language. And lastly, do not email me and bitch about my price. You don't have to buy my gun, nor reply to my ad/posting. If you can buy the same kind of gun I'm selling cheaper somewhere else, buy it somewhere else then (I don't understand that part, why email me and bitch about my price if you can buy the same kind of gun I'm selling cheaper somewhere else? Are you that stupid/dumbass - you know who you are? Ron White was right, ""you can't fix stupid""..lol). Just don't bug me and don't waste my time. I don't need the drama. I got enough drama at home. Geeezz people, this is not Facebook. I'm just trying to sell/trade my gun. Is that too much to ask??! I repeat, don't waste my time if you are just going to whine and bitch about my price.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, or photographs required.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Also, along with becoming a client, I will help you fill out the Form 1, Form 4, etc. I have also submitted these forms via the new ATF website and can advise you how to use the website (which I think can speed up the process). Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- Instructions and ReadMe (4 pages)
- The Declaration of NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages)
- Assignment of Property (2 pages)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

You will be able to speak with me and I will personally handle your trust from the beginning until the end.  I do not charge for phone calls or emails.  So, if you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact me.  The price, $199, includes everything needed to create and deliver this trust.  You can contact me at later times for assistance with filing a Form 1 or a Form 4 at no additional charge.

It is a very handy rifle and a much nicer size than the 91/30 - it's the same size as the much more common M44, but without the bayonet attached. The trigger is smoother than any other Mosin I've had, and it cycles and ejects ammo flawlessly. The rifling and bore are perfect and the bluing is very nice as well.

A semiautomatic shotgun (4+1) that reliably cycles everything from light 2-3/4"" trap loads to hard-hitting 3-1/2"" waterfowl shells, and lightning fast. And the innovative Kick Off(M) recoil-reduction system cuts felt recoil up to 70%. Aqua Technology ensures every part of the gun is resistant to corrosion. B-Lok forend cap with only 60° of rotation allows fast and easy assembly/disassembly. Includes three OptimaBore Chokes (C, M and F) and a custom fitted carry gun case.

Built for waterfowl hunting and shooting, and Tournament Trap, Beretta's A400 XTREME shotgun is coated with a sharp, clean and durable black Synthetic polymer on Stainless. Designed to enhance function and control while reducing felt recoil for the shooter, this gun features an oversized grip polymer inset textured to aid with control and accuracy and a special polymer inset in the stock to reduce recoil. Other features include a steel barrel topped with a vented rib, optic front sight and sling connection points on the stock and forend cap.

It has a US machine gun muzzle device permanently attached to the barrel and a US machine gun AR15 style adjustable butt stock that is easily removed with one bolt. The butt stock can be removed to shorten the overall length of the rifle and make it a pistol again. As well the muzzle device could be removed and ATF paperwork filled out to make it an SBR. Or remove it all and go back to a pistol. Choice is yours.

The rifle also has a saw style grip, recoil reducing buffer attachment, XS big dot night sight, aluminum quad rail and the stock wood fore end. I have refinished the wood grips and I think they look pretty good. I have seven TAPCO lifetime warranty 30 round magazines all in new condition. The rifle also has a a magpul ambidextrious sling attachment at the rear for whatever sling you choose to use. 

The rifle has about 300 - 400 rounds downrange and is in great condition. I'm personally able to hit a dinner sized steel plate at 150 yards from a sandbag with regularity. Your mileage may vary. 

This a cool gun and would make a nice addition to someones current AK collection or it would be a great rifle by itself. Lots of fun, ammo is cheap and it gets a ton of attention at the range. 

I do still have the original sights I will just need to dig around for them. 

I'm firm on the price. Don't waste your time or mine please. My asking price is less than the time and money I have in this gun but I would like to do another project so I'm selling this. 

If you are looking for a great condition AK that has lots of options then this is your gun. 

You can text me at four zero five.. seven zero six... three seven seven four. This is my business number so Leave a message and I will return your call. This will be a cash sale and I will have a bill of sale for each of us to sign. I will not just hand this over for some cash and no documentation to prove transfer or ownership.

Surprisingly it is one of the most accurate AK's i've ever owned. I've shot about 50 rounds through it flawlessly. The receiver is an import SA2000M FEG TGI receiver from Hungary. Very high quality. This is one of the last imports on this particular rifle since now they are no longer being imported. Tapco G2 trigger on it as well as a hogue grip. It has a wire stock side folder. It is light weight and heavy duty. This is the perfect AK to sbr and have some fun with. Comes with original box, original handguards and grips. Also have a 125$ midwest industries tactical rail. The best you can get for an AK. Lots of mods out there for this rifle as well. Read the reviews about this rifle before trying to make any judgement calls on it. Thanks for looking

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)
3. Ruger SP101, 3 inch barrel - 930 fps (303 ft. lbs.)
4. S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel - 979 fps (336 ft. lbs.)"

The SR-556 offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability and employs a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston-driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler-running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier, and the by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. This results in significantly improved performance over gas-driven rifles. The Ruger SR-556 features folding iron sights, a quad rail handguard providing four MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rails, a manganese phosphate/hardcoat anodized finish, and three PMAG magazines.

Sale to Vermont residents over 21 only with proper ID.  You must be legally able to own this firearm.  A firearms bill of sale must be signed at the time of sale.  I'm not interested in any trades at this time.

If you miss 15 times, you can still use it to beat the perp to death. I got it quite a while back just when Glocks came out but before the mania.  I was shooting at steel plates at a local club and wanted a reasonably priced double-action high-capacity pistol.  I had confidence in Stars because I have two other Star pistols, which also perform well.  I had no problems with this 30M with a variety of loads.  After a few practices, I decided a 1911 would be better for steel plates because it would be easier to customize.  The Star has been in the safe since then. I never had a holster, so it has no holster wear.  It travelled in the case. It is an all steel, full sized, double stack pistol with rubber grips. It is a commercial version of the military model used by the Spanish military and police.  Star began manufacturing firearms in 1905 and has a history of creating durable practical weapons.  There is a Truth-About-Guns review at http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2011/03/benjamin-t-shotzberger/gun-review-star-mod30-m/ with more links and information.  The mags are 15 rounds.  There is an included steel loader as pictured in the box on left side.  Condition is excellent and could pass for new.  It is double action on first shot and single after that.  The safety retracts the firing pin but allows the trigger to lower the hammer.  Rear sights are red dots with a white ramp in front.  The pistol can be ENTIRELY disassembled without tools using its own gun parts, although I never tried it.  It was up for US military adoption and survived mega-round torture tests but lost to Beretta.  New mags are in-stock at Midway for $23.  I read that S&W 5906 mags can be used with small modification."

It is a Two tone blue SUV with 360 Magnum. Engine has less than 10k miles on it. Transmission was taken out and rebuilt when the engine was put in (Both by Jasper). New locking hubs. New windsheild wiper motor. New fuel lines and fuel sending unit. New steering linkage. Has Flowmaster exhaust. Has been used as a farm/4X4 most of its life so it does have some cosmetic issues but is solid. Few dents and dings and lower body rust. Skid plate and receiver hitch were taken off when we took off the fuel tank to do the line and unit work but they are here and just need to be bolted back on. Wired for trailer brakes. Tachometer added with new engine. A/C stopped working years ago and I never found out what happened or tried to fix it. Speakers are blown. Odometer was not reset with new engine. Hydraulics for the back hatch need replaced. Battery is able to be charged but will not hold long term. I have the parts to rebuild the steering box and to replace the speedometer cable. This was my wife's first truck and we intended to fix it back up but I just don't have the time or money to do it. We hate to see it go but don't want it to sit here and rust.

I purchased this pistol about a year & a half ago for $550 + tax. I also have an additional $500 invested in aftermarket upgrades + gun smith fees. I switched out the trigger system for an Apex Tactical Duty/Carry Kit. This lightens the trigger pull to 3.5-4 pounds (much lighter than stock) and significantly reduces the pre-travel & over-travel. The actual polymer trigger was replaced by a billet aluminum trigger. Overall a much smoother & precise system ($160 plus shop fees). Aftermarket sights by TruGlo, which are fantastic especially in low light conditions (TruGlo TFO, $150). The slide was refinished with Cerakote which is far more durable coating than the standard melonite finish and adds a richer darker color (Cerakote, $120). The polymer grips are stippled (stand paper feel) which provides far better hold....stock grips on M&P tend to be very slick. Comes with BladeTech adjustable holster ($50). On a side note all the custom work was done by a licensed firearm dealer/gunsmith (West Coast Armory). All said & done you'll be hard pressed to find a more complete & custom M&P.

The hollow point works with the bonding process for outstanding performance through tough barriers. Jacket notching with six segments help promote positive, consistent and programmed expansion at a variety of impact velocities and ranges. Copper alloy jackets are contoured for maximum expansion over a wide range of velocities/ranges.
