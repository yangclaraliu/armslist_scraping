I have had this rifle for almost a year and put probably right at 1000 rds through it. I have run both steel and brass case through this beast and it has NEVER so much as stuttered, this is one of the few piston guns that will just chew through steel cased ammo with no problem (one of the deciding factors in purchasing it) all the internals including trigger group, are NP3 coated for maximum corrosion and wear resistance and the BCG has the same coating makes it a dream to clean. the barrel Uses LWRC's proprietary NIcorr surface conversion technology upping the barrels accurate life to well beyond 40,000 rds. I have the LWRC Skirmish sights on the rifle right now but i might be keeping them depending on the trade. I will be including 3 Lancer L5 mags with the rifle as well as a Daniel Defense hardcase to transport it in. I might include the sig red dot as well depending on the trade/cash offer. 

Now for what im looking for, im not looking for a straight trade only partial or a full cash offer. I am looking for at least around 1000$ cash plus trade. Im looking for a quality AR pistol with the barrel being no shorter than 8 inches (that can include the FH) prefer it not have an A2 sight but not a complete dealbreaker but i am not a fan of railed gasblocks so id prefer the gasblock under the quadrail and not visiable.
Also looking for a quality Arsenal AK74 in 5.45x39, no tantals or cai garbage 
last but not least im looking for a Tactical .308 bolt gun. plz dont offer up your stock rem 700 sps and expect 1000 in trade for it its not going to happen on a 750$ new gun. looking for a ready to rock system. Bell and carlson/acis stock systems and optics are a plus. feel free to offer other items you feel i might be interested in but those are what im mainly looking for ATM. i will respond to all offers but please dont try and peddle junk to me.

With night sights, checkered mainspring housing, ambidextrous safety, adjustable match trigger, etc., hardcase, and everything that came with the gun from the factory (i.e., holster, magazine holder, warranty papers, cleaning brush, ALS keys, and owner's manual). Gun has factory wood grips, but I installed a brand new set of VZ G10 Operator II grips ( on it right now - pictured). I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60), and a box of 50rds FMJ ammo along with the gun. I like the gun, but it is just too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice. Must be 21 years old or older to buy/trade this gun, and must also be a Kentucky resident and have at least a valid KY driver's license. Local KY sale/trade only.

45ACP+P ammo is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 ACP ammo and can be fired in any 45 acp firearm that is in normal operating condition. However, the greater pressures and power of the +P ammo will give you greater slide velocity and if you are going to shoot more than a box or two of +P ammo, you should consider replacing your recoil spring with a Wolf Spring that gives roughly 4 to 6 lbs more spring weight than factory stock springs. A shock buffer might also be a good addition although it is not too necessary if you use the stronger spring.


The below velocities were fired from my personal Colt Gold Cup 1911 (5 inch)


1. 45185-----------1180 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. 45200-----------1078 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. 45230------------979 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. 45230FMJ------981 fps (230gr. Fmj-FLAT NOSE)
5. 45255------------960 fps  (255gr. HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)


As always, with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give real world data and results. Laboratory test barrels tell you little about what kind of speed you can expect from your stock firearm.

All our 45 ACP+P loads utilize flash suppressed powders so that you will not be blinded by your own gunfire should you need to fire in the dark when the criminal element is at work.


The three JHP loads are design for defense against humans, while the two non-expanding loads are designed to shoot through large shoulder bones or the skull on a black bear. These non-expanding bullets also work well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.
Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.
Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, the latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.
When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.
The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.
Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.
All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

These are top-end target shells used by the best trap shooters. These are the only regular production modern paper shells made. The rare few specialty paper shells available these days are usually filled with BP or pyrodex for old black powder shotguns.... these are modern, smokeless loads, constructed with advanced polymer wads instead of waxed cardboard or fiber disks. They also feature a very heavy and precise star crimp, which is less common for paper shells, usually paper shells are seen with an 'end wad' which is roll crimped in place. They are filled with specially hardened lead shot. The paper is very sturdy and luxuriously smooth, it is impregnated with the best wax available. They also feature a premium quality brass base. These represent the rarest blend of the best in both old and new technology in shotgun shells available.

These are brand new and un-fired. I have quite a few available.

They are great for a collector, there is nothing else quite like them.

They are brand new though, and can be shot. I have shot quite a few of them. It is a unique experience. If you have never shot a real paper shell, you need to try it. These give off the most incredible and intoxicating aroma of melted carnuba when fired.

These are just fine to use in any modern shotgun, but they shine in older shotguns. Between the 1920s and the mid/late 1960s, most shotgun shells were still paper, but used modern smokeless powder. The guns built in this time frame are strong enough for smokeless, but the inside of the barrel was designed specifically to use paper (they don't get along with plastic shells, has to do with forcing cone length/angle, and they kick alot more if used with plastic shells as a result). So if you have grandpa's old shotgun from the 40's,50's or 60's; and your wondering how he put up with the incredible recoil...     well the answer is HE DIDN'T, it didn't use to kick that much, the extra kick is coming from the plastic shells being mismatched with G-pa's old gun. Try one of these paper shells and you'll see just what it was like for him!

Buy a few to put on the shelf with your ammo/shell collection and a few extras to try shooting a paper shell!

Transfer must be a PPT.  I will pay all the transfer fees.  I am a current gun-owner so I have all the necessary credentials to make it a smooth transfer. 


Let me know what you have and what you're looking to get for it.  

Thanks."

It is a very light trigger and has the shortest reset out there, I generally only have 1 big hole on my range targets when shooting this pistol.

It truly is the ONLY polymer gun I like as much as a steel or aluminum frame pistol. In fact the only reason I am selling or trading this gun is because I bought a second  one so I could have a pair but the wife is not too thrilled with me having 2 of the same gun so it is time to let it go.

I am interested in trading for a quality bolt or semi 308 (with cash on my end if needed), a 1911 in 45 or 9mm, or a full size 9mm pistol. I am not interested in Glocks, Taurus, or HiPoints and the only Springfield I am interested in would be the 5.25"" barrel model.

I would be happier to trade this but the cash price is 600 in Altamonte Springs."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

Has about 200 rounds fired with this trigger installed. Great upgrade to your standard mil spec trigger. I painted the trigger bow black because I didnt like the gray trigger color but its made that finish so the user can easily paint it whatever color they prefer. This is a $65 trigger and KNS pins run about $30.

Here is the description from manufacturer:
ALG Defense Combat Trigger - ACT
The ALG Defense ALG Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.
**Tuned by Geissele Automatics**
Performance Advantages for the Shooter:
The ALG Defense ACT trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components.
Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged.
Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness.
Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness.
Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications.
A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition.
Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated.
Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.0lbs.
Advantages for the Armorer:
The ALG Defense ACT trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged.
Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.
As a trigger meeting the essential U.S. Military trigger specifications for the M4 Carbine, the ALG Defense ACT can be substituted for lower performing stock triggers while still staying in compliance with Unit or Departmental requirements.
Note about HardLubing: HardLubing is ALG's term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT's single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components."

I have less than 400 rounds with this trigger installed so as good as new. Very nice upgrade to your standard mil spec trigger. This is a $65 trigger and KNS pins usually run around $30 so this is a great inexpensive upgrade if you are planning on upgrading a standard trigger. 

Here is the description from the manufacturer:The Spike’s Tactical Battle Trigger is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer to work with all calibers, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron. This plating gives you an extremely reliable single stage trigger and it’s also one of the most grit-free trigger pulls that you’ll find on the market that breaks between 5-9lbs (depending on individual spring variance) and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 

This kit comes with everything you need to replace your old trigger set. Inside, you’ll find the Nickel Boron plated trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector; as well as brand new Mil-Spec trigger, hammer, and disconnector springs. We’ve also included stainless steel hammer and trigger pins that both feature a Black Oxide finish for durability just in case the ones you have are a little worn or if you’re installing it in a new lower! 

Grab one today and drop one in your lower to finally get rid of that gritty feeling standard trigger!
