Title says what it is. Selling/trading because I've decided not to pursue CAS and this was to be my shotgun. I have not fired this gun but it was looked at by a gunsmith and pronounced ""good to shoot."" I don't remember the exact year but the serial number put the gun at over 100 years old. I actually got it from someone who believed  he was the grandson of the original owner. (True or not I donno, who knows what happened 100 years ago. I don't think my own grandfather would have been born long enough ago to have been the original owner and I think I was older than he was. But that is what he thought anyway.) 

Face to face, meet in Snohomish County. If your not legal to own in WA don't bother me. I will want to see at the bare minimum proof that you are a WA resident (any of the standard ""proofs"" will work) and if age is a question, proof of age. (If you are 50 it is pretty unlikely I'm gonna think you are 15.) Reply to the posting or feel free to text, Four 2 Five - 971 - Four Seven 20. I'm serious about being legal, your girlfriend lives in Bellingham but you live in Oregon does not make you a Washington resident and trying to make that argument just makes you a PITA."

180,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2520180,For Sale/Trade:  Lifted 1994 Jeep Wrangler YJ,"Richmond/Colonial Heights, Richmond, Virginia","$ 2,750","Listed On: Friday, January 3, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Will take partial trade for firearms.

I have a Jeep Wrangler YJ I need to sell for funds. I have title in hand. Lifted with off road tires (excellent tread left, at least 90%) and suspension, Flow Master exhaust, 5 Point Harness tall back and fully adjustable seats. 2.5 liter automatic engine.

I bought this as a project car. Had some real bad luck on my daily driver and got screwed trying to get some things fixed on this one. I now have no money to finish it up - should be no more than $1,000 - much less if you can do the work. I will help you if you need the hands.

The good:
Good looking Jeep overall. Just looks like a Wrangler should. White with black soft top and interior.
Engine and transmission was replaced. Not sure exactly when.
Runs strong.
Brand spanking new radiator and hoses, thermostat, etc ready to go.
Brand new Pioneer CD/MP3/Iphone/aux head unit.
Heat works wonderfully - need compressor for the AC.
PLENTY of other upgrades.

The bad:
Transmission needs to be put back into the vehicle. I have it as well as all seals, I just do not have the skills to do it myself.
Had the transmission pulled because there was a small leak from the rear main seal. Now the mechanic has pretty much abandoned the job, and unfortunately, I have already paid him a fair amount of money. Hard way to learn that lesson.
Other than the tranny, just cosmetic issues. If you like Jeeps, this will be a fun one. Just about everything you can do yourself. I will even help because this has been my baby and I enjoy it!

Any questions, feel free to ask. Reply by CL email or give me a call on the number at the end.

Of course, the Jeep will need to be towed. I am selling for well under what I have in it, but I do need to sell it.

In summary, this is a good, solid Jeep, just needs a bit of love."

Features
Breakthrough Retina display. It’s even more than meets the eye.

The Retina display on iPad makes everything look crisp and lifelike. Text is razor sharp. Colors are vibrant. Photos and videos are rich with detail. All thanks to its 3.1 million pixels — a million more pixels than an HDTV.
Powerful A6X chip. High speeds ahead.

The new A6X chip inside iPad is up to twice as fast as the previous-generation A5X chip, and it delivers up to twice the graphics performance, without sacrificing battery life. Which means even the most advanced apps are smooth, responsive, and incredibly lifelike.
Over 300,000 apps. There’s almost no limit to what you can do.

Apps for iPad aren’t like anything else. That’s because every app — 300,000 and counting — is designed specifically for iPad. And with apps in just about every category, you can do things like make a commute more entertaining, a presentation more interesting, or a school lesson more inspiring, right from your iPad.
Ultrafast Wireless. Make faster connections. The world over.

The new iPad with Retina display features advanced Wi‑Fi that’s up to twice as fast as any previous-generation iPad. And access to more cellular data networks around the world makes it fast in more ways than one, and in many more places.
FaceTime and iSight cameras. Now there are even more reasons to smile.

The iPad features Apple’s 5-megapixel iSight camera. Designed with advanced optics, it lets you shoot gorgeous photos and record HD video in full 1080p. FaceTime on iPad puts you face-to-face — even when you’re miles apart.
iOS. The world’s most advanced mobile operating system.

iOS is the magic behind iPad. It lets you see and do everything using Multi-Touch. It includes all the powerful, innovative, and fun built-in apps you use every day, many times a day. It’s the preferred choice for app developers. And it’s yet another reason no other device comes close to iPad.
iCloud. Your content. On all your devices.

iCloud stores your music, photos, apps, mail, contacts, calendars, documents, and more and wirelessly pushes them to all your devices. So if you buy a song, take a photo, or edit a calendar event on your iPad, iCloud makes sure it appears on your Mac, iPhone, and iPod touch, too. You don’t have to do a thing.
AirPlay. Play it on your iPad. Watch it on your HDTV.

Whether it’s the new album you bought, photos of your Barcelona escapade, or an HD movie, AirPlay lets you stream what’s on your iPad straight to your speakers and HDTV.
Dictation. Talking is the new typing.

Write an email. Send a text. Search the web. Or create a note. And do it all with only your voice. Instead of typing, tap the microphone icon on the keyboard. Then say what you want to say while your iPad listens. When you’re done, tap anywhere on the screen and, just like that, your spoken words become written words. Dictation also works with third-party apps, so you can do things like update your Facebook status or share a thought on your Twitter feed.

Tack driver. Stock has a couple scuffs but to be expected with the rubber Hogue stocks. Ultra light to carry. I just weighed it, 4.5lbs with bipod. This thing is light!  Perfect trail/hiking/hunting/plunker.  Do it with style and accuracy! Less than 2000 rounds through barrel. Original 10rd mag, 4-BX25 magazines, butler creek mag loader and a bipod come with the rifle!

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

562,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2520562,For Sale:  Nacre QUIETPRO®: Tactical Hearing Protection & Ambient Noise Amplification,"Downtown, Houston, Texas",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, January 3, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Description:

QUIETPRO® is a digital, lightweight tactical communication headset with built in intelligent adaptive hearing protection. Nacre has designed QUIETPRO® to protect your hearing and at the same time to preserve your situational awareness to support command, control and communication both in silent and noisy conditions.

The system seals the ear with a specially made noise protective canal tip and captures sound by using microphones and feeds these sounds into the control unit. The control unit analyses the sound,decides action and transmits wanted sound to the loudspeaker.

Bionic Hearing: The situational awareness capability of the QUIETPRO® enables the reproduction of external sounds within the headset. This allows the user to hear naturally without affecting the high noise reduction properties of the headset. Through amplification of the external sounds and digital filtering, the QUIETPRO® enables the user to hear sounds that would not be heard without the QUIETPRO®. 

Passive Noise Reduction: achieves a Noise Reduction Rating (NRR) of 29dB. 

Active Noise Reduction: can reduce the harmful effects of noise from weapons discharge or explosions by approx. 40dB.

Radio Connectivity: allows radio communications to and from attached radio or intercom systems (not included). Radio communication has 3 modes:
·        Push to Talk (PTT)
·        Voice on Command (VOX)
·        Open Mic (O.MIC)

YouTube Video Description: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rfHys9eVhU

Personal Testimony:

I tested my unit out on a back country road from the confines of my truck cab. I stopped the truck, rolled down the passenger window, and unloaded 10 rounds into the hillside while seated in the driver seat. All I heard was the slide action on my 9mm. 

Next, I tested it on a dove hunt with my boss. The goal was to see how it enhanced/hindered the user's situational awareness with multiple shooters. It muffled nearby shots while still providing ambient noise (wind, conversation, muffled gun shot, foot steps, etc) leaving my situational awareness unhindered by the gunfire.


Components Included:

It's labeled ""tactical"" by the makers, but it's more of a short hunting length. Shot 3 boxes through it to break it in. I cleaned all shipping oils off and gave it a good scrub after shooting. Spring loaded pump shuts itself, has sight and accessory rails on it, can change the choke for hunting, and I have not registered the 3 year service warranty yet so you can get it all. 

Pistol grip makes it easy to shoot. Sighted a little low with slugs and I didn't bring a flat head to the range to adjust it. Short enough for home defense, long enough for deer or squirrels. 

Dad shot it and had a good time with me so I bought one for my dad too. He politely declined saying he'll stick with his old trusty Wingmaster and a coach gun for the house (Sheesh! What's with old men and their double barrels??). His is still in the box, never fired. 

Webley and Scott is an old English brand (Gen. Custer carried a Webley.) The original Webley closed and a company in Turkey obtained the name and all rights.

It is an extremely accurate firearm, and a great pocket gun, giving the carrier the ability to put a .357 in a blue jean pocket. (much better to have a .357 than a 25 auto). A certified armorer installed a Meprolight Tru-Dot Night Sight on the weapon, so it is great for night time carry as well. I have put approximately 50 rounds through the weapon. It is in outstanding condition, and has no holster wear or scratches. I am parting with it because I prefer semi-automatics, and would rather have money than something I do not carry. To this end, I am not interested in trades, and want cash only for the gun. I will throw in a pocket holster (Blackhawk Size 3, fits perfectly), two HKS speed loaders, and three speed strips with the gun. This package is worth more than the asking price, so low ball offers need not apply. I would also be willing to talk about selling some .357 Magnum carry ammunition to go with it for a fair price. I am willing to travel a reasonable distance to meet, but I will only sell to someone who: 1)Has valid identification (i.e. Drivers License/ State Issued ID) and a valid unexpired CCW (Concealed Carry Weapon Permit). I have the original paperwork and box for the gun. If you have any questions or would like more pictures of the weapon, please let me know."

I have up for sale a milled Arsenal SA 93 Ak-47 with a chrome lined barrel, made in Bulgaria. This is a rare AK, and one of the best. It comes with 2-30 round mags, and a sling. These are highly desirable because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Upon expiration of the Federal Assault Weapon Ban (9/19/2004), SA-93 owners could legally convert them back to military configuration and have a semi-automatic Bulgarian Type 3 AKK rifle. Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver. It is top of the line when it comes to AK's.

Citori. A perfect blend of beauty and performance.
The Citori is more than a shotgun, it is the quintessential representative of the quality of the Browning brand. Wood-to-metal fit is paramount on the Citori and with tight, consistent junctions it doesn’t disappoint. Action components are machined to exacting tolerances, heat-treated for greater strength and fitted using the traditional lampblack-and-file method to ensure the precise fit of critical components prior to being assembled to the action. It is this extreme level of craftsmanship that leads to the dependable function, impeccable looks, championship performance and respect from both Citori owners and the competition alike.

We challenge you to take any Citori from the rack and you’ll see the same high level of fit and finish on every gun. Open and close the action and throw it to your shoulder. Sight down the barrels. Only then will you fully understand why the Citori has gained its reputation as the finest over and under shotgun available in the world."

Several variants of this gun were produced, but this 3.5"" barrel .38 S&W revolver is the rarest of them all.

A little history
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Smith & Wesson New Model No. 3 is a single-action revolver that was a redesign by Dan Wesson in 1877, after the Russian contracts for the No. 3 Russian were pretty much completed.

Barrel lengths are 3-1/2 (standard), 4, 5, 6, 6-1/2, 7, 7-1/2, and 8 (standard) inches. Chamberings include .44 S&W Russian, .32 S&W, .32-40 S&W, .38 S&W, .38-40, .38-44 S&W, .41 S&W, and .45 Webley. The finish is blue or nickel-plated, with hard rubber or walnut grips. The Smith & Wesson logo is molded into the rubber grips. .44 Russian with a 6-1/2 inch barrel is the most prevalent configuration. They were made from 1878 until 1912.

Retail values (with matching part numbers on frame, cylinder, barrel and latch):

Excellent: $3,420 - $10,200
Very Good: $2,160-$2,400
Good: $1,770-$1,950
Fair: $955-$1,590
Poor: $835
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This piece has all matching serial numbers and is in Good to Very Good condition (as rated by a professional gunsmith dealing in guns from this period). On top of the rarity of a piece such as this, the value increases significantly because it has such a low serial number, and because it has a rack-and-gear extractor.

It functions as it is supposed to and is in immaculate condition considering it's age. The retail prices above are the prices encountered if purchasing from an antique gun-shop; I'll start with a fair asking price of $2085 obo, the mid-range price of Good to Very Good condition.

If no one has a trade for these straight up, would anyone like to purchase the 60 for $36 bucks?  Or the 100 of golden bear for $55?  Which is just what I paid for them off of Natchez last year.    Or pay for them both for $85.
