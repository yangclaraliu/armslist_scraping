Hey everyone,
This listing is for a SCCY CPX-2 Bi-Tone 9mm. It has had less than 50 rounds down the pipe and has given me zero issues. It will come with the gun itself, and two magazines with the pinky extensions on them. Only selling because I already have a compact 9mm or I would keep her. Great shooting little gun. Barely bigger than my PF9 and holds more rounds! Also, for the right offer I can include ammo or a case for it. Please shoot any offer to REDACTED and we can try and make a deal. Will need to meet in or very close to norman due to my time constraints."

I live in Sumter, but I am willing to meet between Sumter and Columbia. My family is in Charleston and I'm down there a good bit visiting with my mother, who is ill, so I can always meet in the Summerville/Goose Creek area as well this weekend (I will be down on Saturday most likely).

I have the original box and all the accessories that came with the gun. I am looking to trade or sell out right. I am looking for a Browning Maxus in near new condition or a Super Black Eagle in equivalent condition. Gun must shoot a 3 1/2 shell like this one. 
I will sell the shotgun out right for $1,200.00. You can text me at REDACTED. The gun shoots 2 3/4-3 1/2 shells. I am firm on $1,200. If you are buying out of state, I will ship to an FFL dealer. 35 dollars for shipping and insurance. Gun is in near new condition no scratches or dents or wear.

A. Higher capacity magazines: 17 rounds in 9mm.  Completely interchangeable with other 92 family magazines. THREE magazines included per pistol.
B. Removable front sight: Allows the user to easily replace a damaged sight or replace it with an accessory sight.
C. Accessory rail: The frame of the A1’s have an integral MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
D. Internal recoil buffer: Increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver created by the more powerful .40 S&W caliber ammunition.
E. Captive recoil spring assembly: The single-piece design simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss.
F. Rounded trigger guard: Updated styling to conform with current pistol gripping practices

Product Information

Arsenal, Inc's side-folding buttstock assembly is an extremely durable, genuine Bulgarian AKS-74 style stock that is identical in appearance and construction to those currently fielded by various overseas government agencies. The buttstock features all steel construction, including a robust metal-to-metal folding joint capable of withstanding the rigors of extended field use. The skeletonized design reduces excess weight while also providing for a solid shooting foundation in the extended and locked position. The stock folds conveniently to the left side for storage or transport, and allows the gun to be fired while in the folded position in case of emergency. Compatible with stamped receiver AK-47 and AK-74 rifle variants, and includes fixed sling loop and all mounting hardware. Made in Bulgaria."

Tractor starts easy and runs great. The motor does not use oil. The tiller is awesome and will produce light fluffy garden beds without the footprints like the walk behind tillers. The push blade works good for pushing around dirt or snow. Never used the mower deck but it turns freely (blades missing). Complete packages like this are hard to find. Turnkey machine. Trade for good running golf cart or boat, ATV/UTV, guns, gold/silver coins, ........whatcha got? $1200 cash takes it too.

I cannot say enough about the tiller attachment. If you like planting a huge garden like we do, this machine takes all the back-breaking work out of it. From garden bed preperation in the spring, to cultivation/weed control between the rows in the summer, to tilling everything under in the fall.....works great! The blade works equally well pushing dirt and snow around with ease.  I really enjoyed using this machine around the farm but have a new tractor now and don't use it much anymore."

Prior to the steel framed Commander (also known as the combat commander) the Commander was only offered as a ""light weight"" alloy commander, while technically since it was the only Commander it was just called the ""Commander"". 

The pistol has the original grips (plastic/rubber material with colt Logo) as well as current Colt Commander wood grips (no logo). The current grips were taken off a 2012 Colt Steel Commander.

This Commander has holster wear, has moderate frame to slide wear with the oh so common colt ""rattle"". There are no cracks, no dings, and no problems with this Commander. I have shot over 200 rounds of 38 super and 200 rounds of 9mm. I have a high powered spring (new) set up for 38 super, as well as a new firing pin spring. This has been my carry gun for the last few months. In 9mm the spring that came with the pistol works (although I do not know the weight). I have not tried the high powered Wolff spring with 9mm, but suspect it is far to heavy. 

The pistol comes with both a 38 super barrel and bushing as well as 9mm barrel and bushing. Unknown manufacture of the barrels, but the 38 super is a ""new"" style and you will not have any of the common 38 super accuracy or extraction issues that 38 super barrels pre 1970s had.

I have one original 38 super COLT mag that works fine, although the spring may need a changing. I have a 9mm marked mag that fits 38 super, I have a dedicated newer 9mm mag. If you don't already know, 38 mags will take 9mm, 9mm mags will not take 38 super.

It is a fantastic pistol, and you get to own a light weight 1911 commander that shoots cheap. The 38 super is a fantastic cartridge. I have shot some of the corbon self defense rounds through it, which far exceed the energy of most .45acp comparable loads. The hot 38 super is equivalent to 9mm +P+, and just bellow .357 sig, yet it still has less recoil (subjective) then the .45 commanders I have shot.

I am open to trades with cash. The barrels and bushings will not be separated. 

Meeting in public, have CCW, be willing to fill out Washington State pistol transfer form. 

If you do not meet the criteria, or have a trade, or want to negotiate the price, please contact me. I am rather firm on the value, as I know what these go for and how much barrels are, but it does not hurt."

I realize this will generate hate mail and be flagged away, but let this be encouragement to those who still appreciate firearms as an American tradition and hobby.

 In the last 2-ish years, I have sold or traded  probably 5 firearms through contacts on armslist.  I have also bought just as many, plus a few more.  Every gun I have sold has been at a better than fair market price tag, because I don't own a gun shop and this isn't how I make my living.  Why would I expect to sell used firearms for more than I paid an actual dealer?  Nonsense.  The obvious exceptions are the ones I bought new for $80... 40 years ago.

I believe what comes around goes around.  And to this end, every single firearm I have purchased off this site has also been at a fair market value.  It's not magic or hocus pocus or karma.  That's the way the world turns people.  Stop trying to screw one another over, it will bite you back.

I hope this is an encouragement to those who are frustrated with the way this site is changing.  Don't abandon ship, there are still good people out there who enjoy firearms for what they are, not how much money they can make."

I was surprised at the accuracy and at 100 yards, it produced a very small pattern with just the open sights.  We took it out at night and the flash suppresser proved to be an effective working feature.  

Included is one standard 10 round clip.  The rear site is a flip up sight that is incremented to 800 yards.  I haven’t tested that as if I shoot over 100 yards, I want a nice scope to help me out. :)

With this weapon, I am including 1 opened box (20 ea.) of .303, 174 GR. Ball Cartridges.  Also included are 4 boxes (48 each) of .303 D.I.M VII full metal jacket rounds.  3 of the boxes are unopened and have the full 48 rounds.  The one open box may be a few rounds short.  The open box matches the other 3 as far as labeling as the picture shows.  I can only assume it is the same full metal jacket ammo in the unopened boxes.  

This weapon is really fun to shoot and also because of the condition, a great collectors piece.  More detailed photos of the weapon or ammunition are available upon request.
