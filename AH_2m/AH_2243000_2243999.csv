Why am I getting rid of a perfectly good scope? I’m selling them off to fund the purchase of high quality iron sights on a safari rifle I’ve built. The Marlin has been converted to a tang sight (which I think looks better). I can sell everything separately piece by piece or (as I'd prefer it) all together for $280 (you save $145).

I have for sale a special deal (and a treat for all those who enjoy lever action rifles) on a scout scope combo for a Marlin 1894. Here’s what I got…

• Weaver Marlin 1894 scout mount (sell for $35 new) $25
• Leupold FXII Scout IER 2.5x28mm (sell for $300 new) $275
• Leupold QRW 1” LOW scope rings (sell for $60 new) $ 50
• Williams FP receiver sight w/target knobs (sell for $85 new) $75

All of these accessories were mounted at one point on my Marlin 1894, but they all are less than 2 years old. The scout scope is great for deer hunting here in Indiana. Why am I getting rid of a perfectly good scope? I’m selling them off to fund the purchase of high quality iron sights on a safari rifle I’ve built. The Marlin has been converted to a tang sight (which I think looks better). I can sell everything separately piece by piece or (as I'd prefer it) all together for $280 (you save $145). Cash or money order only. Will mail if you want them, but you’re paying the shipping cost (probably use USPS). Thanks for looking."

this was my girlfriends gun that i bought for her to use for ccw. we broke up and I have a kelteck PF9 so i dont need this one. If you would rather have the PF9 let me know, it has two mags with externders also and two holsters, but i would want a little more for that one. if you dont know what the difference is, the p11 is a double stack, it holds 10-9mm rounds and is comparable in size to a glock 26/27. its smaller, but not by much. the PF9 is a single stack so it holds 7-9mm and is much thinner. overall length is about the same. the PF9 is just thinner. makes a good ""pocket rocket"". both guns shoot POA/POI at close ranges. i have not fired them farther than 10 yards because thats not what they were designed for. 5 yds accuracy is awesome, 10 yards the group starts to open up.... beyond that who knows... lol. what you see in the pic is what you get for asking price. other options negotiable.

Molot VEPR 7.62x54R (20.5"" barrel, integrated sights, slant receiver, 2 5-round magazines) and a POSP 8x42 D scope (1000m illuminated reticle, fine focus diopter ring).

I bought this rifle from Centerfire Systems in the spring of 2013. They offered up a few of these at a sale price of $750 for one day while they were normally selling them at around $1000. I had been keeping my eye on the price and jumped on the deal when I saw it. Since I've purchased it I've put about 220 round through it (split a 440 round can with a friend).

PRICE:
Right now these are being sold (with square receiver) for $729. The POSP 8x42 D costs $280.

So, $729 for the VEPR + $20 FFL fee + $20 shipping + $280 for the scope + $15 shipping = $1064

I'M OFFERING THE RIFLE AND SCOPE FOR $700, FIRM.

If you're not picking this up locally, then it will cost $20 to have it shipped from my FFL to yours. If you're local and would like to inspect this in person, I can meet up with you at a range and I'll let you look it over, shoot it, etc..

WHY I'M SELLING:
Have you heard about the upcoming changes to the NFA regulations? Well, they are going to start requiring fingerprints, photos and law enforcement signatures even if you are getting your NFA items through a trust, LLC, corporation, etc.. This really sucks for people like me who live in a county where CLEOs refuse to sign off on the paperwork. Basically if I want to own any NFA stuff, I have a small window here to set up a trust, purchase some NFA items, pay the tax stamps, and submit my paperwork to the ATF, before the changes come into effect. (The other option would be to move to a different county, but I can't do that right now.) That's what I'm putting the funds from this rifle towards.

Thanks for looking.

EDIT: I don't have a picture of the POSP scope at the moment, but I can upload one here in the next day or two.

The rifle has been sold!"

The dollar amount is JUST a number.  What I get doesn't need to be money.  I live in London & work in Delaware, so I am no stranger to driving.  Let me know what you think it's worth.  We can work something out.  Cash, trade, etc.  I have a motorcycle that needs diagnosed.  Locally raised beef?  I have an open mind regarding what I get in return for this stuff.  These are just my ideas.  Your ideas might be even more interesting.

This was the press I started on.  I drove to Cabela's in Wheeling because the Columbus store didn't have any.  I learned a lot while using it and have upgraded since then.  I bought a 20 gauge conversion for the press so I could load trap shells for a young lady who shoots on the team with my sons. She has switched to 12 gauge since then.

What's for sale:
Lee Load All II Press in 20 gauge configuration at this time
Automatic Primer Feed
Lee 12 gauge conversion kit
Alliant 20/28 Shotshell Powder (almost 1lb)
20 Gauge Claybuster Wads (more than 400, ledd than 500)
All of the original powder dies, shot dies and mounting hardware for this press
Resizing dies and shell holders for both gauges
Alliant Reloading Manual 2013 Edition

All of this equipment and these supplies, if purchased new, would cost about $125 before tax.  If you want to start reloading, you'll only need to get hulls, shot and primers (if you want to load 20 gauge)

I am willing to trade up or down.  If you have an offer, feel free to send me an e-mail. The worst I'll do is decline politely."

It's a pretty sexy weapon. Bought it almost 10 years ago, selling it now because I might as well cash in on the gun scare while it's still going on. 

The stock is in good condition and the folding mechanism works smoothly, the butt of the stock functions as a grip when folded inwards.  It's a Bushnell scope, you get what you pay for, but it works pretty well on a .22 LR. The magazine loader is the crank style and works well. 

The stock sells for 90 to 100 dollars online (92 and change on cheaper than dirt), the scope is probably around 50 bucks and a NIB stainless 10/22 is about 350.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

After doing some thinking, I am willing to take partial trades or sell the AR outright. Price is 1050 obo. I am not willing to separate the package as this will be my last 223 gun since I am working on my 300 sbr build right now. I am still looking for a pf9, carry revolvers, 45-70, 444, 454 or any weapon that may catch my interest. I am not really looking for an AK though. Thanks guys!

The VE is the new improved SD model. The SD VE is a striker fired semi-automatic pistol. This trigger system prevents the firearm from discharging unless the trigger is fully depressed, even if the pistol is dropped. The SD's aggressive front and back strap texturing along with the textured finger locator allow the shooter to enhance their grip and reduce recoil.

I'm listing and selling this for a good friend of mine who is computer illiterate and could use the money to finance other projects.   

As stated earlier, the lower is Superior Arms and the upper is unknown but when I bought it I was told that it is a Bushmaster. I have no way of verifying this as the only markings on the barrel are 1/9 for the twist rate. TH barrel length is 14.5"" with a Surefire flash hider pinned on. It comes with an Aimpoint Comp M2 on a ARMS QR mount, ARMS rear flip sight, and a redi-mag. Stock and tube are Vltor, grip is a MagPul MIAD, and the rail is a Surefire M73 with a generic KAC style fore grip. The sling is a Blackhawk and thit has an enlarged magazine release button. It also comes with a Bulldog ACU AR soft case and one Aluminum GI style 30rd mag. So we're looking at over $1300 just in accessories on this guy. The paint job (not my work) is a home made krylon not a duracoat. If you don't like it then it shouldn't be to hard to strip it or just spray over it.

I'm asking $1300 for the whole package (was $1400). Buyer pays $35 shipped from me via FedEx to your FFL. If you FFL does not take personal shipments then any additional cost my FFL charges will be passed on to you. Either way this rifle is a hell of a deal. Feel free to ask any questions and I can take some better pics upon request. I'm not interested in any trades at this time.  Thanks for looking!"
