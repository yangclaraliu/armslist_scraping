This is a light weight, pencil profile barreled, AR 15 chambered in 5.56/.223.

It starts with a P.S.A. railed upper mated to a 16 inch pencil profile, 1/9 twist chrome moly vanadium steel barrel, chambered in 5.56, chrome lined chamber, enhanced m4 feed ramps, same plane railed gas block from core 15. R.R.A. lower (bolt catch has been milled off) with PSA p-tac trigger and stock assembly. also has a Pro Mag dual aperture rear flip up iron sight. All mil-spec. ran 500 rounds without a hitch.

The milled/missing bolt catch does not affect the rifles ability to cycle or function as any other AR, it acts as an additional gas vent so less of it comes out the gap between the upper and charging handle, otherwise known as your rear sight position or where your aiming eye is. It may not look attractive but this a minor feature was removed in order to enhance venting.

Many outdoor stores carry direct gas impingement AR variants by ""decent"" manufacturers for around $700 to $1100 brand new. I am not marketing/claiming this as worth that. I have more than one AR and am willing to part with this one. I am not selling or trading this firearm out of desperation or need for money. If I cant get a decent price, or trade, the gun works fine and will for years, my investment is secure :)

This is a light weight, pencil profile barreled, AR 15 chambered in 5.56/.223.

It starts with a P.S.A. railed upper mated to a 16 inch pencil profile, 1/9 twist chrome moly vanadium steel barrel, chambered in 5.56, chrome lined chamber, enhanced m4 feed ramps, same plane railed gas block from core 15. R.R.A. lower (bolt catch has been milled off) with PSA p-tac trigger and stock assembly. also has a Pro Mag dual aperture rear flip up iron sight. All mil-spec. ran 500 rounds without a hitch.

The milled/missing bolt catch does not affect the rifles ability to cycle or function as any other AR, it acts as an additional gas vent so less of it comes out the gap between the upper and charging handle, otherwise known as your rear sight position or where your aiming eye is. It may not look attractive but this a minor feature was removed in order to enhance venting.

Many outdoor stores carry direct gas impingement AR variants by ""decent"" manufacturers for around $700 to $1100 brand new. I am not marketing/claiming this as worth that. I have more than one AR and am willing to part with this one. I am not selling or trading this firearm out of desperation or need for money. If I cant get a decent price, or trade, the gun works fine and will for years, my investment is secure :)

The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well.  the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as i use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson. The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control.

Henry H004M Goldenboy .22 Mag Lever Action Rifle- 20.5″ Barrel, Brasslite Receiver, Walnut Stock, 12+1 Capacity

From Manufacturer:

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design.

The Golden Boy rifle’s awesome 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass buttplate and gleaming Brasslite receiver will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America’s Old West, when our company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original Henry lever action rifle.

Small game hunters and plinkers will appreciate its substantial 6¾ pound heft. It balances well and makes for highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness lever-lovers long for. Get one in your hands and take aim. See what a natural pointer it really is.
Adding to the historic authenticity is the adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. The .22 Mag holds 12+1 rounds and will provide a whole lot of shooting pleasure before it’s time to reload their tubular magazines.

Approx 1,280 rounds of Ultramax .40 Cal 180grain factory reloads.  If your not familiar with Ultramax, here is their website:http://www.ultramaxammunition.com/home.html
I purchased this ammo a while back and have recently sold my last .40 cal pistol so I don't really have a need for it.  All rounds a brass case with Remington, Speer, and Winchester head stamps.  So when I say approx 1,280 rounds this is how i got there:
2 rounds weigh 1.191oz so well call it 1 oz
32 rounds in 1lb
32 rounds times the 40lb box gets us to 1,280 rounds
I'm basing my price on the current 180 grain target loads I'm finding online at about .34 cents per round and that I have 1,200 rounds, so I'm going to ask .30 cents per round to get us to a total of 360.00.  I'm doing this because 1. I don't need them and 2. let someone who does have a good deal.  Save yourself the extra money for shipping and hazmat fees.

Some of you may know me as Justin Regan from River City Arms. I am currently a home based Dealer/FFL located at the Broadway/Houghton intersection on the east side of Tucson. It has been my honor to help all of you firearms enthusiasts obtain guns, ammunition and accessories in the past 6 months I've been here. I sincerely thank each and every person that has used my services to help accomplish their shooting goals thus far! It has been truly an amazing experience getting your messages of encouragement and your positive reviews along the way- I hope you'll continue to support me in my ventures!

I am writing this because I am now trying to move along my plan to open a gun store here on the east side of Tucson. Yes, I know what you're thinking- there are so many stores already in the area. However, I want to open something special. I want my store to be the fairest priced, friendliest and overall most inviting gun store you've ever visited. I LOVE the shooting community and have found this to be my true calling in life. I actually look forward to working 10-12+ hours a day at the shop as crazy as that may sound! Along with being a gun dealer, I will have my SOT 03 beginning in July and will be able to order or transfer Suppressors, Short Barrel Rifles and/or Civilian Legal Machines Guns at that time as well. I only plan on charging a $40 transfer fee for ""Class 3"" transfers, unlike most other shops asking for $100 or more for these services.

So if you or anyone you know would have any interest investing in this small business ""start-up,"" please let me know via e-mail at REDACTED or via phone (call or text) 8o4-683-5o53. For those helping me start up this shop, I will make sure reward you for your efforts in the form of perks at the store, such as discounted or free firearm transfers for life for example. This is my dream, I will do whatever it takes to help it succeed!

Thanks for your time and thanks for reading!"

Rather give a Walther fan a chance to own a excellent example of German craftsmanship. 1600-2000 on certain Websites for this firearm. I am open to negotiate. Thanks for looking.

I have put a total of 80 rounds through this gun of various loads since the conversion and it has functioned flawlessly with zero failures.

I am a fan of CZ’s and wanted a 75B in .40 because I like my 9mm so much.  I bought this pistol, but then found one in duo tone that totally matched my 9mm, so I will now part with this one.  Pistol comes with two 10-round magazines with bumpers and original box, but no cleaning tools or manual, just the way I bought it.  There are some blemishes on the rear sight and right rear of the slide from the previous owner’s sight adjustments.  Again, just as I bought it.  If you know CZ’s at all, you know they have very, very tight sight dovetails. From the previous owner, I do know that the sights on this pistol were installed by the CZ Custom Shop.  This pistol is very clean and has a bright bore.  I have fully disassembled and lubed and it is ready for many, many more rounds.  If you have never held a CZ 75B, you owe it to yourself to try one.

CCI is known in the shooting sports industry for having reliable ammunition that delivers exceptional performance every time the trigger is pulled. It is this reliability that makes this the ammunition of choice for the Swamp People, Troy and Jacob Landry, when they are taking huge gators in the Louisiana Bayou. 

CCI 36 Grain Mini-Mag ammunition is one of the most popular 22 Long Rifle rounds ever produced. It is the perfect load for shooters and hunters looking for a great round for a day at the range or an afternoon chasing small game and varmints. One of the great features of this ammunition is the clean-burning powder. This powder provides optimum velocity while maintaining consistent chamber pressures while keeping the firearm clean from powder residue helping to ensure the rifle will function in even the harshest conditions. The copper plated hollow point bullet offers reliable feeding and great penetration. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

BlackHawk CQC Holster Matte Finish engages the trigger guard as you holster the pistol and wont let go until you release it. The release is made using your normal drawing motion, with the trigger finger beside the holster body. As your trigger finger naturally comes to rest on the SERPA locks release mechanism, simply push the mechanism as you draw the weapon and it releases the gun for a smooth, fast draw.

This shotgun has never seen a shot shell, let alone chamber one, it's been kept in the safe, where it has remained the Queen, but now I'm in need of a differant carry piece for my C.P.L. so she's being put up for sale or trade! Like I said though, this beutiful shotgun has never been loaded or shot, or even left the house for that matter! Thinking it was going to be my wifes, I put nothing nut quality all around in to this gun!! It comes w/ the original box, paperwork, lock, ect...... This is by NO means a Tactical gun, in fact, the wood grain on the fore grip & butt stock is one of the finest I've seen from the factory! ( see pictures ) and it's ready for the woods / field, or most importantly HOME DEFENSE. In fact, I'll include some brand new bird shot, slugs, and OO-Buck for whatever you choose to do w/ it!! I'm looking tp sell outright, or trade?? If your interested, you can contact me via my e-mail at : REDACTED    or feel free to call from noon to 9:30p.m. To ( 586 ) two 6 three - 7 five 39! Kust ask for Jay!! Thankyou for looking, and God Bless!!"

The boat comes with 2 x fold-down seats, 2 x blue floating seat cushions, (Please be aware you will still NEED a pfd for each person!!!), an oar, and a 32lb thrust Minn Kota, variable speed trolling motor... The sale does not include a battery...
The boat has NO cracks or repairs... The only thing is... I started to camo the boat but never finished, so it is two-toned atm :P Nothing a couple of cans of Krylon will not fix...
So... All you need to be ready for this upcoming fishing season, is a battery, PFD's, and a registration from the bmv!!! The price starts at $350.00 and the boat is located in Pendleton, IN. ... So get it before the Memorial Day rush!!!
If this ad is still up, it is still available, for sale..."
