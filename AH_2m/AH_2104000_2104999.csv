Apparently they have quit making these but this has the dedicated Glock magazine lower. 16"" barrel flat top w/A2 flash hider and full quad rail. I removed the A2 front sight but still have it and can reinstall it if you want. You can see where it was mounted on the barrel in the picture. I put the folding Magpul BUS on along with an Aimpoint Micro H1 red dot. The Aimpoint is on a KZ tall mount so you can shoot with the red dot and the MBUS at the same time(co-witness?) 
 I have three 33 round mags, 2 Glock, one Korean but they all work great. I also have two 50 round(they actually hold 55) drum magazines. 
 I bought this from JS gun parts in Olympia early in 2010. I am the only owner and have fired 500 rounds at the very most through it. 

 I am more interested in trading rather than selling and am looking for a Scar 17S with cash on my end to equal actual value. The only other thing I am looking for right now would be a compact SA .45 or a semi auto 12gauge.  With the additions to the rifle(rail, scope, mount, BUS) and mags, I have just over $2000 invested in this. I would sell it all for $1600/BO but again would rather find an interesting trade/trades. The aimpoint H1 is new and has only been on the rifle to sight in. The sight and mount cost over $600. 
I will remove it for those not wanting to spend the extra money that it costs.
I can also sell the RIFLE ONLY as it came from Olympic for $850

WA DL, CPL, or Bill of sale for my records only. I can ship if your FFL takes shipments from private parties only."

Im not going to list a price i will be willing to pay since it all depends on how many mags and if the finish is all nickel vs nitride, and has wood grips. But im willing to start at $350 for a nitride finish and one magazine. Im not too concerned for the wood grips, i can buy those anywhere. The mags are out there but not as common as most think.

I want to do it again but just a bit different.  So... I'm offering this build for sale, to you, for your shooting enjoyment.  The great part is that you can continue to have fun modifying further to make it your own.

It started as a Glock 22 Gen3 LE trade in very good condition.  Then, I did a light coat of DuraCoat to the original slide to eliminate the holster wear marks. Wow, it looks great.  Then I added a Lone Wolf ""40 S&W to 9 mm"" Lone Wolf barrel.  Wanted to cheapen up my range ammo costs.  Now I had a Glock G22 and a G17.

And then I added: Lone Wolf Slide
Lone Wolf Glock G35 slide with Lone Wolf parts and a stock length Lone Wolf G35 barrel.  The striker is Glock OEM.  Glock OEM front and adjustable rear polymer sights (with tool).  ""Matt Black"" Duracoat because... I like a black pistol.  Then I added a Lone Wolf G35 ""40 to 9"" conversion barrel as well. 

Frame:
Original Glock G22 frame.  Ghost ""Ultimate"" 3.5# and a Lone Wolf ""Ultimate Trigger Housing"".

You are purchasing: 
Complete Glock G22 (matching numbers) with Ghost 3.5# ""Ultimate"" trigger connector and a ""Lone Wolf Ultimate Trigger Housing"".  
TRUGLO Fiber Optic ""Brite Site"" Sight Set Red Front and Green Rear on the G22 slide.
Factory barrel. 
Extended Magazine, slide release and slide lock.
Lone Wolf G22 40 S&W to 9MM stock length conversion barrel.  
""Decal Grips"" sand texture and a ""Grip Force"" Beavertail.
Two 15 rd Glock OEM 40 S&W and two KCI 17 rd 9 mm magazines. 
Lone Wolf G35 slide, coated with Duracoat ""Matt Black"".  New OEM recoil spring for the G35 slide.  OEM striker. Lone Wolf Marine cups and 4# striker spring.
""Lone Wolf"" G35 standard length 40 S&W barrel
""Lone Wolf"" G35 ""40 S&W to 9 MM conversion barrel"".

To sum it all up:
In one pistol you have a Glock: G17, G22, G34, G35.  Add a set of 357 Sig barrels and you can shoot 3 different calibers and add a G31 to the mix as well as a long slide 357 Sig.  If you care to add up everything, you'll find there's over $1500 invested here.  This is a great starting point to have some fun and customize even further.  I'm open to offers both cash and trade.

Shipping:
Ships Priority Mail Insured from my FFL to yours or local pickup.  No shipping to California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. In jurisdictions where 11 round magazines are restricted to law enforcement only, please ""bid accordingly"" as I will not include the magazines.

Reason being, I bought this gun and it was all kinds of shitty looking, but it shot straight as an arrow.. So i decided to ""polish the turd"" so to speak, I redid the stock, the procedure used on the stock is how a luthier stains a guitar, and it turned out amazing!!!  I didnt just shove some tru oil on it a couple times and call it a day.

mods done to the gun.
1.  Sand and refinish the stock
2.  Trigger job, the sear was squared to get a crisp trigger break
3.  Allen Bolts instead of the stock bolts to hold the stock the action were installed to get better accuracy, stock is not bedded.
4.  Re-crown the crown and Re-blue for better accuracy.
5. The bolt is blued as well, reason, shiny parts on guns give away your position. plus is looks kick ass.


gun is very very accurate.. and now is a ""polisihed turd"". and it looks beautiful.. the pictures don't do it justice. 

Priced to sell,  starting at 250, for the cost of the gun, and the labor the bolts and the trigger job and all the materials needed to make this ""turd"" look amazing!!

Will consider trades, or trade and cash offers. or maybe you dont want to pay 200, what do you want to pay for this, will consider those as well..
Willing to wheel and deal on this.. so lets deal..:)

I prefer a FTF transaction, I have a state ID and a CCL"

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Just add optics and ammo and it’s ready to hunt or turn heads at the range.
Oracle is an excellent entry-level upper assembly that incorporates the versatility of the A3 Flat-Top configuration in selecting a preferred sighting arrangement with a solid, fully functional foundation of quality components. It is the perfect way to get into the larger, more powerful LR-308 platform, and is an ideal candidate for future user customization.
The Oracle features a 16"" Heavy Contour Barrel with a versatile 1:10 rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. It utilizes a flattop upper receiver with forward assist, ejection port door and integral shell deflector. The upper comes equipped with heat resistant polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle, complete bolt & carrier assembly, and an A2 birdcage flash hider. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black. 
I ship all rifles by UPS ground for a flat fee of $35. Alaska and Hawaii are more. The turn-around time once payment is received is generally within 24 hours unless a weekend or holiday.

 Daniel Defense Ambush V7 RealTree chambered in .300 AAC Blackout. It has a 16"" Cold Hammer Forged, Magnetic Particle tested barrel with 1:8"" twist. A Geissele SSA two stage trigger is installed. The Mil Spec upper receiver has M4 feed ramps and a flat top Picatinny rail. The Daniel Defense Modular Float Rail 12.0 tubular handguard is free floated with top mounted Picatinny rail and modular Picatinny rail segments and has a shotgun-inspired grip. A MOE 6 position butt stock is installed.

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm, which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the lightweight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm. The 300 Blackout cartidge was designed with sound supression in mind, and with subsonic ammunition results in surprisingly quiet shooting.

Thank you for keeping us safe and protecting our liberty. With gratitude as their charge, Troop Fuel has created Troop Vision, a 501(c)(3) which receives a portion of the profits from Troop Fuel sales to fund Veteran's programs. We support our troops and veterans and will continue until all homeless and hungry vets are taken care of.

Unlike most charities which have vaguely defined 'end goals' or 'success points,' their goal for every Veteran housed who wants and needs housing will be completed by 2017. For the folks at Troop Vision, the problem of Veteran housing is definable and finite. By working with the VA, who is able to track homeless Veterans locations and conditions, they concentrate their housing efforts in the greatest epicenters of homeless Veterans across the nation, typically within walking distance of VA hospitals.
