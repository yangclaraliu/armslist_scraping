I have a surplus military-issue ACOG red dot I need to get rid of -- this is a genuine older model Trijicon that requires no batteries, as the red dot is powered by a tritium insert. The brightness of the dot is augmented by fiber optics that dramatically increase the visibility of the dot in sunlight and keep it lower in dark environments. I have it attached to a carry handle with mount so it can be set up for absolute co-witnessing. I have this rig set up on an M-4 configured AR and it works awesomely (is that a word?), but I have decided to get a scope instead.

And we were out there a lot, every weekend and occasionally during the week as well.

And since I wanted to get into reloading, I always gathered and kept the ""empties"". But, that just never happened and since I'll be moving in a few months, I'm looking to find a new home for these hulls.

They're almost exclusively 12 gauge, but there are a handful (couple dozen maybe) of 20 gauge and .410 in there as well. Like I said tho, 98% or more are 12 gauge.

Almost all of them are Remington or Federal, with a few from various other names. 

There are 5 crates of them. How big are the crates, you ask? They used to hold 135 clays, each.

I picked an averagly-full crate and started counting. I got to 200 and it was still at least 2/3 full, thus I'm estimating there are 2,500 to 3,000 hulls here in total.

They're all once-fired and have been stored out of the weather.

Ballistic Products sells once-fired winchesters for 10 cents a piece. As mentioned, these are mostly Federal's and Remington's, so I'm asking $250obo for the lot cash or

Price negotiable, also willing to trade for 7.62x54R, 7.62x39 or 5.45x39 (7N6 only). Cash preferred."

OVERVIEW:
Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

KEY FEATURES:
Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable
Rugged ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces
SuperCell™ recoil pad reduces the felt recoil up to 54%
Our softest-shooting pump gun ever
Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics
Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably

Description: 

The SIG516 Patrol FDE in Flat Dark Earth with a matching FDE Cerakote® finish on both the upper and lower receivers and aluminum handguard. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the Flat Dark Earth use the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. 

This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

A 16” chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating aluminum forend. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights."

This gun has always been on my ""must have"" list, but I just received another pistol as a gift from my wife and want try being a ""one gun man"".

The HP DA was FNs successful attempt to take all the best characteristics of the Hi Power and build the perfect DA/SA 9mm. It is slim, well balanced, very accurate, very safe and has a better DA trigger than any other gun I've owned or fired, including the Sig P226/P225/P228. The frame is all steel for long term durability, the dust cover has a second set of slide rails for accuracy and the decocking lever is ambidextrous. Factory finish is a baked on polymer. At 32 oz it is 2 oz lighter than a aluminum framed P226 or Beretta 92, and is the slimmest full size wondernine you'll find. Service weapon of Finland's very serious armed services.

Asking price includes 4 factory hi caps (more are available from online vendors) and 3 ten round factory mags, plus FN case, manual and lock.

Condition is excellent - there are some small surface scratches in the finish that aren't through to the metal."

It has Trijicon night sights, and all 3 mags have a +1 pinky extension added. It also has a Vickers Tactical extended mag release, and Vickers Tactical Tango Down extended slide catch. I also have a Comp tac Hybrid IWB holster for it. It is in mint condition, and I have ammo for it for the right deal. Please don't expect a value of a stock Glock. This Glock package has over $1,350.00 invested in it. I don't expect to get that much back out of it, but I won't let it go for $500.00. If you want a stock Glock then this is not the Glock for you. Look up the cost of these upgrades if you need a price guideline. It is leaps and bounds better than a stock glock. It shoots amazingly, and is an amazing firearm. No malfunction or fte with all the upgrades. The trigger is perfect for self defense, but can be adjusted from 2 to 6 lbs.  the pre travel and over travel can also be adjusted.

Lever, and a Rainier Arms Raptor ambi charging handle. It is in mint condition and has been fired less than 100 times. The trade value is $1,650.00 with over $200.00 in ammo, $90.00 Raptor charging handle, and $30.00 Troy bolt catch. Also 2 extra mags at $50.00. The gun is $1,500.00. So $1,650.00 is a fair deal for trade value."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including two BRAND NEW, factory fresh Glock 17 9mm Gen 4 pistols! These legendary handguns feature three different grip options to fit any size hand, and a huge 17-round magazine!

I have only two in stock, and have them priced to sell for just $535.00 (cash price).

Glock 17 Gen 4 Pistol, 9mm, 17-Round Magazine, 4.49″ Barrel, Matte Black- Glock PG1750203

The GLOCK 17 Gen4, in 9×19, introduces revolutionary design changes to the world’s most popular pistol. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter’s hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G17 Gen4 9x19mm pistol also retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.
The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.
The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap.

The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

The shotgun is a lot of fun. Great for trap shooting. It cycles very fast and is more reliable than the older saigas. The slidefire takes a magazine or two to learn but works great once you get the hang of it. The drum is harder to bumpfire due to the weight, I think a vertical foregrip would make it easier.

589,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2519589,For Sale:   .45 AUTO RIM STANDARD PRESSURE AMMO - 255 GR. H.C. F.N. (850 FPS/ M.E. 409 FT. LBS) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Friday, January 3, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=72


You've been asking for a couple heavy 45 AUTO RIM standard pressure loads, so by popular demand, here they are. Both of these loads utilize high quality Starline brass. We've also incorporated flash suppressed powder so you can shoot in the dark without blinding yourself and this is important because over 95% of all civilian shootings in the USA occur in low light when the criminal element is at work. Both of these loads are the ballistic equivalent of +P 45 ACP loads, yet they operate at standard 45 ACP pressures. These loads are safe to use in ANY 45 ACP revolver that is in normal operating condition, including ANY model 1917 Colt or S&W revolver.

Check out the below velocities fired from personal real world revolvers, NOT test barrels. You'll notice that the new S&W 4 inch MT Gun gives velocities almost as fast as the older S&W revolvers with 5.5 inch and 6.5 inch barrels. This is not a typo. It simply shows that the new S&W revolvers are made to much tighter tolerances than the older S&W revolvers and therefore give higher velocities per inch of barrel.

Item # 31A - 255gr. hard cast flat nose bullet
S&W Mountain Gun, 4 inch bbl = 869 FPS
S&W Model 325 (scandium) 2.5 inch bbl = 795 FPS
S&W Model 1917 (1937 production) 5.5 inch bbl = 880 FPS
S&W 1955 Target (25-2) 6.5 inch bbl = 875 FPS

Item # 31A was designed for deep penetration with no bullet expansion. It will shoot through stick frame and dry wall construction walls and through both doors on a 2003 Dodge Ram or through a black bears skull, etc. It was designed for, among other things, outdoor use including black bear protection. Expect around 27 inches of penetration through live flesh and bone."

A reproduction of the 1873 Single Action. This model is one of the most accurate in appearance while reproducing the Old West tradition of the classic sixgun chambered for rimfire cartridges! While maintaining the true to form classic design, our Single Action revolver is a hybrid of modern technology and manufacturing with the feel of the Old West. This revolver is crafted with a steel rifled barrel, with most of the mechanism and components constructed from a special formulated alloy that offers greater ductility and flexibility assuring long lasting reliability and durability. Black plastic chequered grips give feel and balance, while a manual locking safety provides additional protection with a highly visible red indicator showing when it's ready to shoot. This great little pistol is available in .22 LR and .22 Win Mag., and at a price that will fit any shooters budget without sacrificing quality."

It comes with the Bushnell 3-9x40 scope and 2 magazines.

These usually have very bad holster wear but this is one of the best one's I've seen.  Slide has some scuffs and scratches but minimal holster wear, grips look new.  Shoots just as well as the other Sig's that Ive had but is a bit thinner due to the single stack mags.  The P225 is the precursor to the P239 and is pretty similar in dimensions.

Comes with two 8 round magazines which have good strong springs and a duty holster.

I like it but I'm wanting something with a bit higher capacity if I'm going to carry a 9mm, so I'd be interested in a mid sized or compact 9mm with a double stack mag like a Glock 19, XD 9 service model, M&P9 or similar.

I wasn't happy with the unfinished original stock so I refinished it.  I know it kills the collector value for some but for those that are buying a SKS rifle to shoot and look pretty; this one is for you!  10 round capacity.  Numbers match on stock, bolt, magazine, receiver and receiver cover.  Comes equipped with the grenade launcher attachment, blade bayonet and sling attachments.  The weight of this rifle absorbs a good deal of recoil and it makes it a fun weapon to shoot.  Manufactured in 1975.  No rust, freckling or pitting.  This rifle has been meticulously cleaned after each time it was shot, including the gas tube.  The import mark is very small and hidden on the underside of the barrel near the cleaning rod.  I'm located in the Cedar Creek area of Greeneville.  I have several weapons listed so check them out.  I may take partial trade of .22 LR or .22 WMR ammo, but not at Gunbroker prices.  I'm not going to try to give you 1990's value in trade, but I'm stocked well enough not to pay ridiculous amounts!  I am also looking for an Eotech, FYI.

The same quality and dependability built into our Starfire ammunition is incorporated throughout our extensive line of PMC training ammunition and standard hollow point or soft point ammunition. 

All PMC cartridges must pass through the rigorous inspection of our electronic powder check station. This station accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by a tiny amount - just two tenths of one grain - the system stops and that cartridge is discarded. 

No other ammunition manufacturer can truthfully assure you greater uniformity and reliability than PMC.

The weapon itself is in great shape, would say minimum 90%, but I am not a professional grader, and that is what I would base it off of if the gun was brand new at 100%  There shows wear behind ejection port about a square inch from brass (typical from shooting from what I'm told), wear on the bottom of the mag well from mags (again typical from what I'm told), Very minor wear from a claw mount (no damage, minor wear), and some minor wear on the flash hider and on underside of barrel (my guess from resting on something). Everything on the gun is original to the gun with the exception of the butt stock to my knowledge (again, told that, but not sure why there're different date codes, someone more versed in HK;s will know. Please PM me if I am totally wrong here so I can change, just passing on what I was told), but selling as is since I am not an HK expert.  It has a SEF style trigger pack which I'm not sure is original or not, but if not, I also have an HK numbered (0,1) trigger pack I can include ( buyer gets choice of pack, not both)

 I was told from previous owner it only had a couple hundred rounds, but looks like it has more than that considering the wear from brass behind ejection port opening.  It had the paddle release install done back in the early 90's, I was told by Vollmer, but can't confirm this.

Bernardelli Model 90 .22 LR.  It was made in Italy and sold in the US by Interarms.  The gun carries both Bernardelli and Interarms markings along the barrel and on the grips.
This was a prime piece when new and is still respectable.  The bluing is worn from both sides of the nose as shown in the photos.  The rear sight is adjustable, there is a thumb safety, magazine extension to accommodate the little finger, and the grips are ergonomically widened near the magazine end--it feels like a big gun in your hand.  As with most .22 semi's, this pistol functions best with high velocity ammo, so while it will fire cheap shells, it is not reliable with them.  I use Remington yellow jackets and the piece sings--the CCi's and other high velocity ammo should also work.
Looking for $125.  I will consider reasonable cash offers--no trades.  Face-to-face transaction in Lafayette.  You must be 21 or older and not a felon.

 The H&K MP5 SD offered by Umarex USA is a rimfire rifle authentic in looks, feel, and operation. This HK clone is engineered as a dedicated .22 Long Rifle. It’s built with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK MP5-style sights. The sound dampener (SD) is actually a compensator. It is attached to conceal the 16.1 inch barrel that extends the full length of the gun and compensator.

The MP5’s magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed for ease of loading with dual grips for holding the spring when loading. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine.

The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing.

I have what experts around here have indicated to be a VERY rare Highpower.  I bought it from the factory in 69 while stationed in Germany.

The one I got is a T-series, factory blued, with a Commander hammer, and factory plastic grips.  No one has seen one from that era like it.  It may have been left over from a run for a European Police Dept or special military unit?  it has been loaded, but Dad never shot it, as it really wasn't what he wanted.  It's in the original black bag with red lining, and except for a small blemish from who knows where, is in prestine condition.  No trades, money to go to his Great Grand kids college fund. Photographs upon request.  Found out on 1/4/14 that they probably  went on special order to the British SAS, with a lanyard ring attached.

Writeup per AO Site:
The Thompson Custom 1911 frames are machined on high precision computerized machinery from a 420 stainless steel casting. The slide is machined from a solid stainless steel billet utilizing specialized tooling to reduce set-up and refixturing. The combination of high precision equipment and fewer set-ups result in a higher quality and more consistent final product at a lower price.

The slide and frame are finished in an attractive matte finish, markings are laser-engraved including the distinctive Thompson bullet logo on the slide. Front and rear sights are black with serrations and are dovetailed into the slide. The ejection port is flared and the slide has front and rear serrations machined at a slight angle. The mainspring housing is checkered and the frontstrap is machine checkered at 20 lines per inch. Additional features include an adjustable trigger, combat hammer, stainless steel, full-length recoil guide rod, extended beavertail grip safety; extended magazine release; checkered laminate grips with a Thompson bullet logo inlay and a checkered slide stop lever."

But the latch itself is still functional, and won't affect the gun function wise. Brand new handguard latch is included with the sale. This gun/variant is getting hard to come by lately. Thumbhole stock is not original to the gun. I took this gun on a trade and had a regular buttstock on it, and decided to install a thumbhole stock for the 922(R) compliance. Thumbhole stock is in excellent condition, no cracks, scratches, or splits. However, it has a couple of very minor dents. Just installed a rear sling swivel on the buttstock (a few days after the pictures were taken). The Hungarian SA-85Ms (sporters) were imported by KBI, Inc. of Pennsylvania back in the early 90's. Sorry about the pictures. I’m not a good photographer. The gun looks way better in person than the pictures. Must be at least 18 years old, or older (with proper ID) only to buy this gun. Thanks for looking. Happy New Year everyone.
