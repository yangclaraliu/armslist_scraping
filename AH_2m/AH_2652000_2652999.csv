99,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2652099,"For Sale:  16"" Carbine Length AR15 5.45x39 Medium","Wilmington, Leland, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 750,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 4, 2014",Rifles,no type,5.45x39mm                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"A 16"" carbine length AR15 chambered in 5.45x39. 
The upper was built from a Daniel Defense standard ar15 upper receiver with m4 feedramps. 16"" Medium contour barrel, hard chromed chamber and bore 1:8 twist. Standard F stamped FSB. CMMG bolt carrier with Alexander Arms 5.45 bolt, extrasize gas rings and BCM SOPMOD extractor upgrade with extra strength extractor spring, harder insert and oring etc. Standard M4 handguards. Standard A2 flash hider. Standard AR charging handle. For lubrication I have only used slip 2000 EWL and phil wood grease for the bolt lugs and gas rings. Barrel nut torqued at 60 ft lbs. Proper headspace etc. Front sight base is actually only a few clicks away from top dead center which is great for a standard FSB. (My BCMs are many clicks but still within milspec). Only ever fired Silver Bear from this rifle, I save the corrosive surplus ammo for my beater. Although from personal experience using lacquered cased/berdan primed ammunition is okay if you clean your rifle. Every round fired from this rifle came from the same case of silver bear, which still looks to be about half full so it hasn't seen many rounds maybe 500 *just look at the brass deflector. 

The lower half is a CMMG standard lower receiver. I tried a couple receivers when building to make sure it fits snug with upper receiver. Standard milspec parts kit with a Wolf Extra power hammer spring for the hard primers you see on most 5.45 ammo. An end plate sling adapter so you can run a single point sling from the end of the receiver. Palmetto State Armory H buffer and buffer spring.  Magpul MOE pistol grip. Magpul enhanced trigger guard. Standard collapsible stock.

I really don't want to get rid of this rifle and I have been putting it off for months now making up excuses, but I need the money to get laser tattoo removal. Understand if you buy this you are buying a rifle chambered in 5.45x39 NOT 5.56x45. It is a soviet caliber designed to copy the standard cartridge our military used in the older M16s. The whole point of this build is to shoot thousands of rounds for cheap while using the same platform as your main rifle. It feels/sounds exactly the same as .223/5.56 and has the same ballistics so you don't have to use a different zero or ballistic reticle than your 5.56 rifle. Just zero at 50 meters or 36 yards or whatever you normally zero at, and enjoy shooting 1080 rounds for 130-160 bucks.  I have found that poa/poi (62g fmj silver bear) matches 77g 5.56 at 100 meters, shooting a little lower than 62g 5.56 probably because of slightly lower pressure and velocities from that particular cartridge, but is more accurate beyond 200 meters comparable to heavier OTM rounds. I can include a handful of mags including a pmag modified for 5.45. Message me and we can figure out when and where to do this."

I've done body work, engine work, all new brakes, rotors, pads, rocker arm, new front quarter panels (old ones were rusting). I put on new snow tires and wheels from a 2001 blazer. I cleaned the interior and fixed numerous other ""cosmetic"" things. I removed the remote starter and aftermarket radio. I have 2 factory radios (not installed) that come with. It rarely gets driven and when it does it's close to home here in town. although I put a new battery in it less than a year ago I had to jump it recently to get it to start. power windows (only driver's side front and rear work consistently). I've noticed a tranny fluid leak and the truck doesn't seem to do well going over 20-25mph. to get it home you'd have to fix it here or tow it (or drive 25mph the whole way). Odometer reads over 200,000 miles. If you have mechanical knowledge then you may be able to get her fixed and up and running well again in no time. and I have no time lol right now to do anything with it. before it sits any longer...come and rescue this truck! Could be a great farm workhorse. it could easily be parted out for well over $1000 if that's what you're in to...or it might be an easy fix. I'm honest and easy to get along with and I'm negotiable. You can come take a good long look at her any time you want.

199,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2652199,"For Sale:  Rem 870 Wingmaster 20ga Lwt Barrel 28"" Mod","Henrietta, Rochester, New York",$ 100,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 16, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Remington 870 Wingmaster 20ga Lightweight Barrel. 28"" Fixed Modified choke, Vent Rib, 3"" Chamber. Steel front bead.

This barrel is in unfired and excellent condition, a few VERY minor marks are present, probably from rattling around in the box over the years. In fact, I had to clean off the petrified factory preservative for the photos (after I cut the original factory tape on the box to open it). You aren't likely to find one in better condition.

OEM box is included with the barrel.

This barrel has the high-gloss Wingmaster finish, NOT the lower end Express finish.

This barrel is for the ""lightweight"" actions, 1972 to current mfg. If the serial number on your receiver ends in ""X"" or ""N"", then this barrel WILL NOT fit your gun. If it ends with anything else, then it WILL fit your gun.

As a secondary check, if a quarter WILL NOT fit through the barrel band (the part that goes around the magazine tube) of your existing barrel, then this barrel WILL fit on your gun. If a quarter WILL fit through the barrel band (meaning you have a full size/standardweight) of your existing barrel, then this barrel WILL NOT fit your gun.

This barrel WILL fit in the 870 Express Magnum 20ga guns, and would be a nice way to dress up your gun.

If you have a receiver/action stamped ""Magnum"", then you can shoot 3"" shells through your gun with this barrel. If your receiver is NOT stamped ""Magnum"" then you are limited to 2 3/4"" shells, since your action is not set up for magnum shells."

This is an M200 12 gauge, 3 inch chamber, 26 inch vent rib barrel with an adjustable choke, and wood furniture.  
*Some of you might be asking what is an M200?? Well Sears (the department store) bought a contract with Winchester back in the mid 70’s to have Winchester produce their model 1200 12 gauge shotgun with the Sears name stamped on the gun.  The guns were produced for a number of years, but after progressive/democratic politics attacking America’s civil liberties Sear along with many other department stores dropped their contracts with fire arm companies. 
This gun is the same as a Winchester 1200, all the controls and parts are the same. All Winchester model 1200 and 1300 barrels, manufacturer parts and aftermarket parts will fit and function on it.  
It is a great vintage hunting gun, or could be easily made into a home defender…..

Comes with vintage leather case!!

Must be in the Albany area or willing to drive here, must do NICS check, you pay any transverse fees from the FFL.

This is the model with the rail and the chrome finish.  Front black sight (biggest gripe out there on this model) has been replaced with a green fiber optic sight.  Also, finger grips added under the stock grips for better control.  Besides everything that came with it, also includes an extra 8 round mag.  I am not the original owner so I cannot attest to the round count.  However, everything looks great so it cannot of had very many rounds shot through it before I got it.  I have put 100 rounds through it with no malfunctions.  
This is a great entry level 1911.  Price new is $499 (cash) on budsgunshop.com.

Don't hit me up on price and I'll throw in a box of 50 rounds of FMJ or a ProMag 10 round mag (your choice).  Would not be selling except wife walked by the gun safe when I had it open and raised holy heck (maybe I should make her put some of her shoes on craigslist).  So, this one has to go.  If it does not sell, it will become my project 1911 and I'll have to find a hiding spot for it in the house.

Smith & Wesson Model 3913 Lady Smith 9mm. Pistol like new, comes with box and spare clip. Illinois residents required to do a  face to face meeting, F.O.I.D. and 72 hour wait after pistol is paid for. Buyers from out of state-I will need a clear copy of an FFL license. Contact me if you need a FFL copy from me , I can contact my local FFL dealer to make the necessary arrangements. Buyer will be responsible for any additional charges.  I am setting a $50 shipping fee since I have never shipped a firearm before. If there is enough money left over from shipping fee's to pay my local FFL dealer, then the buyer will not owe anything further. Serious offers considered. I am selling to invest in a Dillon XL 650, so if you have one of these maybe we can make a good deal for both of us.  This is a sweet little 9mm, fits right into your back pocket, excellent for concealed carry."

If you know AK47s then you know about the quality of the Polytech AK47 variants over just about any other variant out there. If you don't, just google ""Polytech AK Reviews"" and you'll see they're considered to be the finest AK variants to end up in the US. Anyway, take a look a the photos and I'll be glad to answer any questions you have. These rifles are superior to the US rifles in that they were assembled in factories and shipped over here complete, not some random mix and match parts kit from Romania assembled by some idiot at Century Arms. The factory this came from built and inspected the firearm before it was ever shipped. As such, the finish and fitment is unlike anything you can buy on the market today. I'm not the original owner as this was a KFS Atlanta pre ban import. 

Like all polytech AKs, this rifle has run flawlessly and has the smoothest bolt and action of any AK I've ever held. I own an Arsenal SLR which is a fine firearm, but honestly, this one is just smoother shooting. This AK was made in the famed ""Factory #386"" where the Polytech Legends were produced. When I take it to the range, it shoots 3-4MOA with iron sights and would likely do better if I was a better shot, haha. Rifle comes with 2 30-round magazines and sling, I can add more magazines or ammo to the trade at additional expense, let me know what you're thinking.

I prefer cash but would consider trading only for a New or LNIB Arsenal SAM7R with a fixed stock. The only other trades I would consider include MINT Sig P228 or P226 from W. Germany plus cash or a NIB P226 MK25 plus cash."

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It was been developed from Kel-Tec's highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters. 

The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The blued slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular inner frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The grip is checkered black polymer. The overall weight, loaded, is an incredibly light 11.1 ounces. This pistol ships in a hard padded case.

All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes.

Differences between the Arsenal SAM7r and the 101s is that the 101s says Made In Bulgaria and the receiver is not finished in Las Vegas. It comes with an Ultimak rail, 2 30rd steel mags, 1 5rd mag, Bushnell TRS-25 red dot that co-witness, US-Palm ak grip and all original accessories.

472,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2652472,For Trade:  Glock 19 Gen 3 9mm Trade (or sell) for Glock 29,"Vancouver, Southwest Washington, Washington",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 4, 2014",Handguns,Glock                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"First things first: this will need to be a face to face meet up and I will need to see your valid WA ID and CCW. If you don't have a CCW, then arrangements for an FFL will need to be made.

I'm looking to trade my Gen 3 G19 for a G29. I figure that there's got to be someone who bought one and just wasn't ready for a 10mm. SO, if anyone is actually interested, let me know. This was my dad's gun. He had it since new. When I turned of age, it was passed down to me. It was meticulously taken care of. I used white nail polish to get the emblem/serial number white. Can be removed upon request. Has night sights (last picture). Unknown round count. Comes with the standard Glock case, two magazines, and I can throw in a box of 50rds. I'd like to trade for an identical ""set up"" (case/two mags).

NOTE: I'm not trying to sell this, per say, I'm really just looking for a straight trade because it's easier. I may (strong emphasis on the hypothetical) be interested in opening it up to you Oregon fellows, but that WILL require an FFL."

It consists of a 16+"" barrel, internal slide, recoil spring, cocking handle and what you see externally. You can go to http://www.mechtechsys.com/index.php to check this out for yourself.  These are still built today so parts are easy to get.  This thing is built like a tank so you wont have to worry about it breaking.  I have put over 1000 rounds through this and it functions flawlessly!  It increases muzzle velocity by 40% to 60% because of the 16"" barrel.  I have had various red-dots sights and scopes on it.  You can dress it up like an AR15.  I have included the M4 stock adapter so you can add your own tube and stock if you like.  MechTech sells a short stock made for these but I have had a MagPul on this one and it looks cool.    

This is what is Included for the $550 asking price:

1)  Glock Basic Unit CCU in .357sig:  $360.00
2)  GlockBlocks: $34.00
1)  Tele Stock: $90.00
1)  M-4 Stock Adapter: $27.00
1)  Sling Loop (Front): $18.00
1)  Quad Rail: $120.00
1)  Muzzle Break: $15.00
Total retail cost of this package without the Glock lower is:   $675.00  

I am listing this CCU upper by itself with the optional that were installed by MechTech for $550.oo, the Glock lower is available at an additional cost.  The CCU is pictured with a custom stippled Gen-2 Glock 23 lower with an added rubber grip.  I will sell the Glock 23 lower with 3 magazines and its original box and throw in 200 rounds of .357sig ammo for an additional $350 if purchased as a package for $900.  I will consider trades of a quality S&W, Ruger or Colt Revolver, quality pistols or a quality 1911(nothing in 40S&W please).  If the MechTech CCU sells alone I will sell the Glock lower, with its original box, 3 magazines and loader for $350 and the 200 rounds of ammo for $100.00,  I have a few other AR-15 accessories that I will sell in a separate deal if you are interested.   

to recap...  The CCU package is $550 alone and $900 with the Glock lower and 200 rounds of ammo.  Low-Ball offers will be ignored.  Call/Text Rick 5O5*6IO*529I if you have any further questions. Thanks for looking."

It's a 7 shot top break. The side of the barrel says "".22 rim fire"". I have fired plenty of modern day .22lr out of it. It seems to like the subsonic ammo better, but it does mostly fine with the regular stuff too. No pitting in the barrel that I can see. I would call this a collector's piece due to its age. It still functions and the cylinder is still timed properly. I have successfully fired it and would consider it for limited use due to its age unless you have a competent gunsmith say otherwise. I'm selling it because I want to get something newer and it's a little too small for me to fire comfortably. It's old but it's a neat little gun to add to your collection.

Not really interested in trades, mainly because I'd rather have the cash to go towards my new gun. But if you have something like a hi point or jimenez 9mm or something else .22 I might be interested.

These Bad Boys are getting really scarce. I traded for it years ago and it has spent most of its life tucked away in my safe.  Less than a box of shells has been through the barrel. You can't truly appreciate one until you hold it in your grubby little hands. Sadly Smith & Wesson stopped production of these years ago and like I already said, they are getting really hard to find. ESPECIALLY a No Dash model that is in pristine condition that is sure to continue to go up in value. My only reason for selling is to buy a Dillon XL 650. If I don't sell it, oh well. Reasonable offers considered but low ballers are asked to not waste my time and I won't waste yours. 
Finally, this is Illinois and I have to play by there rules. In Illinois only, Face to Face, valid F.O.I.D. and a 72 hour wait after payment has been made. The only form of payment acceptable is cash. Any questions or if you want more pictures you can contact me through ARMSLIST.  Thank you!
Great news for out-of-state buyers. I contacted the Illinois State Police, and it is legal for me to sell a firearm-without the waiting period-to an out of state buyer. I will need a legible FFL copy from your dealer. I am going to set a $50 price tag on shipping since I don't know where I will be shipping the gun to. USA sales only! If you want  an FFL to FFL  from me, I will charge you whatever fee the local dealer charges me. Let me know and I will find out from him just how much his fee is. I can only accept Postal Money Orders from out of state buyers-pistol will not be shipped until the M.O. has cleared my bank.

Burris AR-536 is designed for lawmen, military, and competitive shooters who want additional range from a compact, fast- acquisition optic. The red or green illuminated reticle offers nano-second response to immediate targets but also allows for careful shooting at distant threats. A rotary, 10-position power selector allows for all lighting conditions and the reticle is powered by a CR2032 battery. The Ballistic CQ reticle features holdover dots, good out to 600 yards, that work best with 5.56 or 7.62 ammunition.

The flaking shellac on the stock was removed and replaced with a rubbed linseed-oil finish, which according to my research is what most Mosins apparently had prior to their rearsenal and and preparation for long-term storage in the 1950s and 60s.

The bluing on the barrel, receiver, and bayonet appear to be original and fully-intact and unlike some importer engravings this rifle bears only a small faint roll-mark on the barrel by the bayonet. The bolt is mostly still shiny but has darkened with use somewhat around the bolt handle. As you can see in the pictures the bore is bright, sharp, and shiny with no pitting or corrosion.

The rifle has been fully de-cosmolined and comes with several accessories- a bolt cleaning tool, muzzle cleaning rod guide, spare stock recoil bolt, a two-compartment oil can, two spare ejectors, a bolt cocking peice, cleaning rod, and a period-correct dog-collar style canvas sling.

I have 3000 rounds of extra 9mm ammo. It is Winchester and Federal factory 100 round boxes.  $30 per hundred rounds.     This is what I have in them and they were much more than this at the recent gun show.  

There are 25 boxes of Winchester and 5 Federal plus the 100 in two boxes.  Prefer to sell in lots of 5 or more.  Only selling because these are extra that won't fit in safe.  

This is $1067 for everything but will take $1000 for everything.  I have sold many, many items here and have over 500 all positive feedback on Gunbroker and eBay.

Thanks for understanding.  Not interested in trading for knives, lowers, uppers etc.  The only trade that I would consider is for partial trade on high quality over under shotgun for sporting clays."

Very limited number of these made. Comes with (2) 8 round mags, factory night sites and box. 

The M1911 Spartan comes with truly unique oil rubbed bronze Nitron finish on both the slide and frame, with the slide featuring 24kt gold inlay engraving. SIG Sauer’s Nitron finish is a thin layer of amorphous “DLC” that both creates a hard protective coating and enhances lubricity. “DLC,” in turn, is the acronym for Diamond-Like Carbon. DLC thus has some of the properties of diamond.

 Came with the 10 round magazine and we bought an additional 20. Comes with everything shown in the photos. Rifle in original box, 1-10 round and 1-20 round magazine. the original stupid cable lock still in its bag. I can't seem to find the manual for it but it is available online. 

 Rifle has been in and out of the safe a few times and out in the woods. Has some small handling marks on it. Most noticeable is a paint scratch on the top of the barrel as seen in the photo. 

 I looked at some of the ar style .22 rifles and have to say this one was in my opinion the best. The weight is substantial. Hold this in one hand and the Mossberg or Colt version in the other and you will see what I mean. This is metal and solid. A great trainer.

 I am looking to trade this more than sell it. I have specific trade desires and am not in a hurry to get rid of this .22. Original receipt in hand shows 649.99 on sale from 750. Too much I know but I really liked it. Now I want a Masterpiece Arms M10 or M11 pistol in 9mm. Would like one with its factory accessories and case if possible but am flexible.

Would meet face to face anywhere between Lynnwood and Arlington Have a preprinted Bill of sale we can fill out for each of our records.

 From Manufacturer:
 The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

 Like all the .22 LR H&K's, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

 The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. 

 The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."

I have a S&W Model 18-2 that I am looking to trade or sale. The S&W is in great condition and has zero issues.  The S&W is chambered in 22LR and is as rock solid as they come. The finish on the S&W is in great condition with a small blemish on the bore from obvious holster contact throughout it’s lengthy life. The barrel and cylinder are in great condition and can tell that it has not had much use. I am looking to trade or sale the S&W. If trade is not of same value cash or ammo will be expected to make up the difference.

Bought this new has sat in my collection. Knife has never cut anything and maintains it's factory razor sharp edge. Comes with awesome secure ex sheath which can be worn on belt or necklace. This is the hard to get 4 1/2 inch blade model.

From Cold Steel:

Cold Steel has been making push knifes for a quarter century. In those twenty five years we have continually been refining our designs, discarding features that didn't perform as well as we would have liked and enhancing those that did. These blades, and the wealth of experience that has gone into their manufacture, have paid off handsomely for Cold Steel as they have generated quite a following among law enforcement and military personnel around the world. This is because they offer ""big knife"" cutting and piercing potential in a very compact, easily portable size, and, unlike a revolver or semi automatic pistol, they never break, malfunction, or run out of ammunition.
Designed by Lynn C. Thompson, our Safe Make™ push knifes are, without doubt, the finest commercially made push knives in the world. The blade, shaft, and 'T' shaped tang are all drop forged from one piece of AUS 8A Stainless Steel. This process, though costly, eliminates any unwanted sharp edges or surfaces that would irritate the hand or fingers when the knife is clasped in a closed fist, and it produces a better knife, since the subsequent vacuum heat treatment and sub zero quench, renders the blades virtually unbreakable.
Well made blades deserve equally well-made grips. A lot of time and energy went into the production of our 'T' shaped handles. Made of shock absorbing Kray-Ex™ they totally encapsulate the tang and part of the shaft so they can be comfortably and securely grasped in the fist with the blade jutting out between the fingers and used to deliver absolutely devastating punching and slashing blows.
The Safe Maker knives are available in two sizes; each includes an easily concealable and sturdy Secure-Ex® boot/belt sheath. The smaller version includes a steel bead chain lanyard so it can be worn as a neck knife."

The rifle includes a quantity of loaded ammunition (in 150 gr Hornady SP, and 170 gr Hornady RN), a set of full-length reloading dies, a neck-sizing die, a quantity of brass (some once-fired, and some new, never used, all winchester), leupold steel scope bases installed (no rings or optic). The butt-stock is straight grain walnut, and the forearm is figured walnut. The .325 WSM cartridge is adequate for any large game in North America, including the large bears, elk, and moose. The barrel is 28"" tapered octagonal factory unit with 4-groove rifling. The extra length gives it some ballistic advantage over a bolt rifle, and reduces muzzle blast and recoil a bit. The 1885 is no longer available in this chambering, and not many were made. If it holds true to the pattern for Winchester rifles, this should make it a collectible rifle, and a solid investment. It is very accurate, and doesn't seem finicky about loads. I have been able to get 1 minute groups or better consistently on paper, and nothing but single-shot kills on game. In all, the rifle is a fine piece, and one of the nicest single-shot drop-blocks on the market. I rate it's condition at 98%, as it has a few very small dings in the finish (not through it, or into the wood) on the butt-stock from bumping into the pommel of my hunting knife while hunting, and some edge wear in the bluing at the muzzle (not noticeable unless you look closely). It is otherwise pristine. I am selling it because it serves no useful purpose to me, and I don't like to keep weapons that gather dust. I love the lines of it, and the history behind the design, but that isn't enough to make me hang on."
