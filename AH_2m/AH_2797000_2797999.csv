Retails for approx $350+. It is the textured black version. The few places that sell these are sold out from what I have seen and have been like that for awhile. Completely free floated and aluminum bedded for increased accuracy. The ""hook"" part of the stock is great when you are aiming because it allows you to snuggle your offhand (left hand) into the stock for increased stability instead of trying to get a good purchase on the back-end of the factory stock. Details listed below. 

+ Fits factory hinged floorplate and M4 Upgraded Magazine System;
+ Cut for the standard Rem #3 Varmint / Tactical barrel;
+ Easily modified for 5R mil. spec. and most other heavy contours;
+ Includes the 700 SPS, XCR, VTR Varmint and Tactical type rifles.
""The Hook"" is designed as a “drop-in” for the heavy barrel Remington Model 700 BDL or DBM (short action). It has an extended grip and a fairly wide forend with dual front sling studs to allow for both bipod and sling attachment. The hooked cutout underside is designed as a steady-holding feature - simply jam your off-hand into the recess for an isometrically-solidified rest, ideal for varmint, target or tactical field applications!
The stock has no checkering and like all in the “Medalist” line, it has the integral aluminum bedding system that is computer designed and CNC machined out of aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum. The aluminum block extends through the forearm to add strength and stiffness and incorporates the attachment of the front sling swivel for additional security. An aluminum “tail piece” also extends from the bedding block through the grip area to add rigidity and to strengthen the stock. The stock is designed to be “free-floated” and it comes with a standard length of pull of 13 3/4” with a Pachmayr Decellerator pad."

Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Please check availability before bidding.A whole new legend.
It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.
Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.
Features:
Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet.
Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
Thermal cheek guard.
Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

This was my personal work gun and I have 3 other model glocks, hate to let this one go but its a twin (I have another 22). This gun was only fired for qualification tests (30 rounds per test, took 3 tests total).

Gun is flawless, never jammed, no replaced parts, everything is factory. There is a small one inch scratch on the right side of the slide, only noticed when held in the light (this is from being placed in the holster constantly). You can see in the picture.

This gun comes with ORIGINAL Glock case, 2 15 round mags and 1 10 round mag. Also comes with sleek lightweight BlackHawk holster.

New Glock 22's are selling for $650 + background check $25 + misc.

I am selling this gun for $450...its basically brand new, comes with all the bells and whistles, and its a GLOCK. Im not selling for $250, $300 or even $350. Some offers are outrageous and down right disrespectful. You WILL not find a Glock Used for under $350...even in pawn shops. So please, do not contact me unless you have cash in hand for the price.

I will ONLY trade over registration at a LVMPD Sub Station to have my name cleared from the serial by LVMPD Only. No POS deals. I am off Wednesday and Thursday...those are the only two times I am available to meet at LVMPD and do the switch.

The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left;"

They were professionally cerakoted burnt bronze and the pistol tubes were cerakoted by aeroprecision. The only installed item is the ejection port door. All other parts are stripped, due to lack of interest in these whole. These will be sold discounted and recommended for rough use or people getting them coated due to small marks from where my smith had trouble removing the bolt roll pins. They apparently need to be driven out with a different punch then usual or use a shortened roll pin. If you are looking for something pristine then this is not where to look.  Each lower will be $150, each upper is $130, and each  pistol buffer tube is $40. The pistol buffer tubes will come with a regular carbine endplate that has had the notch ground out with a dremel. If someone is interested in all of it, I will do everything for $600."

I'm cleaning out the safes and have several things posted.***

Title says it all. Good looking optic, older and lightly used.  No significant use/abuse signs. Great looking optic, fiber works great, tritium is very dim (however, this is typical of this optic, check the reviews on the new ones).  I have several RX01's and the tritium is dim in them as well.  I love these optics (have 3 of the RX01s) but I wouldn't consider it on a rifle that you have for home defense if you have a tactical light on it.  The reticule disappears at night when you hit the light.  Works well in dim light or outside.  

I recently worked a deal for a rifle with a TA-33 so I don't need this one anymore.  Just received it and haven't mounted it or fired it (yet...take it before I decide I need another upper to put it on!!)."

Metal upper and lower, unlike competitors such as S&W.  Metal quad rail, unlike competitors.  Weighs almost six pounds, like a normal AR-15.  Weight makes it ideal for most realistic training weapon without the cost of .223 or 5.56.  Cannot be converted to another caliber. Rifle with one mag costs $500 new.  Asking price is $400.  Please don't try to low ball; this price is very low for a quick sale.  Will trade straight across for M&P 9, PPQ or P99 in 9mm, PX4 9mm, or Glock 17 Gen3 or Gen4.  I will take off a fair price for a less expensive pump action shotgun; 12 or 20 gauge.  If the pistol has extra magazines, then I can add a Grip Pod brand vertical grip/ bipod in to square the deal (not pictured).  Comes with two rail covers and Hogue rubberized grip.  Email, text or call with questions 551-1617, I work overnight and very long hours so leave a message if I don't answer.  Thanks for looking.

Every single piece on the rifle matches minus the stock obviously. Still has the original 10 round magazine well. When I got it, upon tearing it down to install wood stock I found that the gas tube was completely full of cosmoline, as was the rest if the rifle. So I compared it to a friends sks and I don't believe it has been shot very much. The gun shows no sign of wear anywhere. I have shot around 60 rounds out of it. Looking for something differant is my reason for posting it. I really want to trade for an m1 carbine probably nothing else, but offer me whatever you like worst I can say is no.

The Model 64-5 indicates, the gun was shipped late 1988, but -5 means it was a 1989 revolver. 

*There is a barely a pinch deep scratch on the frame. Please view the picture.*

I have for sale a .38 special, 3 screw, K frame, Model 64-5 Revolver. This is a CTG so it'll take the +p caliber ammo. NO AMMO WILL BE SOLD WITH THIS REVOLVER. Valid driver's licenses, and bill of sale will be done at purchase. 

This gun is DA/SA, hammer is full, and all cock's are working flawlessly. The cylinder locks up SUPER tight, and overall the appearance of the gun is not great, but the way the gun works, the screws, are all untampered, and work great. The screw for the grips is worn but is still working, and tight. 

Please make sure you view all pictures before purchase. I am willing to meet anywhere in Atlanta. Prefer WEST Atlanta. 

I am putting a price of $500 on this revolver. But I will consider trades for other guns, outdoor power equipment, or a 5x10 trailer double axle or not, 2'' ball, and can hold 2 four wheelers atleast or similar, 6x8 atleast. I can add cash.

Winchester Brings Back the 1892 Large Loop Carbine
News Release -- The distinctive look of the Winchester 1892 large loop carbine rifle was the dream of many young boys and old men who watched the gun being used on TV shows and in movies 50 years ago.   Watching their favorite actor handle the rifle with one hand was the envy of every want-to- be cowboy.

Winchester Repeating Arms is helping make those dreams come true with the introduction of the 1892 Large Loop Carbine back in to their rifle line for 2012.  The new rifle looks just like the original 1892 with a 20-inch button-rifled barrel and overall length of 37 ½ inches.   It features a Grade 1 walnut stock with a rich, satin finish.  The steel contoured carbine strap buttplate is quick to shoulder and protects the buttstock from damage. 

The new 1892 also features a Marble Arms front sight with brass bead and an adjustable rear sight.   The full length magazine holds 10 cartridges and the rifle is available in 4 calibers: 357 Mag., 44 Rem Mag., 44-40 Winchester and 45 Colt.   Each rifle comes with an eye-catching saddle ring.

However, the most distinguished feature of the rifle is the Large Loop Lever with radiused edges.   The lever makes it easy to cycle the rife, even with gloves on.   The 1892 will be produced in limited quantities."

While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning.

In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

AUSTRAILIAN AUTO ARMS (AAA) Dubbed, “THE TASMANIAN DEVIL”, VERY RARE in USA, this is a very aggressive, para-military type Semi-Automatic Pistol with heavy barrel, chromed bore and rugged .090 (2.3 mm) thick steel plate construction. Short 10.5 inch, .690/.750 dia. barrel with bayonet lug/bipod attachment and 5 slot bird cage type flash-hiding compensator, no bottom slots. Very few of these were imported into the United States before the 1989 Assault Weapons Ban (Imported AWB) was passed, reportedly about 1000. Semi-automatic weapons were banned in Australia in 1996 following an infamous shooting spree. Production ceased at Australian Automatic Arms shortly thereafter.Highly Collectible and formidable. The Semi-Auto Pistol (SAP) (dubbed the ""Tasmanian Devil"") was a Pistol-Gripped Stockless version of the SAC. It came with a sling to brace it during firing. Less than 1000 were imported into the US before being banned in 1994 In Excellent condition this (AAA) Semi-Auto Pistol “Tasmanian Devil” which comes with one High capacity Magazine ( AR15/AR16 Mags.) Original Box although rough as it is still in one piece. The Rarity of only 1000 of these made it in the importation making them no longer available and Very Rare to find even in this condition."

908,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2797908,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 54,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 11, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=222

Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."

Rifle has a low round count and is in excellent condition. The 6.8 round can fit into regular ar mags but due to it being a wider round it can only fit around 15 before the mag starts to bulge. The spc was developed by the military for special forces who needed more knock down power than a 5.56 but less than a 7.62. The round is excellent and the only down fall of it is that it's only been around for 10 years so the rounds aren't as cheap as a 5.56 but then again it's in mine and most others opinion a much better round!
