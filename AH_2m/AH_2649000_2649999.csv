The pack was built in 1978 in Monson, MA, according to my research. The Pack has the original case and includes the 4 interchangeable barrels; 2, 4, 6 and 8 inch, all in great condition and 3 sets of grips, as pictured. .  The set comes with the ammo pictured that “tells the story” of the firearm.  The Ammo was purchased in 1978, at the same time the firearm was purchased. The owner fired 32 rounds of the ammo through the 8 inch barrel and replaced the spent cartridges in the box. The other 3 barrels were never mounted. There are a couple of small “dings” in the mounted barrel from handling that can only be seen upon close inspection. The Pack contains the Barrel tool, the DW belt buckle, instruction booklet (details barrel changing) and patch. I have 3 of these sets; a shooter that I play with and switch barrels on; a New-In-Box Unfired set that I will pass along to my family and; this one, which is suitable for collecting or shooting.  I own Colt and S&W 357’s. Though I AM NO EXPERT on anything, I can tell you, if I needed a revolver for a gunfight or hunt, the DW is far and away the one I would choose.  Like most “classic” items, you’ll find these priced in a wide range  from $700 to $1995. I sold one 5 years ago that was well-used for $1200. I will sell this one for $1250 (FIRM) or trade value of $1,300. I am interested in ONLY 1911’s on trade. Of particular interest are Full-sized Kimber, Colt and, Dan Wesson models. I will add/accept cash/ammo to even a trade.  I will CONSIDER any 1911 model I don’t have.   If you have a trade offer, please provide a full description VIA an email  and your trade value. I will respond to all legitimate offers. I am in North Columbus and will drive up to an hour for a QUALIFIED buyer/trader.  Happy Shooting."

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints. Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions. Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic • Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use. • 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances. • In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy. • Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes. • Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifier and Concealed Engagement unit. • Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world conditions and waterproof to 150 feet. • Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD). • Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean. • Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with both covers closed in an emergency. • Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces. • Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles.

I bought this gun as a back-up for my other 1187 that never let me down for Chesapeake  Bay area waterfowl hunting. This gun never left its box except for an occassional wipe down. I own Benelli, Franchi and Beretta guns but have always enjoyed the softer shooting the 1187. Keep them clean, do not over lubricate and they are very reliable.

I have carefully checked out the gun and it is perfect except for a few subtle discoloration freckles at on the receiver near the pistol grip that is shown in one of the photos.

The gun comes in the original box with 3 chokes, choke wrench, magazine plug, camo sling and owners manual.

I have found this useful especially to use the tool for the california compliant bullet button. The gun also comes with an extra 10 rd mag that i purchased recently, a decent soft case, and the stock iron-sights. I will give you the red-dot sight for an extra $50 if you'd like as I am fond of it. This gun was my first gun and I have had a lot of fun with it. It shoots tight groupings at 30 yrds. At the Angeles national forest range, I can shoot the metal targets at 100 yrds no problem. On the pistol/right side of the range I can pick the big metal targets off 10/10 in about 10 secs. Pretty awesome gun. Its light and compact and yet can hit medium distances with ease. It has a spring loaded butt-stock so it shoots with comfort. I haven't had any problems with this gun other than one jam early on (which should be expected with a brand new gun). This one is a good one! please reply if your interested have more questions or want to see more pictures. I bought this gun for $480 out the door at turners, now you can have it for less!!!

The Model 70 is chambered in .25-06 Remington and will shoot 1"" at 100 yards with Federal Premium 117 grain Sierra boattail soft-point ammunition (factory loaded). The rifle is mechanically in great condition and is smooth but tight and new feeling. The trigger breaks crisply at 3.5 pounds. It was adjusted by a professional master gunsmith. There are some shallow but noticeable scratches on the floor plate and a few rust freckles just forward of the scope which are displayed in the photographs. There is some darkening on the wood by the receiver tang from gripping. Other than that the rifle is like new. The rifle also comes with One-piece Leupold steel scope base and steel rings and a Pentax Lightseeker 3X9X40 scope. The scope is very nice and bright and allowed me to see to shoot right up until the last moments of shooting time. The rifle scope combo is zeroed at 100yards and is very accurate as mentioned before. Payment will be accepted by postal money order or certified bank check. Shipping will be $25.00. Actual cost of shipping will be charged to CA, AK,This is a beautiful and wonderfully accurate rifle made in New Haven, CT. It was used to take a deer this season at 100 yards in one decisive shot. Great for those who want a high-intensity rifle but don't want alot of recoil. Pictures do not do this combo justice. This is a great value for your dollar, too.

This gun is BRAND NEW and has never had a round in the chamber. I won this gun and while the ""Slingshot"" spring assisted action is really cool and makes cycling super fast, I really have no need for it.  I have several different shotguns already and figured I'd just convert it to cash or trade it for something I  interested in.

The rifle comes with the original box and manual. The rifle has only seen about 200 rounds. For those who don't know, these FS2000 rifles have been discontinued. The Generation 1 rifles are more desirable for their trigger packs (people will gladly pay $500-600 for the trigger pack because it's a Gen 1, but you can buy Gen 2 packs from FNH all day for about $70). The reason the Gen 1 is more valuable is because the trigger pack can be converted to full auto with little modification. Not only is the Gen 1 rifle desirable, but so is the OD Green Gen 1. I see regular black models in Gen 2 selling for $2,000 easy. This is OD Green and the rifle and trigger pack are Gen 1. 

$2,400 takes the Gen 1 OD Green rifle with the factory box and manual. Can supply additional magazines free of charge.

The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.



All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receiversRC M6 IC Enhanced 5.56 NATO 14.7"" Spiral Barrel

It has double glass doors that both open up and 2 big drawers below for storing clothing, ammo, etc... The whole inside of the gun cabinet is done in a bergundy carpet-like material so that your guns won't get scratches up while storing them in it. And unlike a lot of people, I DO have the key for it soyou can lock your guns up. It does have a few small marks on it but nothing horrible. II'm sure you could easily fix the marks on it with a quick trip to Lowes or Walmart. The only reason I'm getting rid of it is because I no longer have the room for it anymore.

The features of the new Kimber SIS have been selected with the job requirements of SIS and the training program of LAPD in mind. First, it is an ultra-reliable Kimber 1911 pistol. In .45 ACP, of course. Standard bushing and recoil-spring design–no full-length guide rods or bull barrels for the LAPD. The barrel is a Kimber match barrel, properly fitted to slide and frame. The trigger pull is clean and crisp, set in the five-pound region, and the solid trigger (aluminum, no extra holes) lacks an adjustable trigger stop.

The frame is checkered 30 lines to the inch, and the frame has the corners rounded. The sight is a specially modified Kimber fixed sight, with the front face squared off. The LAPD Academy teaches officers who need to do a one-handed slide cycle to do it by pressing the sight against their holster, duty belt or other convenient object. While members of the SIS do not work alone, and often use long arms, they specifically requested a rear sight that could be one-hand cycled.

Kimber, in laying out the pistol, figured a way to incorporate the “SIS” of the unit into the cocking serrations, If you look closely, you’ll see that the grooves are a stylized “SIS”.

On top of everything is the KimPro finish in dark gray over the stainless slide and frame. Why a baked-on finish on a high-end semi-custom gun? Well, Los Angeles is hot in the summer months. Sitting in plainclothes in their cars, it is a sure thing that officers will be sweating onto their sidearms, and no one wants a rusty blaster, now do they? It just doesn’t look right. And it might not work when you need it.

The trigger on this breaks clean and crisp and resets when you hold down, which was an isue on older designs.

I purchased this rifle new about a year ago. I would estimate that I have put about 200ish rounds down the pipe. The only mod that has been done is that I polished the sear and disconnect to smooth out the trigger pull. Its a great shooting peace I selling to raise funds for a Rock River.

The only blemish is were I drill 2 1/8 inch holes in the hand guard to run the wires for a laser and flash light. (you can see this hole in the picture)

Comes with 1 30 round magazine and removable carry handle.
