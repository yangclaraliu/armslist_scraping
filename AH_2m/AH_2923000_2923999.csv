REVIEW

Please note that this review is one person's opinion and is meant simply to provide information and a viewpoint to the reader and is not meant as an endorsement of the product by the KnifeCenter.

BENCHMADE EMERSON 9700S AUTOMATIC

By Dexter Ewing, Knife Collector and Enthusiast

The Benchmade Knife Company turns out some of the best functioning automatics found on the market today. They are about the only company with such an extensive line of auto openers: ranging from the sublime Mel Pardue 3000 to the more radical Reflex 2000. The 9700S would definitely rate on the radical end of the scale. Essentially an auto opener version of the extremely popular 975S, the 9700S offers the same benefits and performance as its more legal counterpart except for the rapid blade deployment capability.

TAPERED PLUG LOCKING MECHANISM

As with the rest of Benchmade's automatics, the 9700S employs the same tapered plug locking mechanism to secure the blade in both open and closed positions. To fire this beauty, you must really depress the locking button. Benchmade does this intentionally, as to prevent unwanted deployment in the pocket. The immediate area surrounding the button is milled out, so the button only protrudes a little above the handle surface. I thought that an auto opener with a blade like the 9700S would require a rather high spring tension to achieve fast opening, and the knife would have quite a ""recoil"" to it as the blade makes contact with the steel stop pin. Turns out that it does not have a strong recoil like I thought it would.

THE BLADE

As mentioned before, the blade is identical to that of the 975S, lacking the thumb disk. The thumb ramp is situated a little further forward than that of the 975S, probably for compensation for the location of the release button. As usual, there's a razor sharp edge thanks to the beautiful chisel grind patterns.

THE HANDLE

The solid G10 handle slabs give the knife a real meaty feel. Benchmade uses no liners for this particular knife, and compensating for that, the thickness of the handles are increased. The noticeable texture of the surface is excellent for it is a surface with a noticeable texture. As with all Benchmade folders, the 9700S comes with a steel pocket clip. Overall, the handle of the 9700S is a bit thicker than that of the 975, making it easier to grip.

ANALYSIS

Ernest Emerson is a man whose name is synonymous with high tech, high performance combat folders. The CQC7 liner locks have been a sweet success story for Benchmade. It was only logical that Benchmade release an auto opener version of the larger model 975. This knife has all the characteristics that law enforcement officers look for in a ""sharp"" companion: lightweight carry, rapid deployment, and a proven blade design. The equipment that officers carry with them not only help them do their job effectively, but may also be called upon to defend their own lives as well. The 9700S is definitely one piece of equipment that will not fail under any circumstances."

This pistol is a blast to shoot and have had no issues with fte or ftf.  I've put about 400 rounds through it and not one hiccup.  It's ate everything from 55gr PMC, white box winchester, independence, AE..  This is a quality build with some high quality parts, just add up the parts and your well over 1300 without tax.  It does have some scratches on the handguard and by the mag release bc this is not a safe queen.  
The pistol is optics ready but I also have a Primary arms red dot sitting on top a Fortis F1 mount and a Tactical Link stealth bungee sling that hooks up to the QD end plate.  This is EXTRA if buyer is interested or I can give you a package deal for this whole setup ready to go. Red dot is sighted in @50yrds.
Now on to anyone who wants to flame or low ball, do the math, if you can the parts cheaper or find it elsewhere go on ahead and please don't waste my time and yours unless you have nothing else better to do.

Cold Steel Leatherneck-SF Fixed Blade Tactical Knife
The Cold Steel Leatherneck-SF Knife takes its name from the common nickname for US Marines, a name that dates from 1776 when the standard Marine uniform included a thick leather collar that provided protection from sword strikes, as well as the famous ""Semper Fi"" logo. The Cold Steel Leatherneck-SF has a saber ground clip point blade that is hollow ground and honed by hand to a startling razor sharpness. The Cold Steel Leatherneck Knife features a substantial hand guard that prevents the user's fingers from sliding onto the edge, with double quillons that are turned slightly forward and provide excellent protection for your hand (especially in CQB situations) while offering minimal interference in the use of the knife when performing utility tasks. The handle are made of deeply checkered Kray-Ex that totally encloses the knife's extra wide full tang. The Cold Steel Leatherneck SF Knife offers unsurpassed gripping power through their palm hugging oval cross section and unique finger trough. It's capped with a thick, machined steel butt cap (not cheap casting like others) so they can also deliver frightful blows with the butt or double in an emergency as a hammer.

To carry the Cold Steel Leatherneck Knives safely and conveniently in all environments, they come with a sturdy Secure-Ex sheath complete with fully detachable and ambidextrous belt loop."

All of these are decapped and more-or-less clean (tumbled), but of course you'll need to size, trim, etc. before loading. These are all ones I judged to be usable – no Berdan primers, crushed/dented/cracked, steel case, etc., but honestly I did not inspect every case the way I would before I load it, so please do your own inspection before use. Except as noted, they'll have mixed headstamps. Also, any count shown below up through the 40's is an actual count, but anything higher was counted by weight, so might be off by one or two total, plus or minus. Please let me know if exact count is important -- I can double-check.

Just to clarify since it's come up a few times now: a ""2"", for instance, in the first column below, means two shell casings total -- not two boxes or two hundred or whatever. 2 means 2.

That said, please look over the list and le'me know what you could put to good use. I mostly want to send these along to good homes, not looking to cash in, but something for the trouble would be appreciated. I'm sure we can make a reasonable deal. I'll update the list as I sell some.

It also includes 52 rounds of spent brass.  Item G-35962-1.

The .300 H&H Magnum Cartridge was introduced by the British company Holland & Holland as the Super-Thirty in June, 1925.[1] The case was belted like the .375 H&H Magnum, and is based on the same case, as also is the .244 H&H Magnum. The belt is for headspace as the cases' shoulders have a narrow slope rather than an actual shoulder. More modern magnums continue this practice, but headspacing on the belt is not necessary with their more sharply angled shoulders. The cartridge won the 1000-yard Wimbledon Cup Match at Camp Perry in 1935,[1] and the international 1,000 yard competition in 1937.[2] Winchester chambered the Model 70 in .300 Holland & Holland Magnum in 1937.  It has never been as popular as the .30-'06; but the mystique of well-crafted rifles chambered for the .300 H&H keeps the cartridge in use despite its repeatedly reported demise. The .300 H&H is a fine African plains game cartridge, and suitable for all but the most dangerous big game and pachyderms.

The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic carbine chambered for the 7.62×39mm round, designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin sistemy Simonova, 1945 (Russian:1945; Self-loading Carbine of (the) Simonov system, 1945), or SKS 45. 

In the early 1950s, the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front-line service and replaced it with the AK-47; however, the SKS remained in second-line service for decades. It is still used as a ceremonial arm today. The SKS was widely exported, and was also produced by some former Eastern Bloc nations as well as China, where it was designated the ""Type 56"", East Germany as the Karabiner S and in North Korea as the ""Type 63"". 

The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries, including the United States, Canada and New Zealand. It was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62×39mm M43 round, which was also used later in the AK-47. 

Excellent overall, Excellent bore no pitting, appears fired very little

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol. This XD-S
model comes with a durable rugged case and two  magazines--one
flush-fitting stainless steel 7-round magazine and one full-size Mag
X-tension 9-round magazine.

Generally, no. This type of transaction is referred to as a “private party transfer” and must be conducted through a fully licensed California firearms dealer. Failure to do so is a violation of California law. The purchaser (and seller if the purchaser is denied), must meet the normal firearm purchase and delivery requirements.

Firearms dealers are required to process private party transfers upon request but may charge a fee not to exceed $10 per firearm for conducting the transfer. For example: 
a.For a private party transfer involving one or more handguns, the total allowable fees, including the DROS, safety, and dealer transfer fees, are not to exceed $35.00 for the first handgun and $31.00 for each additional handgun involved in the same transaction. 
b.For private party transfers involving one or more long guns, or a private party transfer involving one handgun, the total allowable fees, including the DROS, safety, and dealer transfer fees, are not to exceed $35.00. The dealer may charge an additional dealer-service fee of up to $10.00 for each additional firearm. 

""Antique firearms,"" as defined in section 921(a)(16) of Title 18 of the United States Code, and curio or relic rifles/shotguns, defined in section 478.11 of Title 27 of the Code of Federal Regulations, that are over 50 years old, are exempt from this requirement. For additional exceptions, refer to Penal Code sections 27850 through 27966.

IT IS HOWEVER MISSING THE CLEANING ROD.  BUT WHO USES THE ORIGINAL ROD TO CLEAN A MOSIN, RIGHT?  
I HAVE ONLY SHOT 60 ROUNDS THROUGH THIS RIFLE.  JUST TO ZERO THE SCOPE AND DO A LIL SHOOTIN.

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with
enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and
greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a
single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front
sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite
finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple
safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger
System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly
lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the
disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
These features come together to create a superior slim pistol, and the XD-S
comes with a durable rugged case and two stainless steel magazines.

The loan on the engagement ring is coming due soon, boys. We all know what that means - I've got to sell one baby to keep the other.

So here's my Rock Island Armory Compact Tactical 1911 in 9MM. It's only got about 250 rounds down the pipe, but that hasn't stopped me from doing a few upgrades.

It's coming to you with a fiber optic (green) front sight from Fusion (includes an extra rod), Skingripz Operator grip panels (grey), and a front strap wrap using 3M's tape (not low quality skateboard tape).

I also have a Hogue rubber wrap around front strap and the original front sight, grip panels, and Mec Gar stainless magazine.

If you keep up with 1911's, you know the compact 9MMs are pretty hard to come by -- especially in this price range. I bought her on an impulse for that very reason and had hopes of turning her into a custom job like my .45. I guess my fiance had other plans.

I've had zero issues with this gun. Hell, it's not even broken in. Take it off me for a song and treat her right, because if the repo man comes and gets that ring, it's going to be in my best interest to have the least amount of guns in the house as possible.

Please, cash only. I'm not looking to trade. FTF transfer (no out of state). I'm a licensed permit holder in the state of TN and if you want this gun, you need to be too.  E-mail me through here and I'll give you my number. My name is Justin."

At 13.5 oz (380 g),[4] the LCR is nearly 50% lighter than the stainless steel SP-101[5] and with only the barrel and fluted cylinder made of stainless steel. The frame is aluminum alloy and synthetic glass-filled polymer finished in matte black with Synergistic Hard Coat. The LCR operates in double action only (DAO) as the hammer is concealed within the frame handle's fire control housing of the gun and cannot be cocked prior to firing."

As of right now, I have a 5 1/2 ft. bullwhip ( which if you include the fall and the cracker it's a little over 7 ft. long) and a 9 ft. for sale right now. But if you let me know, I can make any length you would like. Right now all I'm offering is black but like I said if you get ahold of me and let me know, I can make it any color you like.

I ran only 3 mags of 5.56 expensive match ammo after it had only been test fired. So it's basically brand new. I've fired several machines over the years and THIS ONE FLAT OUT ROCKS!! The parts are some of the very best that the AR industry has to offer. The pics don't do it justice AT ALL. There have been lots of trade offers and credit card offers but I want the cash plz.

My grandfather passed and left us his gun collection. I found this historical gem and decided to place it up for sale. Seems to be in great condition, especially considering the age.

Headstamps are IMI (Commercial Israeli M855)/TZ (Actual military issue M855). Most of the dented/oxodized are TZ headstamped, meaning they were probably issued to soldiers then put back in the ammo pile. Dated around 93-98.

The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme.
