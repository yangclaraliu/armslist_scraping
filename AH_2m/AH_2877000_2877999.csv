The scope is Chinese but I can't find any markings on the bipod or flash suppressor - they seem to be decent quality though.  The bore is chrome lined and looks nice and shiney.   You can get a gas block/hanguard to match the stock.  The bipod will not allow attachment of a bayonet but I do have a spike bayonet that I can include. I traded for this one in it's current configuration so I don't have the original stock. The serial numbers on the bolt, receiver, and trigger guard match.

I'm buying a new USP tactical from an FFL mid-April if I can't find anything here. I am really hoping to find a USP expert. It is a travesty that they were discontinued. Below is a list in order of what I'm looking for and an approximate cash price of what I would pay.

Looking for:
NIB USP Expert- $1100
Used USP Expert- $950
NIB USP Tactical- $1000
Used USP Tactical- $850
NIB standard USP- $780
Used standard USP- $680

Additional mags over the factory two I will count as $50 each. These are very fair cash prices for guns in excellent condition, and depend on overall condition, included accessories, etc. If you have a bundle of stuff, great I'll buy the holsters, lights, etc.

I'm in Arlington WA so I would prefer to meet somewhere around here. I have cash in hand. Send several pictures of your firearm, round count, and your asking price, and I will reply back with an offer and a phone number I can be reached at. Would prefer to have a deal set up the weekend of April 4th-6th. I would drive pretty far for the right deal. Thanks"

There is pretty much no wear on this pistol, the lighting reflections make it look like there is bluing worn off, but there isn't.

I have a ""Ruger .22LR Automatic Pistol Pistol"", with a 4-3/4 inch barrel, it is in very good condition and comes with Pachmayr grips (the rubber is still soft and comfortable). This is the predecessor to the ""Mark II and III"". The Ruger website, when looking up the serial number (15-9xxxx), shows the date of manufacture as being 1979. I bought this used from an FFL last year and have no knowledge about its history. Trade Value of $325 (against something that would sell for close to the same new, but there can be money added in either direction to balance it out).

I have taken it to the range once, since I bought it and it cycled a box of regular .22LR just fine and is a lot of fun to shoot.

It comes with two magazines and a loading assistance sleeve (see picture).

I require that you have an Iowa CCW or Permit To Purchase in order to purchase a firearm from me (I know this is beyond what is required, but those are my terms). We will each leave the transaction with receipts signed by both parties (containing all pertinent information).

With the beast of the largest V-twin engine in a mass-production, this motorcycle has 2053cc, amazing torque, unique style and superb craftsmanship, the Vulcan® 2000 truly is the king of the road.    Only 150 limited edition cycles of this model were made.  This is a super nice cycle in looks, performance and reliability.

Specs: Engine and transmission : Power: 117.33 HP (76 kW) @ 4800 rpm Torque: 177 Nm (130.55 lb-ft) @ 3200 rpm Final drive: Belt Top speed: 124.27 mph Curb weight: 817.9 lbs Category: Cruiser Engine type: 2 cylinders, 4-stroke, V-twin Displacement: 2053 cc (125.44 cubic inches) Bore × stroke: 4.06 inch × 4.85 inch (undersquare - longstroke) Cooling system: Water cooled Power: 103.33 HP (76 kW) @ 4800 rpm Torque: 177 Nm (130.55 lb-ft) @ 3200 rpm Throttle: Cable operated Valves: Valve train: OHV, variable Valves per cylinder: 2 Fuel and ignition Sparks per cylinder: 1 Fuel supply system: Fuel injection Ignition type: Analogue CDI (Capacitive Discharge Ign.)

Some of the extras are Cobra pipes, Hot Rod seat, custom luggage rack to support 100 lbs. of clothes and gear to eliminate the need for those ugly side bags for those week long plus trips.   This unique motorcycle luggage alone cost $250. In addition it has a removable windshield, both almost new front and back rear tires, custom prettiest paint job you would ever see, special handle grips, larger foot rest at front and rear.  This cycle is owned by a 61 year old man and never abused.  Only around 13k miles today and still like new condition.

My most recent trip was in Sept. 2013 when  I took it from Columbus, Ohio to Ashville, N.C. .  I drove 2,229 miles that trip alone all over the Smoky Mts. 2 up with my wife, drove the Dragons Tail with 211 sharp curves within one 11 mile stretch and bought the license plate extra to prove it from there. Needless to say we had a blast.  This cycle cruises very nice @ 70 to 80 mph and very nice long distance dependable cycle.   You don’t even notice the noise of the huge engine because at 70 MPH, this bike has so much power, you are slightly above idle. However, when you are taking off, it does sound like a screaming hot-rod with a very cool loud sound.  Once in high gear, you barely notice these Cobra pipes so very relaxing drive on a long trip. 

Seriously, you cannot tell this cycle from new so if you always wanted to own a $45k custom cycle, but don’t have the $45k, here is one you can’t tell any different in for only $12,500.00.      Sold new @ $15,999.00 without all the extras.   Has been very well taken care of ever since and always garaged.   Call me with questions.  Shipping extra and must be paid for in full prior to delivery.   Only cash or wire transfer accepted for full payment.  Clear title in hand."

The model number is LMS-1131P and outputs a pulsating red beam.  The laser fits inside the Glock’s frame by replacing the stock guide rod/recoil spring assembly.  Installation takes less than two minutes and does not permanently change the weapon.  Everything you need is included (laser, batteries, slide lock/activation switch, slide lock spring, installation tools, installation instructions, owner’s manual, and box).  MSRP is $349.00, I’m asking $200.   Here is their website and some information:
https://www.lasermax.com/ProductDetails/tabid/127/ProductID/287/lms-1131p/Default.aspx
For: GLOCK 19, GLOCK 23, GLOCK 32, GLOCK 38 (**Will NOT fit the new Gen4 GLOCK**)

Completely internal! Keep your current holster for your GLOCK, keep your tactical lights, keep your favorite grips.

Extremely rugged. The LaserMax Guide Rod Laser for GLOCK meets or exceeds both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your GLOCK, you can install your LaserMax Guide Rod Laser sight—No gunsmithing to your GLOCK required. 

Hi-Visibility Pulsating Beam. A pulsating laser beam gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, and it transcends language barriers. It can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. Infra-Red versions are optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers for GLOCK come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever that very closely resembles the factory GLOCK take down lever. Deliberate on/off activation which is highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!

This is my personal gun, not for sale in the shop. I bought this new for competition shooting but never got into it, only put 100-150 rounds through it. Comes with the sleeve shell holder and soft zip case. Has a 2 round extension so holds 6+1. Also has rail mount for flashlight but I sold my light separate. It's been my home defense gun and sits in its case in my closet. I did lean it up against the wall one time and it slid and hit my dresser perfectly on top. It bent the rib vent slightly. I never got it fixed because it doesn't bother me but I will be going to a gun smith next week and if it's not too much I'll have it fixed if possible. That's the only time it's been dropped that I know of and it honestly it didn't fall hard. I don't take it hunting or anything so it's been well taken care of.

      This is by FAR my personal favorite in the Glock line. I typically go for the classic DA/SA guns, but I love the G23, and the 3rd Gen models to me are the best of the breed. This is the mid-size, between the G22 & G27. Small enough for daily carry, but still fits your hand like a gun should. This gun is in fantastic condition, factory except for polished feedramp, includes 3 mags & a Galco leather IWB holster.

Reserve capacity of 90 minutes for constant performance
Optimal starting power even in bad weather
Fifteen times more resistant to vibration for durability

The patented SPIRALCELL Technology in Optima RedTop batteries is truly worthy of praise. Optima RedTop batteries are built to withstand the abuse from Trucks, SUVs and 4WD experience on and off-road. SPIRALCELL Technology immobilizes the internal components of the battery, enabling Optima batteries to withstand incredible amounts of vibration. Vehicles modified for better engine performance demand more from a battery. Optima batteries withstand the high underhood temperatures associated with these Performance vehicles. This prevents external gassing and leaking which can damage engine components and limit battery performance. An Optima RedTop battery is the only battery specifically designed to take abuse. Its patented SPIRALCELL Technology offers 15 times the vibration resistance and up to twice the life of ordinary batteries. Plus it's spill-proof, highly resistant to heat and cold, and can be stored for long periods without maintenance. Optima batteries deliver a higher level of power to the starter in the critical first 10 seconds of the vehicle starting cycle. This decreased internal resistance, along with the completely sealed case, is the key to Optima's unparalleled high power delivery, increased cycle life and fast recharge capability for fast recovery in short driving cycles. Optima's unique SPIRALCELL design offers the greatest technology in providing a strong and clean power source that far surpasses any of today's filled lead/acid batteries."

      Widely considered the ""AK of handguns"" the Russian Makarov(not the Czek or Polish versions) gained favor rapidly among their military. Unflinchingly reliable, surprisingly accurate, these pistols were a step in a different direction. Featuring a DA/SA trigger with a manual safety & decocker, able to be field-stripped & reassembled in seconds, the bar was set for the modern sidearm. The 9x18 round is easy to manage, while packing a hotter punch than the .380ACP.

It comes with the original hard shell plastic case, screw on flash suppressor/muzzle break, (looks like a silencer), 35 round clip, speed loader, and all the original owners manuals.  I can send pictures if your interested. The gun DOES require a standard pistol permit, or CPL to purchase.   The gun retails for $499.99 before taxes.  Priced to sell.  $240 firm.  This is the full sized pistol, not the mini mac. These are the actual photos of the gun.  Can send more if you want them.  Below is a link that will take you directly to the manufacturer of the gun with all details.  Fun gun to shoot, just not my style.  Pick up in Harrison, Michigan only.  No shipping, No trades, No scams.  CASH ONLY  

The trigger looks weird because it still has the rubber protective sleeve around it from when in was new.  Never took it off.  I literally shot a box of 25 rounds through it, cleaned it, and its been sitting in the case for over a year now.
