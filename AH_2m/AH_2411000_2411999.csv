Guarantee you'll love this pistol when you handle it in person! Beretta released a batch of these to the public in what was basically over production from the military pistols.  It features the stainless steel guide rod, steel trigger, serialized parts, and has the factory proof markings.  The DOD wasn't too happy about that for whatever reason and ordered Beretta to stop.  

http://militaryarms.blogspot.com/2012/05/civilian-m9-pistol.html

THIS IS NOT THE SAME COMMERCIAL M9 YOU CAN BUY IN STORES TODAY!  I would rate the gun cosmetically at 90% with some minor wear from shooting and physically 100%.  This gun will be 15 years old and it still shoots like it's new.  The gun has seen 1800 flawless rounds over it's life which is extremely low and without ONE single malfunction!

This M9 will come with a military green nylon latched holster, (5) 15 round Beretta magazines, and, (2) 30 round Beretta magazines. I have the Hogue grip on it now but it also comes with the ORIGINAL Beretta grips. 

Depending on the trade I have 9MM ammo I can work with as well.  From premium hollow point ammo (Federal HST, Remington Golden Saber Bonded, Speer Gold Dots +P, Winchester Ranger +P+) to range ammo (PMC Brozne, Blazer Brass, Remington UMC, Winchester White Box).

Must be 21+ and have a valid FOID."

Overview:

One of the most attractive, and simultaneously, the most practical over-the-counter centerfire rifles Remington has ever built — the Model 700™ Mountain Rifle LSS (Laminated Stock Stainless) has quickly become a favorite for hunters seeking a versatile, lightweight rifle without sacrificing full-bore range or accuracy.

The Model 700™ Mountain Rifle's clean, classic stock design, with straight-line comb angled slightly downward towards the muzzle and sculptured cheek piece on the left side is a style still favored by many custom stockmakers. The gracefully-tapered 22-inch barrel without sights produces a rifle capable of handling mountain-level ranges without draining the hunter's energy to get there.

Visit the NEW Remington 700 Network website  

The barreled action is produced from 416A stainless steel and is set in a handsome, elements-resistant, satin-finished, brown two-tone laminated stock. Other features include crisp cut checkering, black fore-end tip and grip cap, and hinged floorplate magazine. 

Key Features:
Slim 22"" mountain contour barrel to reduce weight Hinged floor plate magazine
Receiver machined from solid-steel bar stock resulting in uniformity and strength
Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement
Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming ""three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength
Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head.

Description

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the .223/5.56. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Features

Mounts on durable Entry-Length Receiver Extension tube (included) to accommodate the common carbine buffer and spring
7-Position LOP adjustability with customizable preset system for fast access to preferred length

Multi-shell construction provides solid foundation and shields critical operating parts from penetration damage
Sloping cheek weld combines a slim profile with user comfort
Stout construction provides counterbalance weight for improved weapon balance and handling
Storage compartment in tail of stock is removable and the door is reversible for user preference
Removable 0.30"" Rubber Butt-Pad offers an anti-slip surface and increased impact protection

Czech Model 70 is a single- and double-action, semi-automatic, pistol of all-steel construction. Its simple, straightforward design and robust construction makes for a pistol that is easy to maintain and field-strip. Its double-action trigger allows for a very fast response to danger during an emergency, while the single-action feature allows smooth trig- ger operation with a relatively light trigger pull weight.
The pistol relies on the simple blowback principle for its operation and its fixed barrel has the potential to deliver exceptional accuracy. The three position safety lever features a decocking function to allow the exposed hammer to be safely lowered without firing a round that may be in the chamber. The sights are fixed and the magazine is single stack. The magazine release button is situated relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. This position prevents inadvertent release of the magazine. The manual safety lever is set into the left side of the frame, at the top of the grip. This position is ideal for easy operation by the thumb of the shooting hand.
Specifications:
Caliber: 7.65 (.32 ACP)
Magazine Capacity: 8-rounds
Overall Length: 6-1/2 inches Overall Height: 4-1/2 inches
Barrel Length: 3-1/2 inches
Weight: 1-1/2 pounds (unloaded)

Finish: Blue Construction: 
Steel Grips: Plastic
Country of Manufacture: Czechoslovakia

Comes with original box, tools, manual and test target from factory

This gun was never issued or fired (except for test target) until I bought it and I've fired approx. 300 rounds through it... Ammo of all type, including JHP and FMJ of many brands... With no failures of any kind.

This is an excellent carry pistol with unusual degree of accuracy and reliability. 

I'm consolidating calibers and want to sell this gun to help fund purchase of a different gun.

The AccuTrigger gives the shooter the flexibility to set the trigger pull to individual preference without have to pay a gunsmith to adjust it. Also, even when adjusted to its lowest setting, the AccuTrigger is completely safe and cannot accidentally discharge during normal use from being jarred or dropped when maintained and adjusted as intended. A newly designed teardrop safety is an additional feature on rifles with the AccuTrigger. It provides for better acquisition of the safety button and operates more smoothly and quietly. Enhanced accuracy is another benefit of the Savage AccuTrigger, is the crisp, clean light trigger pull allows the shooter to maximize the accuracy potential of the rifle.

This was Reeder's limited run of a magnum #5 (his #5 Improved came in .44 Special and he differentiated the Magnums by calling them a #6). This is not to be confused with his current ""New #6,"" which is a stretch frame revolver. Reeder made these on his own, proprietary main frame rather than customizing an existing gun, such as a Ruger. This one is serial number 11. I bought it from Reeder when he handled the estate of the original owner a few years ago. I purchased it to make comparisons to TLA #5s firsthand for my book research. It also helped that the SN matched my very first TLA, so I planned on keeping it and hunting with it and the TLA. I really don't need it, though, and need to get my money back out of it.

It has the optional octagon barrel and is stainless steel, with Reeder's vapor-honed finish on most of the gun and a high polish stainless finish on the small parts. The polish is mirror bright and in some of the pictures, looks weird because it is reflecting the environment (for instance, look at the hammer side in the full view of the left side of the gun - looks dark because it is reflecting something, but it is mirror polished). The gun has been shot and has a turn line from the New Model-style action he uses. Also has a couple light marks from handling and use, but is in very nice condition. Lock-up is extremely tight, with no endshake and just a tiny touch of sideplay (and I mean tiny - it is as tight as most of my TLAs and other customs). The action is very smooth and the trigger pull is just heavy enough for use, but light enough for accurate shooting. It is a bit creepy, but is still a very nice trigger. I never got around to shooting the gun, but the other Reeders I have owned have been very accurate and I expect this one is no different.

The stocks are ivory colored corian, which is a rugged, utilitarian stock material that also looks good. Not as nice as real ivory, for sure, but it does go well with the satin stainless finish.

Comes with the Reeder box and Reeder gun sock, but I didn't get any paperwork with it. Don't know if anyone got paperwork with these, for that matter.

If I recall correctly, this gun cost well over $2200, including options, when Reeder sold them back around 2005 or 2006. I paid less than the original bill, I remember that. Looking to get $2250 shipped fully insured from my FFL dealer to yours. Or, $2,175 face to face in Hickory, NC. I really need cash, but will entertain trade offers if I feel I can sell them either easier or for more than my price on this one. My price is firm - I'm looking to break even on it and it is well priced for what it is."

The action is excellent and the lock up of the breech block is very tight-like the gun was built yesterday! The bore is also in excellent shape with crisp rifling and some areas of light frosting. Externally, this firearm sports a nice even patina with one or two areas of light surface rust. The lock functions flawlessly on both full and half cock. All complete with the exception of a missing saddle bar and ring. A great gun for a collector or shooter. Serial #3371

Gun is in excellent condition(needs a refinish). The only reason I am selling this is to fund a gun I want more. I have taken great care of this gun, and it comes with the bag, test target, and instruction manual. 
Gun has a custom seer from Chuck Warner(a reputable smith), and the trigger is one of the best I've felt. Neverthless, if you don't like the seer, the price drop will also pay for Nighthawk to put theirs back in(I wouldn't recommend it though, because the trigger is much better as is).
The tritium dots still glow, and I can routinely hit a 2 and 3 inch plate at 25 yards with quality ammo(even standard Winchester or PMC). The gun has been very reliable, but it will not accept cheap GI magazines.
As stated before, it does need refinish work(depending on how picky you are), but it's still tight as a drum and super accurate. Rail is completely in tact. 
If you are not happy with this gun, you can send it back and I will refund your money(within 2 weeks), if you didn't do anything to damage the weapon.
This gun is over 3k new, with a 2 year(last time I checked) wait time. For less then 2000, you can buy it and restore the finish.

*IMPORTANT- Regarding Rebuild Kits*
A ""REBUILD KIT"" is a complete magazine that has been disassembled into parts. 

It contains all the original parts of the magazine that have been taken apart before being shipped into Colorado to comply with state and local laws.  I do not remove any parts of the rebuild kit before we ship to customers. 
Rebuild kits are not to be used to assemble a new high capacity magazine which would be in violation of local or state law. These rebuild kits are intended to rebuild a legally owned pre-ban magazine or for assembling a 10 round magazine pursuant to local or state law.

You can assemble your rebuild kit into a magazine when you are outside of CO or at a location at which you are legally allowed to possess a high capacity magazine. For example: You can take your rebuild kit from Colorado to Arizona, assemble it, use it, and take it apart before you return to Colorado. Many of our customers are competition shooters who reside in CO but travel the country shooting and require rebuild kits for competition. Others attend weapon training facilities in other states where they are legally allowed to assemble and use rebuild kits as magazines. Just be sure you take them apart completely before returning to Colorado. 

By purchasing a rebuild kit(s) the purchaser accepts sole responsibility to remain in accordance with local or state law and any failure to do so will be the purchasers responsibility. I accept no liability whatsoever for misuse or negligence on the part of the purchaser. 

It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from us. 

I do not sell hi-capacity magazines period. 

Please consult the CO DOJ and/or your local ATF office if you have any legality related questions."

This is a good shooting handgun that is accurate and functions perfectly. I have a bunch of these, and I have learned how to tune them to make them reliable. This is one of those. Since it has a fixed barrel it happens to also be accurate. I routinely shoot spent shotgun  shells at 20-30 yards with these. 

The best part is...where else can you find a reliable semiauto pistol in a serious caliber for $75? They make a great car gun or just plink with it like I do. 

Contact me through Armslist and we can arrange to meet in Santa Fe any time. I will show you how to keep it running great indefinitely. These are neat little guns. They just need some tweaking since they were made to be sold at a very low price point. I have lots of very expensive handguns, but nothing puts a smile on my face more than outshooting a $500 pistol with a cheap little auto.

This car is in very good condition considering the age. The body is in amazing condition, super solid and very straight, no rust holes or anything like that. Much of the glass is good. The original tires still hold air with no problems at all. Original hubcaps, original chrome, original everything. Suicide doors. This Olds has the rare factory installed antennae for the radio. It has the extra options on the dash such as the clock and the fancy ashtray on the glovebox door. It also includes an EXTRA grille. This car was last ran and driven in 2001. Interior is shot, seats need to be replaced, headliner is out, and the interior needs a complete restoration. The windows roll up and down, doors open and close with no problems. Hood opens and closes no problem. There is some rust on the bottom edge of the doors and deck lid. The car rolls easily in Neutral.

I don't have any way of delivering the car, so you will have to arrange pickup. The car rolls very easily and is easily pushed out of my garage by two strong people.  Does not run.

Price is $4500 and I am willing to negotiate or trade for firearms.  I am a WAC member and have my CPL. The car is a rare one, perfect for restoration. I wasn't planning on making it into a rat rod or a hot rod, but it would look awesome no matter what you did to it.

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.

What sets it apart from the 92FS is:

A. Distinctive military style markings: on various components closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces M9 pistols.

B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.

C. “Dot-and-Post” sight system: clones that of the M9.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

This rifle was made in 1915 and was part of a shipment sent to Russia between 1915-1916. I have no idea how it made it back to the U.S. but it does not have any import marks on the rifle. This gun appears to have been redone long ago as it is color case hardened. Most of the 1895's I have seen are blued with the exception of one rifle at the Cody museum. There is some slight pitting on the rifle but the stock, bore and chamber are excellent.  
 More photos are available upon request. 
The Price guide lists this gun between $2500-$4000 but because we are unsure of the finish we are offering this rifle at $2000. 
The price will be adjusted accordingly once we receive more information from the Cody Museum.
We accept all major credit cards.

STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT. This is the smallest, lightest, slimmest weapon-mounted tactical light on the planet.
Designed for close-quarters, the STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT uses a very narrow 15 degree beam with a specific blue/white color spectrum to create a blinding blast of light. The result is a very cold-looking light source that also looks much larger than it really is.
The primary purpose of the STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT is to deliver a shocking dose of light more so than long-range illumination. If you want to light up targets far away there are plenty of other weapon-mounted tac lights on the market, but none will be as lightweight or slim as the STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT. Features 4 391 batteries that will last a total of 2 hours of ""On"" time.
As an illumination source the STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT's output is 25 Lumens, which is equivalent to a medium-sized conventional flashlight and would have been unheard of just a few years ago from such a tiny device. It's just the right amount to light up a dark situation and recognize objects up to 40 feet away. But the real benefit is in disorientation due to it's unique combination of beam focus, power, and the most shocking color spectrum.
If you're looking for a tactical light that is so small you don't even know it's there, that can disorient a threat, has extremely long battery life, can throw enough light to positively identify objects in the dark within the range most gunfights take place, and won't break the bank, then a STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT needs to be on your pistol. Fits medium and full sized pistols with Weaver & Picatinny rails
Made from the same DuPont Zytel Fiber Reinforced Nylon that most manufacturers use in polymer pistol frames - extremely tough and durable.
Changing batteries is simple and easy with the convenient battery door.  
STINGRAY SRX LED TAC-LIGHT will fit any Weaver & Picatinny rail found on today's Full & Medium-sized pistols.
Featuring a 5 year warranty, Uses commonly found 391 batteries. 
2.03'' overall length, 1.46'' from front of pistol rail notch needed to clear trigger guard curve.
The only full or medium-sized pistol with Picantinny/Weaver rail the SRX won't fit is the Walther PK-380.
