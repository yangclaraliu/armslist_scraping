Excellent condition. Purchased new in 2013. Smaller SF frame. Round count exactly 414 rounds. Well cared for nightstand gun that has NO holster wear. Has NEW decal grip panels. These can be removed easily, but I found that they greatly increased grip and follow-up accuracy (perfect for nightstand gun). Also has installed new Meprolight TruDot night sights and a steel guide rod assembly (steel/night sights and steel guide rod are generally thought of as must have upgrades for Glocks). Comes with factory box, factory guide rod and papers. Also comes with the two factory 13 round magazines and 2 additional UNUSED 10 round magazines (still have packaging). I purchased the 10 round mags specifically for if/when a magazine capacity ban happens. They are hard to find right now and will likely only get harder. This way you won't have to worry about having a gun but not having any mags you can use to shoot it with if a ban occurs. If this doesn't concern you, they will make great shooting range mags. Asking $525 OBO. If you purchased new, it would likely cost you about $525 for the pistol, $10 to OSP, $100 (plus install) for the sights, $30 for the guide rod and $30+ for each new magazine (I paid $33 each for mine). That comes to over $700. Thanks for looking. Oregon residents only. Face-to-face sale. Must be legally allowed to own a firearm."

It's a 2000 Chevy silverado 8ft long bed, 4x4 with a small lightweight personal plow and a color matched oversized fiberglass cap.

This truck is an automatic with a 4.8 liter V8... Enough power to pull and it gets excellent fuel mileage for a full size truck. Close to 30mpg on the highway! The truck does have high Mileage but has been well maintained. I have driven this truck to New Hampshire and Maine several times hauling motorcycles and even made a trip to Florida and back. The engine was replaced at 180k, transmission rebuilt at 110k, transfer case replaced at 215k. It does have the typical rust/ dents/ scratches of an old workhorse but it has been mechanically maintained by the original owner (cabinet company) for the first 250k of its life and then owned by a gm technician for the last few years.

The truck is mechanically sound... Drive it anywhere today without worries. It does have a check engine light on for an o2 sensor heater and converter, and the abs light is on, but the truck does have a current inspection sticker, and does not need to pass emissions testing next year.

Recent repairs/ maintenance include: new wheel bearings, ball joints, u joints, all brake lines have been replaced, new water pump, starter, alternator, idler pulley, belt... Much more... I have spent over $1000 my cost in parts in the last month for this truck getting ready for a trip but I just bought a new extended cab truck so I'm offering this one up for sale. (Retail for all these parts is over $2000 plus labor)

It comes with a small lightweight snow bear style plow. It just clips on the battery and uses its own winch to lift and lower it, no hydraulic setup and no modification to the truck needed.

The cap is in good shape and has wiring for lights... This setup painted was $4000 when new.

As I said this truck is ready to drive as is and is even still registered if you'd like to test drive it... I have been using it as my daily driver 60 miles per day.

I am asking $2800 cash with the plow and cap. The truck can be seen in Freetown (Assonet) or in Fairhaven with an appointment.

It is a quiet vault solid precision instrument, made from aircraft grade aluminum, which is anodized in a black color. The ACI is completely compatible with the Mildot Master and ballistic software, as the cosine numbers are laser engraved onto the body in five-degree increments. Battle-proven and in use by the US Marine Corps, MCMWTC, US Army Special Forces, US Air Force, US Navy, US Border Patrol, British Special Forces, Canadian Special Forces, Australian SAS, LE, hunters, and many others.

The ACI works on any shoulder-mounted weapon system and with just about any optics. When the weapon is held at an angle, the ACI indicates the cosign number of that angle by means of a highly visible index mark. The cosign number is then multiplied to the ""established range"" (straight line distance to target), which gives you the corrected-for-gravity distance.

There are several ways to mount the device. One way is to utilize a short, Weaver base scope ring, which is mounted onto the scope tube at 90 degrees. Another way is to utilize a Badger Ordinance mount designed to attach to a picantinny rail. The mount works on all day and most night scopes."

The Dragster Weapon Case system has taken over 6 months to develop and has been through 4 generations of design. Through a collaborative effort with SOF Snipers, we’ve refined the drag bag concept. Our first goal was to dramatically reduce the weight without sacrificing performance or protection, and at 4lb 9oz, we’ve certainly accomplished that. The bag zips open and lays flat to turn into a shooting mat. On the leading end of the bag, a silent, quick scabbard opening allows nearly instant access to the rifle. The shoulder straps and handles tuck away into zippered compartments and the bag can be attached to our CHIEF Patrol pack by connecting into the packs’ side compression side release buckles. There are 3 pocket systems well suited to carrying the sniper essentials, and there is also a system for attaching ghillie material for the ultimate camouflage system. This is one of those “it needs to be seen and used” to be fully appreciated!"

I was going to use it on a build but my plans have changed so it's up for sale. 

Here's the manufacturer's description: 
The Stock Attachment Precision Rifle (S.A.P.R.) Magpul variant is a lightweight adjustable attachment designed to fit all six Magpul collapsible stocks (i.e. CTR, MOE, ACS, ACS-L, UBR & STR). Weighing in at ONLY 12 oz, the Magpul variant of the S.A.P.R. was designed by Battleline Industries to allow the operator more flexibility with their weapon platform. The S.A.P.R. has a fully adjustable cheek rest and butt-pad giving the operator the ability to custom fit the weapon system to their body and equipment. This allows the shooter to maintain proper marksmanship fundamentals and facilitate more accurate shots on target. 

A key feature of the S.A.P.R. is the rotaing cheek piece which rotates left or right 90 degrees allowing the shooter to transition from their primary optic to Back Up Iron Sights (BUIS) or a 45 degree off set Mini Red Dot Sight (MRDS) without any further adjustment to the cheek piece height.

Product Description:

The front pocket holster design is very effective at masking the outline of the gun and keeping the gun in an upright, ready position in the pocket.  The outside of the holster remains mostly smooth to mask the outline of the gun while the inside, the side toward your leg, is formed to the shape of the gun.  The holster is curved to confrom to the shape of your leg.  It is (.060) Kydex for this design.  There are three ways to draw using this holster.  With the gun holstered in the pocket, obtain a good firing grip on it and discreetly break the retention by pushing on the thumb tab or push off with your middle finger. You can also simply draw the gun briskly and upon drawing, the thumb tab and the hooked end will catch your pocket and the holster will remain inside.

A key feature of this holster is that it takes up the entire bottom of the pocket which is what keeps the gun from floating around and also keeps the holster from drawing with the gun.  It has a round bottom pocket.  The round bottom works great for larger pocket guns such as the XDs as it is unlikely they would get turned in the pocket. It is a very thin and effective design.  As with all of our designs the trigger is covered completely and all edges are smoothed and polished."

olt Woodsman 3rd Series Sport 4 1/2"" ANIB, Colt Woodsman 3rd Series Sport 4 1/2"" – chambered for .22 LR. This beautiful pistol has the very rare and desireable Sport 4 1/2"" highly polished, deeply blued barrel with the adj rear sight and blade front sight. The left side of the slide/barrel reads “COLTS PT FA MFG CO HARTFORD CONN USA”, “WOODSMAN” with the Rampant Colt, “COLT AUTOMATIC CAL .22 LONG RIFLE”. An impressive example of a rare Sport 4 ½” Colt Woodsman.

The Colt Woodsman is an elegant and accurate pistol. It is also a light pistol compared with those of today, and its grip is shorter and at a more rakish angle than many pistols today. The design allows for an impressive trigger. The grip angle and sight radius makes for a very pointable, accurate pistol. For decades the target versions of the Woodsman dominated competitive match shooting, and many old-timers regard the 4-1/2-inch Sport Woodsman as the finest little companion gun the outdoorsman could carry. The Colt Woodsman is the stuff of legend when folks talk plinkers. It's the unavailable measuring stick for other rimfire pistols, often having its name dropped in a debate in a subtle contest of one-up-man-ship. It's a pistol that appeals to new shooters, is beloved by experienced shooters, and cherished by collectors. It is a finely machined and fitted handgun designed by a man of sheer genius, John Moses Browning.

This Rare Colt Woodsman is in beautiful condition It comes complete with everything pictured, the Colt Woodsman Sport 4 ½” box with the correct number written, as they were at that time, on the underside of the box. The serial number has an ""S"" suffix, designating it to be a 3rd Series. The date of Manufacture of this Colt Woodsman is 1976"

The MR556A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416, developed by H&K as a premium commercial/civilian market rifle with match capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 offers many improvements over conventional AR-15 pattern rifles and carbines.

The MR556A1 uses H&K's proprietary gas piston operation system, employing a piston and a solid rod in place of the gas tube found on typical AR-15 firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since the hot carbon fouling and waste gasses do not enter the receiver. This keeps the receiver much cleaner and decreases heat wear to internal componentry. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components, and uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416, including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled."

It comes with a Leupold VX-III 2.5-8x32mm Handgun Scope, rings and mount. I bought the revolver brand new last fall and I bought the scope, rings and mount used a few months ago. The mount and rings are made out of stainless steel and are very strong. The scope mount can be removed to make the revolver into the exact configuration it came from when new.

The one without tape has the rear sling swivel, but the other one does not. length of pull is about 13.25 -13.5"" (will be a bit longer with buttplate added on the base). You could also remove the base and just add a standard recoil pad. 

These will not fit standard repeater actions, such as bdl or adl, unless you get one of the glue in followers, or inlet the stock for a blind mag setup (adl). These will need a trigger guard and screws (brownells has both). These are in good usuable and serviceable condition, and would be great to refinish for a vintage/retro build. These are old and used, so expect nicks, cuts, scratches, dents, etc, but no cracks and nothing that would hamper them from being used as is. Steam a few small dents out and sand and then finish with a hand rubbed finish if you like.

I originally bought it for the ferry ride from Alaska ""locked in my car"" and no longer have a need for it.  It comes with 2 foam inserts, both in great shape with no cuts or damage. The third foam has cutouts, but can be replaced at any sewing/hobby shop for about $10. The wheels and case are in perfect shape ""not even dirt on them""; I never really used it.

I can also drive this to you, as long as you don't live to far away.  This is a great price with extras...

Up for sale or trade is a Palmetto State Armory AR15 upper half chambered in the powerful 6.8 SPC round (6.8 X 43MM). This makes for a nice rifle, featuring the softer shooting, mid-length D.I gas system. 

The barrel is the shortest possible length (a true 16.1""), while still being NFA compliant. It is a 14.7"" hammer forged barrel that is manufactured by FN which is commonly referred to as ""machine gun"" steel due to its use in the M249 and M240 machine guns. The barrel is also double chrome lined, 1:10 twist, with a pinned/welded A2 flash hider which brings it to the legal length of 16.1"". 

The upper has a chrome BCG and fixed front sight.   Comes with a 25 round magazine AND flip up rear sight. Will also come with PSA box. 

This will make  a very nice rifle once pinned to the lower of your choosing.. I have yet to fire this one, I'm moving it to clear a little space in the safe. I figured I didn't really need 5 AR 15's. I could use some of the trades listed below or will sell for cash price too.

Gun is in like new condition.  Sell all for 850.00 or trade on a NICE 1911 STYLE HANDGUN. Just the ammo and reloading supplies alone are worth 275.00.
