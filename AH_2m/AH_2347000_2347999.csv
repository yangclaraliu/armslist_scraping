It is in great condition, and is ridiculously accurate. Sporting a 16” barrel that’s guaranteed to shoot 1” groups (with match grade ammo) or less at 100 years, otherwise the factory will put a brand new barrel on it, FOR FREE. The barrel is cold hammer forged and fluted barrel, that’s chrome lined and designed to last 10,00 rounds. The FNAR has a great trigger, detachable 5, 10 or 20 round magazines, and is one of the most accurate, piston driven .308 precision rifles I am aware of. The action is fully bedded and barrel free-floated, for superb sub MOA accuracy.
I really like this gun (I own a second FNAR actually), and I’m only selling it because I’m trying to fund the purchase of a high end opic for my other FNAR.
It’s lightweight (like 8.125 LBs), shoots like a dream, has a great trigger and is crazy accurate. I originally bought it because I wanted a highly accurate semi auto rifle in .308, and I loved it so much I bought a second one. I sighted this one in with 6 rounds, and shot another 15 maybe, for grand total of 20 or less rounds. After each shooting it was properly cleaned, and stored it in my climate controlled safe.
It comes in a FNH hard case, 3 comb inserts and 3 recoil pads, and 3 magazines (about $50.00 each, and built like a tank) and a foregrip/bipod (another $50.00). I’m asking $1450.00 OBO, if you can find the 16” barrel version of these they they run $1400.00 new today, plus tax/shipping, plus the magazine.
As you can see they get favorable reviews, and those who know about them/own them really like them, it’s really a great gun. http://www.gunsumerreports.com/review_fnh_fnar_p1.php

Why should you get a Permit to Carry?

You should get one so that you can defend yourself and loved ones from the numerous ""bad guys"" out there that prey on the law abiding citizens. Most violent encounters are over within a minute and the typical police response is greater than 5 minutes. Some people believe that the only people that get a Permit to Carry are ""gun nuts"" or ""wanna be cops"" That is far from the truth. People who get their Permit to Carry are regular people that want to be able to take responsibility for their own safety and security. They are Doctors, Lawyers, blue collar workers, bankers, computer programmers, accountants, retirees and housewives.
Gun Ownership is a serious responsibility and the use of deadly force is a very serious matter and so is protecting yourself and loved ones. Do you know what Minnesota's Use of Force Laws are? Even if you do not want to get your Permit to Carry or even carry a firearm, you should still get training in the safe handling of firearms and the laws of self-defense.

If you need a gun for the shooting portion of the class I will have guns available for free. 

This class is good for the Minnesota Permit to Carry and also Florida, Arizona, Maine, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan Non resident permits.
With the Minnesota Permit to Carry you are legal to carry in up to 23 States. With the Non-Resident Permits you could get up to 35 states."

Suppressors (Silencers) are legal to own in North Carolina with the proper paperwork.  No credit card fees! Use the contact button or call / text REDACTED. If you use the email option, please check your spam folder. We typically respond in 12 hours or less.  Free shipping to your class 2 or 3 dealer.  NC Residents add 6.75% sales tax.

Ruger 10/22 Integrally suppressed with Houge over molded stock.  Black stock is shown, but we have most other colors in stock as well.  This rifle is very quiet.  The integrally suppressed barrel has ports to allow you to shoot cheap bulk pack high velocity ammo at subsonic speeds, eliminating the sonic crack.  This means you get a super quiet rifle without having to buy expensive subsonic ammo.  You can close these ports, and the ammo will remain supersonic.  This must transfer to an individual or trust on a form 4 or dealer on a form 3.  If you are not familiar with this process we can help.

Specs on the barrel:

Fusion T22. The convergence of quiet and short.

Want to quiet your 10/22 in the shortest possible package with only a single tax stamp? The Huntertown Arms Fusion T22 is a short, light, and quiet bull barrel replacement for your 10/22. At just 16.5 inches long, you will have the perfect plinking, target, or hunting rifle.

Upgrades

Need a new barrel in your integral suppressor? Want to change the twist rate? What about moving it to a different host weapon? Unlike most integral suppressors on the market today that register the barrel as the suppressor and use some type of baffle insert, the Fusion T22 has a suppressor tube and the barrel is the baffle stack. If there is an issue with the barrel for any reason, we can repair or replace it. Can you do this with any other integral barrel?

The Fusion T22 has a ported barrel to slow bulk pack ammo to subsonic speeds. But we didn't stop there. You have the option to open and close the ports, allowing you to decide whether to fire at subsonic or supersonic speeds.

Material

The Fusion T22 is constructed entirely of stainless steel and is a direct replacement for the Ruger 10/22 bull barrel. 	Specifications

The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The ACOG is not for sale.  The Surefire M952V can be purchased seperately for $175."

I have a High Standard HSA-15 5.56 NATO with its original 5.56 barrel.  Currently I have a High Standard/Crusader .300 Blackout barrel on the rifle.  It has its original collapsible stock on it.  I have added UTG-branded quad rail, red/green illuminated mil-dot scope, and tactical light with foregrip/switch.  The .300 Blackout barrel has a Yankee Hill Machining flash hider/compensator on it.  There is also a low-profile gas block on it but I don't remember who the manufacturer is at the moment (I do have the original packaging somewhere).  The original grip has been changed for a Magpul MOE grip.  I will include at least one Magpul MOE magazine (I have more).

(Note: You *will* get both barrels, not just the .300 Blackout, just to be clear.)

I own several High Standard ARs and I've found them to be excellent platforms.  This is a sweet shooting rifle.

I'll consider an outright sale, but I'd prefer to trade.  Things I'd be interested in include but are not limited to:

- AR-10
- 1903 A3 or A4 in very good condition
- M1 Garand in very good condition
- S&W Model 29-2 .44 Magnum 6-1/2"" blued with original walnut presentation case

 Marlin X7 Scope Package .30-06  Marlin is one of the oldest and best known firearms manufacturers in the United States -- dating all the way back to the 1870s, with their reputation built on their legendary lever action rifles. There is nothing new or radical about the Marlin X- Series bolt action rifle. It borrows some of the best features found on today’s modern bolt guns and combines them into a very shootable, reliable, accurate, and affordable package.



The black synthetic stock is lightweight, pillar-bedded to the receiver and has a soft, comfortable recoil pad attached. The barrel is threaded into the receiver, and locked in place with a Savage-style barrel nut. The Marlin bolt action rifle has an internal box magazine. The push feed design of the bolt head allows an extra cartridge to be fed directly into the chamber, eliminating the requirement that it be fed from the magazine. The bolt head is pinned to the bolt body, much like the system used on the Savage 110 series rifles. It allows to bolt to self-center, doing away with the need to have the lugs lapped and improves accuracy. The thumb safety is to the right rear of the bolt handle, as seen on the Remington Model 700 rifles. It blocks the trigger from moving, but allows the bolt to be worked.



Perhaps the best features of the Marlin bolt action rifle is the trigger system. Called the Pro-Fire Trigger, it is user adjustable for pull weight, and releases crisply with no hint of creep or overtravel. The new Marlin X- Series rifle is one of the best bargains available in a quality rifle. In addition to that, it is made in the United States by American skilled workers.

282,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2347282,For Sale:  Sig P229R .40 - 9 mags - 3 holsters,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,200","Listed On: Sunday, November 17, 2013",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a great package for a new gun to CCW

For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing."

All items on this gun are brand new within the last 3 months.  I put this gun together thinking I would get into long range shooting.  It hasn't worked out.

Gun: Savage Model 10, FCPXP,  heavy bull barrel, accutrigger, detachable box mag, comes with single shot adapter for the range, less than 100 rds fired, shoots .5 MOA at 100 yrds- excellent condition

Accessories: 
Choate tactical aluminum bedded stock with large palm swell
EGW one piece picatinny rail
Burris Xtreme 30 mm rings-low
Butler Creek lens caps
Bipod- only item that is not new- but in good condition

Scope: this is the crown jewel of this set up
Bushnell Elite Tactical 6-24x50 illuminated reticle- Amazing
Mildot reticle
FRONT FOCAL PLANE- please do your research- this is the most important thing about this scope- a front focal objective means that the reticle grows with the magnification therefore the mil calculations remain the same no matter what magnification setting you are in- most scopes, even some of the expensive Leupolds don't have this feature.  It spares you from having to be a math genius at the range.  It also allows you to range your target with the reticle.  An amazing feature
Large military style target turrets- .1 Mil per click- this means that the mildot reticle and the mil adjustment turrets match- most mildot reticle scopes have MOA adjustments, which means you have to be a math genius again and have a whole other set of numbers at different magnification levels- this scope takes the difficulty out of long range shooting
30 mm main tube
Perfect Tracking- you can adjust the windage and elevation up to 1000 yards then return it to zero and it will be spot on
Do your homework on this scope- watch the youtube videos 
Costs $1000
This scope is new- unlike the Bushnell models of a couple years ago, this scope has enough elevation built into it to shoot 1000 yards without a MOA rail
This gun is ready to shoot 1000+ yards right now


I have over $2000 invested into this set up.  I will sell for $1500 bc I need the cash.  You could never build this gun for that money.
I will sell the scope separately, its new with the box, for $800
- I will include over 100 rds of match quality ammo in a MTM ammo dry case if you buy the whole set up

*Please ignore the ammo in the magazines, I did not remove them when taking the pictures.*

I've shot 400 rounds through this gun, using all 3 magazines and have had ZERO issues. It's been a flawless shooting gun. Installed on the grip, pinky extensions of the compact mags, and the X-Grip are Traction Grips rubber texture for better grip. The backstrap that's installed on the grip is the Small size. If you want to swap it out for either the Medium or Large backstraps, you're going to have to remove the Traction Grips.

History: The PPK/S was developed following the enactment of the US Gun Control Act of 1968.  Under this law one of the firearms no longer allowed for import was the German Walther PPK.  In an effort to overcome the legal obstacle and because the US law did allow domestic production, as opposed to importing the PPK... Thus Walther began manufacturing the PPK/S under US license in 1978 distributed by Interarms of Alexandria, VA."

Most agree that the Makarov produced by East Germany is the finest ever made. Fit and finish is certainly superior to the Russian & Bulgarians I've seen. The bluing is deep and dark with a high polish that looks like what you'd find on a high end Colt, but certainly not on a military pistol.  

Action is smooth and tolerances are tight. I'd rate this pistol at a conservative 95%. There is little wear and the bore is absolutely mirror bright. It was made in 1962 and all numbers match except for the mags which are not factory numbered.  

Included:  

Original E. German brown leather holster in excellent shape with a correct Makarov (screwdriver tip) cleaning rod.  

Four original E. German magazines all in very good or better condition.  

Correct E. German black rope lanyard.  

A spare set of real Russian Red Star thumb rest grips with lanyard loop, screw & Russian leather lanyard. (in case you want to dress it up to look like a Russian).  

 Federal Arms stainless steel threaded barrel in .380ACP. These are very hard to find today and this one is new/unfired in original packaging.  

A SIONICS style FAKE suppressor in blue steel that's designed to work with the threaded Federal barrel. This will look ""super bad"" when installed.  

250 rounds of fresh SILVER BEAR 9x18 ammo. Zinc plated steel cases, 94 grain FMJ bullets, non-corrosive. Great target & blasting ammo.  

Asking $800 for everything listed above. FTF local sale only to a Florida Resident who is at least 21 and is legally able to own a firearm.  

A proper bill of sale will be provided."

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2347729,For Sale:  600 Rounds Federal HST .40S&W JHP - Preferred Police Ammo,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington",$ 700,"Listed On: Monday, November 18, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is 600 rounds of Federal HST 155gr JHP for a .40S&W. Federal released its Hydra-Shok line of ammunition to capture the law enforcement market years ago, and while it was a good round - it proved troublesome when going through barriers before reaching its target - clogging much of the time.

Federal corrected the problem by introducing a line known as HST, and it was tested extensively by the FBI upon its release in .40 caliber, and adopted as their ammunition after blowing the tests out of the water. This is currently the only ammunition I will carry as I feel like it is the only ammunition to hold a candle to the famous ""Black Talon"". 

It's easy to find the much less desirable Hydra-Shok ammunition on the shelf, and many people are intrigued by the ""post"" inside the hollow point. If you do the research, and I suggest you do, you will find that HST is extremely tough to beat. 

That's why HST has almost never (in my experience) been for sale on the shelves at your local gun shop - I have only ever found it online, for a premium price, and in small or limited quantities. I have recently switched to a different caliber for my preferred CCW and cannot find anywhere that sells HST in bulk, must less a place with a single box in stock right now. 

I live in Puyallup, but will be willing to drive a reasonable distance to meet - or even ship if you want to pay for shipping. 

Take a look here for FBI Protocol test results on this ammunition

So here are the options:
-$650 OBO for everything listed minus the ammo

or

-$720 OBO for everything listed, which includes 120 rounds of new in box factory ammo. (100 FMJ and 20 JHP)

Aside from what I mentioned, I will NOT separate anything in my included offers.  What is listed is what is for sale/trade. 

After consideration I've decided to sell to the right buyer.  I have an excellent condition XDs .45 up for sale/trade as the title states. It has been sent to Springfield Armory and has received the upgrade. I can show proof. Gun ran flawless before, and she still does. Less than 150 rounds down the pipe with 0 malfunctions. Cleaned, lubed, and babied after every range trip. Looking to sell or trade, but if you want to buy it, I'll entertain reasonable offers. Not desperate, so no low ballers. Love the gun, but just seeing what else is out there. Here's what I got:

-XDs pistol in .45ACP, 5+1/7+1 capacity
-3 flush stainless factory mags 2(5) rounders and a 1(7) rounder with the sleeves.
-Factory Box that has matching serial numbers with factory holster, factory dual mag pouch, factory fiber optic front sight replacements, factory interchangeable backstrap, factory XD lock & key, and all paperwork 
-Custom Urban Camo Kydex IWB(in waist band) concealed holster and single mag pouch, right handed
-20 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense FTX .45ACP
-100 rounds of brand new factory target FMJ's (Winchester and Remington brand)

This pistol is a pocket train. Has knockdown power of a .45, with a concealability of a .22 or .380. Has tons of excellent reviews for a reason.  WILL NOT SHIP, NO EXCEPTIONS.  I only will deal locally, buyer must meet face-to-face and must have AZDL.  CCW preferred and I have my CCW also."
