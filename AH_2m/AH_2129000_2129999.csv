$425 OBO I really want to sell this for cash, only trades I'm interested in is Ar lowers or uppers.
Colt's bluing is worn and has 'browned' some, but no visible rusting, the aluminum finish has some nicks in it, the grips are original and show wear and the 'screw on' cap on the extractor rod is missing($8-10 on Numrich), it's my current truck gun but time to move it on. I have fired this weapon and it functions perfectly. Comes with brown leather and 32 factory rounds and 6 reloads that a friend gave me, I only have fired 18 factory rounds through it."

Rock Island Armory is owned by Armscor USA they make their 1911s in an ISO-9001-certified factory right outside of Manila, Philippines. The company mills their gun frames from cast 4140 carbon steel and forged 4140 steel for the slides. Rock Island, by far, beats any price on any solidly built 1911. Armscor/Rock Island Armory makes more 1911s than any other gun manufacturer in the world. Not only does the company build the Rock Island Armory pistols, it also makes Auto Ordnance’s entire line of 1911s as well.

What makes it recoilless is the rifle-length gas system combined with the battlecomp 1.0 muzzle device. With this setup you can actually get the gun recoiling DOWN if you shoot fast enough.

It is immensely controllable and has been put to good use, surviving a training class flawlessly without a single stoppage for any reason.

The rifle's Palmetto State Armory lower is built with a White Oak Armament lower parts kit and includes their ALG trigger. The stock is a Magpul ACS, grip and trigger guard are also Magpul. The barrel is a Green Mountain 18"" made of 416R stainless steel and has a 1:7 twist (Green Mountain namelessly makes the barrels used in many top quality AR makers), with a Wilson Combat low-profile gas block. It runs an Alpha Omega Weaponry M16 BCG and the long handguard is a Troy VTAC.

It also comes with ARMS 40L backup flipup sights already installed and zeroed for 50 yards.

As you can see (or Google), the parts are all top-shelf and it shows. It shoots like a dream and the weight distribution makes it incredibly maneuverable. There is some wear on the left side of the lower from my belt buckle as it swung on me while slung, and there is some scratching on the bottom of the handguard from resting on different real-life barricades like car hoods and boulders. Obviously none of these minor cosmetic blemishes will impede function in any way and if I had planned on selling it then I would've taken better care of its aesthetics. I meant to keep this as my One Rifle but real life has intervened as it always does.

I will also include two metal high-quality D&H 30-round magazines with the rifle.

Price is $1,050 or best offer; cash only, no trades. I don't think you'll ever find this nice of a rifle at this low of a price on Armslist ever again."

I picked it up several years ago with the intent of a restoration...but have lost the interest and don't have the time.  It has a full and untouched mum.  The cleaning rod is missing.  There are a couple buggered screws around the mounting plates but the metal is otherwise in very good shape.  Bore is excellent and I fired a few rounds years ago and found it to be a good shooter.  Bubba did a job on the wood finish...it has been lightly sanded and refinished to an orange like color...much darker than the original finish.  Matching numbers on the bolt, safety, firing pin, extractor, receiver and front bayonet lug. Front half assembly number of 271 matches the rear mounting plate number and the number on the takedown lug.  Front assembly plate number is 916. This is as close to fully matching as u will get I think.  It was common for the plates to be mismatched during assembly I believe.  There is a little wiggle when the 2 halves are assembled...the detent pin seems to be pushed in a little...may have a weak or missing spring there.  It is not crushed..but moves freely and is flush with the mounting plate.  This is a quite valuable rifle in good condition...understand that there is work to be done here.  I am throwing out a price and will consider cash offers.  I will consider partial trade on any Model Glock 9MM that is in good shape and complete.  Please do not ask about any other trades....only the Glocks.  I will ship to FFL or C&R for a flat fee of $40 but prefer a FTF transfer.  Email for additional pics."

But I decided to leave it in its original state. A gun collector friend of mine found a few of these rifles that were stored away for many years. It is obviously used but in very good shape for its age (manufacture date stamp is 1946). The rifling is very good. This thing is accurate! I shoot smaller than quarter-sized shot groups at 100 yards with open sights that I have not adjusted at all. 
I did a little research and found a number of comments that this is considered to be the best turnbolt action rifle that ever saw combat. All of my combat experience is with an M16A2 so I can't tell you firsthand.. But this rifle is alot of fun to shoot. The only reason I am selling it is because it's time to buy my son his first deer rifle. This would make a great deer rifle for someone; just not a 10-year old. The recoil isn't bad but it is too much for a kid. I will include a box of .303 British ammo and a 10-round magazine with the rifle."

Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock."

Includes Quick Detach Mount and Dust Cover

Never needs batteries

Better Aiming Anytime, Anywhere

The Need
Soldiers in the modern battlefield require weapon sights which facilitate quick and instinctive accurate shooting. The need for advanced optical sights is especially vital in close quarter combat where the use of both eyes is critical.

Users
• Military
• Law Enforcement
• Civilian Market - Hunting

Our Solution
The MEPRO 21 provides instant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the MEPRO M21 is battle proven, simple to use accurately and totally reliable.

MEPRO 21 offers a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open. This was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat, and it can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye.

Illumination of the aiming point is achieved by a fiber optic collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The MEPRO 21 reflex sight offers users the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open.

The MEPRO 21 is also designed to work in tandem with a magnifying scope like the MEPRO MX3 - mounted behind it for ultimate accuracy.

Advantages
- Always ready for action – no batteries or switches.
- Aim & shoot faster than ever - with both eyes open!
- Self-illumination means always available
- Operates under all weather and temperature conditions
- Large 30mm diameter lens assures large FOV

- Quicker shooting in urban areas and rapid target acquisition
- Can be ordered with optional reticles – dot, triangle, open-x and bullseye
- Effective use of sight under extreme conditions such as bad weather, firing after physical stress and firing under pressure
