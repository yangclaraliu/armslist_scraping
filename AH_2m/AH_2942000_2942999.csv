For sale or trade is a 2006 Chrysler PT Cruiser Touring Edition. 4 cylinder, non turbo, automatic. Just short of 125K. 2nd owner, purchased in 2007. Clean title in hand. No wrecks. Keyless entry. Power windows and locks. The spots in the pictures are water, not oil.
The Good...
In the last year all of the following parts have been professionally replaced. I have spent just under $3000 and have all the paperwork.
Left rear brake drum
Rear brake shoes
Rear brake wheel cylinders
Front sway bar links
Left and right front CV axles
Rear shocks
Left and right lower control arm assemblys
Front sway link kit
Left and right outer tie rods
Cam sensor
Pirelli Tires ($560, less than 1000 miles on them)

And that is just in the last year. I have done regular maintenance on this vehicle and replaced things immediately as needed.

The Bad...
Needs timing belt (does not run, will need to be towed)
Cracked windshield (across the bottom, does not impair vision)
Front bumper is pushed in on passenger side (it's plastic, could be popped back out)
Various minor dents and dings around vehicle
Could use a good detailing

The PT has been a very reliable car and gets fairly good MPG. I no longer need this vehicle so there is no point in me putting more $ into it. I know what it books for in this condition and what the cost of repairs is. $1800 is a very nice price price.
This is a great opportunity for someone who wants to put in a bit of time and money then flip the car for a profit.

Shoots flawless and never had any problems.  What I used for my every day carry until I recently bought a glock 26 .45 to carry.  The CZ82 is by far the best of its makerov variants.  Was a military/Czech police sidearm from 1983 to 1994.  The first of its kind to have polygonal rifling and a fixed barrel for improved accuracy and less blowback. Breaks down in seconds for the easiest cleaning I've ever had to do. I absolutely love these. I was going to stick in a few hundred in it to get in nickel plated, improved sights, wood grips, and some other nifty skilled gunsmith work. I have seen some beautiful custom pieces that would make for a great keeper. Comes with two 12 round double stacked magazines and a uncle mike hip holster.  I also have some 9x18 makerov silver bear critical defensive ammo I can throw in. Im firm with the price.  I think that's fair considering the current demand for them.  Sold out everywhere that I've seen online, there's a few locals 2 or 3 all asking over 375. For the money you won't find a gun this reliable anywhere. Not made of cheap plastic/polymer. Has a good weight to it. The trigger pull blows my kimber 1911 to shame.  I was very impressed. Must sign a bill of sale and ccw is preferred but doesn't bother me if you don't. It has a ambi clip release and safety for lefties also. I can send pics upon request. Serious buyers only. If you are familiar with these firearms you know there known for reliability and accuracy."

This is a Saiga IZ-106 AK-pattern semi-automatic 20 Gauge shotgun with a 3"" chamber in the original box and 2 extra magazines.  It comes with an adjustable gas tube to handle different loads.  I have never shot the thing, but the previous owner said he purchased it new and ran only about 10 rounds through it.  He didn't need it and sold it to me.. and well, I don't need it.  I've reduced the price on this thing 3 times... So... this is the lowest I am willing to go.  I expect anyone interested to be in Nebraska, have their CCW or Nebraska Purchase Permit.  I will meet anyone interested at a public, well lit place to conduct the transaction.

382,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2942382,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Tactical 357 Mag Low Flash-Short Barrel - 125 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1225 fps - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Monday, April 14, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=276

For those wanting the deep-for-weight penetration of the all copper (lead free) Barnes XPB 125gr. bullet in a “tactical” loading, here it is. We use low flash powder so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire, as nearly all self defense shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about.

Our tactical 357 mag. ammo generates less felt recoil and blast (flash and noise) than our Heavy 357 mag. loads and as such is a better choice for those carrying light weight short barreled revolvers. This is still a full powered 357 mag. load, but allows for faster follow-up shots and greater shooting comfort.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal real world stock guns. The established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings are essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing ammo from laboratory test barrels.

1642 fps - Marlin 1894, 18 inch barrel
1333 fps - S&W mod. 27, 5 inch barrel
1383 fps - S&W Mt. Gun, 4 inch barrel
1295 fps - S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1235 fps - S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
Yes the more modern 4-inch S&W Mt. gun did shoot faster velocities than the older 5-inch model 27 and this is due to different internal barrel dynamics of the newer gun.

This ammunition is safe for use in ANY/ALL 357 magnum firearms."

Up front the only issue with the gun is the original *plastic* grip safety snapped in two following a fall off a coffee table. Because no grip safeties exist *anywhere* for this gun, I had to modify a Caspian Arms .220 radius to fit and restore function. To that end the gun functions great and looks proper but this is not an original part. Neither is the threaded 5.5"" Stainless Storm Lake Barrel and Wolf 25 lb spring I installed. .578x28"" thread for a suppressor or brake and is covered with a Stainless steel thread protector. The heavy spring eliminates recoil. This has been my carry gun for a long time and fires and functions wonderfully. Will include two Mec-gar 13 round magazines and a modified Para 20 rounder. This gun is a great gun for a shooter and 13 rounds of .45 ACP in a 1911 full size is a lot of firepower. Pricing it low due to the modified grip safety. Otherwise the gun is 8/10, some cosmetic holster wear and use wear on the slide and moving parts but the slide and barrel are pretty tight. If you have or know someone with a proper .250"" radius hi-cap grip safety you can easily have a great looking and solidly functioning shooter. About 200 rounds in the new barrel and 700 rounds through the gun overall. Mostly 230 grain Winchester ball and hydrashoks. Price is firm, Local sales only, must have valid AZ drivers license and because it's a handgun I'd also prefer to sell only to CCW holders. Must also be willing to sign a transfer of ownership form. 


*** I provided a few pictures*** I have more pictures of the replacement grip safety upon request. Really needs a .250"" out of a Charles Daly, BUL M-5 or similar gun."

I only took it out twice and it performed flawlessly. Shoots really good groups.
 It was clean and wet when I got it and it's always been clean and wet ever since. As you know, these rifles are the most durable, dependable, easy to maintain, and they look awesome too! 
Although this is a close/medium range rifle, the scope gets you much more distance with greater accuracy. The scope illuminates red and has the range finder. Windage and elevation adjustable. Removable and replaceable in 2 seconds or less.
At this price, you'll never lose your money. Especially the way things are now.
Show ID and preferred cwp and it's yours. Serious buyers only that pay cash. No trades
P.S. If you want to see what AKs are doing to unarmed, defenseless men, women and children on youtube. Type in something like ""Syria execution"" They are fu@#n animals over there and the powers that be (here) feel we need to see it all. (which we probably do..) So arm yourself and never let go because as history has ALWAYS shown... unarmed people eventually end up DEAD.

The raised cheek piece helps to direct recoil into the shoulder area and quickly puts the shooter's line of sight in alignment with the scope
A satin finish provides protection and enhances the natural beauty of the hardwood.
The high grade Walnut stock with detailed checkering provides classic good looks.
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy.
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy.
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately.
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform.
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass.""
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact.
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change.
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged.
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil."

FROM MANUFACTURER:

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™’s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight."

STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
March 19, 2014

The MMCT is a 501 (c) (3) charity and was started in 1990 in Dallas, TX.  Its mission is to provide economic support to local military personnel, regular, reserve and retired, and to military support charities and volunteer organizations.  Such assistance has been as varied as underwriting every local  USMC Toys For Tots Campaign since 1991; providing individual grants to individual returning reservists, who have lost their jobs and/or homes to; making grants to JRB Carswell Guard & Reserve Associations and DFW Marine/Navy Families.  Its longest and largest effort has been to provide direct support to families of amputee, PTSD, and brain-injured OIF & OEF Vets as well as the Vets themselves through the North Texas VA Warrior Patient Shuttle service since September 2007 and the official active duty (United States Marine Corps and Navy Corpsman) in Quantico, VA The Official Wounded Warrior Regiment covering costs not taken care of by the DOD, USMC JROTC High School Programs, ReserveAid and Joe Foss Institute.

In 2007 there were about 1300 VA OIF and OEF outpatients registered using three major VA medical facilities in northeast Texas-The Bonham VA Medical Center, The Ft Worth VA Outpatient Clinic, and The Dallas VA PolyTrauma Unit in Oak Cliff, Dallas.  Of those 1300 patients 100 PTSD were outpatients at Ft Worth, while 65 PTSD veterans reported to the PolyTrauma Unit.  65% of the outpatients at the PolyTrauma unit also had a brain injury.   

In 2009 the Veterans Resource Center was set up as a 501 (c) (3) originally named Homeless Veterans Services of Dallas.  We currently provide all branches of the military, 6,000 Veterans in 2013, ranging from Daycare and female resources resulting in employment, education, healthcare, transportation and traditional housing.

The MMCT underwrites the expenses of the shuttle service which is manned entirely by volunteers.  Three wheelchair converted Dodge Caravan’s were originally purchased, and their respective fuel, insurance, and maintenance expenses were underwritten by the MMCT by way of a Triad Fund Grant of about $234,000, which grant was renewed for about $130,000 in 2010.  1564 patient’s trips were provided from each patient’s home to the relevant North Texas VA facility for treatment, and back home from April 1, 2011 through January 30, 2012.  1564 of these same patient’s trips were provided from April 1, 2011 through January 30, 2012.  Additional vans have been donated to this effort, one by Harriet Miers, former White House Counsel for President George W. Bush, and first female president for State of Texas Bar Association.   MMCT also underwrites the expenses for those vans.

The MMCT does not charge anyone for its services and all of our labor is provided at no costs to MMCT, except CPA audit and Tax return preparation is totally volunteered.  The CPA cost was around $2,500.  The only other G & A expense was the cost of the Directors and Officers Liability insurance of $2,140 (2yr premium).  Other than these stated costs, there are no other administrative expenses with approximately 100% of donated funds going direct to those of all branches of military services in need!
