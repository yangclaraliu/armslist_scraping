The price I'm asking for this is a steal, they're worth more, just wanting something different.

I did have an issue with ejection when I first got the rifle. With one email to POF, I had UPS at my doorstep the next day ready to ship my upper to POF. A rubber gasket was put over the ejector spring at the factory and the upper was back in my hands in a week's time. POF has a lifetime warranty on all their rifles. 

I experienced excellent accuracy with this rifle and really got into reloading precession rounds. I now want to reach out even further so I this one has to go. I am pricing it for a quick sell at $1700. 

This rifle is CA legal as it has a Raddlock bullet button on it. The rifle comes as is with no accessories minus a POF hard case to carry it. 

If the rifle must be shipped, I will ship the upper directly to you and the lower to your FFL dealer. Payment must clear before item ships. Secure and safe payment is a must."

However, I will not sell the guns without also selling the holsters. For example, if you want just a holster, you can buy just a holster. But, if you want the guns, you have to buy the holsters. I will sell the guns separately, but you will have to buy some of the holsters too. I don’t want to get stuck with a bunch of holsters and no guns. Please contact me for individual pricing on each item you might be interested in. Cash only, no trades at this time.

Buyers must be 21 years of age and older and must be willing to sign a bill of sale. Buyers are also required to have a valid Virginia Driver’s License and a CCW or a Voter Registration Card to demonstrate that you are not a felon.

The frame was replaced in 1979. Some other work was done in 1992, possibly the installation of the 1977 manufactured slide.  Manufactured in Ulm, Germany in 1977.  This gun looks brand new and the original owner spent extra $$ for the wood checkered grips.  Standard 9mm ball ammo works best.  It's suggested not to shoot +P ammo.

I have never even gone hunting with this stuff. Which is the main reason I'm selling it all. I am selling this altogether initially. Maybe later on if I get no takers I'll sell the stuff individually. This is a great deal for those wanting to start in muzzle loading. I have everything you need to walk our my door and go hunting. I would be happy to walk you through the equipment and or accessories, and explain how everything works if need be.

Also included with this auction is a Netgear WiFi Range Extender and a 12 volt power inverter that basically doubles the range of the drone.  You just plug the WiFi Range Extender into the power inverter, plug the unit into your vehicles cigarette lighter and have a mobile extended WiFi Base Station.  The drone takes outstanding high definition video from a forward facing camera as well as standard definition video from a downward facing camera.  It also takes still photos.  This is one of the easiest drones to learn to fly and can be mastered in a very short time.  All setting can be adjusted for either novice or expert.  It can be flown indoors or out.

My name is Naomi Struttgard, I am here to testify to the good work of the Best African Traditional Healer.

4 years ago, my husband left home, he never returned, no phone calls, no letters, no emails, and no sign of him anywhere. My daughter got sick with multiple sclerosis; things were so tough for me. I had lost hope, 2 years ago, i met a psychic on the internet, he said he would help me, i paid over $600 a hope of at least saving my daughter’s life and getting a job that i was contesting for, and still nothing happened, i lost hope completely, my daughter's situation got worse each day.

Last month, i saw a posting concerning the good works of the A most powerful traditional doctor in Africa, Africa has always been my hope in spells but i never trusted any spell caster from the one who just ate my money. Then i decided to try Prof Mama Nisha. I gave her a try...i paid about $370, for all three spells (Bring Lover back, Healing spell and Career spells). In a matter of weeks, my husband called me and told me he was sorry and that he wants to come back to me and that he would explain everything when he comes back home, three days later, i got a new job with a loan from a finance company, right now, my daughter's condition is getting better each day and i trust she would be well in a matter of days.

I want to thank you again Prof Mama Nisha for your efforts and for bringing my life back to normal and so close to perfection.

When i talk about this woman i don’t want to finish she is my hero of the century.

thanks Prof Mama Nisha.

Overall it is a great car, I just bought it on a whim, and it is not really what I am looking for. It will go into third, but instead of mashing it in there I have been going from 2nd to 4th and it works like that just fine. The engine runs strong, does not smoke, and does not burn oil.

Needless to say, all numbers are matching and the rifle shows close no signs of wear at all. The bore is mirror clean and I am not sure if it has ever been fired except for factory testing. I have checked upon the status of the rifle myself and have consulted experts as well, and there are no signs of it having been refinished or ""polished"" in any way at all.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat fi nish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform.
Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the CZ 75 Compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry with checkering in key areas on the front and back straps combined with the redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decreases the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transitions.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

http://www.thebangswitch.com/is-the-x39-world-coming-to-an-end/


The people here selling ammo are doing only harm to the gun community by overpricing their products and spreading fear to try to make a buck out at your expense, shop smart, use websites like www.slickguns.com and www.gunbot.net to find good deal on ammo, never buy 7.62x39 ammo for over 24 cents a round, that's $4.80 a box of 20, the deals are always around, never buy corrosive ammo, it's not worth it. Btw that same website sells .233 ammo dirt cheap, you can get 1k rounds of 7.92x39 and 500 rounds of .223 FMJ wolf ammo shipped to your doorstep for $400, thats 7.62x39  for 24 cents at round and .223 for 31 cents a round delivered to your doorstep, shipping included! No need to drive and meet someone, no need to get cash from the bank, think of the time wasted meeting people here to buy ammo, think of the gas expense, unless the person lives 5 minutes from your house(thats 10 min round trip), sells the ammo for the same price online or cheaper and there is a bank on the way, you are better off buying it online and getting it delivered to you.


Another thing to think about, if the person lives 30 miles from your house (you can use google maps to find out), and you get lets say 20 miles per gallon on your car, round trip thats 60 miles, so you just used 3 gallons of gas to meet that person, if the gas is about 3.33 per gallon you just spent $10 just to meet that person! That's not taking into account any toll money, you can check how many miles per gallon your car does at http://www.fueleconomy.gov, but know that the list is your car brand new in perfect conditions, not how it is nowdays, but at least you get a ballpark.

It has an Armasight Orion 4x Generation 1+ night vision scope with attached IR illuminator. I have also added a second IR illuminator on the left side near the bipod.  All that comes with the rifle. The NV will be in it's orignal box, the carbine will be in a Palmetto State Army box. The bipod and second IR are mounted on a Magpul MOE handguard (mid length) the Carbine also has Magpul MOE trigger guard and the Magpul MOE stock.

The combination works excellently out to 100 yards plus in all conditions and further depending on ambient light. It is easy to zero in daylight using the pinhole in the lens cover but I actually used a laser bore sight at night to dial it in. NV includes the batteries. Here's a link to YouTube so you can see the Armasight Orion.

Once upon a time, a ""dissipator"" AR was created by taking a 20"" rifle-length gas system upper and cutting the barrel down to 16"".  This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability.  The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition.   Advances in AR technology  have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks.  This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation.   We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version. 

Our Hammer-Forged Mid-length dissipator uses a ""Machine Gun Steel"" barrel that is thick chrome-lined for durability and high pressure tested and magnetic particle inspected.

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system.   A2 style profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with a pinned F-marked front sight post in the Rifle position with sling swivel,  rifle length MOE handguards, and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.
