A heavy-duty dual latching system makes for a better seal and less likely to open accidentally. Double padlock tabs along with molded-in stacking ridges, make these solid containers the perfect solution to so many storage needs.

The 50 are hollow point.  I do not own a gun these will fit and want to trade all for 300 CCI minimag .22 caliber rounds. I do not care if they are solid point or hollow point.   I will ship but will need to do it correctly and follow the rules of UPS in shipping these which is expensive.  I would also need my ammo shipped first so I obviously would prefer to hand deliver.  The Winchester box is complete but worn on the corners and color stained from age here and there on the surface of the box.

They haven't been made for quite a while, the cost of the complex manufacturing just couldn't keep the price within the realm of most shooters, but for those who have fired one the accuracy and reliability are without compare; in addition, this has one of the nicest triggers of any semi-auto pistol you'll ever shoot, and has the unique ""grip cocker"" action that makes this gun completely safe in the event of droppage.  This is the original PSP variant, and is a former German police gun imported about 10 years ago thru Alabama---if you know anything about the P7s you know the history of these guns and how well they were taken care of; I'm still searching for the box but I ""believe"" this was a B-grade gun...when I confirm that I will update this listing.  The pistol will come with the box, 2 magazines (most were only shipped with 1 mag) and the cleaning brush and takedown/carbon scraper tool; this is a blued gun without the plum slide many of these guns had.  My price is $1350 FIRM; additional magazines are available at $100 apiece.  

I am selling several quality firearms to fund the purchase of a car for my daughter to go to college, so once I have enough money in hand I will take down anything I haven't already sold.  I will consider partial trade values on QUALITY FIREARMS only...I emphasize only QUALITY FIREARMS.  Please call or text to REDACTED between 0900-2100 only please.

The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind
Free-floating button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy

Item G-35993-1.   It was the first standard-issue semi-automatic rifle.[5] Called ""the greatest battle implement ever devised"" by General George S. Patton.  The M1 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, clip-fed, semi-automatic, shoulder-fired weapon. This means that the air cools the barrel; that the power to cock the rifle and chamber the succeeding round comes from the expanding gas of the round fired previously; that it is loaded by inserting an en-bloc (i.e., it goes into the rifle's action and functions as part of the rifle) metal clip (containing eight rounds) into the receiver; and that the rifle fires one round each time the trigger is pulled.[7] After the eight rounds have been shot, the empty clip automatically ejects with an audible ""ping"" to alert the shooter that it required reloading.

This gun has nicks and scratches in the stock typical of a 109 year old gun and someone has re-lacquered the stock and fore grip but it was not sanded down so wood fits as original by the color and condition of lacquer would estimate it was done 70 to 80 years ago. Barrel retains 90% plus of it's original bluing!!! Barrel bore is 90% plus and shiny. Tube has nice brown patina but only has 60% or so of the original bluing. Receiver has 50 to 60% or original bluing and then rest is nice brown patina. Action is very solid this gun was shot very little internals function like new and springs are still good and tight. 20"" barrel with full length tube. Original butt plate with some cracking in the wood towards the bottom of the butt plate. Claimed to be owned by famous Texas Ranger John R. Hughes 1855-1946 then later by his Son Franklin R. Hughes who's initials are inscribed in the stock and who was responsible for the re-lacquering. I have no paperwork to substantiate this claim. This rifle was purchased from a gentle man By the name of Franklin R Hughes Jr. who said he was John Hughes grandson. From the age of the gentleman and the stories his grandpa use to tell him I believed him. Historical or not nice old functioning and shooting 1904 Model 1894"

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple Brand New, factory fresh Kahr CM40 compact pistols! These are fantastic little concealed carry guns, and you can’t beat them for the price. Featuring all the features of Kahr’s CW series, and putting them into a smaller 3″ barrel and body, the CM series is an excellent choice for any shooter interested in carrying.



I only have TWO in stock, and they are on sale and priced to sell quickly for only $389.00 each (cash price).



Kahr CM40 .40 S&W Compact Pistol with 3.1″ Barrel and 6-round Magazine CM4043


The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr’s CW series (3.6″ barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3″ barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1″ barrel and an overall length of 5.47″, with a height of 4.0″. The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr’s PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple engraved markings instead of roll marking; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr’s seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:

- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.

- Kahr’s incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a “safe-cam action” and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.

- Kahr’s two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr’s barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter’s hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.
Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

All upgrades (other than installing the handgrip and buffer spring) were performed by the professional gunsmiths at Wiser Owl Firearms & Tactical up in Miramar.

The lower has MOE grip, trigger guard and stock.  Here are the specs from the PSA website:

Barrel:   A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  16"" length, chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   M4A1 style profile is phosphate coated to mil-specs, and is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability.   Barrel is made for us by FN Manufacturing here in Columbia, and finished off with a Midwest Industries SS12G2 free float rail, low-profile gas block, and A2 flash hider.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer, and are marked with the Palmetto State Armory logo on the left side, up front, just below the rail.
Bolt Carrier Group: Bolt is made of Mil-spec Carpenter 158 steel, Shot peened, and MPI. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked per mil-spec. M-16 style bolt carrier is parkerized outside, chrome lined inside.  Charging handle is crafted of 7075 aluminum to mil-specs.
Lower:  These forged lowers are quality made using 7075-T6 aluminum and are marked ""MULTI"" for caliber.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.  7075 aluminum Mil-spec sized buffer tube is dry film lube coated on the inside, has 6 adjustment positions, is paired with a PSA M4 stock and has a staked castle nut.  Standard carbine buffer is Black anodized and has the PSA logo on the face."

This is a post-recall model (serial number XS69xxxx). Only 20 rounds down the pipe. Carried for less than a month. Gun is in like new condition and comes with Springfield case and accessories. For the right price, will also include MTR custom leather holster (pictured) anc magazine pouch (not pictured).

Comes with:
--XDs Hard Case
--2 Magazines
--XDs Holster
--XDs Magazine Holder
--Yellow and Orange Replacement Fibers for Night Front Sights
--MTR Concealment Holster/Magazine Pouch (if wanted)

This rifle separates into two halves for convenient transport and storage options. Barrel and forend easily separates from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need adjustment after the first reassembly. Lockup is secure and repeatable ensuring an accurate return to zero - even when receiver mounted optics are used. Shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide extra storage. Padded, single-shoulder strap. Gun features include a black synthetic stock and forearm, an 18.50 inch stainless steel barrel with six grooves and a 1:16 inch right hand rifle twist. Clear matte finish. Adjustable rear sight and gold bead front sight. Ten round rotary magazine included. Weighs 4.67 pounds and is 37 inches long when assembled with each half being less than 20.25 inches when disassembled.

I recently traded a friend of mine out of two very interesting Winchester 1911 shotguns is great condition.  I will more than likely sell one evenutally.  No, I am not retarded, these are actually Winchester's first attempt at an autoloading shotgun, that worked around John Browning's patents on the A5.

Anyways, them being about a hundred years old, the stocks are decent, but the forends are cracked.  I need you to look in your gun cabinents, safes. garages, attics or over your mantle for one of these bad boys that nobody has used in 50 years, and see if you are willing to part it out if the stock and forend are in good condition.

The only reason I'm selling this gun is that I've found a 17 Remington Center fire that I'm wanting to get. It has a 3x9 Bushnell Banner Dawn & Dusk scope with an illuminated reticle mounted on it. It can be switched from the standard black to red or green. I also have 200 rds of ammo I'm throwing in with it.  I've put around 75 rds through it. If interested you can text, email, or call me. Thanks, Seth. 620- two one eight-8596"
