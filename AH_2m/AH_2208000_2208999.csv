Gun is in excellent shape and is tight and accurate. Grip safety can be overcome though.
Don't know the round count but gun acts like it is new. No wear and comes with extra grips, 2 McCormick 7rd magazines, original papers, take down tool, and case.

The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept in a pump action shotgun. With the optional SteadyGrip™ stock, this 12-gauge shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or mount a fully-rifled slug barrel for tack-driving accuracy on deer. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip.

At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn’t just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core.

ComforTech® Shim Kit
You can customize the models with the ComforTech® buttstock to your personal requirements using a shim kit that adjusts both drop and cast. Also fits newer Montefeltro and Legacy models.

Grooved Grip Surface
Checkering is for wood stocks, but the Benelli Nova Pump and SuperNova use distinctive grooves that give both an unmatched gripping surface and an unforgettably distinctive look.

Modular Stock System
The SuperNova is available with a choice of three modular buttstocks and can be quickly reconfigured with a simple ratchet wrench. All three stocks are made of tough synthetic and have a textured, matte finish to provide years of reliable service."

Foregrip, tri rail, ext mag release, flip up iron sights, 4 mags, red/green dot sight, x4 zoom scope (flip to side ). Sks bolt milled to take magazines with bolt action open or closed. Every year I treat myself to a fun modification project and sell the gun to do the next one. This year I turned an sks with a broken tapco stock into a bullpup rifle with a barrell length of 16 inches. I'm selling it with 4 magazines. To be honest the 20 rounders are perfect, and I have a plastic and metal 30 rounder. The plastic has done well, but needed machined out of the box to fit. The metal one is a total POS that I cannot get to work. That aside, I've had nothing but great shooting and turned heads at the range. People always tell me it looks like an mtar and are amazed it costed me about 750 bucks to do (and about 5""4 hours to install the stock for the first time). I'm asking 800 with the configuration you see on the bed excluding the red/ green dot and flip to side zoom. The latter two sights are an extra $100 but cost me about 140. There's an extra front sight with a muzzle break, but I'm not asking anything for that. Open to all offers (cept shotguns and handguns, I'm good there.) offer what you can, worst I'll say is no. I'll include ammo so you can take it straight to the range, I'll be more generous with the amount based on initial offer. I'm open to trading for an ar or ak. Text contact is my preference, but do what you need to do to contact. REDACTED."

The pistol has a universal style accessory rail for mounting lights, lasers or other devices.

The sights on the MC Operator are low-profile combat sights, with three tritium dots for fast target pickup in bright daylight or on a dark street. The edges of the sights are smoothed for snag-free draws.

The barrel is match grade stainless, supported at the front with a match grade stainless barrel bushing. The pistol has a G.I. style guide rod.

The trigger on the MC Operator is match grade, too, with a pull weight of 4.5 to 5 pounds, example photo of Picatinny rail which is just right for combat or target shooting.

An ambidextrous safety makes the gun easier to operate for lefties, or for those who need to shoot with either hand.

This rifle is butter smooth and shoots great; it would make a great deer rifle, a nice collector's piece, or just a fun plinker at the range that will surely turn heads with its thunderous roar and 12"" fireballs. Anybody who is familiar with these rifles knows that the Polish-made ones are of very high quality (much more so than the Russian M44's), and they will continue to rise in price from now on. It also comes with the typical side folding bayonet and sling. All numbers match except the bolt, which is normal for the Polish rifles. The headspace is great, the bore is shiny, and the recoil is surprisingly mild.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.  Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.  Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.  The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.  To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.  The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.  The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.  Made in The U.S.A.

The only reason I am thinking about trading it is because it is just a bit heavy for me to carry all day long.
I am not interested in any Taurus, RIA, Para Ordnance or any cheap 1911's. Also I am only interested in 45's unless you have an old Sig P228 with ammo.
Trades must be done here in the Keene, NH area.
If you have any questions you can call or text me at REDACTED. I will not be able to get to a computer this Saturday or Sunday so my cell phone will be my only way to answer questions or make a deal.
Thanks in advance, Butch 
PS for you guys that have made offers to me. I will decide by Monday night what trade I will take. Most likely I will decide on Saturday."

Or I will sell the whole package for 700. The holsters were $150, the mags are 22 piece, so $120 or so, and to get texturing done is $120-150, the Vanguard is $20 bucks, the pistol is about 450-500, so you are looking at $850-900 investment on my part. I really like this gun but Im staying with the M&P so my loss is your gain. Surefire x300 and ammo not included. Will ship to your FFL but prefer FTF, will sign bill of sale.

In my opinion this is the best pocket pistol on the market. I've owned and shot everyone of them and this little gun beats them all. It has a shorter and slimmer profile than Ruger LCP and Keltec P3AT, yet has a larger grip area which aids in shooting it accurately. The trigger on the DB is an extreme improvement compared to the other 2, and it is also the only one that actually offers real dot sights. The stainless slide also protects better against the daily wear and tear a daily carry gun faces. The price is $350 cash and we're located in Stanfield, NC. Shipping to your local FFL is also available, if that is a better option for you. All local, state and federal laws apply. Contact us today to get this one before its gone.

I have for sale a like new Heckler & Koch MP7A1 Sub Machine gun. Caliber 4.6x30mm. This gun was used for one LE Demo and then put back in the safe. Ammo is easy to obtain from Midway USA and in stock. This gun is amazing and any dealer that doesn't have one needs one. H&K no longer allows imports of there firearms to go directly to dealers so you can't find many of these around and when you do they go for big bucks. This gun comes with 500 rds of Fiocchi FMJ ammo. 80 rds of Radway Green ammo. The Radway Green 26 grain projectiles are black. The casings are headstamped ""4.6x30 05 RG"" for Radway Green. They are nasty little rounds. Tests show they will penetrate steel at 100 yards where 5.7mm SS190 AP ammo will only leave a dent in at point blank range. These rounds alone sale for 95.00 a box of 20.00 on Gunbroker. The gun comes with a factory sling, one 20 rd mag, owners manual, and factory box. Buyer will pay shipping of $50.00 and what ever insurance is required depending on final price. I will require payment in the form of postal money order ONLY.

This is the model with the internal magazine which can only be purchased by special order now.  It is chambered in 22-250.  The mass produce VLP is now only produced with a detachable box magazine, but you can still get the internal mag by ordering it.

It has a 26"" fluted stainless heavy barrel.  It has the accutrigger.  Wood laminate stock( by far savages most attractive stock).  The stock does have one scratch which is hard to see but I show it in the pictures because I try to represent the firearms I sell as accurately as possible.  Other than the one scratch this gun is flawless and the 22-250 is a deadly fast and flat shooting round for both bench rest shooting and varmint hunting.  I had a redfield revenge scope on the rifle but I am keeping that scope but will be selling it with a bushnell scope (shown in pictures).

The gun itself retails for $1,000 without a scope.  The scope was $175.  However, it is a used rifle with a used scope and one blemish in the stock.  It is still a beautiful and deadly accurate gun.  I am asking $875 OBO which is significantly less than it would cost if you went to your local gun shop and bought this combo.  The only reason I am selling is because I just bought the model 10XP to use for hunting.  This gun is just too nice to take out to the woods.  I have more pictures and will forward them to you just too big to upload.
