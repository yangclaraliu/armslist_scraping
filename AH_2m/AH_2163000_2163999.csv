This is a piston driven AR with a chrome bolt carrier group, flip up sights, carrying case and everything listed. I have fired about 3 magazines though this rifle. I listed the price I paid for everything so you could see for yourself and look up the prices if you needed, it did cost over $2600. Ruger SR556 ($1450), Eotech 552 ($517), 3xTR-9 rail ($105) Hellfighter 380 lumen light w/tail switch and offset mount ($127), Magpul MS3 sling ($49), Magpul AFG ($34), Magpul ASAP plate ($24), Hogue grip ($18), Black ladder rail covers ($10), 190 rounds .223 on stripper clips ($100+), 3x magpul pmags ($66), 2x thermold mags ($22), laser engraved charging handle and dust cover ($50). The local gunshop is still selling this rifle at $1499 new and it has been sold out for weeks.

*This is not the same version you will find on budsgunshop for around $1000. Their version does not come with a chrome bolt carrier group or iron sights. Feel free to buy one of theirs, I am sure it is a great rifle but it is not the same as this version."

Lightly used (less than 30 rounds total through it) but near daily carry. It has a pocket clip attached on the right side of the frame that allows for grip forward carry in the right front pocket of your jeans or a rear grip carry if you prefer to carry for your left hand. It also includes the original box, paperwork, trigger lock, cloth storage case and a DeSantis-brand Nemesis pocket holster. Excellent weapon for concealed carry as it is nearly invisible unless you wear a Speedo at the pool or beach and then you have more issues than a handgun could solve...otherwise, it's a very easily concealed weapon that is handy when anything larger would print through clothing or be an inconvenience to wear.

The holster in conjunction with the pocket clip help to keep the barrel lint and obstruction free while carrying. There are two areas of very light rust (appears to be surface only with no pitting) on the right and left rear of the slide near the slide serrations (please see photos for further detail) but the weapon is otherwise in excellent condition and the bore/crown of the muzzle are both pristine. Light rub marks on areas of the slide from being carried but blueing is solid throughout. The weapon was purchased with a seven round magazine standard and I have on additional ten round ProMag-brand magazine I will include. I will also include a partial box of Glaser Pow'r Ball .380 70 grain self-defense ammunition with the sale. 

Open to offers for an outright cash sale and/or partial trades for other firearms with me offering cash in addition to this item if necessary. Please be able to provide proof of your legal eligibility to own/purchase this item (ie: valid ccw permit, over the age of 21, etc.) and I will have a bill of sale requiring a signature from the buyer at the time of purchase. Thanks for looking and look forward to hearing from anyone interested."

Lightly used (less than 30 rounds total through it) but near daily carry. It has a pocket clip attached on the right side of the frame that allows for grip forward carry in the right front pocket of your jeans or a rear grip carry if you prefer to carry for your left hand. It also includes the original box, paperwork, trigger lock, cloth storage case and a DeSantis-brand Nemesis pocket holster. Excellent weapon for concealed carry as it is nearly invisible unless you wear a Speedo at the pool or beach and then you have more issues than a handgun could solve...otherwise, it's a very easily concealed weapon that is handy when anything larger would print through clothing or be an inconvenience to wear.

The holster in conjunction with the pocket clip help to keep the barrel lint and obstruction free while carrying. There are two areas of very light rust (appears to be surface only with no pitting) on the right and left rear of the slide near the slide serrations (please see photos for further detail) but the weapon is otherwise in excellent condition and the bore/crown of the muzzle are both pristine. Light rub marks on areas of the slide from being carried but blueing is solid throughout. The weapon was purchased with a seven round magazine standard and I have on additional ten round ProMag-brand magazine I will include. I will also include a partial box of Glaser Pow'r Ball .380 70 grain self-defense ammunition with the sale.

Open to offers for an outright cash sale and/or partial trades for other firearms with me offering cash in addition to this item if necessary. Please be able to provide proof of your legal eligibility to own/purchase this item (ie: valid ccw permit, over the age of 21, etc.) and I will have a bill of sale requiring a signature from the buyer at the time of purchase.

The bolt, trigger contacts, inner receiver, and hammer have all been polished. The polishing coupled with a bolt buffer makes for smooth cycling. I also brought the trigger down to around 2.5lbs and got rid of the pre-travel. The trigger housing is metal as this started life as an older 10/22. The red dot is a cheap BSA but it holds a zero well. I have been able to get dime sized groups at 25 yards when I was using CCI ammo and a better scope. This is a great 10/22. I had plans of refinishing the stock, but was hesitant as I do not have much experience and did not want to ruin it."

this is really getting out of hand.. people are asking WAY over retail or at retail for used arms and other items. I see it everyday honest men posting a ""be realistic post"" just to try and bring people back down to earth. i understand that everyone of us with this like interest were effected by the ""ARMS-PANIC"" , yes it sucks, but if you bought at the peak then you made a risky investment and NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TRY AND MAKE YOUR MONEY BACK!! you should be asking less than retailers are asking, period. plain and simple ladies and gentlemen do your homework and if you can get it NEW then get it NEW and flag the person who is trying to screw you. I have been corrected on here for asking to much, and i adjust accordingly, begrudgingly. 

In short honest people on here need to be diligent about FLAGGING overpriced and unreasonable ads to preserve the arms list that we all love.

Remington model 512 sportmaster. This is a less frequently seen tube fed bolt action that shoots all flavors of .22. Short, long or long rifle. It holds 22-rounds (22 short) 17-rounds (22 long) 15-rounds (22 LR) It's action is as smooth as warm silk & it is a dead on accurate rifle if you do your part. It has a fire/load indicator. When the bolt is charged, the red painted end of the firing pin protrudes from the back of the bolt showing that it is ready to fire. I regularly pull 2-3"" groups at 100 yards, not a boast, just simple fact. 25-inch (64 cm) barrel, 43 in (110 cm) overall length. Weigh 6 lbs. White metal bead front, open rear sight. The bluing is in 85%+, the stock has a few marks here & there, but nothing too drastic at all. The mill work on the backside of the bolt is beautiful, you just don't see work like this on modern rifles. This is not your garden variety .22 plinker. It is in 100% original condition and in my humble opinion one heck of a nice slice of firearms history. Just think about everything happening when this old fella was made/bought. Mainly, our boys were coming home from Europe and settling back into their interrupted lives, among many other things.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories (carry Handle NOT Included). 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use.

The .30-1903 was adopted by the Army in 1903 to replace the aging .30 Army (.30-40 Krag) which had been adopted in 1892. Winchester first offered the model 1895 in the .30-03 cartridge in 1905. Unfortunately, the '03 cartridge became all but obsolete only a year later with the adoption by the Army of the .30-06 in 1906. (Commercial ammo for the '03 was made up until WWI.) It wasn't until 1908 that Winchester produced the 1895 in '06.  This pictured gun was born in 1912. Bright bore with great rifling, 50% bluing, wood has no cracks and has great wood to metal fit, originally had a Lyman 21 sight which was removed and a rear marble was installed. I would replace marble with a Lyman 21 to bring it back to originally configuration. This gun is also more desirable because it does not come with the standard 28"" barrel, but the 24""."

This caliber gives you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.
The rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

 Description: Factory New Kel-Tec PF9 9mm compact semi-auto pistol! 

 The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
 RAJAC FIREARMS POWEL OHIO 614*208*5444

 The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

 ""The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. 

 The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. 

 The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. 

 The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

 The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. 

 The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.""

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console is Console Vault's flagship product. Taking full advantage of General Motors' model change in 2007 that allowed a much larger console, Console Vault crafted an amazing vault that took full advantage of the ample space now provided. 

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console Vault features an awesome secret compartment at its base, providing an extra dosage of security and covertness for your valuables. The hidden compartment may be used for extra secure storage, and should you not wish to take advantage of this feature, simply remove the access panel for additional space. We've seen some customers attach a holster to this area with velcro, enabling them to keep their firearm in place while traveling. 

 As with all Console Vault products, installation is incredibly simple and installation time requires only about 5 - 10 minutes.

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console is Console Vault's flagship product. Taking full advantage of General Motors' model change in 2007 that allowed a much larger console, Console Vault crafted an amazing vault that took full advantage of the ample space now provided. 

 The Chevrolet Suburban Floor Console Vault features an awesome secret compartment at its base, providing an extra dosage of security and covertness for your valuables. The hidden compartment may be used for extra secure storage, and should you not wish to take advantage of this feature, simply remove the access panel for additional space. We've seen some customers attach a holster to this area with velcro, enabling them to keep their firearm in place while traveling. 

 As with all Console Vault products, installation is incredibly simple and installation time requires only about 5 - 10 minutes.

 Suburban Floor Console Features:

•Massive 12-Gauge cold rolled plate steel, welded tab and notch seams
•Superior 3-point locking system resists prying
•Bank Vault-style hinge latch pins
•Drill-resistant locks
•Easy 10 minute installation

This is for the big boys that can handle shoulder firing the 7.62x54R round. 

This 1944 M44 is in excellent condition. I no longer have the original stock however the composite stock it is fitted with fits and feels great when firing. 

The firearm has been very well taken care of with a great bore. It has amazing accuracy and is a fine piece of history. This design was originally made to deal with the urban warfare environment of late WW2. It is essentially a shortened version of the Mosin Nagant series of scout sniper rifles.  It has surprisingly low recoil given the power of the round it fires.  The muzzle bloom when firing heavy ball ammunition is also rather impressive! 

The firearm has it's original bayonet still attached and the spring is still very tight. 

I will include 200 rounds of ammunition along with the stock sleeve and sling shown in the picture. I also have two stripperclips and the original sight tool to include. 

As part of the deal if you would like to fire the weapon before purchase I can accommodate the request.  Fire one of these and you will never want to fire another rifle again. The accuracy is simply amazing and the power behind the massive 7.62x54R round is pure adrenaline. 


I will accept any reasonable offer or trade. Email or text REDACTED"
