 These are absolutely great barrels. I've sold a ton of these locally. You would be hard pressed to find a barrel like this for less than $150. The finish is excellent, the machining is smooth in the chamber and on the ramps, and the rifling grooves are deep and consistent. They are made by a military contracted shop that has over 25 years in making these types of barrels. Barrels are stamped/rollmarked. 

You can rest assured that your barrel will be professionally packaged with care, safeguarding from any improbable threat while in transit to your door. They are first wrapped in a nylon mesh webbing, then five layers of 3/16 bubble wrap, squeezed into a heavy gauge KRAFT tube mailer.

This trailer is roughly 4x8 box size and made of aluminum. It folds out into a 12x8 camper. It has been in a garage since the 1980's and is what I would call a barn find. It is very light and takes a 1 7/8 ball. I pulled it with a atv and couldn't tell it was there. It is in exceptional shape. Good canvass with just a couple of pin holes. It has all the tent poles. It is missing the outriggers for the fold outs. It could use tires as I think the ones on it are from 1971. I just assesembled it and everything works as it should and looks like the picture. Has title. The owner just found it and is mailing it to me. Will trade for guns, atvs, carport, atv tires 26"" or bigger new or close to new, or just tell me what you have. Or $500 cash. No I will not take $250 for it.

General
For sale is a like-new Sig Sauer P238 subcompact pistol, chambered in .380 AUTO.  It was purchased about a year ago and has had less than 100 rounds fired through it.  It is in excellent shape with no damage, scratches, or markings whatsoever and functions flawlessly.  The gun comes with official Sig factory night sights and are some of the best I've seen on a pistol.  I am selling this pistol for $650 which is a great deal considering the 2 extra magazines, relative rarity of the 2-tone Nitron finish, and the fact that you won't have to pay taxes or transfer fees.

----------
Why I'm Selling
I'm currently building a high-end AR-15 and find myself spending more time shooting and upgrading that than I do my other guns.  This gun is one of the best out there for conceal carry, but given how little I actually use it I feel it's value is better off with someone who would (and the money I get back to go into AR-15 upgrades and ammo).  I originally paid $700+ tax for this gun so I'm taking a loss for it.

----------
Terms of Sale
I live in Chino, CA and require any interested buyers to meet me in this area.  There is a Turner Outdoorsman in Chino Hills where we can meet and you'll be allowed to inspect the gun first before agreeing to buy.  If everything checks out then we can enter the store and start the transfer process.  A few important things you must agree to:

1. You will have to provide a phone number that I can contact you at (and preferred calling time if you have one).  I'll also be calling from my personal cell number.  I won't deal with anyone who is not willing to speak over the phone first.

2. We must meet at the Turner Outdoorsman in Chino Hills.  I've conducted a handful of gun transfers here before and can guarantee both myself and you that it's a good and safe location to meet and conduct business with.

3. You are responsible for all the private party transfer fees (which is still much less than a FFL transfer fee).

4. Face-to-face transactions only.  Please don't ask if I am willing to ship this to a FFL dealer!

5. Cash only, please.  Not looking for trades and price is FIRM.

----------

I apologize for the strict terms but I've bought and sold enough guns online to know what scammers are capable of and just want to protect myself and any potential buyers.  I consider myself a nice and trustworthy individual and only want to deal with others who are the same.  

If you've made it this far and are still interested, please send me a message with your name and phone number and I'll respond as soon as I can.  My name is An and let me know if you're interested or have any questions.  :)"

Bullets & Beans is a small, home-based FFL, started because I was fed up with gun shop prices, transfer fees, and 'take it or leave it' attitudes. As I run out of my house, my low overhead allows me to sell, accessories, and build/modify firearms at reasonable prices and all transfers are $20. I am always willing to provide information or a price check, just email me what you are looking for and I will get back to you in a couple days (as I do this part-time) with a price and availability. I can also provide a price check if you need a bargaining chip for a new gun at a local shop."

I have a high quality AR-15 build that is priced to sell. I had a handguard that I took off a rock river predator that I refinished, and coated with duracoat matte clear. It turned out really nice, so I used it on this build. While i was at it, I duracoated the barrel. This is a 223 wylde chambered (tighter tolerance makes it more accurate than a standard 5.56 while still maintaining the functional reliability) The upper and lower receivers are anderson manufacturing, with a ptac m4 lower build kit and collapsible stock. The bolt/carrier group is a full auto, so it will last next to forever, and also nice because they are built a little more robust and have the correct mass for cycling properly. Gas tube is stainless, low profile gas steel gas block (not aluminum).  Milspec charging handle, and 30 rd steel magazine.

Bipod is not included unless you want to buy it extra ($25), the gun has had 2 rounds fired through it to ensure a good primer strike and proper ejection angle.

The firearm is chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 16 inch barrel and standard A2 flash hider. One unique aspect of the Rhino Arms AR-15 is the addition of a reinforced magwell (easily seen in the pictures) which makes the rifle tough enough for extremely hard use, though i've babied it myself-- approximately 400 rounds have passed through the chamber (it runs steel cased ammo as well as it does brass). I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be. I purchased the rifle new in 2010 in stock configuration and proceeded to add the following accessories:

Stag Arms 6-position retractable stock
Blackhawk ergonomic Grip

The rifling seems to be good from what I can tell, there are some pits on the exterior of the barrel.  Surfaces somewhat rough, but overall in good condition.  This rifle has the mum's intact and all markings legible and has no importation marks, this is a bring-back with matching numbers.

The stock was repaired from sporterized and broken condition, pachmayr pad added, and stock home camo'd, nothing fancy.  If you have access to an original stock this would be a nice piece.  It is what it is.

Rifle, some rounds of original Milsurp Nickel rounds (Collector only), 20 rounds of Norma/PPU brass fired once from this rifle, 30 rounds of New 140gr Hornady (one or two may be Norma) SP hunting rounds.  This is a shooter I have personally owned for 25 years.

This is a pre letter date code gun with a parkerized slide, with the factory target dated Dec 14, 1979. The gun has the standard HK Eagle over N stamp, and ""ARL, VA"" slide markings. As stated this is the ultra-rare ""Target"" model, with adjustable sights and fully adjustable trigger.

SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace Description
SIG SAUER®’s SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

- Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.

The bolt carrier group had the firing pin blown out the back of it and I just don't have the time to fix it/invest in a new bolt. The safety button has also cracked in two, however the safety mechanism itself is functioning correctly. I have checked with a gunsmith that the rest of the shotgun is in full functioning order. It just needs a new bolt and plastic safety switch (installed with a hex key).

The Not So Bad: 
The car needs a set of headlights (i can buy some and put them on but the price will go up by $100 ;-)
There is slight body damage by the Fuel Door (picture attached)
Small leak (pin sized) in a coolant hose that I've been too lazy to fix (not a big deal)
The car will need paint soon (looks ok from 10 feet away)
I have the Flowmaster's that go on the car but it currently just has turndowns

This car was originally a 4 Cyl Vehicle that was converted in 2006 to a 5.0 302 by Rhino Engines in Fairport NY (I have the receipts http://www.rhinoengines.com). The motor is a Ford 302 from an 88 Thunderbird (Standard Output) that runs great. The Transmission was rebuilt back in 2008 by AAMCO in Woodstock GA (I have the receipts) and shifts smoothly with no issues.
It has a Sony detachable face AM/FM CD with Aux port and Bluetooth plug in module(yeah high tech). I'm not sure of what the rear end gear is... but it might be a 373. 

This was my daily driver until I purchased my 2014 Mustang GTCS which is getting me an ungodly amount of pussy around Atlanta and I need to sell this car to fund my exploits... he he he. I purchased it for $3500 and I want $3500 for it despite the money I put into it (over 1k).

I will accept trade offers but only on:
a sport bike (nothing under 2002)
Nice Lifted Jeep Cherokee
or a NICE BMW E30 or E36 I can take to Road Atlanta to fuck around.

Don't offer me your junk shit that's lying around your scrap yard or a fucking pit bull puppy and some Kush for this car. Im not a crackhead and I know that the price is ""Super fair"" in comparison to the crap that gets sold on here daily.

I have a 6 month old Ruger LCP with a spare mag and all the crap that came with it, and I'm interested in trading it for a S&W Bodyguard.  I will add cash, ammo, or whatever strikes your fancy to make up the difference.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with my pistol, I just prefer the feel of the Bodyguard over that of my LCP.  I've fired 70 rounds through this pistol (50 FMJ and 20 PDX1 to test function for my chosen carry ammo).  I've had it for about 6 months, and it's probably been carried two dozen times or so.

New Bodyguards with one mag can be purchased in the Jacksonville area for $365.  New LCPs with 1 mag can be purchased for $290.  Please keep this in mind when responding with offer, as ludicrous offers will not be entertained.  Exceptions will be made for Bodyguards with the Crimson Trace grips, as that obviously increases the value of your pistol.  

So, in closing, LCP, spare mag, plus $50 or it's equivalent in 9mm, 45 or 223 ammo for your Bodyguard.

Thanks, I hope to hear from you."

Its size, caliber, and double/single action make it an ideal personal protection/carry weapon. This handgun is known to be one of the best concealable .45 acp, 3rd generation Smith & Wesson's ever produced. I'm only selling this one because it's a duplicate for me.
It is in very good plus overall condition, appears to be used lightly, functions perfectly, and shoots lights-out. I bought this handgun used so I do not know a round count. I have put less then 50 rounds down the pipe myself. 
It has a 3-3/4"" barrel with a pristine bore, 7 rd single stack, plus one in the chamber. It has novak low carry sights and a ambidextrous external safety.
The slide is stainless steel with an aluminum alloy compact frame with a satin stainless finish. This handgun has the frame and slide machined as a matched set with an assembly number on each half. The barrel bushing is fixed and the frame and slide are fitted with oversize frame rails.
A black rail is mounted under the forward part of the frame for accessories. The trigger is smooth with a .26"" bobbed hammer. One piece wrap-around grip with straight back strap. 
Includes two 7 rd mags with finger extension base plates. Unfortunately I do not have the original box and papers. I will include a Flambeau Plastic hard case.

I'm looking for a face-to-face sale in the Twin Cites Metro Area. I'm in the Burnsville and White Bear areas daily. A Bill Of Sale will be provided, buyer must have a valid MN Drivers License along with either a valid Permit to Purchase or Permit to Carry.

I will consider shipping to your local FFL dealer for an additional $40 to cover the cost of insured shipping.

Please email me with any questions. I'm not into texting all my communications. If you want to chat, email me your phone number and I will call you.

KCI manufactured Glock 17 Round 9mm Magazine. These are made by KCI and a quality replacement magazine for a Glock.  Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert which is encased in a high tech polymer (which is fully metal lined). The polymer coating protects the gun magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from great heights.

FEATURES: 

Constructed from steel and polymer just like factory Glock mags.
Compatible Glock 9mm pistols: Glock 17
Construction: Polymer/Steel
MFG: KCI

NOTE: Like many new magazines, these may have stiff springs from the factory, which is quite common with most new magazines.

For best results, KCI Mags recommends loading half of the magazine capacity and leaving it loaded over-night before your initial use. This will help with future loadings of the gun magazine and make it easier.

This item is sold (as is) since it is an aftermarket Korean magazine and not a Glock factory OEM magazine. They are however priced to move.

PRICE: $15.00 each or if you buy all 5, I will sell them for $14 each."
