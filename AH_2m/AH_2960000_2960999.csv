The gun was modified by Parker and Hale in England after the war and is now in .38 special. I get it...it's been modified...it's not for everybody. It is a part of this guns unique history. Parker and Hale also did the following: shortened the barrel to 4 inch, put a different front sight on it, reblued it, and put on checkered grips. You can see these modifications are consistent with others that they did from web photos. The caliber change was well done as it ONLY accepts the .38 special and not the original .38 S&W. The action is very smooth and the cylinder timing is spot on. The lanyard ring is intact and not modified in any way. It just doesn't appear in the pictures. FTF only. Text or call 918-Five Zero Four-6610. I would prefer cash, but I am looking for a lever action .22 or older single shot .22, so we could talk trade. Either way, if you have interest let me know."

This is not .22lr.  It is not 22Mag, though it fits where Mag fits, but it's about 1/8"" shorter than Mag.  

They sold guns for this, long before they came up with Mag.

I see it selling at Gunbroker.com for much more than 50 cents a round. 
 If you've got a gun for this ammo, this is the stuff.

Blogs on line say it will fit and fire in a 22Mag weapon, but depending on the gun, it may lack the power to cycle a second round.  YMMV.

I have 350 rounds of the Remington, and 99 rounds of the CCI.

I want $20 a box, or $15 a box if you take it all.  
Otherwise, I'll just post it on Gunbroker.

I'd rather not ship, but I will if you pay with paypal and pay shipping.

I can meet anytime near FDL, and occasionally near Milwaukee or Appleton or Oshkosh.

Happy shooting."

I operate NOCO Hydrographics here in Fort Collins. If you're looking to get a firearm hydrodipped, I offer both the best prices as well as the best quality materials. I know how important quality is when it comes to any firearm work, and that's why I strive to be the best in the business. When you bring me one of your firearms, you can rest assured that the job will be done right, and come out looking great. After the pattern is applied, the part is coated with a high-strength clear coat with an internal flex agent. This means that the clear will flex without cracking when the gun is fired, and will last through many years of use.

I have over 700 patterns available in categories such as:
Camouflage
Carbon Fiber
Wood Grain
Stone
Metal
and Designer

You can check out the full gallery of films on my supplier's site here:

Most films can be paired with a custom base color of your choosing as well.

Performance: The gun has a 3/8 MOA guarantee from the factory. It exceeds this. I shoot 168 grain HPBT with Varget Powder. A beginner can get behind this rifle and shoot MOA at 650 yards. In my opinion, the best set up money can buy. I have shot under 200 rounds with all of them logged.

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."

It has been a great rifle that I've shot extensively with no malfunctions in approx 3k rounds. I've maintained it well, but this isn't a safe queen. Waffen Werks coated the rifle with KG Armory Kote which is a great finish that has held up well to the routine cleanings. The rifle has a lot of life left in it and needs a good home. I am the only owner of it and purchased it new from AGS armament with the rail included in the package. 

This is a great rifle that works for plinking or home defense(yes I would trust it in that role). I sold off my stash of mags so the rifle comes as seen in the pictures. I can toss in a box of 50 Hornady Vmax 5.45 rounds to sweeten the pot if interested.

Type: Semi-Auto Pistol
Action: Single action/Double Action

This pistol is in great shape.  The finish on it is excellent, the bore is superb (as there has been less than 100 rounds through it), and the over all appearance is absolutely nice.  This pistol was taken to the range and tested, and I was pretty amazed as to how it handled.  A very smooth trigger pull, pretty accurate, and all of the controls are easily activated when needed.  This pistol field strips quite easily, can be cleaned without much effort, and put back together just as easy as it tore down.  This beast has a take down switch, a slide stop/release, and a de-cocker which puts the pistol in “SAFE” mode.  It also has a built in compensated barrel.  The slide and frame are made of steel which will give you years of use.  It also incorporates a 3-dot sighting system on a set of low profile tactical sights.  It also has a built-in frame rail so that you can mount a flashlight or laser.
This pistol would be awesome for concealed carry as it is a little smaller than a full size pistol, but yet it be loaded with high capacity magazines.  If you should decide to not use it for concealed carry, it would make a great ZOMBIE back-up pistol because of the accuracy and high capacity (LOL  for those of you who believe in the ZOMBIE APOCOLYPSE).  For you preppers, this would make a great pistol to store in your bunker.

Includes:
5 15-round magazines.  These magazines were originally Beretta 92 mags that were notched appropriately for the CS9.  These magazines function flawlessly and are in great shape.  Not only will these magazines fit and function in the CS9, but if you have a Beretta 92, they will also fit and function flawlessly in that pistol too.
1 21-round magazine
Go check out YOUTUBECOM and type in ZIGANA TISAS CS9 and see what pops up.  You will be amazed with the factory testing for these pistols.

It has has roughly 150 rounds through it and has been treated like a baby. More detailed photos available at the link below. Click to zoom.
http://imgur.com/a/1h7sT

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is manufactured in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.

A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR5556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance."

We all used to buy this stuff for pennies, and I won't spend $.50+ a round to feed someone's greed. So if you're looking to gouge, keep looking. I WILL buy from you for something like $.20 a round or whatever you paid for it awhile back.

As shown in the pictures, I also added the GG&G enhanced heavy-duty QD sling swivel, front and back (both are easy to remove if not wanted).  I also purchased a Bulldog shotgun soft case, as show in the pictures it fits this shotgun perfectly.

I’m selling all for: $670.00.  You get all the accessories for free (I sure can’t use them on the Vepr 12)! If you walked into Cabela's today the gun alone would cost $670.00 + $67.00 tax without the accessories.

I’m selling because I decided to purchase the Vepr 12 instead.  I honestly never got a chance to get to the range to fire the Mossberg; it is UNFIRED!  THE SIGHT AND LIGHT ARE NOT PART OF THE SALE!  I just wanted to show why I installed the picatinny’s and how it looks with them."

It is in stainless with a hardwood stock.  Very pretty piece.  This can fire either type of round in full (5 round) cylinders, or they can be rotated.  Also comes with pictured red dot sight, hammer extension, bore brush and a spare choke (can use rifled or plain).  It weighs only about 5.5 lbs. and is extremely easy to carry.  All documentation included.  I will also include a zipper soft carry case.

I fired only 10 loads (50 rounds) through this at the range.  The red dot is zeroed at 25 yards.  It is absolutely as new and perfect, no defects and accurate.  As a matter of fact, I got a bad one initially from Davidson's; this was the new replacement and is a GREAT one.  Rossi/Taurus can be hit or miss, but this one is the real deal.

Lastly, I would include 35 rounds of Buffalo Bore 45 Colt Anti-Personnel hard cast wadcutters (1 full box, and one 20 round box containing only 15 rounds), a full, 20 round box of Hornady 225 grain FTX LeverEvolution .45 long Colt, and one 10 round box of Winchester PDXI .410 Defender shells -- well over $100 in ammo for the gun.

PRICED FOR QUICK SALE:  $475.  Or trade/partial trade with cash for a 1911, S&W .357 4"" barrel, or another nice handgun, preferably in 9mm or 357.

PLEASE, LOCAL SALE ONLY.  I WILL NOT SHIP.  THANKS.

NOTE IS A REVOLVER, NOT A LEVER OR SEMI-AUTO ACTION."
