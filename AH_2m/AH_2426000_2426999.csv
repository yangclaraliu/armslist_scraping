This beast has only been on the market about a year.  It chambers 2 rounds of .45 acp, but has added surprises.  In your off side pocket is a loading device with 6 more rounds for speedy reloads, with some practice.  For the finale finale two more ""pumpkin rollers"" on a loading device in the butt of the grip.  Ten rounds of man stopping .45 acp in a packet half the size of a Kimber.

This is the most concealable pistol with stopping power that I have ever carried.  Being a retired cop, I have been doing this for 40 years; I've carried the Colt Detective, Star PD, 6906 S&W, Walther PPK, Glock 19, 26, & 30, Beretta 21A, H&K P7M8, and High Standard 22 mag.  For firepower and ease of carry, the DoubleTap beats all of them.

The slide locks back on an empty magazine, the mag drops free and the slide release is well placed on the frame. The magazine itself is a traditional double-stack 10-rounder, which is quite compact.The slide and barrel are 416 heat-treated stainless steel. Furthermore, the slide is ballistic nitride (QPQ, Melonite, salt bath)  treated, giving it excellent corrosion and scratch resistance. This feature in itself is a huge deal for me. For the last year and a half, all the barrels I’ve bought for AR-15s have been nitride treated. The increased Rockwell hardness is excellent. It shrugs off abuse remarkably well and to have a pistol slide treated in such a manner is truly something I appreciate.It’s a double-action only pistol which is hammer fired. The hammer is internal and will not snag on clothing, which is a plus. I like the fact that it has second-strike capability. If you get a light-primer strike, all you have to do is pull the trigger again.To increase the reliability of the CPX-2, I treated both the slide and the barrel with FrogLube paste. As a lubricating agent, it’s incredible and has decreased both the cleaning time and increased the durability of the firearm. Carbon from the cheap Russian ammunition I shoot now wipes off with ease from the inside of the CPX-2.When I carry this pistol, I load it with hollow-point rounds. For those of you who like to carry +P ammunition, that’s fine. According to Jason, one of the Tech Gurus at SCCY, the CPX should be only fed a limited diet of +P. So it’s fine to carry in your gun and occasionally use to make sure you’re still on target. Do not run +P exclusively and heavily through this pistol and then complain down the road when it fails.Honestly, I liked this pistol right off the bat. It’s smaller even than my HK P200SK, while retaining the same capacity. Oddly enough, I was able to force an eleventh round into it. I would not recommend this, though. The CPX- 2 fits easily into a large back pocketThe recoil is a bit sharp, but much less than I expected from such a lightweight gun. The backstrap is designed to reduce the felt recoil. Honestly, I initially thought this to be a marketing gimmick, but after firing the CPX-2, I was convinced of the utility of the design.Accuracy is decent. If you are firing quickly and under stress, your groups may be rather wide, though that can be said of almost any firearm. However, if you want to hit a small target, simply get used to the trigger and slow down. After a couple of my students raised doubts about the accuracy of the CPX-2, I promptly loaded a magazine, took my time and calmly shot the knuckles off of the target we were using (that target is an RPD-NV Handgun Threat 6).This is really of very small concern, as the average handgun engagement distance is  only a few yards. And defense is what the CPX-2 is made for. It’s not a target gun, and should not be judged as such. It’s a little pistol you can slip into your back pocket (if you’re too hurried to put on your holster) and get it into the fight quickly, if need be.One of the only downfalls of the pistol is its magazine base plate. The current one has sharp edges that make it quite uncomfortable to handle outside of the gun. SCCY will be coming out with a different base plate with all rounded corners and edges. I recommend simply using 120-grit sandpaper to sand down the sharp plastic edges of the base plate. This does does not void the warranty at all.I can’t emphasize how much I appreciate the ballistic nitride coating of the weapon slide. That alone shows an attention to detail and commitment to quality. The CPX-2 a fine carry gun, which is one of the reasons that SCCY just broke the 70,000 marker for number of guns sold. Speaking of sold, I’m sold on this pistol. I would say that I’ll be carrying it for years to come, but my wife has already laid claim to the CPX-2."

Receivers will have to be sent to my FFL but newly made unlawful magazines and even ammo (if the EPA outlaws lead for bullets) can be sent to my shop. I have a few good safes and even a couple of old, but dry 'bomb/tornado shelters' for storage. It would be best for your firearms to be shipped and stored in the same box that it arrives in, the better you pack it and make it waterproof/crush proof the better. The climate controlled safes will run $75/year, max of $150 no matter how long they will be stored. $50/year for storage in the tornado shelters, max $100. If interested email will be the most effective way of contact, telephone numbers will exchange for questions/concerns. Thank you and let's hope all this crazy gun grabbing will be repealed shortly. 
God bless,

I have a Glock 19 gen 4 for sale.  Comes with everything as you would get if buying new, box, manual, back straps, 3 mags.  About 300 rounds through it and it fires perfectly as all Glock's do.  

If interested, please give me a call/text.  Don, REDACTED.  Yes, it is an out of area number, but I live in Porter County.  Transfer will be done at Downrange Dynamics in Portage.  They charge $25 for the transfer and I will split it with you.  I have had a lot of time wasters lately so here is my FAQ section.

Q)  I have XXXX for trade, are you interested?
A)  NO, thank you, but not interested in any trades.

Q)  Can we just do a bill of sale, I have a lifetime carry permit?
A)  NO, through the FFL, sorry

Q)  I will give you $500 for your Glock.
A)  Well first, that isn't a question, that is a statement.  Second, NO you will not give me $500 because my price is $540.  I am firm at that price, if it doesn't sell, oh well.

Q)  I can get that same gun at XXXX for $XXXX.
A)  Again, that isn't a question, that is a statement.  If you can get it here or there for this or that, GREAT, go get it.  I know what the prices are locally and online and mine is well within reason, even for a used Glock.  

Q)  Do you have any extras?
A)  Yes, for additional cost.  I have 2 33 round mags that I would be willing to part with for $40 each.  Price is set.  Need ammo, I may have some I can spare, but you will need to let me know how much you want and I can give you a price."

SMITH & WESSON BODYGUARD 380
Purchased new by me on April 27th of this year.
Good to Excellent condition.
Has 139 rounds through it total, 89 were steel cased Tulammo & 50 were brass cased Tulammo. 
The only issue I have ever had was after firing 39 rounds of the steel cased ammo the takedown lever/pin became loose and broke. Smith & Wesson sent the replacement part free of charge, which fit much tighter than the original. I have fired 50rds of brass cased ammo & 50rds of steel cased ammo through it since then, with no issues whatsoever. 

Comes with the following:
3 mags total (1 that came with gun & 2 extra), also the 3 flush fit mag plates.
Tagua nylon holster 
87rds of steel cased Tulammo
31rds of brass cased Tulammo
Factory box, factory soft case, instructions, lock, etc.

$325 - Gun with factory items, 1 mag, holster

I have on the selling block my Rem 1100 TAC 4 Semi auto 12 ga for sale. It is chambered ONLY for the 2 3/4 shells. I bought it for 3 gun but never used it other than 2 range trips.

The gun is a blast to shoot and hate to get rid of it but situation calls for me to part with it. I will say the gun is 95% in condition. Very little wear other than normal handling marks from being fired.
