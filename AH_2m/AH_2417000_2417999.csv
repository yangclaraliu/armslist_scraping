So I am looking to maybe to a partial trade towards an upper with cash on top from my end. I also wouldn't mind selling either but the trade would kill 2 birds with one stone. Anyways, the gun has maybe 65-80rds thought it. The bad part is my friend left the carry case open for the mags and one fell out and so did the backstraps.(Hence the price but still has 2 mags) I contacted Glock about them and they sent me a parts sheet to fill out but I don't really want to wait.

from the website:
When we first thought about building custom rifles we wanted a line of rifles that addressed a few basic needs. First, with the kind of hunting we like to do, they had to be light. And most important was that light rifles had to be accurate. By nature light rifles are inaccurate because most light contours suffer from ""barrel whip"". However with the barrel shank design coupled with the M1999 breaching system there is a much stronger base for which to control barrel whip. Another problem we faced was with the extreme hunting we like to do, we run into many harsh conditions. Conditions like rain, sleet, snow and temperature ranges from 110 degrees to well below zero. These are often prime conditions for some of the the best hunting and we wanted our gear to be able to handle those elements. With this we use ALL stainless steel barrels and the complete action is made up of entirely stainless steel parts. We then couple that with some of the best synthetic stocks in the industry, Pendleton Composite's (Oregunsmithing). On top of that for the Ridgeline, Timberline and Alpine we also have the barreled action set in a Ceramic coating for maximum protection. This coating is extremely rugged and durable and will protect the steel from just about any type of weather.

All high country series rifles will be pillar and glass bedded, with all stainless steel barreled actions"

These are not reloads. I picked them up at a gun show and they are still sealed in the packages. I use the hollow points with my .45 and they shoot great and seem to be very accurate and 1100 fps is very fast.

.45 Long Colt 200gr Round Nose Flat Point Velocity:750 fps 50pk ---> Asking $40.00

*Safe for use in the Judge

I've looked on Basspro and Cabelas and these prices are less than the cheapest rounds they carry especially the hollow points (if they even have them in stock). And its tax free because no one wants to give another penny to that freedom grabbing, socialist Governor of ours! And it saves you a trip across the bridge if you live on the Shore. I may be able to get more of this ammo in a week or two just let me know if your interested. If you need .44 Rem Mag I may be able to get some for the same price.

Please read the entire listing.

I am selling a Thompson Encore rifle.

The 26” heavy blued barrel is new and was mounted for aesthetics. The receiver is stainless and the thumbhole stock is brown laminated.
I am asking 500.00 in cash. I know this is not a bargain basement price but if I start at my “take” price, it gives me no wiggle room to make the perfect deal for both of us. I take care of my stuff and it is nice shape.

No holds please, unless a non-refundable payment is made.

I don’t want to deliver this but am in Wichita once or twice a week. FTF transaction only.

If you don’t like my price, make me a reasonable offer.

I have some extras and will try to price everything out.
The barrel can be purchased separately for 200.00 or in a package deal.
Barrel, receiver and stock 500.00
Barrel, receiver, stock and 50 rounds of Fiocchi factory ammo 530.00
Barrel, receiver, stock, 50 rounds of ammo and Hornady dies 550.00 (The dies were never used)
Barrel, receiver, stock, ammo, dies and Talley 1 piece base 580.00
Barrel, receiver, stock, ammo, dies, Talley base and Center Point 4-16X40ILL scope 635.00 (red and green adjustable brightness)
UNLESS THE BARREL SELLS, THE REST IS NOT FOR SALE SEPERATELY, EXCEPT THE SCOPE. The scope is 60.00 by itself.
If you don’t want the receiver or stock deduct 300.00. The stock and receiver must go together."

I havent had too many rounds through it, probably about 60, and i have never taken it hunting so there isnt a scratch on the rifle as you can see in the photos. It has a long barrel, 26 inches and it is a bull barrel so it wont heat up after alot of shooting for more accuracy. This gun would be perfect for varmit hunting but you would be pushing your luck trying to take deer with it. I have about 60 rounds for it as well that will go with the gun and the pelt seen in the pictures is not included.

It's an Italian made Beretta model 70S, also known as the ""Puma"".  According to the web, it's ""AI"" date stamp places it as a 1982 manufacture from Beretta in Italy, and it was imported by the Berben Corporation out of New York.   It's a single action pistol, with a very smooth safety, a crisp trigger pull, and  it's extremely accurate.   I bought it over a month ago in the hopes that my wife would like it, but she's happy with her smaller Beretta in 25acp.   That being said, it's just going to sit in my safe until the end of days.  I'd like to recoup my investment and purchase something else.

I've put 100 rounds of various 380 FMJ loads through it, and it cycled flawlessly.  I also fired a 20rd  box of the Winchester PDX1 Hollow Points through it, and it didn't skip a beat.  

When I bought this last month I did a lot of searching online for price comparison.  I found Pumas in comparable condition going for around $500, and some extremely worn out Century Arms imports going for around $400.   Please check out gunbroker.com, auctionarms.com or gunsamerica.com if you'd like to verify.  There are only a handful of Model 70s Pumas chambered in 380 on each site. 

 I'm asking $350 for this handgun.   I am not entertaining trades at this time.   Cash only, face to face transaction.  Please have a NC Pistol Purchase Permit or NC Concealed Carry Permit and a picture ID.   I will not take photocopies of your ID, but I will annotate your permit number on the bill of sale.  Please be willing to sign a bill of sale, this is for my records, and I will provide you a copy.

I am going out of town on Sunday 8 Dec for a few days, so please be patient if you contact me after I depart.

Up for sale and/or trade is this well cared for Smith & Wesson Model ""629"" with no dash. Chambered in .44 Magnum with a highly desirable 4"" Barrel.  This is the ""No-Dash model with the ""Pinned Barrel"" and ""Recessed Cylinder"".  The S&W 629 features a heavy underlug barrel, fully adjustable rear sight and a fixed red insert on the front sight, target hammer and trigger with it's wooden original box.  The box still has the original cleaning rod with brush in the small storage compartment.  Serial number N850XXX indicates a manufacture date of 1979 or 1980.   The finish is very good to excellent and it feels great in your hand.  This revolver has been well maintained and the hammer and trigger parts have been detail cleaned and polished recently.  The trigger pull is crisp in SA and smooth as glass in DA.  This revolver is a real eye catcher and is in excellent 95% to 98% condition with a few small handling marks over the years. The bore is mirror bright and shinny condition and the cylinder locks up clean and tight.  It is obvious this revolver has not been fired a great deal.

The Browning BL-22 is in a class by itself. Sure, there are other lever-action 22 rimfire rifles available, but no other has the features, reliability, quality and accuracy of the BL-22. The easy to load tubular magazine holds any combination of 22 short, long and long rifle ammunition, all of which are on the menu for the BL-22. Speaking of features, the highlight of the BL-22 is the short 33° lever throw that makes cycling faster for adults and easier for younger shooters. The easy to load tubular magazine holds any combination of 22 short, long and long rifle ammunition, all of which are on the menu for the BL-22. Unlike some 22's the BL-22 features quality that rivals other Browning firearms. From the machined steel receiver to the fit of the finely finished wood, these superb rifles are Browning's through and through."

I'm trying to possibly trade or sell, or trade and get cash depending on what you have
I'm interested in a good 9mm or .40/.45 handgun, nothing too compact, in fact something sub compact or even near a 1911 is alright.  I really like the S&W's, springfields, the Interarms STAR's, ETC. just to give an idea.

what i have is a laptop and a 360 (might not be to your taste but i might be able to add some cash for the right deal) 

about them
the laptop- is a new Dell 15R touch screen with windows 8, recently bought new about 2-3 months ago. has 1tb harddrive, 8gb ram, win 8 and full touchscreen. usb 3.0, HDMI, bluetooth, the works.  great audio and a decent chipset. have the original box and reciept and all that showing what i paid for it (about $900) 
so id be willing to sell this for around $700 obo or a little bit more in trade value

and i have your typical xbox 360, the 4 gig version but i have installed a new 320gb hard drive, it also comes with the wireless controller, the box if i still have it, a headset, and the games
-forza horizon
-COD ghosts
-Battlefield 4
-DBZ Tenakichi
-Grand theft auto 5
-farcry 3

id be asking about $360 for this setup or trade value as well

let me know what you have or if you're interested
im always available for text or calls usually 

i may also trade these together for an AR-15 .223/556, or an AK style rifle.  like i said i may have cash to add for the right deal, just not a lot on my end.

thanks"
