what really attracted me to the pistol were all the features at the price-point, especially compared to a Colt Delta Elite which is twice the price. This pistol has fully adjustable rear sights and a high visibility fiber optic front sight. it has a hefty bull-barrel and a full length bushing-less guiderod. A skeletonized commander hammer and trigger came standard on this model, as did the full beavertail with memory pad.The straight checkered mainspring housing and VZ g-10 grips really grip your hand.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

FEATURES
100% new-production parts and components.
Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook trigger
Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology
Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber
Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.
Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.)
Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.

For sale today is my Ruger SR9C handgun. I bought it new in 2011 and it has been my everyday carry since. It is used but well taken care of. It was returned to Ruger in 2011 for service on the trigger bar under warranty. Since then, it has only needed cleaning. It functions flawlessly and is the two tone stainless / polymer model.

Included in the sale is the case, manual, factory fired case, magazine loader, 3-10 round magazines and 3-17 round magazines. Two of the 10 round magazines have the finger extension and all three of the 17 round magazines have the grip adapter. You will also receive a Mitch Rosen cuban brown belt slide holster made specifically for this gun. It is stylish, comfortable, and best of all holds the firearm tight and close to the body for ultimate concealment.

100 rounds of FMJ ammunition will be included in the sale. A partial box of Golden Saber hollow points will also be included.

Face-to-face in Roanoke city/county, Salem, Vinton. Will drive as far as Blacksburg / Lynchburg. Two forms of ID and signing a bill-of-sale is required."

Mossberg & Sons, more commonly known as Mossberg, is an American arms manufacturer that was founded in 1919 by Swedish-born Oscar Frederick Mossberg alongside his two sons. Mossberg came to the United States in 1886, where he worked in a bicycle factory owned by Iver Johnson. Though the company was founded on the Mossberg Brownie, a four-barreled handgun chambered in .22 LR, it is now known the world over for producing exceptional rifles and shotguns.

We here at Keepshooting.com believe in the Mossberg brand. As such we have chosen to become an official Mossberg stocking dealer, which means a couple of different things. It means we have committed to stocking approximately 30 of Mossberg’s finest rifles and shotguns. Not only that, but we will have exclusive opportunities to check out new products as they are released. Finally, our commitment means that we will be getting these firearms at excellent prices and will, as always, pass those savings on to you. Many of those firearms are currently on sale in our web store – the Mossberg 500 Tactical shotgun is just the next in a long line of fine products.

The Mossberg 500 Tactical shotgun is a 12-gauge, pump-action shotgun that features an 18.5-inch barrel and an overall length of 38.5 inches. One of the defining features of the 500 Tactical is the inclusion of an adjustable, synthetic, six-position stock not unlike those typically found on M4 rifles. This telescoping stock adjusts easily to offer a length of pull measuring between 10.75 inches and 14.625 inches. The stock also offers carrying space for up to five shotshells. Chambered for both 2.75- and 3-inch shotshells, the magazine tube has a 6-shot capacity that is more than enough to get the job done. The shotgun also includes an ambidextrous thumb safety, pistol grip, gold bead front sight and a nylon hand strap on the forend.

At the heart of the Mossberg 500 Tactical, however, lies the legendary Mossberg 500 receiver. With origins in the 1960s, the Mossberg 500 is a series of shotguns that represented a range of varying hammerless, pump-action shotguns, all of which feature the same receiver. The 500 series is also the only shotgun that has passed the United States Military's Mil-Spec 3443G standards, which just serves to illustrate the superior performance and reliability associated with the Mossberg 500 Tactical. That means this shotgun is suitable for saving your life.

What are you waiting for? Are you waiting for the floods to wash you away? You should not be. You should be pulling out your credit card and typing in your information so you can get a Mossberg 500 Tactical delivered as soon as possible. Consider this shotgun for:

- Home defense and personal protection

- Survival

- Hunting

- Recreational shooting

""Here is your chance to own a rare Remington Model 788 in the highly desired .22-250 caliber. This rifle is in excellent shape. Semi-gloss walnut stock, sling mounts, detachable box magazine. Comes with mounted scope. Not any issues on the barrel or receiver or anywhere for that matter. One of the unique features of this gun is the rear-lugged bolt. The handle lifts only 60 degrees compared to 90 degrees (like the model 700) allowing more room to mount a larger body scope, and also reducing the travel needed to operate it. The distance the bolt travels backward is also reduced because of the locking rear lugs. There are 9 lugs making this one of the strongest actions ever made (as compared to most manufacturers 2 lug models) A fine design from a bygone era. 

I have an extra mag I'll include ~$45 value, and about ~30 Privi Partizan .22-250 rounds. Meet in person. Must be willing to show ID. I have personally shot this gun about 20 times and when I put it away I was hitting water bottle lids at 200 yds."

Do your research about bitcoin if you don't know what that is.
 It is just like the gold rush of the early years.

Sapphire Radeon HD GPU's are usually out of stock because of bitcoin miners.

 Total rig cost: $1,411.75

 Total rig cost which you cannot build anymore because the parts are sold out because everyone is mining bitcoins that knows anything about it.

 Not to mention this computer is loaded with Windows 7 Enterprise and is a fully functioning desktop/gaming rig or home server. Can load Microsoft OFFICE 2013 for ah additional $100. The two massive graphics cards that are set up using SLI technology so if you want to game you use the power of both cards. This system is way better than the new PS4's plus if can make you some serious money as a bonus. I have generated lots of bitcoins and traded the bitcoins for land, silver, gold and some other items. Bitcoins are not tractable so your transaction are very private.

The reason I am selling is my new ASIC miners have arrived. This are $5,000 to $15,000 rigs. As you know the more you mine you need to re invest some to upgrade your rigs because the mining difficulty increases as more and more people start mining. So this is why I stated earlier you need to get started mining now before everyone else is mining. If that happens you will need a $25,000 rig just to get started.

All Stainless and much more beautiful than pictures can show!
I’ve owned this beautiful gun since early 2008. 
I’d say it has somewhere around 1,500–2,000 through it now.
This gun has been, by far, the most accurate gun I’ve ever shot.

The original box and papers from the factory are included.

It comes with 10 magazines.
7 of them are 229 original Sport magazines(10 rounds).
3 of them are 229 factory 12 round magazines(shiny) with special made 229 Sport bases.

I'm taking a real beating on this at this price so, the price is NOT going to go any lower than $1100.
Sorry, I know everyone wants a great deal.   Me too!.  I just don't want anyone to think that if they wait until next week just 'maybe' the price will go down.  It ain't going to happen. (:-)"

It includes the original factory plastic case and 2 Ruger 15-round magazines. The P95 has a polymer frame and steel slide and it's double action with a slide-mounted, ambidextrous Safety/Decock lever. There is an accessory rail for mounting a light or laser. It also has an ambidextrous magazine release. Ruger pistols are known for reliability and ruggedness.

The exterior finish on the metal shows only slight wear around the muzzle and on the sharp edges of the slide and safety levers. The stainless steel barrel/bore is in excellent condition.  The gun shows very little wear overall and would make an excellent choice for a highly reliable, inexpensive defensive gun.

Don't buy an off-brand or other low-quality gun when you can buy an AMERICAN made gun from the largest maker of quality firearms in the US.

I'll consider serious offers of cash or AR-15 parts or even firearms. Serious offers only please, low-ballers and idiots will be met with a giggle and a press of the delete button! LOL! Let me know what you have. Worst I can say is no thanks."

The TP22 is a dead ringer for the Walther PPK whose heritage goes back to 1928.  The Iver Johnson TP22 breaks down exactly like a Walther PP, PPK, PPK/S.  The TP22 was manufactured between 1982 and 1986, it is based on an Erma Werkes design and some of the earliest production used Erma parts.  It is a sound design that has an internal firing pin block.  When the manual external safety is applied the firing is blocked at both the front and rear.

A model developed after the M4 pattern rifle, the PWS MK114 Rifle has quickly become the crowd favorite for those wanting a compact package without the NFA paperwork associated with shorter barrels. The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC762.

Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

   The frame was manufactured in 1913, which is validated by Colt archives (frame serial # 30,4XX). The front of the grip was made 'rough' by the US Army, before the pistol was used in Korea (prevent slipping from the hand). The frame has the original wooden grips from 1913 and is inscribed with ""United States Property.""

 The slide of this 1911 is dated by Colt to have been produced during 1955-1970 - there is no serial #. The reason the slide is different from the frame is that my friend's dad went on (after Korea) to become a competition shooter in the US ARMY; the current slide has adjustable sights. I have shot approximately 80 rounds through this 1911, it is a TAC-DRIVER! The slide has inscribed: ""Government Model COLT Automatic Caliber .45"".

 The bore is bright and shiny with some wear. Considering the frame was produced in 1913, and the slide was produced as early as 1955, this pistol is in outstanding condition. There is some very minor pitting, but all of the internals are in great shape.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt®-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

 This is a very nice Police Pursuit Vehicle (PPV) Tahoe which I bought from NCHP. It is my daily driver and has currently 165k miles. I have put 10k miles on it, and drove it across country to Alberta last July. You will not believe how well this Tahoe handles. AMAZING! 
 It does NOTHING wrong, does not use oil, does not drip, rattle, etc. I amazed how tight the body and mechanicals are. I installed: Alpine head unit (has Bluetooth, USB port, etc), Alpine amp, Kicker speakers in all 4 doors, new Bilstein rear shocks, red urethane bushings in ALL rear suspension parts and the front sway bar bushings and sway bar ends, new headlight assemblies (the originals were really faded looking) . It has leather front buckets (no console) and a perfect (vinyl??) rear seat which folds down. Has two air conditioning units, electric driver's seat, cruise, auto headlights, intermittent wipers, 5.3 litre v-8, 4 speed auto, electric windows and locks, trailer hitch, electric mirrors. 
 NCHP also provided service records since day 1, and the Tahoe needs nothing, other than (depending on how picky you are) perhaps a windshield; no cracks or chips, but it is sand pitted. It has a paint flake area above the windshield, and a small dent on the hood. There appears to be no body damage ever, and the other panels are perfect....(two sealed antenna holes in the roof) it's black, you'd see damage.
 I have the title, I'd drive it anywhere (actually, I do...) and it will be sold as is. If this ad is up, I still have it.

The CW9 offers the same patented features seen in higher-priced Kahr Arms pistols in an ultra-thin package. CW pistols have a stainless steel slide with a matte stainless finish that gives the pistol a rectangular slide profile and is finished with single-line slide markings. The double-action-only CW9 is a lock breech, passive striker block design with a Browning-style recoil lug. Despite the CW9's durable construction, it weighs only 16.8 ounces. A thin, textured polymer grip fits your hand comfortably while the drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and the pinned polymer blade front sight create a precise and accurate sighting profile. Each CW9 has a black polymer frame with a matte stainless steel slide. One 7-round magazine included.

This pistol has only had 28 rounds shot through it. I bought it for my wife, but she has a hard time pulling the slide back, so I bought her a revolver. I like this pistol, but I have several 9mm pistols, so it would just sit in the safe. According to the manual it isn't even broken in until it it has had 500 rounds shot through it. This gun is built to last and it is extremely accurate. An excellent carry gun. The condition of this gun is like new."
