For those of you needing real help, this is the man, He is the truth....I had spent thousands of dollars trying to get my ex-husband back with other casters and it in vain. When I came across samueldavid, I didn’t want the reading. I just wanted him to do the work. His secretary told me that without the reading, samueldavid would not help me. In the reading, He told me the truth. I didn’t want to hear it and it was hard to take, but he told me anyway. He told me my ex-husband was a waste of my time, as he was not going to come back. No matter what spell. So he suggested I do a cleansing to move on. It took me three weeks to get used to that idea. But after a while, I realized samueldavid was right. So I did what he said. And now, I am happily married to a man of honor who really cares about me and who is actually my friend and really has stuck by me. I know that he would not have come into my life had I continued to peruse my ex and that I would have just been miserable for longer. So all I have to say is Thanks, you truly are the best. Whenever I need help, I will definitely come to samueldavid. And I hope to meet you in person one day soon. Thanks so so so much.

Shoot More, Pay Less With .22 LR Ammo For Practice

The TSG-22 quickly and easily converts the Glock models 19, and 23 into a .22LR pistol. Machined from a solid piece of heat treated 4140 steel, the TSG-22 maintains a similar weight and feel to your factory Glock allowing realistic shooting and training. A nitride surface treatment offers superb resistance to wear and surface friction. The TSG-22 fits comfortably onto your Glock frame in just seconds.

Conversion Kit:

Barrel can be removed like a factory Glock without removing the firing pin housing. Our previous version required taking out two screws to remove the housing.
Functions with a wider variety of ammunition.
Durable Melonite QPQ Finish for increased wear resistance."

It's up for sale or trade of equal value, Selling for $1900 that's with some change added to compensate for tax and shipping.

This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I bought this gun 3 weeks ago and decided that it's too much of a heavy duty powerful gun for the type of hunting that I do. The gun shoots great and is very accurate!

Comes with everything from the factory which includes 3 mags, 2x 15rd mags and 1x 10rd mag, and comes with the new beavertail backstraps.  Shoots well, hasn't been shot much at all.  If I could list this as brand new I would because it essentially is. 

Asking $580 OBO. No low ball offers will be considered, this is essentially brand new and it's a Gen4, not some used up 10 year old police trade in which is why my price doesn't reflect that.

If interested, I also have several extra barrels available.  One is a stock length (4.6"") KKM 10mm barrel and also I have a 6"" KKM .40 S&W barrel for it that will let you shoot .40 S&W from the Glock 10mm (use 10mm mags).  Neither has been shot much, are stainless and are like new.  Either barrel is an additional $125, which is less than what the cost new, yet they're like new.

UZI UC9 9mm 
Availability: In stock.
Product Description:

Developed in the early 1950’s, the UZI proved to be a most formidable weapon, not only in the hands of the Israelis, but many armies throughout the world. A simple open bolt concept with few moving parts, the Uzi is an extremely dependable and tough weapon. It will function in the desert heat, in wind driven sand and a host of other difficult environments. Fitted with a very stable and strong folding metal stock, the gun feels solid. The Uzi will feed any 9mm ammunition without fail. It will break down without tools in a matter of seconds! Its sights are satisfactory and easy to adjust. It is accurate out to 200 meters. Multiple hits on target are accomplished with ease! What it is not is a finely machined weapon, but that is the secret of its success! Without close tolerance and ease of manufacture, the gun is simply not a high maintenance weapon. It is a joy to shoot and never fails to bring a smile to the faces of those who do"

Purchased for Coyote hunting, but never went due to bad heath. 72 years old. Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

    New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind

To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

I have up for sale a like new Charter arms Lavender Lady 38 spl Hammerless model. This is the model that has ""The Lavender Lady"" engraved into the barrel rather than anodized on like some of them do. This is also the Hammerless model which isnt as easy to come by compared to the hammer models that run 399.99+ in stores. This little 5 shot is perfect for conceal carry for a man or woman. The color actually grows on you and has a great sheen to it. Haha. It has had less than 75 rounds through it and has zero issues. The grip is fantastic and pockets very nice for being this kind of gun. The kick is very light considering its weight and the punch it is delivering. I would keep this but I already have a conceal and my gal just isnt in to revolvers. So, I will pass this great gun on to someone who will use it for more than just a safe queen! Included for the asking price are the original case, paperwork, lock, and the pistol itself. I can also possibly include ammo on my end for the right trade. I need to meet in or very close to norman if possible due to my current time constraints, but Im not unreasonable. For any questions or for more pictures please shoot me an email or text me at REDACTED and we can try and make a deal."

781,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2443781,For Sale:  Standard Pressure Short Barrel Low Flash Heavy .38 Special Ammo - 150 gr. Hard Cast Wad Cutter (850fps/M.E. 241 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 23,"Listed On: Friday, December 13, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=111

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo in the loadings whenever possible as over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20D utilizes a very hard cast 150gr. WAD CUTTER bullet. The bullet is made hard, so it won't deform or mushroom. It cuts/crushes a ""cookie cutter"", full diameter hole in human flesh just like it does on a paper target. It penetrates deeply (roughly 14 to 16 inches in human tissue) and its full diameter profile maximizes blood loss as it cuts and crushes (not slips or slides) its way through tissue. Although I've never been shot with a full profile wad cutter bullet, I must assume that the initial impact of that wide flat nosed bullet, is crushingly formidable. As a teenager, I took to the woods on a regular basis and killed many a critter with heavily loaded 38SPL wad cutters'. The effect of a full profile wad cutter on small game was obvious and amazing, compared to regular round nosed bullets. That flat nose, literally hammers living things. These bullets are hard and properly lubed and will NOT lead your barrel. Note my velocities from real world ""over the counter"" revolver s- NOT TEST BARRELS!

-It has the ATI stock installed, its a clone of the Beretta carbine, great ergonomics
-I DO NOT HAVE THE ORIGINAL STOCK, however I will include (2) 10rd factory magazines and the factory front and rear peep sight set.
-It has an aluminum weaver rail mounted with a TruGlo 2.5x magnification red dot installed. I shoot at an indoor range and consistently shoot quarter size holes at 20 yards with it. 
-The bore is like new you can bring a flash light and check it out. I'm the second owner and have shot 250 rounds out of it and the previous owner estimated about 500 rounds. 
-Sometimes the magazines can be tricky to remove. I have been told its an easy fix just a clearance issue with the mag release from the upgraded stock. I never messed with it still shoots great. Don't forget that Hi-Point will still honor their lifetime warranty with the ATI stock installed. I verified this before I purchased it. 

Remington Vantage NP Air Rifle

-To start off this rifle has a NITRO PISTON no cheap spring in this one. 
-This rifle is not a toy. It will fire the .177 caliber round at 1200 feet per second (818mph) you can seriously harm a person. 
-It has a very nice wood stock on it. Out of the air rifles I have fired this one has one of the best triggers. I have fired about 1500 rounds over the 3 years I have owned it. I am the original purchaser, I paid $189 at Dicks sporting goods. 
-Its equipped with a Center Point 3-9x32 scope. Very accurate air rifle.
-It is a Break Barrel single shot. I will allow you to dry fire it if you wish.
-I will include approximately 250 rounds of hollow point hunting ammunition.

The serial number is the lowest I've ever seen on an Izhevsk SKS -- 01647.  All of the serial numbers match.  The gun appears to have had very little use and seems to be mechanically excellent and totally original.  Its stock is laminated.  There are NO refurb marks on the gun.

There is some superficial scratching to the furniture which would make it a good candidate for refinishing the wood, if one wanted it to look perfect.  There is some minor surface rust, mostly on the buttplate.  There are no signs of damage or repairs.  The finish, other than the faint surface rust, is very good and will respond very well to tidying up.  

For more photos, see http://imgur.com/a/wyedQ

It's getting to be very difficult to find good, original Russian-made SKSes anymore -- especially with all-matching numbers -- and the vast majority of those on the market are Tula-made.  Here's a much rarer Izhevsk-made version that would be great for a collector, for the same price as a Tula with mismatched numbers.

It has the original bayonet (not mounted), but is missing the screw that holds the bayonet to the mount.  The sling is long gone.

I'd prefer to sell this within California, and am willing to ship it anywhere in the State for $25.  If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you're welcome to check out the gun in person.  I'm in the center of SF.

Mauser was a German arms manufacturer of a line of bolt action rifles and semi-automatic pistols from the 1870s to 1995. Mauser designs were built for the German armed forces. Since the late 19th and early 20th centuries, military Mauser designs were also exported and licensed to a number of countries, as well as being a popular civilian firearm.
Mauser continued to make sporting and hunting rifles in the late 20th century. In 1995 the company became a subsidiary of Rheinmetall called Mauser-Werke Oberndorf Waffensysteme GmbH, before being merged in 2004 into Rheinmetall Waffe Munition Gmbh."

902,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2443902,For Sale:  SILENCERCO 22 SPARROW,"North Peoria, Phoenix, Arizona",$ 389,"Listed On: Friday, December 13, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"OFFERED BY WWW.ACETACTICALARMAMENT.COM

Caliber: .22 LR, .22 MAG, .17 HMR, 5.7×28 FN Diameter: 1.062″Length: 5.08″Weight: 6.5 oz Material: Alloy Steel, 17-4PH Finish: “Black Oxide Magnesium Phosphate (outer tube)”Supplier: SilencerCo Mount: 1/2×28 threads  

The 22Sparrow is the first silencer in the world to offer the patent pending Multi Part Containment (MPC) technology, which allows the 22Sparrow to be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance after heavy use.

Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance.

Until Silencerco introduced the 22Sparrow, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

Silencerco solved this maintenance issue with MPC technology and made it possible for shooters to disassemble the 22Sparrow easily after heavy use without the need of tools. MPC technology revolutionized take-apart silencers by containing the lead and carbon debris to prevent the debris from reaching the outer tube. This innovative design is achieved by applying two tube halves before sliding the outer tube on the rest of the assembly. When disassembling, the outer tube can be easily removed, and the tube halves are free to pull away from the baffles without having to rotate or slide. Just pull off the tubes, clean the components, and reassemble.

The 5.56 Saker is the most advanced rifle suppressor on the market. Packed with features never before offered in the industry, the Saker is yet another game changing product offered by Silencerco. 

The Saker has an interchangeable front cap feature for different purposes such as a flash hider. The baffles are made from an exotic material that has never been offered in silencers and is approximately 30% stronger than Inconel®. The Saker has several patent pending technologies that place it leagues above its competition. Made for durability, accuracy, and function, the Saker is Superior Silence. 

FEATURES 

Silencerco’s Multiple Accessory Attachment Device (MAAD) allows you to interchange the Saker’s mount so that you can attach the Saker to your preexisting quick detach mount and save hundreds of dollars. 

This patent pending baffle technology protects the Saker’s baffles from erosion thus increasing its durability. Much as armor on an armored vehicle deflects the debris from an IED, the Hoplon Baffle deflects debris and cuts down on baffle erosion up to 90%. 

The TrifectaRS flash hider is the most advanced quick detach mount on earth. The RS stands for Resonance Suppression which is a patent pending technology that keeps the flash hider from ringing like a tuning fork. The TrifectaRS also allows the Saker to be attached and detached from the rifle quickly with one hand.
