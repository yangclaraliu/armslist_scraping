A large contract for the Beretta 92 was with the Brazilian army, for which Beretta set up a factory in Brazil. This factory was later sold to the Brazilian gunmaker Taurus (Forjas Taurus S/A ). Taurus makes these pistols (called the PT92) without the need for a license from Beretta since their design is based on the original Beretta 92, whose patents have since expired.

Like the Beretta, the Taurus PT92 utilizes the open-slide design where the upper portion of the slide is cut away exposing much of the barrel itself. The original PT92 was exactly like the original Beretta 92, though it was also unusual for the time in that it featured a squared trigger guard for supporting the index finger of the opposite hand while firing, a feature which was subsequently introduced to the Beretta 92 with the 92SB-F (92F) model in 1985. The Taurus PT92 is less expensive than the Beretta 92 in most cases.

Other versions of the PT92 include the PT99, which has an adjustable rear sight and a taller front sight.

It exhibits high-hardness that is approved for use within the Department of the Army and is available for use by all Departments and Agencies of the Department of Defense. The high hardness properties of MIL-A-46100E provide for excellent resistance to penetration. This steel was developed specifically for military ballistic threats in personnel carriers, tanks, buildings, and anything else that requires protection against high velocity projectiles. This steel far outperforms AR500, which was developed for abrasion resistance and was never meant for ballistics. There is a reason the military developed this steel to use to protect our troops."

I'll do my best to describe each build in detail. I do not need to sell all of the rifles or all of the optics, I'm just trying to cover my NFA start up costs and a few cans. The fact that these haven't been fired by me yet makes it somewhat easier to sell. At this point I'm still undecided on what I'm purchasing but I know I need to raise $2k. I'll leave these listed until I raise the funds I need or till I figure out what I'm buying and then I'll just toss them on a credit card for the time being. 

1. Factory(kinda) Bushmaster XM15-2ES, 2nd owner. First owner stated 200 rds fired and looks that way. He replaced the carry handle upper with a flat top Aero Precision. He also replaced the hand guard, sight post etc with a low profile gas block, and a troy alpha 15"" rail. I swapped the trigger guard, stock and grip to magpul, added an IWC QD mount on the rail, squid grips and a troy 3 point sling attachment. I then added a ADM recon mount and a Vortex Viper PST. The scope and mount were installed by Rob and haven't left the safe other than for these pics. As is $1700. 

2. Bought this rifle used a little over a month ago and I don't remember most of the specs on it. It's an LMT Defender 200 lower, colt upper(I think), colt BCG( I think), DD 14.5"" mid length with a Troy 13"" Alpha rail( squids and iwc flush qd mount also). It has a Magpul MOE stock, grip, trigger guard, mbus, and blue force sling. I can't remember the rd ct on the rifle from the ad. It also has an Eotech XPS 2-0 mounted that is just out of the packaging this week. As is $1450 

3. Brand new unfired build, Aero lower, PSA Lpk, Magpul MOE stock, rear mbus grip and trigger guard. I did swap the hand guards to skinny's to accommodate the Eotech 512 that is mounted but still have the factory new stock ones. The upper is a PSA 16"" 1/7 twist CL. As previously mentioned there is a very lightly used, not a mark Eotech 512 mounted. As is $950-1000 

4. Used PSA lower I bought complete a few weeks ago, every part in it looks used. It has an ACE Skeleton stock, magpul grip and trigger guard and the Geissele ACT trigger, along with some knicks. There is a brand new PTAC upper 16"" carb 1/7 twist on top. BCG has a carp 158 bolt installed. As is $600 

NO TRADES WHATSOEVER!!! Please don't ask as usual Ffl required, I prefer ARK Tactical, buyer pays fees

This firearm does not shoot .38 special +P rounds.

The pistol was formerly owned by an Orleans Parish Sheriff's Deputy until they converted to 9mm, when he then sold it to a pawn shop in Slidell. I bought it from that pawn shop and it was my very first pistol and Glock. I absolutely love it, and it has very minimal wear from use (ignore the photos, it is only glare from the light, refer to third photo for true coloring). It was primarily my truck gun and I used it to complete a concealed carry course. I personally have put about 300 rounds through it, not sure how much before that was fired. But I have always cleaned it after every range visit, and monthly general cleanings. Bore is in spectacular shape. The frame is solid, and the slide is good to go. Have had zero issues with this firearm.

Now, I have a lot of stuff to go with it. I am including the following:

Title says what it is. Took this in trade a few weeks ago, nice firearm in good shape, just not right for me right now. Has red fiber optic front sight. 

Face to face, meet in Snohomish County. If your not legal to own in WA don't bother me. I will want to see at the bare minimum proof that you are a WA resident (any of the standard ""proofs"" will work) and if age is a question, proof of age. (If you are 50 it is pretty unlikely I'm gonna think you are 15.) Reply to the posting or feel free to text, Four 2 Five - 971 - Four Seven 20. I'm serious about being legal, your girlfriend lives in Bellingham but you live in Oregon does not make you a Washington resident and trying to make that argument just makes you a PITA."

I do have the S&W magazine version already so if you're looking for that, I'd love to trade. ($500)

Glock - I am a fan of Glock handguns, primarily the 4th Gen 9mm ones.  I already have the 17 and 26, so I'd like to find the 19.  I'll only buy this if it's a better deal than I can get through Glock's blue label program.  (Black - $400)"

An Oyster Bay Industries 9 OBI extended magazine, magazine catch &  an upper reciever Post War 9mm ""Bolo"" Barrel are also included.  

This 1910 ""Broomhandle"" is all original and in great condition for a sidearm of this age, there are no major flaws or problems. Wear on this pistol is where it should be-on the sideplate, barrel, and grip strap due to holster wear and usage. The numbers on the inside of the grips match that on the barrel & the only other visible number next to the hammer.  The holster stock is either original or an original quality reproduction.  

The long magazine and magazine catch is a 9 OBI. Oyster Bay Industries was an American company that made a detachable magazine conversion kit for the Mauser. It removes the floor plate, spring and follower and added a small magazine catch mechanism that allows it to feed its own brand of proprietary 9mm magazine using the replacement 9mm upper reciever.  This Post War 9mm Bolo Barrel upper reciever has a 50-1,000 meter tangent sight.  Due to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, German pistols were limited to 100 mm (3.9in.) barrels or shorter, and calibers under 9mm.  Mauser satisfied these restrictions by reviving an older variant, popularly known as the Bolo.  Note this  Bolo barrel may have been forgotten and neglected once set aside in the twentys.  There's some pitting on the barrel & next to the front sight of the Bolo and may have later been refinished & had some parts replaced. 

If interested please call or text to 505-three two one-4552. (Please leave a message)  Cash only please.   Can be shipped to an out of state FFL where legal (will accept Postal Money Orders or PayPal with guns held at the shipping FFL till funds are confirmed).

""Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately. ""
