The Night Reaper™ Crew Served Weapon Light (CSWL) System is anchored with a 50-watt, 5,200 lumen High Intensity Discharge (HID) Searchlight. This wide area search tool provides an unparalleled combination of long range and wide-angle illumination in both the white and Infrared (IR) light spectrums. From there, in accordance with requirements and desired feature sets, one can select and specify the appropriate mounting hardware based on gun mounts, protective armor and fix or quick-detach capability. Quick detach allows operators to easily remove the searchlight in seconds for dismounted search operations. Reattaching the searchlight is quick and secure. The Night Reaper™ has the ability to accept remote vehicle power from 10-30V DC directly without the need for any inline voltage conversion hardware. Remote Switching and Power Cables can be custom designed to address the wide array of vehicle/gun systems deployed. The Night Reaper™ can also run off of (2) BA5590 batteries for an extended period of time. The Night Reaper™ can be configured with or without an internal battery which will allow the system to run continuously for up to 60 minutes should vehicle power be interrupted. If a remote power interruption does occur, the searchlight will auto-switch to the internal battery. If the remote power is restored, the searchlight will seamlessly switch it's operation back to the remote power source to take advantage of the continuous source of power.."

179,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2343179,For Sale:  Sig P229R .40 - 9 mags - 3 holsters,"Puyallup, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,200","Listed On: Saturday, November 16, 2013",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For sale is a used Sig P229R (purchased in 2007) in .40 S&W. This is a NON E2 model with a short extractor and original mainspring and strut. This handgun is DA/SA, and I have swapped out the factory hollow aluminum guide rod with a Bedair stainless guide rod. This adds a tiny amount of weight to the front, so it helps slightly with recoil and is a bit stronger than the factory guide rod - but is mainly just more attractive than the original one. I do also have the factory blue box the gun originally came in.

I also am including 9 standard capacity magazines for the handgun. They are .40/.357Sig 12rd magazines, and each one of them has a brand new Wolff extra strength spring in them.

The three holsters included are:

1 High Noon Custom - Slide Guard (with lining) OWB cowhide holster. This is a custom made high ride holster with belt loops that fit up to 1 3/4"" belts. It has an adjustable tension screw to fine tune the strength of the retention on the holster. If you have never experienced a custom leather holster - it is AMAZING! Mass produced holsters do not have the detailed boning that custom holsters have which does not retain the handgun as well as custom holsters. If you have ever experienced a mass produced leather holster, you know that the leather becomes well-worked and soft within a month or so, but you don't have any of that with the High Noon. It will be just as rigid as it was when it was made forever.

The second holster is a Bianchi IWB concealment holster. I have carried the Sig in an ""appendix carry"" position as well as 3:30-4:00 and it works very well.

The third and final holster is a great range holster. It is the very popular Blackhawk Serpa holster. It includes both the belt attachment and the quick attach pancake attachment.

If you need ammo I can also make you a deal on Federal HST for CCW - but ammunition is NOT included in the asking price for this listing."

Trades I might consider cash plus handguns or Ar's or multigun trades.

Pistols I prefer are (glocks 9mm, .40 or possibly 45, .357 sig, in the $400 - $550 range unless it has xtras, prefer Gen 4, but will consider Gen 3 if price is right)



(Sig P238  $500-$600 value only).  



If AR only looking for 5.56/.223 or 7.62/.308 with same manufacturer upper and lowers only please of current in business factory. Low round

count weapons only in great to new condition.  Only real extra I would consider is a high quality optic, rail, grips, handguard.  Laser and lights

are nice, but I don't really need them. I really prefer handguns or cash, so it would have to be the right AR for me to consider.



Otherwise I prefer newer colt, smith, kimber, HK and some sigs, 1911's, judge, governer and all must be newer weapons (not vintage guns),

 .......semi autos, possibly revolvers, must be excellent condition or new  ............not interested in wooden stock or hunting rifles or hunting

shotguns



Email me your number if you want more pics, I'll text them to you. I can email them too, but prefer texting



Must be legal and show ID. Prefer CWP.   I'm a private seller with CWP. All sales will require bill of sale and will be face to face in public place

This model bike is one of choice for many motorcycle training courses so it would make a great beginner bike. Currently the bike does run a little rough till it warms up(Has trouble running cold at low rpms). The jets need to be replaced along with a good carb cleaning and it will be good to go. I have purchased the new jets for it but haven't had the time to install them yet. The bike comes with a wind screen, two black helmets, along with a set of saddle bags. The only flaw on this bike is one dent on side of the tank that isn't very noticeable. Looking to get 1350.

From Cabelas website:
These screw-in choke tubes let gases vent through slots, creating a braking system that reduces recoil. It also keeps gases from moving faster than the wad or shot. Plus the slots momentarily grab the wad to separate it from the shot before exiting the barrel to improve shot pattern consistency."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 20 GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Hey guys, I have a beautiful Coast to Coast Mater-Mag 12ga with a 32in full choke barrel and 28in semi choke barrel. Both barrels are steel shot and in great condition. It is chambered for 2 3/4 and 3in shells. This shotgun is one of the older Coast to Coast shotguns, modeled after the Winchester 1200. Something rare about this gun that I haven't been able to find on any other, is that it is engraved with ducks on either side. Its a very nice shotgun.

From what I've read, the Coast to Coasts were made for the Coast to Coast hardware stores (hence the name) by multiple gun companies, most commonly Mossberg. The Winchester is one of the more rare ones, dating around the early 1970s. You are more than welcome to do research and find out more, this is just what ive read.

Im open to trades for a lot of things, ideally a nice Hi-Point Carbine in either .40, 9mm, .45

Also interested in other rifles or handguns, tickets to Seahawks games, football jerseys, mopeds, dirtbikes, cars, trucks, etc.

The target and stand have absolutley no dings or pitting. Target cost me 140 plus shipping and has been taken out twice. 

Here is an an excerpt from Action Target website.

""A portable and durable armor steel target for everyone who loves shooting! The Evil Roy Practice Target is the best thing to happen to shooting in a very long time.

The portable stand folds to less than 3 feet long in just seconds, so it easily fits in the trunk of even the smallest car. The target head is made of AR500 armor steel so you can shoot it with anything from .22 rimfire to .44 magnum with no damage at all. Our ""heavy duty"" version is also built to take appropriate rifle rounds* with no damage.

The beauty of a steel target is that you don't have to waste time changing paper or putting out new tin cans. The head of the Evil Roy Target will ""bounce"" a little when you hit it, so you get instant positive feedback.""

This gun is brand new, never been fired.  Flawless condition!
It comes with a scope, bipod and plenty of ammo.
The scope is a Scheel’s Icon Hunter 4 to 12 x 44mm, with Weaver Rings.
Was only put on this gun new, and never used.
The bi-pod is a 9” to 13” Shooter’s Ridge that swivels, cants and rotates.
Was only put on this gun new, and never used.
720 rounds of ammo; that I bought before the big ammo price inflation, so I’ll pass along my lower prices to you:
10 boxes of Federal Premium 50 grain Sierra Blitzking.
8 boxes of Federal Premium 40 grain Nosler Ballistic Tip.
6 boxes of Winchester 50 grain Soft Points.
8 boxes of Hornady 60 grain Hollow Points.
4 boxes of Hornady 55 grain V-Max.
I bought all of this with the intent of going prairie dog hunting, but that doesn’t seem to be happening.
With a bullet velocity of over 4,000fps, this caliber has also been used on white tail deer.
This only goes as a package, I’m not selling the ammo separately, so please don’t ask.
This package is worth well over $2,000.
Make me a reasonable offer, but keep the ridiculous ones to yourself."

I was going to build a pistol with it but can not find a stripped upper to do so. The overall length is 14 1/4 and this includes the muzzle. So if your getting this for a ""rifle"" you will need a longer muzzle and pin it and weld it. If your into pistols then your ok.  This barrel also has LMT,s signature star stamped which I can not get a picture of due to the location of it.  The barrel reads MP 5.56 NATO 1/7 CB. I just simply want to move it. I will consider trades for other AR parts etc. Just let me know."

I have kept and taken great care of my FJ and babied it on service. I have always put synthetic oil in it from day one and never gone over on my oil changes. Toyota suggests premium fuel and despite gas prices, ive always kept premium in it. It has a timing chain vs timing belt so you shouldnt ever have to deal with that part of the upkeep. Everything on this FJ works.

Included are many spare parts.  As you can see from the picture, the handle is broken, but a new handle can be purchased for $30.  The previous handle met a very unfortunate accident...

Included:
  - Lee Pro 1000 press (broken handle)
  - 3 die set of Lee Carbide 9 mm pistol dies.  Used, but in great shape.  These dies don't require lubrication.  Dies included: Carbide Full Length Sizing Die, Powder Through Expanding Die, and Bullet Seating Die. If you aren't interested in 9 mm dies, let me know and I will reduce the price accordingly.
  - Shell carrier.  I believe I stripped the drive gear, but a spare is provided.  See above reference to ""unfortunate accident"" which then resulted in a broken handle.
  - #19 shell plate for 9 mm etc.
  - #1 shell plate for 357 mag., .38 spl, etc.
  - Three 3-hole turrets.  Value $9 each.  Two are used, one is new.  These allow you to set a caliber and simple swap turrets.  Switching from one caliber to another is actually very easy this way.
  - Case feeders (2) + case tubes (2x4).  Value $40 total.
  - Small and large case slides
  - Lee Deluxe Auto Powder Measure + 4 charge plates.  The whit glob on the side is where I reinforced the stripped screws.  Better than new.
  - One primer tray with lid and one spare pace.
  - Spare auto-index hex ratchet gears
  - Spare drive gear
  - Spare case check plastic arm.
  - Mounting hardware
  - Owner's manual
  - Misc other small parts.
  - 500 mixed brass 9 mm cases as BONUS.

If you have a lee Pro 1000 and are looking for a kit of spare parts, this is a great way to get it.  If you are interested in getting into reloading and are very patient, then this isn't a bad deal either.  If you feel the price is too high, make me an offer.  I won't be offended, but if it is too low, I'll just ignore you.  This press has 1000's of rounds through it and overall worked great.  It does require an extra amount of patience and that is something I don't have right now...

Photos available of all items, just email if you'd like to see them.

Not interested in trades as I want cash for a new Hornady LNL AP.

This hunting ammo from Remington in .308 Winchester has a 150 Grain Core-Lokt Pointed Soft Point Bullet is ideal for medium game.

Remington Core-Lokt, a reputation deserved. Hunters with a knack for filling their deer tag tend to have more than success in common. They trust their hunt to Remington Core-Lokt. For more than six decades, it has remained the leader in centerfire deer ammunition. And deservedly so. The Core-Lokt bullet design is the original controlled expansion bullet, and one of the most effective ever developed. Its progressively tapered copper jacket is locked to a solid lead core, promoting perfectly controlled expansion and high weight retention for absolutely dependable on game results. You'll find its time proven performance in both soft point and pointed soft point versions, and in a range of bullet weights for virtually every centerfire hunting caliber made.

I have the factory sling swivels as well, but I replaced them with modern style ones, as the factory ones are about the only negative with these guns. The scope is a simple BSA 4x scope, but the gun will shoot ragged holes at 50 yards all day long with factory ammo. The action is smooth as butter, and the wood stock is in at least 98% condition. It is a truly beautiful rifle, but I have other needs right now. The only flaw this rifle has is some small wear in the bluing in some areas on the barrel - nothing a paint job or re-bluing couldn't fix, if it bothered you that much.

These 513's are becoming harder to find, as CZ discontinued them in 2012. Luckily, they use the same magazines as the popular CZ452, so accessories like magazines are not difficult to find at all."

I am ASKING 600.00 in cash and will include a soft side case for it. If you don't want he case, I am asking 585.00. I am willing to entertain trade offers but won’t hold this. I have had too many “I get paid in a couple of days” offers that never called back or changed their minds and I lost a sale to someone else. I am pretty firm on price but can trade better. I am only selling  this to fund another project and have had no feeding, ejecting or extraction problems.

If you don’t like my price, buy it somewhere else or make me a reasonable offer. This can be viewed/purchased in Wellington and I will not deliver it or ship it.

My wish list:
I am possibly interested in a bolt action 30-06. No Mausers or rebarreled models please. Remington is my favorite but a Winchester, Ruger or Savage is not out of the question. I like Weatherby Vanguards also.

A .257 Weatherby. I prefer stainless but blued will work.
A nice stainless 6” .357.
A nice stainless .44 mag.
A .243 complete upper for a DPMS
Quality optics but am not interested in Leupolds.
I trade fair but will not pay new plus price for your item. Even if it shoots dime sized groups at 1000 yards, it is only worth the value of what any other one is."

I've upgraded the trigger assembly so it now has a 3lb trigger pull the ejector spring, firing pin spring, and a spring in the trigger got replaced. I've upgrade the guide rod to a stainless steel guide rod with a 14 lb spring to bring down the muzzle flip works really nice. it has two holsters with one being my favorite the remora. Also has 5 mags 2 15rd mags and 3 17 rd megs. I clean it after every use and its light to carry hardly notice it sometimes and with the remora very comfortable when in the car or moving around.

The Ruger LC9 Raspberry is a double-action-only, hammer-fired, locked-breech pistol with a smooth trigger pull. Control and confident handling of the Ruger LC9 are accomplished through reduced recoil and aggressive frame checkering for a positive grip in all conditions. The Ruger LC9 Raspberry frame features smooth melted edges for ease of holstering, carrying and drawing.

A seven-round, single-column magazine is provided with each LC9 pistol. The magazine’s standard flat floorplate aids concealability, while the provided finger grip extension floorplate offers an option to shooters who prefer a longer grip surface with more hand-to-pistol contact.

Firearm Features and Specifications

The Ruger LC9 Raspberry is compact and just slightly larger (less than 1 inch in both height and length) than the popular LCP. Its rugged construction consists of a blued, through-hardened alloy steel slide and a black, one-piece high-performance, glass-filled nylon grip frame.

Ruger’s dovetailed, high visibility 3-dot sight system on the LC9 Raspberry contains a windage-adjustable rear sight and a fixed front sight. Safety features include an internal lock, manual safety, magazine safety and a loaded chamber indicator which provides visual and tactile indication that chamber is loaded.
