The Interceptor armor is also compatible with the Molle gear system, but the system is rapidly declining in popularity among troops and turning more to the Interceptor.

Personal Experience with the 516P :  
The516 blows doors off any compitition. The fit and finish is perfect. The lower receiver has a flared full fence around the magazine area. The front of the magazine area has long dimples for better grip. It is punched so you can attach your harness to the lower vs the butstock, so when you extend your butstock your harness position doesn't change.

My personal 516 can shoot any ammo; metal, brass form any country without a misfire with exceptional accuracy unlike most others which require expensive brass rounds like the LWRC at a much higher cost.

About the Sig Sauer 516 P - Flat Dark Earth 5.56 Nato: 
The SIG516 Patrol FDE in Flat Dark Earth with a matching FDE Cerakote® finish on both the upper and lower receivers and quadrail handguard. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the Flat Dark Earth use the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. 

 This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

 A 16” chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating M1913 quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights.

That being said I'll reiterate what I had previously posted from my last ad here...I purchased this AR from Independance Firearms out of Brenham Texas brand new. I paid them $3100 plus tax. It is in the burnt bronze finish as you can see from my pic below (canon shot :)  The rifle has seen approximately 30-50 rounds max. I still have the original box and all original paper work as well!!! Contact me through here or send me a text message REDACTED



You will get everything you see in my picture, minus the aimpoint red dot for $2500. Here is what it includes



This is a used in box Christensen Arms CA-15 Recon Gas Piston AR-15 rifle with burnt bronze finished receiver. Gas Piston operation ensures outstanding reliability and cleanliness. The barrel is Stainless Steel, Match Grade and hand lapped, turned to a proprietary contour and then wound in Carbon Fiber, resulting in a lightweight barrel with the accuracy of a target bull barrel. Christensen Carbon Fiber barrels are three times stiffer than steel barrel of equal weight. The Christensen Arms patented carbon layup process produces a barrel shell that has zero thermal expansion coefficient, which brings shot after shot consistency. There is a Titanium bird cage-style flash hider with defense point serrations. This rifle has a Timney trigger system Made in the USA with a pull weight of 3 pounds.



The lower receiver is a precision milled 7075-T6 aluminum forging, and the upper receiver is an eye catching proprietary 7075-T6 aluminum billet design with heavy walls and top mounted Picatinny rail for easy and secure installation of optics. The bolt carrier group's nickel boron coating acts as a protective finish and polishes the receiver each time it cycles. Oversized takedown pins are installed for easy cleaning or receiver changes. A MagPul CTR stock is installed, as is a comfortable Hogue pistol grip. The Handguard is a proprietary Carbon Fiber design with top and bottom mounted rails.



This is a truly premium AR-15 rifle.



Caliber: .223 Remington

Magpul: Back up sights and Forearm grip 

Capacity: One 30 round Pmag included

Equipped with 8 AA batteries, and capable of taking SD cards up to 64 GB, this camera will help you scout your deer without putting too much pressure on them.

Simply set the time lapse mode, put it on a field you'd like to watch, and let it eat. You'll quickly know the entrance and exit points of a particular area.

- I wont go any lower on the price. This SuperNova is the cheapest in the WHOLE Country by over $120 difference. If you find one for less than $400 buy it!!! they are great guns. 
- Why I am selling it? I want a brand new one. 
- I have a Scope saddle for extra $25 (also camo, paid $48).
- I have a brand new case for $15. 
- $360 for the whole package or $330 for the gun. Thanks!

A potential buyer: lionsfan_ben@y****.com set up a meeting several days from our initial contact.  Kept my word and denied other buyers until then. I showed up and met him, apparently near where he worked, he was sweating quite a bit and was looking for very dark and remote places for the exchange.  When he noticed security guards near any area he told me ""it feels like there are eyes on us everywhere"". He said he would pull around in a car, and left me sitting in front of a convenience store, wouldn't answer his phone.  Finally he texted, ""had a bad feeling"".
I'm not sure if he's a tweeker, or had dark intentions, but I highly reccomend you steer clear of this guy!

From a website... ""Definitely an interesting handgun from an era gone by, the 7-shot Nagant Revolver is an extremely unique design dating back to the 1890s. The most interesting design point is that upon cocking the hammer, the cylinder pushes forward in an attempt to seal off escaping gas; the cartridge case itself then provides the final seal at the point of firing and supposedly adds 50 to 150 fps to the bullet's initial velocity. 

Designed by the Nagant Brothers (Emile and Leon) of Liege, Belgium, the original design was accepted by the Russians in 1895. The initial shipments were produced at Liege, Belgium and exported to Russia. Around 1898, the Russians then initiated their own production at their Tula Arsenal. Originally designated to be replaced as frontline issue after the adoption of the TT30 in 1930, the production on these military weapons actually continued up through 1945 and they could still be found in the hands of reservist troops and police into the 1950s."""

I am looking for funds for medical and several other related bills. I am more than happy to send photos of the two rifles for sale below to interested buyers. 

Let me know what photos of which rifle you would like to see and I will send them over. If you have any questions feel free to ask. 

I can arrange a FTF in the Twin cities area. I am willing to ship, but the rifle will need to be shipped to either valid C&R or 01 FFL. All prices include shipping.

 Accepted payment methods are Certified checks/funds, Personal check (however I must wait until it clears.), or Postal money order.

 Norwegian Gevaer M/1894 Krag-Jorgesen long rifle in 6.5x55mm, Kongsberg arsenal date 1902. Very early date, produced just prior to the Norwegian succession from Sweden in 1905. This rifle is in straight Norwegian military configuration, this rifle is not sporterized in any way. Very rare find in this condition, I have only seen one other in 25+ years of collecting European military arms. 

 All matching serial numbers on stamped parts including the bolt. The bore is very clean and with sharp lands and grooves, well taken care of. The rifle comes with an original example of the brass muzzle cover (near impossible to find on its own.), original Norwegian issue sling, and all of its cleaning kit contents in the butt trap compartment in the buttstock. $3,000.00 shipped.

 Please send me a message for any inquiries and I will forward further info on payment. Thanks for looking and God Bless!"

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

Pistol looks unused. I can provide more detailed pictures of anything.

Comes with case,paperwork, and two magazines one of which has a pearce pinky extension. 

>>>>>$450 pistol only with stock sights.

I also have installed a set of night sights that are currently on the pistol. They are Ameriglo Pro series. The rears are illuminate yellow at night and the front is green, as you can see in the picture below they are white rings during the day but they glow at night very bright. Makes for much easier pickup versus the all green dots. They are brand new I purchased them Oct.3rd and received them October 8th 2013. These were $125. I have the receipt with the price I paid and date if you are interested these have a 12 year warranty also. Many consider these some of the best night sights. I will include these for $90 on top of $450 for the pistol  and I will also include the stock sights. If you do not want them I will install the stock sights and keep these.
They can be seen here.

Law enforcement professionals already know that when they deploy a shotgun, suspects carrying a handgun are not nearly so emboldened about starting a gunfight. It's very intimidating to think that you might be on the receiving end of the lethal blast that a shotgun delivers. More patrol officers are carrying AR-type rifles in their squad cars but are discovering that, if setup properly, a 12 gauge can deliver a 300 grain slug with combat accuracy up to 100 yards with devastating results that no rifle can match. This can be achieved while carrying munitions that range from buckshot to breeching rounds to less lethal, all with the same weapon. The bottom line is that the shotgun has proven itself to be the most intimidating, effective and versatile of any weapon deployed in an urban environment. Whether you are a civilian wanting an optimal home defense weapon, or a law enforcement professional with special needs, you will need this."

This is a Smith & Wesson “Pre-27” .357 Magnum DA Revolver. A 5-Screw Smith, these guns (with the high-frame screw) were only made between 1950-1957. Adding rarity to the pistol, it has a factory nickel finish and a pair of gorgeous aged ivory grips with gold-plated S&W medallions. Also, the pistol has the rare, and sought-after 3 ½” barrel. As was standard on these pistols, it has an adjustable rear sight, a ramp front sight (with a dollop of red paint on the ramp), a finely-checkered top strap, and grooved front and rear grip straps. The ivory grips (worth about $1000. In their own right!) fit this gun like a glove! To say that the pistol is handsome is an understatement! The pistol has faint turn marks on the cylinder, and the painted sight ramp, and that’s it – NO cosmetic issues whatsoever, the bore is absolutely MINT, trigger pull is very smooth, overall, the pistol easily rates 95%+ condition."

Feels and looks like the American classic battle carbine of WW2 and beyond, only cheaper to shoot in 22lr. It has a couple small marks on the stock but nothing major and looks great. The trigger had a light action job so its not as heavy and the out of the box factory trigger.
