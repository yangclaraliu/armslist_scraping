Here is a list of things I am interested in trading depending on what is out there. 
KelTec p11, in good shape, belt clip installed, one 10 round mec gar magazine

Ruger mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun also comes with 9mm threaded barrel which functions perfectly, and frame saver recoil spring system.  The extras alone retailed for $400

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus pt 145 Millennium pro 45 A.C.P.

The Millennium PRO"" features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry. This gun is in good condition with one small finish wear spot.  two magazines."

I'm not gonna waste your time with all the sales stuff on this ad for pistol, it's on google if you want to see it. Here's the important stuff:

- Totally ambidextrous double/single action pistol
- 16 rounds of .45 caliber; 15 rounds plus one in the pipe
- Barrel threaded for suppressor
- Complete with 4 grip panels, 3 magazines, soft case, and bases needed to install red dot sights
- Trijicon night sights, raised to co-witness with red dot, and to clear suppressor

This SLR 95 is accurate, cycles perfectly as you'd expect, and with the unique muzzle brake, it is very controllable when firing fast.  Having owned 2 Russian Arsenal stamped AKs and averaged a good 3.5 MOA average with them, I can say with certainty that this one is more accurate - which I'd attribute to the milled receiver, heavier STEYR hot hammer forged barrel, and no trunion.  Also, the milled receiver is no heavier than a stamped one despite rumors to the contrary.

This gun has since been brought into 922 compliance once the native sporter thumbhole stock (included) was removed including a US made grip, stock, fire control group (included), handguard set (muzzle is pinned/welded so as not to trigger 922 compliance for it).  You can still use foreign Bulgarian mags as included in this offer.  

What you get, and what it cost me:
SLR 95 chambered in 7.62x39 - $1100
7 - reliable Bulgarian mags that feed wonderfully - $20ea 
Ultimak rail - $100
Bushnell micro red dot scope that allows for co-witnessing with iron sights - $90
Ace modular receiver block for milled receivers (means I didn't cut off the tang) - $45
Ace fixed stock - $65
Hogue rubber hand grip - $20
Cross tack single or double point sling - $35
Krebs custom AK safety/selector switch - $60
Tromix AK large bolt handle - $25
400+ rounds of Wolf FMJ - $120

Originally a 7 1/2"" barrel, it has been shortened and recrowned to a much handier 4 3/4"" barrel length. These were only made from 1970 to 1973 with the 45 Colt being produced in the smallest numbers with only 22,921 made. Overall condition is excellent, with about 98%+ bluing with a couple of tiny nicks on the ejector rod housing, and a small dink in the backstrap and adjacent right grip panel (see photos). Timing is perfect, bore and chambers are excellent, and no buggered screws. I know collectors might shudder, but I've never regretted shortening the barrel and creating a much handier, tank tough and powerful revolver. You won't be disappointed with this one, it will make a very shootable addition to any Ruger collection.

The bluing is in very good condition with the exception of a few very small rust spots.(have not removed rust for fear of damaging finish) The wood has very little scaring and is glossy throughout with a few spots that appear to be some kind of green paint smudges. This rifle comes with what I believe to be the original tan cloth carry bag and cleaning rod, although it is in pretty rough condition. The action feels great and I'm sure it will fire but hasn't been fired in at least 40 years. I am unsure of the condition of the rifling but there does appear to be some oil in the gun so I imagine its fine. These old rifles go for anywhere from $300-$1000 depending on condition and features, most I have found recently are selling for 500-700 on the gun websites like gunbroker although I don't really expect that much out of it."

This pistol is in great shape;

- normal ""cylinder ring"" from cycling. 
- Other than these mentioned, the bluing is beautiful.

Have only fired 12 shots while I've had it, and it shows little evidence of being shot much in the past. Appears to be manufactured in early 80's. Comes with standard rosewood grips, and smaller Hogue finger groove grips as shown in the pictures, as well as original box and manual, etc..

NFA REVOCABLE LIVING TRUST

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (16 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Assignment of Property (2 pages, send this in with your BATF forms)
- Affidavit of Trustee (1 page)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Vintage Doctors Bag with Huge amount of Physicians Instruments / Tools
Everything you see in Pictures is Included
I am not in the Medical Field and what some of these items I know and most I do not know what they are. Most are in good condition however some do need to be cleaned up. They are being sold as collectables for display, not to be used.
These came from a Doctors Estate several years ago. He was a Doctor that served in WW2 and many of the items date back to that Era. 
Names I have noticed are, Aescup, American Standard, Tiemann, Durban, A.C. Tafel, to name a few.
I do not have the time or energy to deal with cleaning and finding out what they are.

They Doctors bag is leather but condition is fair. Zipper is broken and some of the stitching has come loose but could be restored by someone with the time.
High Resolution pictures are available.
There is over 100 pieces of this vintage medical instruments.

Gun has factory wood grips, but I installed a brand new set of VZ G10 Operator II grips ( on it right now – pictured). I will throw in the VZ grips (cost me $60), and a box of 50rds FMJ ammo along with the gun. I like the gun, but it is just too nice to carry for CCW (which was my intention). This gun is absolutely nice. Must be 21 years old or older to buy this gun, and must also be a Kentucky resident and have at least a valid KY driver’s license. Local KY sale/trade only.

Never carried this thing, just took it to the range a few times. It's had zero malfunctions and I've tested a few types of hollow points.

This is one of the guns known for fighting in the Indian Wars. Gun is marked ""Property of Kansas"" and ""non-transferrable"". Overall rifle is in good condition considering the age of this rifle. Stock is in excellent condition. Blueing on the rifle is very good near the receiver, but is poor towards the muzzle. Bore shows age, darkness, and pitting. Action works great overall and hammer has three snaps as it cocks. I have never fired this rifle.

I do not recommend firing this rifle in any way before being checked out by a certified gunsmith. 

If you need pictures of anything, please let me know and I will send them to you!

I have only put about 200 rounds through it, i bought a case of 440 and got about 200 left. When I go to the range I usually spend more time explaining what the gun is and letting people shoot it a couple times, it draws a crowd every time I go. I have only shot light ball 147 grain through it. I did take it out to a range up to 600 yards and after a couple shots adjusting my scope I was nailing the target every time. Whenever I've shot it I've never shot more than 30 rounds at a time before cleaning it. I haven't shot it for about a year but get it out every once in a while just check it out and oil it up. The rifle is still close to new condition, the parts still fit very tight on it and the guns finish still has little marks.
