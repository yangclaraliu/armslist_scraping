I couldn't care less about the exterior appearance of the vehicle so long as there's a) ZERO rust on the body; b) minimal rust on the underbelly and c) the windshield, all windows, mirrors and lights are in good condition. If the vehicle is still light-years away from passing an emissions test then I also wouldn't be interested.

Before any deal gets done, we would need to bring the vehicle over to my friend's house and get it on his lift for an inspection.

40 gr CCI maxi-mag total metal jackets (78ct)

30 gr Hornady v-max (hollowpoint with ballistic polymer tips) (170ct)


Photos of the lot are included below. The clear boxes that the hornady and cci come in normally hold 50, but i repackage them to take up less space and each contains 78 rounds.  The bitterroot valley boxes are 50 to a box.  There are a few loose polymer tip rounds as well.

At roughly 12 dollars per box of 50 for the hornady or cci, I am selling this lot at a steal.
627 rounds at $10 per 50 is 125.40, I think that would be a good deal, but to be sure im going down to an even 100 for the whole lot, putting the rounds at 16 cents a piece.  8 cents less per round than what you may pay at the store.  The bulk buy crap winchester or remington boxes of 500 are still .24 cents a piece or more for .22 WMR.

Model HK5146.  Includes all factory accessories - flip up covers - lens cloth - battery and manual in factory box. Mounted and used at range about 50 rounds. No scratches or ring marks on exterior and lens are perfect. SCOPE IS LIKE NEW!

If one name is synonymous with night time shooting it’s Hawke Nite-Eye. These New Hawke Nite-Eye Digital riflescopes have been specifically designed to meet the needs of hunters who require supreme optics for shooting in low light conditions such as dawn, dusk, or in wooded areas.The range contains the same great side focus optical system as the Varmint SF, with addition of a larger objective lens for increased light gathering at dawn and dusk. There is a wide choice of specially crafted glass-etched reticles, including the ballistic SR12.

Smart Illumination
Hawke Nite Eye Digital features a unique day/night (blue/red) digital illumination system designed to work in harmony with your eye’s natural sensory characteristics. The Nite Eye system offers 24 levels of blue or red illumination and memorises your settings, thereby avoiding unwanted night blindness. The lowest settings cannot be seen in daylight. A battery indicator and auto-shut-off ensure you won’t be left in the field without illumination.  

Side Parallax
Extreme accuracy is achieved with a precise side focus wheel with smooth operation ensuring the image can be focused so that it is parallax free at all distances. All Nite-Eye SF scopes parallax from 10yds to infinity (except the 6-24 model, which will adjust to 15yds).

Advanced Reticles
There are 4 exciting reticles to choose from – The popular SR6 and SR12 and all new ½ Mil Dot and MAP 6A. All reticles are glass etched for increased strength and fine detail.
All of these reticles are compatible with Hawke’s Ballistic Reticle Calculator (BRC) software. The BRC allows the reticle aim points to be calculated to all rifle's trajectories. Download the software and 'Blueprint' your set-up.


Improved Optical System
The objective lenses in the Nite-Eye® Digital family are all 50mm, preferred by many sporting shooters, due to the brightness, clarity and low-light performance. The optical system is newly designed with fully multi coated lenses throughout – the image is crisp, bright and holds even contrast. The Hawke Nite-Eye Digital range is styled to be practical yet attractive, featuring all weather grips and a thumb bump on the magnification ring for easy use, even when wearing gloves.
The objective end is threaded to accept sunshades. Low, non-intrusive, turrets give precise clicks and repeatable accuracy. The click value is ¼ M.O.A.

I really don't have the luxury of keeping it at the time, I have added some upgrades and am selling it as it is pictured. Here is a compilation of information on this build;  This is THE cutting edge piece of weaponry for the modern day warrior. The .300 Blackout is the culmination of everything learned from the battlefield in the last 70 years. Designed around the most battle proven platform ever, the AR-15, it requires only a different barrel, all other parts are fully interchangeable. The forged Vltor MUR (Modular Upper Receiver) is a MilSpec correct upper with a thicker wall, making it a much stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver is made from 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging, and will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. it features an anti-rotation interface with the handguard. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. Noveske's chrome lined barrels are hammer forged to the material callouts and manufacturing process for the M249 Machine Gun barrels. Cold hammer forging work hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. The barrel is chrome lined to the spec for a M249 Machine Gun barrel, which is about twice as thick as that of an M4 barrel. The end result is a rifle that can be run hard day after day. The barrel has a AAC 51T Blackout flash suppressor, and a 1 in 7 twist. It is outfitted with the NSR 13.5 rail. The NSR handguard is the lightest and smallest free floating forend to date. The width before accessories is only 1.48"" The KeyMod inter-locking rail system is a collaboration between Vltor and Noveske. It offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard. The lower receiver is a Franklin billet Libertas model in multi caliber. These are a whole different game from the average AR lower. This design incorporates integrated ambidextrous, anti-rotational Quick Detach sling mounts. On the magwell, forward of the trigger is a textured Memory Index Point for safely resting the trigger finger when not ready to fire. The magazine well is also enlarged and beveled to facilitate quicker magazine changes. The integral trigger guard is over-sized to allow room for larger hands or gloves. The front of the magazine well is also textured to allow it to be used as a grip for forward support. Optic is a Burris AR-132 red/green dot scope, 10 brightness settings 5 in each color, comes with original paperwork, the guaranteed quality of the Burris name, and is specifically designed for optimum height to an AR platform. The finishing touches for durability, reliability, and simplicity are the 6 position mil standard Palmetto stock, chromed bolt and BCG (smoother, more durable and cleaning is a breeze), a gen 3 30 round PMAG, and set of Troy flip up iron sights. All in all this gun is a testament to American ingenuity, the spatha of the modern day gunfighter."

Very reliable, has new ice cold air, new tires and 8k synthetic winch. Engine and transmission was replaced a few years ago. New exhaust, front hub assemblies, all new ABS sensors. New radiator, new high amp battery.  Just had all the drives oil changed, front end aligned and tires rotated. I drive it every day at least 50 miles. 4x4 is awesome. The tires are very loud, has check engine light & abs lights on and it is cumbersome."

Don't want anything very nice so I don't feel the need to go and buy anything new from a shop. Prefer 30-30, 243, 223, 308 but will listen to any offers. 

Would really like an old beater lever action but like I said I'll listen to most anything. 

I'm down south of Wilmington and make trips up to Raleigh about once a month so it probably need to be around those areas. 

Price I'm willing to spend completely depends on the gun being offered, but I don't really have a limit on spending, I just don't want to buy a brand new gun to keep in my truck

It started off a 2003 Honda 750 liquid cooled and has been fully customed from there by being hardtailed, lowered, stretched, new primary, custom exhaust, ram air charger, custom risers and bars, side light and plate bracket, headlight, forward controls, as well as a strutless rear fender and custom made solo seat. This beauty is fast and LOUD! As well as being a leak free reliable honda powered bike ( And yes for you label lushes it is a honda motor but it was built in america). Bike has 5,9xx miles on it (maybe a little more as I ride it) and is clean, never dropped, only flaw is for a bubble in the paint on gas tank that needs to be re done (really not noticeable unless you know it is there) I am in no hurry to sale as I don't need the money I am just looking for my next venture so don't try and low ball and beat me up over the price, I may be negotiable on the price if you are serious and have cash on hand but I know what I have in this machine and am already taking a loss as far as money goes. This beauty is ready to go, has thousands of dollars in custom work, has zero issues, has a clean Colorado title and you can ride it home today. The only things I could say I would be interested in trading for is another v-twin bike (no rockets!!) that runs, is reliable, has the title included, and has more then 1000cc and yes I would be interested in any Harley sportsters or other Harleys for a new build. I am also a gun enthusiast but don't need any junk or $100 guns (high-point garbage), I like lever actions, nice handguns, revolvers, winchester model 70's, Springfield M1A's, a nice autoloading shotgun for hunting (benelli, remington, etc), might be interested in a nice saiga 12 and of course I am alwasy interested in good AR's. I am not looking to do a full trade however with firearms, I would take guns tho on partial trade.
In closing I have no time to waste and will not waste any of yours with nonsense so please only SERIOUS inquiries from people actually wanting to purchase or trade for this machine, I do not need any help selling it and if you cannot show up yourself with cash in hand don't bother as I have heard all the paypal scams and will delete your e-mails immediately. I will also not reply to any one liners or anyone simply asking if it is still available, if the post is up then yes it is still available, so shoot me your contact info or you will be kindly ignored. I HAVE PLENTY MORE PICS I CAN SEND IF YOU ARE SERIOUS!! Whoever takes this machine home will be very satisfied, it is an awesome bike and will be sorely missed!"

505,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2081505,"For Sale/Trade:  Spikes Tactical AR pistol 10.5"" w LaRure rail and Vortex optic","Bradenton (or Tampa or St. Pete), Tampa/St. Pete, Florida","$ 1,300","Listed On: Thursday, September 5, 2013",Rifles,Spikes Tactical                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have a complete Spike's Tactical AR-15 pistol that I'm listing in hopes of lucking into an interesting trade or will sell for $1,300.00

Spikes Tactical lower receiver that is factory marked as an AR-15 ""Pistol"" with the Spider logo. This lower is serial numbered under 1000 and it has Color-filled (red and white) selector markings on both sides of the lower receiver and has a complete Spikes lower parts kit factory installed. The foam-wrapped pistol buffer tube on this weapon is the same length as a standard AR-15 rifle buffer tube so it takes the same buffer and spring as a standard AR-15 and, of course, this weapon comes with the buffer spring and buffer so it's ready to shoot the moment you pick it up from me. The rear sling adapter plate is an ambi sling plate and it looks and functions great with any type of sling (even the newer Magpul MS3 clips). The Magpul enhanced trigger guard and a MagPul pistol grip have been professionally installed on this weapon also.

The upper receiver is also Spikes and has the Spikes spider logo laser etched on the top of the rail (hidden under the rear sight) and the rail has white t-markings. The barrel is a Spikes marked 10.5"" govt. profile barrel NATO 1/7 twist rate MP marked and chrome-lined barrel with a ""F"" marked front sight / gas block with a the bayonet lug and an A2 flash hider installed with a crush washer. The barrel has seen MAYBE 400 rounds through it and, of course, this weapon comes with the complete BCG and has the upgraded BCM extractor. The rail is a LaRue Tactical 7.0 free float quad rail that is ROCK SOLID, has white T-markings and looks great. The rear sight is an authentic LMT fixed BUIS and the red dot optic is a Vortex SPARC that has a LONG battery life and holds zero like a champ.

This weapon is 100% rock solid and works flawlessly on any ammo I feed it. The trigger is smooth and has a crisp reset. Because this weapon is so short and lightweight it ends up being a PERFECT truck gun (if you don't mind having a high-end truck gun) because you can get it in and out of the vehicle quickly and easily. Also, I store it in a standard tennis racquet case and keep it in the front passenger area and nobody knows that there's a BEAST of a weapon there. This weapon is also small enough to fit in a bugout bag so it is perfect for a SHTF gun too. The fit and finish of this weapon just HAS to be seen. There are a couple FAINT rub marks here or there but over all it's a clean, SOLID running weapon that can have a lot of possibilties. I currently have it set up to be similar to a Navy SEAL MK18 Mod 0 (but with a MUCH better rail system than the Knight's RAS) and this gun can easily and legally be turned into an amazing SBR if you get an NFA tax stamp for it and slap a stock on it. But, use it as a pistol while you wait for the stamp to come back.
WILL TRADE FOR:

*****NOTE*****: Not interested in selling at this particular time. I don't need the cash, I'd rather fish for a new toy or two. Besides, my wife will just suck the cash up anyway and then I get no new toys. 

Anyway, like I said, I'm looking for trades and I'm open to hearing what you have but please read the list because it'll give you a better idea of what I'm most interested in. 

First and foremost: I'm not currently interested in any shotguns of any kind, nor am I interested in any .40 cal weapons. I've simplified my ammo needs by sticking with ONLY 9mm and 5.56 but I'd be open to the idea of a .45 cal pistol if you have something sexy. 

I can take partial trades + cash or you can trade me two things or whatever and for something really cool, I can even add cash but I'd be most interested in the following but when reading the list please realize that when I say ""Glock 26"" I don't mean that I'd trade this gun for a $450 Glock 26; I mean I'd take a Glock 26 PLUS cash or a Glock 26 PLUS a plate carrier or plus a Glock 19 or something like that, just as long as it gets close to the trade value of around $1,300.00 I say this because there's going to be people who offer me a KelTec .380 and an Atari 6400 for this gun and I'll just have to ignore them.

From 1908 until 1962, Sears, Roebuck & Company sold a wide variety of sporting goods and recreational equipment, including bicycles, golf clubs, rifles, shotguns, and revolvers under the brand name ""J. C. Higgins."" These products were well made and were popular with the company's historical core of rural and working-class consumers.

Like many other Sears products, the Sears firearms were originally made by major firearm manufacturers. The Model 20 was produced by High Standard Arms, as was the Model 88 revolver.

The J.C. Higgins brand for Sears sporting goods was replaced with the Ted Williams brand. Many of the more durable J.C. Higgins products are still available as second hand items.

The brand name, J. C. Higgins, was based on a real person, John Higgins who was a Sears employee. He moved from his birth country of Ireland to the United States in his late teens and began working for Sears in 1898. He spent his entire working career with Sears and was Vice President for the company for a period of time. He was actually born with no middle name but the Sears Co. presented the idea of labeling their sporting good line with his name and saw it more presentable labeling the brand as J.C Higgins. He worked with the company until his retirement as head bookkeeper in 1930. Higgins died in 1950. His expertise in sporting goods or sports is unknown"

I'm leaving the country for work soon so my guns, amongst everything else I own, have to go! Here you'll see my service gun, it's well used and well cared for. I've put about 5,000 rounds through it and I've cleaned it after every range visit. There's some light wear on the brush finish but the internals are very clean and oiled to perfection. My experience with this gun is mostly positive. The ammo capacity is wonderful at 17+1 and it hardly ever jams. I recall only getting a stovepipe jam about two or three times which is probably due to my lose in grip strength after extended firing sessions. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the engraved grip on the slide is a little sharp. After a couple dozen times racking it your fingers will probably feel a little sore. It retails for $529 brand new so I'm putting the price at $280 FIRM. Please feel free to contact me with any questions!

Purchase this week and I'll add an ammo case with a couple hundred rounds of ammo for FREE!

https://danieldefense.com/rail-systems/omega-rail/omega-rail-7-0-carbine.html

I will sell rifle with or without parts installed. Just let me know.

The history of this rifle is that the rifle was purchased brand new from CDNN sports out of TX by me. No steel cased ammo has ever been shot through this rifle. 99% of ammo shot has been my own personal handloads with brass cases which were mild 223 pressures. Round count is slightly under 1000. No jams or failures of any kind. Rifle has been cleaned after every outing. Rifle is in near perfect condition. Has been stored in a hard case when not in use. Rifle has not been beat on at all.

I am asking a price of $850 for the rifle. Sights are $250 extra, & a additional $180 if you would like to also buy the rail & it will already be installed for you. I feel this is a very fair price for a rifle kept in this quality condition with such a low round count. Rifle priced at $850 + $250 for sights = $1,100. If you also add the rail with the reduced price, this is over $100 in savings than buying all this equipment yourself & you will still have to spend time installing & setting up a rail & sights. I will even throw in a free front sight adjustment tool with the rifle. If there are any other questions you have on the rifle, please just e-mail & I will let you know. If you want to talk, e-mail for a phone # to discuss anything serious. Sorry no trades, Money only. Located in Charleston area of SC. 

I will sell to out of state buyers, shipping at the buyers expense. I can ship through my FFL to yours. Payment can be made (if out of state) by USPS money order, I urge to send via certified mail with signature requirement, & even insurance. I will not use paypal, don't ask.

I do have mags available separately if you would like to also buy some of those as well. I will throw in one 30 round GI mag for free with rifle purchase (if your area allows it). Any other mags can be discussed separate of the rifle price. If buying out of state, please know your local laws, I will not ship High-Cap mags to non-approriate areas. Thanks!"

Here's my third gun for sale. Since I'm leaving the country in two weeks I have to sell pretty much all my possessions! Here is my snubby fitted with black pearl handles. Super flashy! it's been my daily carry gun for the last 5 years. I'm not gonna lie, this gun is not something you want to shoot at the range for more than a few rounds to get a feel for it. The kick of a .38 special from a small aluminum wheelie gun will leave your hand aching! Otherwise it shoots true enough for a 2"" barrel and conceals so well you'll forget your wearing it. Of course I'm from Virginia so maybe conceal carry is a stupid idea in Maryland. Haha
