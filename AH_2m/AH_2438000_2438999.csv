This enables you to mount a scope or red dot since it is not drilled and tapped. It uses the rear sight dovetail. I will included the rear sight if you ever want to use the open sights again. I will also include a hard case. Comes with one magazine.

I tried to show all the flaws in the picture. Just cosmetic but is a great shooter. Price is firm, and Im not really looking to trade. Thanks for looking."

It has a 16"" barrel with a 6-position collapsable stock, a flat top (including gas block), a backup magpul MBUS sight in the rear and generic sight tower in front.  It weights just under 6 pounds and is PHENOMENALLY light.  It also comes with the original American Tactical mag and three extra (unused) 30-round pmags.  
I can attest to the durability of the rifle, as they did a gun show and had a 15,000 round torture test done that was flawless. There will be no sales to any parties whom would otherwise be banned by a dealer (no felons, no DV misdameanors, no persons with restraining orders, no drug addictions, etc.).

This is an M96/38 from the very desirable Oberndorfer facility.  Has the 24 inch barrel instead of the nice, but more unwieldy 29 inch barrels in the M96's.  Following parts are numbers matching: Butt plate, receiver, all bolt and safety parts, front barrel band.  Rear barrel band is not matching, not unusual but I mention it for accuracy sake.  Has a cleaning rod and a sling as you see pictured.

If you know Swedish Mausers, you know how accurate they are, I regularly shoot less than a 3 inch group at 200 yards...with the iron sights no less.  And, candidly, the rifle is more accurate than my aging eyes are...

Barrel condition based on the stock disk, is a ""0"" meaning it was considered as new on the way past the Swedish armorers, a notoriously fussy and quality minded group.  Nominal bore size is 6.51, just what you'd like for this caliber.  In short, nothing not to like about this classic.  And I'm not like the guy asking $500 each for his Swedes, they might be worth that but this isn't the place to go for full retail, now is it???

I live in the northwest burbs of Milwaukee, willing to drive some, not forever, to help this happen.

Cash sale, face to face, not interested in any trades at this time.  If you want to purchase and have it shipped I'll need a usps money order, shipping adds $23 to the price, I need a copy of your ffl's license to ship to, etc., etc., etc."

Really limited run from Liberty Civil Defense. Apparently they had some dirty primer seating dies in their machines for a short run of their 60gr +P .40 S&W ammunition, causing a slight mark (hardly noticeable to the naked eye in 90% of the run) around the primer. This blemish causes no defect in the functionality of the round. These rounds have been thoroughly tested.

This would be a great rifle to teach someone how to shoot,plus it will be easier on your .22 ammo supply.

This was made by Winchester for Sears and it is the same as the Winchester model 121, with minor differences in the stock. The Winchesters were made from 1967 to 1971 so I would imagine the Sears model 1 was made during the same time frame.

This is a .25 cal air rifle. I have added a very nice scope that has the option of lighting the crosshairs green or red. Has a laser attached to the scope for quick sight ins. Has two extra rails under the gun. One with a bipod and one with nothing on it that is at the end of the air service port under the barrel. I had a custom shroud made that holds 6 extra baffles (stock and the one I made are in the pic, you can see the diffrence in length). I have also added an internal part that decreases the sound. This thing sounds like a .22 rifle. But you put the extended shroud and baffles on. It sounds like a empty coke can being dropped from waist height. This gun can be shot out your bedroom window, crack the skull of a coon and never wake a soul. True ""urban"" rifle if you like taking out stuff but live close to town. No joke, a red rider makes more noise then this thing. A picture of some types of rounds I have are included next to a 9mm bullet. Comes with an air take. Can service the rifle about 40 times and each service gives about 20 shots. Comes with soft case. Magazine holds 8 pellets and this thing is a bolt action air rifle. Will consider trades but would prefer to sell. Check out www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUEwxg32s6Y. This is a video of a guy using the same gun I have but stock kill a hog!

Nine is its easy to use massive screw adjustable rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation. Other, higher priced, pistols do not offer this kind of flexibility. The high visibility front sight is another great feature which adds to a highly effective sight pattern.

Warranty:
A warranty. What else about a product says as much about how highly a maker values their own work? It’s a mark of integrity, an assurance that the person who built it believes in it enough to stand behind it. Lawyers, legalese and fine print have no place in it. And we feel ours both stands on its own and speaks for itself.
“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE15 rifle has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one
of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”
That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe.

The 212 is the field version, for sports use but also popular in Europe for intelligence agency use.  Accuracy is comparable to the 208.  As accurate as the 208 (and better than any USA handgun) at 25 yards, with a little fall-off at 50-75 yards due to the barrel length but less first shot inaccuracy than the 208.   Gun accuracy is at the 0.2MOA level.  The accuracy and handling of these guns is far superior to the best S&W41 or CT-based High Standard Victors.

Rear sights are very low profile, adjustable for windage only.  Suitable (and in Europe, used for) concealed carry.  Elevation-adjustable low-profile rear sight can be mounted, by skilled gunsmiths.

Supplied with the 50 gram barrel weight.  A scope rail that also can hold dot or doctor sights can be attached to the weight dovetail.

Adjustable trigger pull, from about 5 oz to 3 lbs.  

Standard velocity ammunition only.  Provided with one magazine, up to 3 additional available.

All federal and state laws observed for sale or transfer.  No sales considered that do not follow those laws strictly, including for law enforcement officer sales.

Mfr listed as Sig Sauer, but it actually is made by Hammerli - SIG before Sauer acquired the SIG handgun production, later sold to Blaser.

The original design probably was by Reising (USA) further developed by Walther (Germany), with the patents purchased by Hammerli after WWII and vastly improved by them, with further improvements in the trigger by SIG in the 1970s."

Not NIB rifle, was bought with 3 others in July this year and it has been shot maybe 200 rounds through the bore. I tried it out with the Iron Sights and it did well, considering it was my first attempt at shooting peep sights. It was my plan to keep one Kimber for glass and one for iron, but decided after shooting the iron that I preferred using a scope. In addition to this reason, I just bought a Winchester 52D and with a H&R Model 12 I dont need two kimbers. I have sold two of these in the last month and half for $700.

Rifle includes everything that came with it from CMP (Rifle, Front and Rear sights, authentication letter, inspection certificate, packing box and shipping box)

(This is not a Star Grade rifle)

On inspection, this rifle has all the parts and the rifle itself. Considering the way these were handled in the 90’s under inventory control.  This rifle I am selling is in good condition with slight bumps and indentions done I assume during inventory and being moved around on the racks at CMP that are easily taken out with wet towel and hot iron. I was going to take out the bumps, but realized to do it properly I need to strip the rifle of its finish and then steam out the bumps and refinish. Which I did not want to do at this time. 

Bolt and Rifle serial number match USGM010xxx.

I purchased several of these rifles in August and the first one I used was a good shooter USGM001xxx, so I am going to sell the rest of them. 

All I have done to my personal shooter is trigger adjustment, Recrown barrel, and lap the bore. These are very good shooters for the money. If you dont know of the rifle you can read about them on Rimfire Central Forums or all over the internet.

I will transfer the rifles at this point, one of three ways. 
I will ship to your FFL dealer if they will receive from an individual for actual shipping cost. If not then I will have the rifle shipped through my local FFL dealer. The fee depends on how much he charges me. 
I can legally ship person to person using USPS within the state of Florida ONLY.  Buyer is responsible for all shipping cost. Cost within the state is $34 insured and priority 2nd Day.
Or I will do a FTF transfer in Sebastian, Florida.
***********************************************************
Some information in regards to the Kimber Model 82 Government Rifle:
http://www.odcmp.com/Sales/kimber82desc.htm

**************Added note: The factory trigger with no modifications can be adjusted to as low as 13oz. If you have a gunsmith disassemble, add the available replacement trigger spring and hone and polish both the trigger foot and sear. The trigger can go down as far as 7oz I believe. The one I shoot is 10oz with replacement trigger spring. The receiver is dovetailed to accept a 11mm ring set scope*****************

I bought most items from joeboboutfitters, midwayusa, and the bolt carrier group at a gun show at GRB Houston

It was an Eco build. I didn't go with the cheapest parts just the most price conscience parts. I've brought it to the range 4 times and I kid you not it did not fail once. My dads Bushmaster had all sorts of problems and mine-none. So that being said we can certainly hit the range and plow though a hundred rounds but you have to have money in hand.

The reason I'm selling is because I've got my eye on a Oneida Eagle bow.
