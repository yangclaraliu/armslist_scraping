It currently has Crimson Trace laser grips on it and I do not have the original grips. Also the laser is touchy and sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. They've always been like that I've just never taken the time to send them in to Crimson Trace and have them fixed. Surprisingly for as small and light as this revolver is there isn't much recoil.

The No. 2 Mk 1 was born when British authorities began searching for a double-action revolver with less weight and recoil than the Webley they'd been using, that could be quickly mastered by a minimally-trained soldier and gave him a good probability of hitting an enemy with the first shot at extremely close ranges. The .38-200 round was created by combining a .38 S&W catridge with a 200 grain bullet. By using such a long, heavy, round-nosed lead bullet in a .38 caliber cartridge, it was found that the bullet, being minimally stabilized for its weight and caliber, tended to tumble longitudinally when striking an object, theoretically increasing wounding and stopping ability of human targets at short ranges. This double-action-only revolver features a fixed blade front sight with a rear groove, and a saddle ring. Its metal is in fair condition and its bore is in good condition.

Includes: 2 boxes of 38S&W (50 each) and a very nice basket weave leather holster.
$295.  This is an awesome deal on this pistol plus you get ammo and a holster!

Would consider partial trade for 22LR ammo (no junk)

Similar pistols like this have been listed for sale on GM & Cabela's for $500-$600 (have copies of ads) for just the pistol.

If you ever watched Lawrence of Arabia, he carried a gun similar to this.  He was a British Officer.  No collection is complete without an Enfield.  Or shoot for fun.

This is what CZ has to say about the gun on their site. 


CZ-USA is pleased to announce the release of the CZ 2075 RAMI P.

The new CZ 2075 RAMI P replaces the aluminum alloy frame of the original
RAMI with one of polymer, and lightens the slide to make the new RAMI P
even more carry friendly.  The new model also adds more aggressive slide
serrations and adjustable sights. The number of internal parts has also
been decreased contributing to the reduction in weight and cost without a
reduction in reliability.

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ
75 line of pistols.

The trigger mechanism operates in selective DA and SA mode depending on
the shooter's preferences.  Several safety devices are used including a
firing pin block and a manual safety.  Incorporating the CZ double-stack
magazine design, the little RAMI accommodates 10 rounds of 9mm plus 1 in the
chamber.

With a 3"" barrel, and unloaded weight of less than 23.5 ounces, the
polymer frame RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

The Suggested retail price for the CZ 2075 RAMI P 9mm is $510.00"

The gun is like new in box.   This is the Israeli made MKXIX. The gun appears to be unfired but I am not the original owner so I can not testify that it has never been fired.  I have not fired it.

Gun is capable of firing multi calibers.  Gun comes with everything it came with from the factory in the factory custom cut-out box.  All barrels are the 6"" length.  Gun includes the following:

1) The Desert Eagle Gun with the 50 AE Barrel currently mounted on it

2) A 44 Mag barrel which easily switches out with the 50 to shoot 44 mag.  The 50 AE and 44 Mag each use the same bolt so it is very easy to shoot both quickly...Just switch the barrel and mag.

3) One 44 Mag Desert Eagle Magazine

4) One 50 AE Desert Eagle Magazine.

5) One 357 6"" barrel.  This will switch into the gun but in order to shoot the 357 you need to get a new bolt and magazine.  However the barrel is the most expensive component.  The barrel alone cost $400 on the DE Website.  Because this was bought separately, this barrel does appear to be used but is still in good shape with a few scuff marks.

6) 3 boxes of 50 AE Ammo to go with the gun. 

Price for the entire set is $1700.  If you were to buy all of this stuff separately from DE it would cost well over $2500.

May trade for Colt Handguns (Especially SAA's) or a nice over under.  Most other trades will have to be in my favor as I would really prefer cash.  I'm NOT interested in any Century built AK47's or WASR's."

I'm not an FFL and don't want to list there due to paranoia, I guess, with maybe violating the BATF laws. So if anyone is interested, let me know. I'm not a wheeler dealer. This is my first Armslist item, but I have purchased a couple of times from local folks and its all been good. I have a rough idea what they have been selling for, but I want to trade. The rifle has been shot, by me a few times, but I like my Winchester better. The gun is in better than average shape, I don't know how to evaluate. Its not collector/unused/excellent shape, but I'd say very good. 90%+ blue, shoots fine. Does not like to cycle flat nose bullets. It likes and feeds FMJ, or round nose just fine."

This offer is for a limited time only and due in part because I have an opportunity to buy something that I want…but don’t need…and the deal I made with my wife is to sell one of my guns to purchase this item or toy. Again, I do not need this item, but, I want it…so my want is your gain. Read more…this is from the PTR91 website:

If you are interested in buying this rifle and are willing to come to Mobile, AL, or meet somewhere relatively close then send me an e-mail, NO TRADES, after all, re-read what I wrote as to why I am selling the rifle.

The rifle will be available on Monday and will be removed NLT Friday because the toy I want will be gone by then, more than likely.

Helps counteract the painful effects of recoil using mercury, one of the heaviest, densest, liquid elements. Compact, permanently-sealed, steel case is made from bar stock; the only moving part is the liquid mercury so there’s no wear, no chance of leaks. Mercury's viscosity varies only 1% from 0° F. to 90° F. which means the recoil-fighting performance is consistent in almost all weather conditions.

Product Information, Features, Specifications:

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. 
Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

This gun is very accurate. I had it dialed in out to about 400M. I am a new shooter, so this was as far as I pushed it during the warmer months because it was a challenge enough for me at that range.

This scope was designed by Jim Leatherwood, the famous designer/creator of the ART I and ART II sniper scopes used in Southeast Asia to enable a sniper with only moderate training to accurately shoot out to 800 meters without running through all the calculations and compensations to manually adjust for the ballsitics of the load being fired. Jim Leatherwood created the ART / MPC after the ART II, taking the knowledge learned with the military applications of his Auto-Ranging-Sniper scopes, and applying them in the design and productions of an Auto-Ranging scope for non-warfare use.
This particular ART / MPC has a low serial number (008775) and is complete with the mounting/ranging ""saddle"" that fits on Weaver and similar one-piece bases. This scope was manufactured under contract by Weaver Scope Company.
The ART / MPC is calibrated to automatically compensate for load trajectories over ranges from 200 to 600 meters. Unlike the ART I and ART II, which were calibrated for a single caliber and load, the manual for the ART / MPC contains settings for over 100 calibers / loads, ranging from the .17 Remington to the .375 H&H Magnum. 

Condition is new old stock! It comes with an inspection receipt, original box and copy of ART MPC manual VAL AT $1,200.00"

Depending on the price (not a $900 high end trap gun) a double barrel that fits the same specs with 2 triggers (internal or external hammers are fine) could work.  Ideally if it's a fixed choke it would be modified but that is not a deal maker. Also I would prefer to deal with a private party (I'm legal and will sign a bill of sale) but could potentially go through an FFL.

It could be a Savage/ Stevens, Winchester, Remington or H&R, etc. As to condition I'm looking for a serviceable firearm but if it's cosmetically rough that is not a deal maker. Price would be dependent on the specifics of the gun and it's condition. 

I am in the DeRidder/ Leesville area. Depending on the deal I could potentially do some driving.
