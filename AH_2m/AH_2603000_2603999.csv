And to Eric...I put my faith in you, against my better judgment, and you proved to me that you are a shady, lying, piece of shit who only wasted my time and took away more of my faith in humanity.  But I take comfort in the fact that shitheads like you will be back in prison soon.


For Sale is a Taurus PT145 Millennium PRO .45 A.C.P. Compact Pistol.  This gun is in excellent shape.  I am the original owner (I still have the receipt), and I have put less than 100 rounds through it.  This has been my carry gun for a while, but there are only minimal holster marks.  It really is in like new shape.  It's a good size for carry, since it has a 3.3 inch barrel and it is a lightweight polymer piece.  I just got a Para Ordinance 1911 Expert Carry, which is now my new carry gun, so I want to sell this one.

This comes with all the original gear, including the hard case, 2 10 round magazines, owner's manual and paperwork.

I am serious about selling, so here's my ROCK BOTTOM PRICE:  $320 cash only face to face in my area.  No trades and no haggling, please.

Serious buyers send me an email with a phone number, and I will call you to set up a time that we can meet in the Bremerton/Silverdale area.  Any inquiries without a phone number will be deleted.  I am sorry to the real buyers, but I have already dealt with too many flakes and shady characters on this site."

This gun can be carried cocked and locked like a 1911, or it can be carried with the hammer down like a traditional DA/SA. I have almost $700 in this gun after tax, I'm asking $500 firm. You won't find a better shooter for this price, After I installed the black rear/fiber optic front I was shooting 1'' groups offhand at 15 yards, this gun is a tackdriver. I love the gun, I just want the ability to mount a light which is why I'm getting the SP-01. This gun would make a great base gun for IDPA or USPSA, a carry gun, or just as a range gun.

We do not certify our casings as ""once-fired"". We collect our brass from several public ranges, sort it, clean it, inspect it, and sell it. We visually inspect each case for defects as our experience tell us. We feel certain 95% or more of these casings are ""once fired"" but we did not buy, shoot or were present when the new ammo was fired. To represent them as such would not be the right thing to do.

The fraudulent seller claims the unit is serial #23228, has only been fired once, includes a Colt 20 round magazine and a Kay Industries 30 round magazine.  Price was $930.00.  The ad includes photos which were stolen from the actual item which was sold back in Oct., 2013.  The photos show a rifle on a wooden block.

I became suspicious when she, (Sherri Bringard), would not supply me a phone number or address.  And, she requested I send her brother, (in another state), payment as he ""really needed the money"".  I immediately googled her name and learned she had tried this scam advertisement in October, 2013.

I am contacting the ATF and the local police department in Delta, Utah where it appears the woman is located.

I looked for a means to contact this website, for the purpose of informing them of this issue, however, I was unable to locate such.  I hope a moderator will make any necessary adjustments to my post."

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Made in the same factory that produced top quality rifles for former Yugoslavia like the M70B1 and M70AB2, our newly manufactured PAP rifles
are the semi-auto version of the famous military series M70 rifles. These beauties are the latest imports from the world famous Zastava factory.

This one is the HI-CAP PAP Classic and features a full teak wood stock matching fore end wood and an ergonomic pistol grip.
It also features a hammer forged barrel, specialized safety lever, and factory buttpad.

Unlike the first batch of imports this new second generation rifle also has a built in side rail mount for true hold accuracy when mounting a scope.
Rifle features a Beautiful Teakwood Stockand forearm and ergonomically shaped molded and textured pistol grip.

Comes complete with Two Original Yugo 30 round steel mags.....

Barrel: 16.25"" with a 1:10 twist, Overall: 36.25"", Weight: 7.7 lbs. Condition: New.

Yugo AK rifles are unique in the industry in that they have a bolt hold open capability and when used with original Yugo mags will lock the bolt
back after the last shot is fired. Rifle will of course function properly with any AK mag but only the Yugo mag facilitates the bolt hold open.

Rifle also features an exclusive safety lever design that also acts as a bolt lock/hold open for ultimate safety and lightning fast chambering.

Rifle comes complete with 2-30 round mags and cleaning rod.

Mags are surplus and cosmetic condition on the mags included with the rifle may vary.

Legally accepts all high cap mags and drums regardless of country of origin.

Receivers are stamped but slightly heavier than typical stamped receivers. These are built like tanks....

If you can only have one AK in your Arsenal let me suggest the N-PAP Gen II.

The Yugo AK's are regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world and these are no exception.

Extremely well made with very tight tolerances - These rifles will feed, function and fire flawlessly for thousands and thousands of rounds.

I bought an Octagon Barrel and was going to have it put on but I'm not a collector and really don't care about such nonsense.

Others have said about this make/model:
-""Shoots accurately out to about 40 yards. An inexpensive, good, first concealed-carry weapon, they fit nicely in the optional Cobra holster. I would buy again, and at that price point it's a good weapon.
-""No jams even using wolf ammo""
-""This is a very good and reliable little gun. No problems whatsoever with Federal or PMC ammo or Aguila hollow points. This gun has a lifetime warranty, and is USA made.""
-""It shoots very accurately and will easily shoot on target from 30 yards, plus it handles very smoothly, especially after the break in period. The trigger pull is so soft, a child could fire it with ease, but the safety/fire switch is quite rough. The barrel keeps very cool and doesn't have much recoil, which helps to maintain accuracy."""

This is the model with the rail on the frame. I am offering it in a package with a tactical holster, 2 mags, 1 extended aftermarket mag, and custom stainless recoil rod and springs. (No factory box/case)

The Gun: About a few hundred rounds have been in it but decided I want a .45 instead. Nothing wrong with this pistol, looks like new. Kept clean and greased for that steel on steel smooth action. Sights appear to be removable, and the rail allows mounting lights or lasers. Fully stock except for the recoil rod and spring. The 92A1 has a captured rod assembly, and its plastic. I got a steel replacement which is installed already, and a second one, but it will ship with the original. Gun is in excellent condition. 


The Holster: The holster is a Blackhawk tactical holster with a button snap locking mechanism and a mag holder. It has a plastic ruler that is used to adjust the straps to adjust the length of the locking  mechanism.

The Mags: The gun comes with two 17round magazines and a 30round magazine. The 17round mags are factory, and are perfectly fine. The 30round mag is aftermarket (some unknown brand) Made of kinda cheap stamped steel but loading 5 snap caps and slapping it in, it ejected the rounds fine.

The Rods: The It comes with two stainless steel captive guide rods (one is already installed) plus the original plastic captive guid rod. The parts are made and sold by Fire Dragon as a custom aftermarket part with great reviews. Lifetime warranty from Fire Dragon. Functions flawlessly with the installed rod.

AI stocked it with a super fancy piece of walnut and installed there all steel chassis system. The stock has amazing figure and fiddle running the complete length of the blank. It was checkered with flure de lure by a lady who is a master engraver with Colt Firearms. She also hand engraved the floor plate.

Do your research on this caliber and the company that built the rifle before you offer or ask stupid questions. Ill be happy to talk with you once you know what your talking about. Thanks for looking.  Well over 4000 invested.

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. Henry selected the Golden Boy as the canvas for the application of fine hand engraving which elevates an already beautiful rifle into a work of art. The result represents the true marriage of state of the art gunsmithing with the centuries old craft of engraving.

The stock has hand/finger reliefs carved in it and was told the mans father had it done when the gun was setup originally for a sheriff dept. sniper rifle by the mans father.  Can email or text more pics if needed. Would make a great deer rifle. Eddy Stone"

The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

Enhanced grip texture, Enhanced sight picture and Wilson Combat®’s legendary attention to detail add up to a unique new offering destined to be a top choice of working operators everywhere. The new bi-directional, X-Tac frontstrap and slide treatment offer enhanced grip and improved durability over traditional checkering in severe and hard-use environments. Scientifically designed to work with dry or wet hands, with or without tactical gloves, the X-Tac pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gunhandling without the coarse, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-Tac tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments. The X-Tac proudly wears our newest rear sight, the Wilson Combat® 1911 Battlesight. This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture."

This sight has been a gem.  After returning from the Middle East, I sent the optics in to Trijicon, not because of any problems, but because I wanted it to have a complete inside/out thorough cleaning for any possible sand or contaminates.  Trijicon replaces all seals and gaskets, replaces all gases and even calibrated the thing.  They returned it to me within 2 weeks and didn't charge me a dime.  Trijicon REALLY stands behind their gear.  This optics set-up alone would cost you over $2,200.00 retail.
I'm including the optics pelican case, LensPen, neoprene rifle top optics cover, adjustment tool and all manuals.

I am having and have had ZERO problems this this set-up, it is tight to be sure and ready for the range, or wherever you decide to take it.  I've decided to sell my system here and either take on a complete ass to elbows build of a new rifle, or trade for another high-end set up that someone else put together or something else interesting that someone may have to offer-"

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models"
