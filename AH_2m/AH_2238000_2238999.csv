I bought this set up 4 months ago and bought the NB BCG seperately. The BCG is not included. It will work on any M4 lower so if you have an AR-15 you already have a BCG that will work perfectly with this upper, just pop the 2 pins and remove your 223/5.56 upper and pin this upper on and drop your BCG in and you are ready to go. I am selling this upper with charging handle for $500.00 so if you are aware of prices related to this item you know this is a steal and way less than i have invested in it. I have only shot one box of 20 rounds thru it so it is virtually new. Text me at NINE EIGHT FIVE 502 EIGHT THREE FOUR SEVEN to set up face to face sale or you can email me at kevinwflowers@aol.com but I won't check emails until tonight."

I also have included a red dot sight and a factory 110 round drum.

I have never shot it, and by the looks of it and the feel of the trigger (very crisp with almost no trigger play) it appears that it was never used for battle. 

There is aging marks, scuff marks and little marks here and there, but no battle wear. Can that be possible? The wood is in near perfect condition and the barrel rifling looks like it came off of the factory line a few days ago. 

All numbers match from bolt, to stock and other parts. WOW.. It came with some Cosmoline here and there but it's been cleaned for the most part. You might find a little miniscule amounts here and there. 

The Bolt has been completely cleaned of most cosmoline but you might want to do a more thorough job. 

For a gun that is over 70 years old? It's in great shape.

Honda motor 5.5 hp OHC, runs great, will split anything you put in it and then some. EPA sticker says it was compliant with the 2006 regs., so it was made some time after 2006, not sure of age. Works in vertical and horizontal mode. I bought it used in 2010 and have split a considerable amount of wood with it, but no longer need it since I have cut and split all the trees I needed cut down on my property. Price is 700.00 obo as this sells new now days for 1399.00 from Lowes. 

Edit: If this isn't the first time you have seen my ad, you may notice a price increase. This is due to some of the folks that just have to try to negotiate a lower price, by hundreds of dollars, for a product that is already priced lower than it should be. This is a good wood splitter, if you are looking for one that barely works, let me know, I know where I can get a 250.00 wood splitter for you. That being said, I don't need 700.00 for this wood splitter, feel free to make an offer on it, but don't waste my time. I apologize for having to word my ad like this, but it looks like being nice won't get me anywhere."

Product Details:
This defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

These are very highly thought of in the 3-Gun crowd. I bought two but decided to use only one in 5.56 and ordered another in 300BLK so this one is a spare. I have one additional 4 inch rail to include. Zero rounds outside of Lancer Systems factory. The barrel has a 1/7 twist and mid-length gas system. This also comes complete with the charging handle and BCG along with Lancer's superb rifle length carbon fiber handguard. There are slots on 7 of the eight sides of this handguard so that 2 or 4 inch rails can be placed in any position necessary to accommodate your needs. No need to install angled BUIS sights as you can install rails at that position and install the sights you already own. There is also a 2 inch rail permanently installed in the 12 o'clock position for a front sight. 

The Lancer Lightweight Carbon-Fiber Handguard (LCH) is a custom profiled free float handguard system designed for 5.56mm cal AR type rifles and 7.62 AR type rifles.

Applying our experience in carbon-fiber product design and lightweight component development we’ve created a robust free float handguard that weighs less than comparable aluminum handguard systems without sacrificing rigidity or impact strength. Available in carbine, mid-length, rifle length and extra long (15”), the Lancer Lightweight Carbon-Fiber Handguard can be applied to a variety of rifle configurations and used in many different applications. 

•Free Float Design ensures that the barrel is not effected by pressure on the handguard eliminating point of impact devations.
•Low profile, octagon shaped carbon-fiber tube, is as rigid and impact resistant as lightweight aluminum free float tube designs
•Available with or without cooling slots
•Cooling slots will accept accessory rail hardware
•5.56 cal handguards are available with or without a picatinny rail at 12 o’clock.
•Attachment points for quick-detach sling swivels at 3 and 9 o’clock"

I simply have more than I really need now so I thought I'd see if anyone wants to pick up a significant quantity of .22 before the Florida shooting season is in full swing.

This is classified by BATFE as a pistol.

It fires the super-hot (1900 fps / 800-900 Ftlbs energy), and super cheap (~35 cents per round) 7.62x25 tokarev round. You can buy this round at gun shows or online by the hundreds in surplus soviet tins.

Also comes with a full parts kit for any future repairs and parts replacements.


Original Polish PPS-43C in a semi-auto version. 7.62x25 caliber, considered a pistol due to overall length. The PPS-43C was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. These are extremely reliable. This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland."

Original Polish PPS-43C in a semi-auto version. 7.62x25 caliber, considered a pistol due to overall length. The PPS-43C was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position. These are extremely reliable. This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland."

 I had this pistol to the range once and fired a box of 50 just to make sure everything was kosher, and put it back in the safe.  If you like the feel of a .40 caliber but don't like how snappy it is, the .357 Sig will likely be right up your alley.  Has almost as much knock down power as a .45 ACP without the kick or the boom.  

I have the original hard side box from Sig Sauer, 2 12-round magazines, and about 300+ rounds of quality Speer Lawman .357 Sig ammo I might include for the right offer.  Here's a link to some additional info on the pistol from the same place I bought it from a few months back:

The gun has the factory Hogue overmolded stock in ghost green and a super short 16"" bull barrel and Remington's awesome x mark pro user adjustable trigger. This gun is a tack driver I had a Nikon 4.5-14 scope on top and had it shooting 1'2"" groups at 100 yards it's an amazing gun I'm only selling it because I need to take care of other financial obligations at the moment . New retail on this rifle today is $759.99 the Levang $69.99 the Leupold base & ring set about $50.00 so that puts this package at a new list price right around $880.00 PLUS THE SALES TAX!!!!   When you factor that in the final price for this at Cabela's or Gander Mountain would be about $940.00 mine's been fired 8 times that's as close to new as you can get without paying that ""new"" price. With the muzzle brake on it this would make the PERFECT deer gun for the wife or kids because it has near ZERO felt recoil and all you need to do to have it ready to hunt come November here is mount your own scope and its ready to go or if your a varmint hunter it makes an awesome blind gun because of it's short length this thing is super maneuverable. Anyway if your in the market for a .223 Tack Driver here it is for about $200.00 off New Retail for a gun you cant tell has ever been fired. You won't be dissapointed Guys.... (Scope Not Included )"

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We are proud to offer Cerakoting, DuraCoating, and, Hydocoating done by our veteran Gunsmiths with low turnaround times! Most Cerakote, Duracote, and Hydocoating projects have a 14-21 day turn around period at this time (October of 2013).

Check out examples of our recent cerakoting and dipping work at http://wecleanguns.com/refinish.html

Cerakote™ has a unique ceramic structure that is said to be the top finish in the industry. The unique formulation used for Cerakote™ Firearm Coatings enhances a number of physical performance properties. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote™ products remain at the forefront of the firearm Refinishing/Coating market. DuraCoat is a two part chemical coating. Unlike other firearm finishes, DuraCoat was created specifically for firearms.

DuraCoat is permanent. With normal use, a firearm finished with DuraCoat will last several lifetimes. DuraCoat's combination of elasticity and hardness creates a finish impervious to impact, scratching and the elements. Some users say DuraCoat displays some lubricating qualities, but this phenomenon was never intended when DuraCoat was created. Since then DuraCoat has been blended to incorporate the lubricating properties desired by todays' shooters.

DuraCoat AND Cerakote are well suited for salty environments.  

We are proud to offer both Cerakoting AND DuraCoating by our veteran Gunsmiths with a low turn around time! Most projects at this time have a 14-21 day turn around period.

The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.
