Originally bought as a project gun but now have no more money for the project.

- Walnut stock with a few dings/scratches from deer hunting, but nothing that detracts from the look and can't be quickly repaired.
- Comes with GI leather sling, one 10-round mag, one 25 (yes, 25) round mag, and shims for gas system (not installed)
- Installed is an A.R.M.S./Swan scope mount- one of the best and most stable ones on the market (which is why the military uses it).  Note - It does not come with a scope.
- Has about 350 rounds through it.
- Local (MN) only and you will need a case when you pick it up.

Product Information:
The new XPS series of sights from EOTech are the shortest sights from EOTech to date which leaves you with more rail space than other EOTech sights. This smaller sight runs on a single CR123A battery which provides a life of up to 600 hours. Having a shorter sight allows for more room to mount detachable iron sights for backup, or to mount any other accessories you might want. EOTech XPS sights feature an integral mount for use on Picatinny or Weaver-style rails.

Also looking for only FTF in the Metroplex at this point

First up;

S&W M18 w/4"" barrel
This is a shooter not a collector piece.  I think it was refinished before I got it.  I sent it to 10 ring precision for an action job and to have the butt rounded and the butt needs cold blued.  I was planning on refinishing it totally but plans have changed.

Not sure on year but it is pinned and recessed.  It currently has a set of hogues on it that fit it very well

I can cold blue it before you pick it up if this is a issue.

I would rank it between good and very good but like I said I believe it was refinished at some point.

Price - $400.00 cash

Next up

Ruger stainless 22/45 with a 4"" bull barrel

Overall in excellent condition, comes with 1 magazine

Packed with versatile features, the SR22® is lightweight (just 17.5 ounces) and perfect for just about anything - plinking, target shooting and even small game hunting. It is easy to field strip, fun to shoot, and will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition (not just high-velocity ammunition). 

I originally purchased these for training purposes in NRA pistol courses, but health issues arose. I have owned several 22's and the SR22 is my all time favorite. YES, better than the Walther!"

The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode.  The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

SAFETY
Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety

All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

My love and joy. This has been my carry gun for over a year, but gun shows kept enticing me to buy more and I need to consolidate. Love this gun. I have the sights painted in and added coloring to the inscriptions. I can remove the inscription coloring relatively easily, if desired. This comes with two mags (CC short mag and extended mag) and will keep the grip on if purchaser desires it. I have been the sole owner of it and have put a little short of 1000 rounds through it with no failure. It loves all brands of 9mm, it doesn't care - it will do the job set forth to do.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.
Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a 9mm in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Mikhail Kalashnikov, the rifle's designer, still works at this same factory. 

The only Saiga rifles that are legal for the U.S. market are those in sporter configuration which means no pistol grip and they use a low capacity plastic Saiga mag. This Saiga was imported by RWC Group LLC in Tullytown, PA (which is Izhmash's exclusive US importer) and was converted to have a pistol grip and use regular capacity AK mags therefore the reason its much more desirable to own.

 Comes with two 30 round steel mags.  This has only had (2) mags shot through it, a total of 60 rounds.  It's basically brand new. Features include black synthetic stock and forearm, side rail, and black chromed barrel.

This is a rare S&W model 66 .357 with the safety ring lock system. It has a 4 inch barrel. The way this gun works is that it cannot be operated without the user wearing the supplied rings. The action locks up and cannot be rotated or fired until the ring is on your middle finger.

The brand new bullpup-rifle from IWI that's taking the world of modern semi-auto rifles by storm. After more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

Bullpup configuration; short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy

Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles

Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies

Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR® SAR parts

Last round hold open on empty magazine

Walther 2796082 PPQ M2 9mm Navy SD 4.6"" TB 15+1 Black Poly Grip Black Finish

The PPQ M2 Navy is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense
handguns. The styling is elegant and trim with a sculpted grip that meshes
smoothly into the hand. The PPQ M2 has a reversible mag release button and
an ambidextrous slide stop. The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in
conjunction with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. The trigger pull of
5.6 lbs remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no
decocker. The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe
carry. Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does
not protrude from the back of the slide. The polymer frame has
interchangeable backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has
low profile, 3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. The PPQ M2 has
Tenifer-coated slide and 4.6"" threaded barrel.

A short 18 inch for home defense and standard 28 inch for birds and ect. I also have installed a Kicklite Tactical Stock which helps reduce recoil .
Easy-to-install kit turns an ordinary pump shotgun into an easy-to-control tactical or self-defense gun. Adjustable, six-position, AR-style buttstock has a generous rubber recoil pad and built-in spring-loaded recoil suppression system that reduces shoulder battering. Aids shooters of all sizes, skill levels, and body types to shoot more accurately, with faster followup shots. Ergonomic pistol grip and tactical forend with deeply grooved, no-slip surface further enhance control. Includes sling swivel adapter and five-shot shell carrier that mounts on either side of stock (holds 12 gauge shells only). Drop-in installation: just unbolt factory buttstock  and install the KickLite components with the included mounting hardware.
I have original stock also. Everything you need for hunting,playing and protection

LWRC Description. 
The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group and the bolt carrier are coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots."

CZ 91620 CZ P-09 9mm 19rd Blk 4.3"" Poly Grips Blk Finish

Based on the short-recoil, locked-breech design principles of John
Browning's linkless cam locking system, the P-09 Duty represents yet
another evolution of the company's duty pistols that goes back to the CZ
75. Specifically, the Duty line is most closely related to the CZ-75B
models with its added firing-pin block, a passive safety system. Like the
CZ 75, the P-09 can be fired in either single- or double-action modes and
features a frame-mounted decocker installed (the pistol comes with an
ambidextrous manual safety conversion also).
he slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside. Though some
shooters do not care for the reduced surface area with which to manipulate
the slide, this slide-to-frame fit is unusually tight and enables a very
efficient barrel lockup, providing exceptional accuracy. Also includes interchangeable backstraps.

Here's what Sig has to say...

The P239® Tactical is the same pistol that was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 tactical is available in 9mm."

The Remington 788 is an accurate hunting rifle developed by the Remington Arms Company.

The 788 utilizes a single-column detachable magazine holding 4 rounds. A .22 rimfire model was also produced known as the 580, 581, or 582 depending on its method of feed.

A target version was used by the US military[2] as a training rifle and later disposed through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.

Distinguishing design characteristics
The Remington 788 has two distinguishing design features. The first is the rear-lugged bolt. The bolt has nine lugs in three rows of three lugs each. They lock into the receiver behind the magazine well. Due to this design, the bolt handle lifts only 60 degrees on opening giving more clearance for scopes compared to the 90 degrees required for the Model 700 and other two-lug rifles.
The bolt travel is also reduced because of the rear lugs. The locking bolt requires the safety to be in the ""fire"" or ""off"" position in order to rotate the handle and actuate the bolt. Rifles manufactured from 1975 to 1983 have non-locking bolts which can be actuated while the safety is engaged.
The second distinguishing feature is the receiver. It has a smaller ejection port than similar bolt action rifles, and no bolt lug raceways. The single stack magazine design yields a smaller feed opening in the bottom of the receiver compared to rifles using a double stack magazine well.
When machining of these smaller ports is complete there is more steel remaining in the receiver between the ejection port and adjacent feed port, and significantly more steel overall where all receivers have the least strength.
These characteristics combined to make the Remington 788 receiver more rigid and stronger than most, if not all, competing designs, including the Remington 700 which shares the same outside receiver diameter.
A rifle's accuracy tends to increase slightly as the rigidity of the receiver increases, as this slightly reduces barrel deflection during firing. Thus the Remington 788 has the structural foundation to be a very accurate rifle."

Spain was in the process of implementing the CETME assault rifle, but there were not enough of the new assault rifles for issue and training. They did, however, have stockpiles of older Mauser bolt action rifles (1916 and 1943 models). They developed a rifle that not only could be used to arm non-combatant and “Guardia Civil” troops, but also would fill the gap in training purposes until more CETME assault rifles were produced. The Spanish Special Purpose FR7 and FR8 rifles were born. These rifles were designed to shoot the 7.62mm NATO cartridge and have a birdcage flash hider that is designed to fire NATO rifle grenades. Under the barrel there is a hollow tube that looks very similar to a semi-auto rifle's gas assembly. Its function is to hold the bayonet adapter and store cleaning equipment."
