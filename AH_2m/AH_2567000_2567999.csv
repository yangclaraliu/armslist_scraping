45 Super is externally/dimensionally identical to 45 acp or 45 acp+P and is designed to be used in 45 acp semi auto pistols that have been fitted with stronger than normal recoil springs and a shock buffer, plus a couple other modifications. While you can shoot 45 SUPER out of some stock 45 acp+P pistols such as the Glock 21, HK USP or the full sized all steel 1911, you will batter your pistol if you do not have them modified to handle the extra pressure and slide velocity of the 45 Super.


To learn about the modifications your 45 acp pistol needs to reliably and safely fire 45 SUPER, contact Garey Hindman at REDACTED. Garey is the foremost authority on 45 Super modifications/conversions for your 45 acp and Garey performs such conversions for a living.


The below velocities were fired from my Colt Gold Cup Govt. Model (5 inch) that was converted by Garey.

1. Item # 45S185-----------1330 fps (185gr. Jhp)
2. Item # 45S200-----------1235 fps (200gr. Jhp)
3. Item # 45S230-----------1131 fps (230gr. Jhp)
4. Item # 45S230FMJ----1133 fps (230gr. FMJ-FLAT NOSE) 
5. Item # 45S255-----------1090 fps  (HARD CAST-FLAT NOSE)

 As always with Buffalo Bore Ammunition, we use real world firearms to give you real world data and results.

All our 45 Super ammunition is loaded with flash suppressed powders so that if you have to fire in low light (when the criminal element is out) you will not be blinded by your own gun fire at the worst possible moment.


All three of the JHP loads were designed for anti-personel use and for hunting small big game like deer. The two solid bullet loads were designed for breaking large bones like a bears shoulders or skull, but will work for anti-personel use as well if you need to shoot through cover like car doors or stick frame walls."

I have an H&R receiver for sale, 
just the receiver and I can include a new forend, no stock.
If you already have one of those single shots with couple barrels you can make an extra gun with this receiver or build it yoruself.
You can buy the barrel for cheap on ebay or send the receiver to H&R and get whichever barrel you want.

I'd like $75 for the receiver with the forend (wood)
But since is consider a gun it need to go though an FFL.

	Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

The stock has some scuffs as are usual but it has a nice shiny bore and is a very good shooter. $150 OBO for the rifle, ammo still has price tag on it and you can pay what I paid for it. 
 The Lee-Enfield is a Mk 3, also a very good shooter took it out just yesterday and shot a 3 inch 5 shot group at 100 yds. There is a slight crack in the stock that does not effect function and for that I am keeping the price low. I have about 100 rounds of Winchester .303 to go with the rifle. My dad is an Enfeld fanatic and says that while he can not identify all the markings, this rifle has been around and has definitely seen some action, but the bore/rifling are still good and the wood is still nice. The ammo alone is worth about $100. $300 for rifle with all ammo.

Taurus Int'l, PT92AF 9mm in original packaging.
Front LIGHT RAIL and HOGUE rubber grips
Originally came with a standard 10rd mag and a 17rd mag.
$525 cash

Also comes with:
2 MecGar 10rd mags
1 MecGar 15rd mag
1 unknown (Made in Italy?) 15rd mag
3 Blackhawk single mag belt holsters
1 Uncle Mikes double mag holster
1 Uncle Mikes handgun belt holster, left or right.
1 UTG shoulder holster
1 Husky bag that works awesome as a range bag.
(I did some training a couple IPSC matches in the stock class while back so that's why I bought so many extra magazines and whatnot. You could effectively carry 77 rounds on you with this setup.)

I can email these pictures to you if you want better detail.

I like shooting this gun. I find the ""thumb-down"" motion to disengage the safety much more intuitive and natural than the ""thumb-up"" motion of the Berreta 92. The Hogue grips are nice, filling the hand a little better than stock. The light rail is a nice extra also. The ONLY reason I'm selling is because I have finally decided to get some other gear for hunting and need to sell some of what I have to make that happen.

Thanks for looking!"

500,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2567500,For Sale:  Brand new and never used Military Issue Launched Grapnel Hook (LGH),"Near Dover NH, New Hampshire, United States",$ 249,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 15, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a brand new in waterproof case U.S. Army issue ""Launched Grapnel Hook.""  Yes, it's spelled Grapnel.  It comes with several hundred feet of twine and you place it on the muzzle of a 5.56mm AR-15 / M4 and fire either a live M855 ball round or a blank (either a M195 or M200 blank) round.  

The force of the projectile or the gas from the blank shoots the LGH up to 100 meters.  According to the instructions, it can only be shot once with a live ball round, or as many times as you want with a blank round.  A live ball round sends it up to 100M with a 45 deg elevation of the rifle.  A M195 blank round sends it up to 100M and a M200 blank round sends it up to 25 meters.  (The M200 blank is the standard blank round that is used with a BFA for training.)  

I have no idea where you can get M195 blanks, but M200 blanks are easily obtained.  Further, the instructions state that if you fire the hook with a live ball round, you can still fire it later, but only with blanks.  So in other words you can never fire it more than once with live rounds or you run the risk of the hook exploding and causing death or bodily injury to the shooter or people in the area.  

This Grapnel hook is NOT for rappelling!  It's specific use is to fire it and then retrieve it, dragging it along the ground to set off tripwires.   It can also be used as a ""leader"" line to shoot over an obstacle and then attach a rappel line to the end and pull the rappel rope over the obstacle.  Again, DO NOT use the twine that is included or the Grapnel hook to bear weight or to climb as it will break.  Lastly, and consider this a disclaimer, firing the Grapnel hook at a person will cause death or serious bodily injury, and is also capable of damaging or destroying property.

Well, you could be interested in getting 34 to the gallon on the highway. Or you need an extra car in a movie about Arab terrorists. You could also like the fact that it can run on about anything including but not limited to- diesel, dyed diesel, bio diesel, French fry grease, left overs from dinner, grandpa's cough syrup, hopes and dreams. 

The real reason to buy our family's car is that it is a head turner and very reliable.  We recently drove it to Miami and back. It also will include a few stray cheerios that may have wedged themselves in the interior from my one year old.  

That being said our family is growing, again. We need space for more kids. Got a wagon, or suv with 3rd row seats? I want that. I also like guns so throw something in for dad to sweeten the deal. May be willing to add cash to sweeten the trade. 

Will not accept trades for gold bars, silver bullion, food rations, lead wall linings, unique stamps, or first born children. 

Here is the specs:
Engine and body are good for a 31 year old car
200K miles, less than 7k a year. (My best friend has the same car with 680k+ on it right now, same engine!)
Its got windows the roll up and down on electricity!
New battery about a year ago
50% tires left

633,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2567633,For Sale:  Custom Painted Camo Waterproof Housings for GoPro Hero 3 or 3+ Cameras,"near Dover NH, New Hampshire, United States",$ 52,"Listed On: Friday, January 24, 2014",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have been selling custom painted housings for the GoPro brand Hero 3 and Hero 3+ camera's that have recently become the best selling camera in 2013.  I have sold well over 200 of these custom painted housings.  I do not sell the actual camera's and you don't get one.  The Hero 3 and 3+ can be placed in either the more heavy duty housing or the new ""light"" housing.  I only sell the heavy duty housings, which are the ones waterproof to 60M and much more shockproof then the newer ""light"" housings.  

Each of these housings are carefully masked off to cover the lens and the LCD screen.  I purposely paint over the two LED blinking lights as the majority of my customers are hunters or in the military and want those covered.  I presently have over a dozen different painting schemes that I sell.  

Here is a link to my Ebay store that shows some of the many housings that I sell.

The link above won't hyperlink, but if you cut and paste it, it will take you to my store.

You can either purchase these on Ebay or directly through me.  I only take payment through PayPal.  You will save a couple dollars if you pay me direct through PayPal rather then going through Ebay.

In over 200 sales I have never had a housing returned or an unsatisfied customer.  I also do custom paint jobs if you have a specific need.

All of my housings get 3 base coats and 2 clear coats of sealer (either matt or glossy, depending on the housing.)

The price on here includes shipping to the 48 states with tracking.

The first picture is of a friend of mine with the Woodland Camo version on a head mount.  The following two pictures are of the same Woodland Camo version and the last is a Desert Camo version.  These are my two most popular housings.

For those who aren't familiar with these, they were made in the same valley as Beretta in Italy by Tanfoglio, but these pistols were made for the Israeli military under contract and thus have ""MOSSAD"" with two 6 point ""Star of David"" on the slide.   This classic pistol is based upon the classic loved CZ-75 design.  Frame says ""Made by Fratelli Tanfoglio S.P.A. for ""Weapons House LTD"" - Israel"".   Bore/barrel look good, no pitting and good distinct grooves, 9mm 16 round mag double stack. One Italian made mag included.  Additional mags are plentiful as they take the same mags as current CZ75, Baby Eagle, Jericho, Springfield p9 and Tanfoglio Witness pistols - this pistol is the same basic design as all of these (CZ75 clones that are still being made today).  

This is neat opportunity to own a very uniquely marked and rich historic pistol used to defend the nation of Israel. Many believe that Israeli Mossad officers originally may used this weapon as their ""home"" carry protection. For those that may not know, the Israeli Mossad is roughly the equivalent of our FBI/CIA.   A very rare and potentially valuable addition to many collections.

I have sold well over 200 of these custom painted housings.  I do not sell the actual camera's and you don't get one.  The Hero 3 and 3+ can be placed in either the more heavy duty housing or the new ""light"" housing.  I only sell the heavy duty housings, which are the ones waterproof to 60M and much more shockproof then the newer ""light"" housings.  

Each of these housings are carefully masked off to cover the lens and the LCD screen.  I purposely paint over the two LED blinking lights as the majority of my customers are hunters or in the military and want those covered.  I presently have over a dozen different painting schemes that I sell.  

Here is a link to my Ebay store that shows some of the many housings that I sell.

The link above won't hyperlink, but if you cut and paste it, it will take you to my store.

You can either purchase these on Ebay or directly through me.  I only take payment through PayPal.  You will save a couple dollars if you pay me direct through PayPal rather then going through Ebay.

In over 200 sales I have never had a housing returned or an unsatisfied customer.  I also do custom paint jobs if you have a specific need.

All of my housings get 3 base coats and 2 clear coats of sealer (either matt or glossy, depending on the housing.)

The price on here includes shipping to the 48 states with tracking.

The first picture is of a friend of mine with the Woodland Camo version on a head mount.  The following two pictures are of the same Woodland Camo version and the last is a Desert Camo version.  These are my two most popular housings.

Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

This USP is a .40 Caliber 

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

Equipped with Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Front Night Sight.(a $50 value) The manufacturer states the following. The sight is a dot iron sight that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicon rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock- resistant design that is patented by Trijicon. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicon rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. 

Talon custom rubber grips installed (a $15 value).  Talon grips afford a better grip as well as comfort from the aggressive stock grips.  If these are unwanted, simple remove them and clean the stock grip with alcohol.

A model developed after the M4 pattern rifle, the PWS MK114 Rifle has quickly become the crowd favorite for those wanting a compact package without the NFA paperwork associated with shorter barrels. The MK114 retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a permanently attached FSC556.

 Utilizing the proven system originally designed for the MK107, the MK114 uses a mid length gas piston system. The operating system, designed after the venerable AK-47, features a long stroke fixed operating rod design with an adjustable gas block, 15 handguard and free-floated barrel.

 The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

 Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver. Additional features include the BCM GUNFIGHTER charging handle, the PWS enhanced buffer tube and an ALG Defense QMS trigger. The rifle is rounded out with industry leading features such as Magpul MOE grip, MOE stock, and MBUS2 sights.

868,http://www.armslist.com/posts/2567868,For Sale/Trade:  grip/stock stippling for wood and/or polymer grips/stocks,"green/uniontown, Akron, Ohio",$ 1,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 5, 2014",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"TEXTURE/STIPPLING
Would you like to add a highly functional texture to your firearm that also gives it a great custom look? I've been doing this for years, and can honestly say that there is no better, or more functional texture that can be had on firearms than a custom hand finished texture. And it can be done at a reasonable price. Price does depend on what will be done though as well as quantity.

It has to be done correctly though, I've seen lots of pictures of hand stippling that looks sloppy, and terrible.... mine looks professional, and as if it were maybe done at the factory. 

It can be done very fine, which looks the best in my opinion, or it can be done more aggressively with the use of lines instead of dots or other various patterns. I have done custom hand finished textures on polymer pistol frames, ar15 and ak grips (both pistol grips and forward vertical grips to match and then Magazines to match the two grips as well. I can also do wood rifle stocks and wood pistol grips. on wood I can do a carved stippling, or a burned stippling. I can also do a fish scale pattern commonly seen on higher end target rifles, and expensive shotguns. 

COLOR FILL----------
You will also see in my photos some examples of color fill that I've done. this is the process of filling engraved lettering and/or logos with color. this is commonly done on ar15 recievers as well as logos and lettering on pistol slides, and polymer grips and other accessories. This is purely for cosmetic purposes. Examples: red spider on spikes tactical recievers, glock slide lettering/logos, magazines, ar15 pistol grip magpul logos etc.. this can all be done in pretty much any color, and is very permanent, but can be removed if absolutely desired.

This is a very nice clean rifle. To the best of our knowledge it is all original. Manufacture dates from 1955-1957, this has a 5.8 serial number. The bluing on the barrel and finish on the action is excellent. The stock is in good shape as well very few scratches if any at all. The only downside to this rifle is there is a crack on the stock around the area of the grip, other than that the rifle is in excellent condition. This rifle would make a great addition to a collection. If this listing is still up the firearm is still for sale. We ship to FFL's.
