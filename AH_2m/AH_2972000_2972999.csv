I'm the second owner of this upper. first owner built, test fired 30 rounds and sold to me. I've put only a few boxes of subs thru it. I'll say 100 rounds, but its less than that for sure. I've never shot full power ammo thru this upper. cycled perfectly for me with subs with a can on AND without a can. YMMV on the non-suppressed, but I did shoot a handful of times just to see what it would do and was flawless. 

there are a few nicks and marks here and there, but it is far from beat up. I just don't want someone thinking they're getting a NIB because its not.

The connector does not lower the pull to 3.5 lbs, but did lower it about a pound and, more importantly, really smoothed out the trigger pull. I do have the original factory connector and will include it in the Glock case should a buyer want to return the trigger to factory spec. I also had metal Ameriglo I-Dot Pro sights professionally installed. They are a vast improvement over the plastic stock sights. The front dog is bright orange in the day and uses trijicon tritium to glow bright in low light/the dark. I also have four 13 round Glock magazines I'll include with the pistol. I've put less than 500 rounds through the pistol, so it's got all most all of its life left. This is an honest round count... there isn't really any visible barrel finish wear. I've never had a single malfunction of any kind... it's a Glock. Sadly, I'm forced to downsize my collection and I've decided to eliminate the .45s. Email me with any questions. I have over $750 into this pistol, so this should be a great deal for someone."

I am going to the AK/SKS platform, so trades are welcomed I am fairly reasonable, and I am not asking $1000 for the AR, but I am also not going to give it away. If the composite lower scares you don't worry it's FMK and has a lifetime transferable warranty or spikes lowers are under $80 right now and they are extremely easy to build. I will bundle for the right trade or price.

The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648-308 ACOG® reticle features a red chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 7.62mm M80 out to 1200 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG® line, the new ACOG® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 328 feet.

The TA648-308 also includes:

1 Picatinny Rail Adapter (TA75)
1 LENSPEN® (TA56)
1 Trijicon Logo Sticker (PR15)

I originally bought this as a project rifle, but don't have the money or time to start it right now.  The Stevens Model 200 has the same action as the Savage Model 10, but is built as a budget rifle.  This means there are a multitude of aftermarket parts for it that would make this rifle a beast.

The rifle has about 200 rounds through it and is in excellent shape.

The second picture is one of my groups at 100 yards the last time I took it out.  Bear in mind that I'm a sub-average shooter with little experience shooting at a distance.

I have used this rifle myself in the field. I prefer this over the AR-15 for the size of the round and is one of the most accurate rifles i have ever shot with iron sights..well outperforming my friends with AR platforms.. The ironsights are DEAD ON..

I will ship this for free through USPS and it will be to you within 3 business days after shipping with confirmed tracking number. Text or calling will provide the quickest response.

Burris has gone to extremes to engineer the ultimate in high-performance optics - the BURRIS Xtreme Tactical 1-4x24 Riflescope, Illuminated XTR Ballistic 5.56 Reticle, Gen2, 30mm (201904). Extra-large, ultra-premium lenses produce unsurpassed resolution, clarity, and brightness. The propietary HiLume ultra-clear, index-matched multi-coating used on the Burris XTR riflescope has been enhanced with new StormCoat. The ultra-low-surface tension coating causes water to form into tighter beads and slide off the glass, leaving more clean surface through which to clearly see your target. The enhancement is exclusive to XTR scopes. Another simple yet highly effective Burris innovation - the lighted reticle scope. Any hunter who has tried to settle standard black crosshairs on a black bear or wild boar, or attempted to put the hammer down on a buck right at dusk recognizes the necessity for a lighted reticle. This model riflescope features the innovative XTR Ballistic 5.56 reticle, which is developed for competitive shooters, law enforcement, and military applications. The lighted circular donut in the center provides ultra fast engagement at close distances. The center dots and lower leg of the reticle provides trajectory compensation for the 5.56 62grain FMJ cartridge out to 1000 yards yet is very accurate with a number of other loadings out to 600 or 700 yards. The left, right, and upper reticle posts feature precise bars for milling target sizes and distances. A true 1x optic, 30mm XTR Rings and a P.E.P.R. mount is ideal for modern sporting rifles. It covers the tactical bases from entry work to long-range counter-sniper duties. The XTR scope tubes are 30mm, resulting in 25% thicker main tubes and 42% more strength. Double-force coil spring suspension locks the inner tube in place for unfailing accuracy. The whole package is waterproof, fogproof, shockproof and warranted forever. Tactical scopes just don't come any better. Features 30mm main tube that is 25% thicker in cross section, resulting in 42% more strength Integrated eyepiece and power ring with deep relief grooves for maximum durability and ease of changing magnification Extra large internal lenses for maximum brightness Ultra-premium quality lenses for outstanding resolution and clarity Double-force coil spring suspension system for the ultimate in accuracy HiLume StormCoat lens finish to reduce surface tension and increase water shedding 30mm XTR Rings P.E.P.R. mount Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof Illuminated XTR Ballistic 5.56 Reticle Matte Black Finish Burris Forever Warranty"

Also comes with 2 Kimber magazines and 2 Wilson Combat magazines.  I kept the Wilson Combat magazines inside my weapon since carrying it keep in mind this weapon does have ambi safety on the sides and has matched trigger and hammer as well.  I keep this weapon in excellent condition and always cleaned it plus I babied it when it needed it to be clean. 

The first owner only shot 50 rounds of 115 grains thru the weapon so hasn't seen much shooting action down range.  He did point out two small scratch marks around the ambie safety on the left side it's barely noticieable.

MFG Description:
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Rosewood Grips round out this package.

Utilizing a removable serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

This gun has been my EDC for about 2 years.  I've put 1,500 rounds through it.  I did not do the stippling or the relief under the trigger-guard.  I bought it used and it came that way.

These pistols are made at 2 FN facilities. European market guns are produced at a home factory in Herstal, Belgium
 US market guns at an FN plant in Columbia, SC

 The law enforcement/military version was marketed by FN as the FNP-9 and was all black with black furniture and barrel.
 The civilian version was marketed by Browning as a PRO-9 and was black with a stainless slide as well as stainless furniture.
 Frames on both were black polymer. The Pro-9 had the browning buckmark logo, and the FNP-9 has the FN.

 This is an extremely rare mix of the 2 designs that Browning & FN Herstal did together and also marketed together as well. The frame marked with FN and the slide is marked as an FNP-9. It is NOT a pieced together weapon as only a limited handful were manufactured like this 
 (All black with stainless furniture and barrel)
 First announced in 2003 it features a DA/SA operation with decocker.

 CONDITION:
 Gun is in VERY nice condition and has had less than 100 rounds through it. Has a couple of VERY MINOR holster wear spots on the slide but that is really about it. Otherwise looks great as you can see in the pictures. For the most part was a safe queen and I carried it for a short time.

 This is a beautiful gun with an extremely smooth pull and I can honestly say I have never held a more comfortable firearm in my hand. Many enthusiasts compare them to the feeling of these to the 1911. (If you are into that)

 INCLUDES:
 Holster, 1 box (60rds) of 9mm ammo, 2 mags.

The firearm is chambered in 5.56 NATO with a 16 inch barrel and standard A2 flash hider. One unique aspect of the Rhino Arms AR-15 is the addition of a reinforced magwell (easily seen in the pictures) which makes the rifle tough enough for extremely hard use, though i've babied it myself-- approximately 400 rounds have passed through the chamber (it runs steel cased ammo as well as it does brass). I am a former soldier so i've been trained in proper maintenance of this particular weapons platform and it has been cleaned and pampered as much as any AR could hope to be. This is NOT a cheap polymer lower AR, this is the real deal. I purchased the rifle new in 2010 in stock configuration and proceeded to add the following accessories:

Stag Arms 6-position retractable stock
Blackhawk ergonomic Grip
Blackhawk quad rail
Magpul AFG2
Bushnell TRS-25 red dot sight

THE UT-15 TACTICAL CARBINE

 Wilson Combat’s® UT-15 Urban Tactical model is an ideal all-around tactical or sporting semi-auto carbine. It offers precise accuracy and fast handling versatility in a lightweight package, with our famous unequalled quality, relentless reliability, and superior service. We start with precision CNC machined upper and lower receivers, using high-quality 7075 T6 aluminum forgings. The upper utilizes a flat-top receiver and a 16.25” free-floated, fluted, match grade barrel. Uppers and lowers are hand-matched by a master riflesmith.

 The UT-15 features a precision Tactical Trigger Unit, tuned to a crisp 4 pound trigger pull, facilitating the inherent accuracy potential of this carbine. A master riflesmith then carefully assembles and fits the rifle with what we consider the finest barrel in the industry. The result is a tactical rifle that you can stake your life on; one guaranteed to shoot 1 MOA at 100 yards with quality ammunition.

 The same qualities that have made the UT-15 Urban Tactical rifle a favorite defensive weapon also make it an outstanding choice for a sporting rifle. Light weight, compact size, dependable performance in all weather conditions – plus extreme accuracy – assure excellence in the field. Whether you are a target shooter, varmint hunter, or even a weekend plinker, our UT-15 is a superb choice you will enjoy in the field.

 Some standard features of the Wilson Combat® UT-15 Tactical include: 

·       Flat-top upper and lower receiver CNC machined from quality US made  aluminum forgings

·       Premium 16.25” Wilson Combat® match-grade fluted barrel

·       Free-float ventilated aluminum handguard

·       TTU - Tactical Trigger Unit - Single Stage, 4 lb.

·       Six position Mil-Spec collapsible stock

 One of the most popular options is a quad-rail handguard featuring full length integral Picatinny rails for mounting virtually any accessory you can imagine. Common accessories the quad rail will accept include bi-pod, weapons light, laser sights, red-dot sights, vertical handguards, etc. The quad-rail also allows mounting the barrel so it is free-floated for maximum accuracy and is ventilated for improved barrel cooling. Our quad-rail is fully machined from air-craft grade aluminum and hard coat anodized to a matte black finish."

All original matching numbers and un-bastardized. This is a true Type 56 with the arsenal markings on the reciever, not the civilian models. I believe it was manufactured in 1967. Super shiny chrome lined bore. I've put over 300 rounds through it since owning it with no jams or failures to feed and I've kept it cleaned. I don't think this rifle was shot very much before I picked it up, I had to clean all the cosmoline off the inside. It's very reliable.

Ruger's M77 MKII Frontier Rifle won the Guns & Ammo Magazine Reader Poll as ""The 2005 Gun of the Year""

It has a 16.5"" barrel and a far-forward scope mount so you can use a long eye-relief scope. Cooper's idea was that this allowed for faster acquisition since the shooter could keep both eyes open while picking up the target in the scope.

- Chromed bolt carrier.
- Simple nylon web sling
- Mounted Centerpoint -4x16x 40 lighted reticle scope. Dual mounts with enough clearance to clear front ramp sight

The barrel is stamped  ""308"" not ""7.62x51"", which DOES make a difference.  Factory 308 ammo loads/ejects fine, but any reloaded ammo will have to be made using small base dies, patience and some dedication. The chamber is finicky as any out-of-spec overall length (reloads, not factory ammo) will cause feed/lockup problems. DPMS really prides themselves with what they call ""match-grade"" chamber dimensions.

I am the second owner, so the gun has been handled, has been in the woods as well. If you're looking for a museum piece, move on. This gun has been shot, carried and can be accurately called ""USED"", but in excellent condition.

Federal American Eagle Suppressor Ammunition was designed from the ground up to provide the ultimate in reliability and cleanliness in suppressed firearms. The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest, fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent, accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive.

About $400 new, depending on where you get it, sometimes up to $550. Nice part Is you don't have to pay that. I took this off a Savage model 10 FCP-SR  when I admitted to myself that I will 1) probably never have to take a 1000 meter shot 2) don't reload, so I wasn't able to give the rifle the ammo it needed to get the best accuracy 3) even IF I did needed to take a 1000 meter shot and had the right ammo to do it with I'm just not that good. It's only been on the one rifle, and very lightly used. I'd like to trade for .308 ammo and a good quality scope for my .22mag. I'd also be interested in .22mag ammo, .357 ammo, Savage model 24's, and of course cash offers are always welcome. Don't be shy though, I've got a wide variety of stuff so if you have another idea for a trade, try me. All I ask is no reloads, no junk, be reasonable on what you ask for your stuff ( if you bought it last year for $500, put 200 rds through it and then put it in your closet it's not worth $500 anymore. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news), and no AK stuff. I don't have one, and don't have plans to buy one. I do have cash and a variety of ammo I can add to a deal if your stuff is worth more than mine. Let me know what you have and we'll get it done. Thanks."
