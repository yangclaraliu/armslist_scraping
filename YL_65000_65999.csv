Model number is 307703.  Does NOT have an internal lock or magazine safety (which is a plus in my book).  This is a police model as it comes with factory Trijicon tritium night sights stamped '09.  There are less than 100 rounds through it, and it looks brand new (minus the normal external finish wear on the barrel from firing it).  Not a single nick or blemish.

Comes with everything that came with it from the factory, including:
- 3 factory 10 round magazines (2 with finger extensions, third one should be coming in the mail from S&W for free)
- 1 factory unfired 15 round magazine with X-Grip extension (just purchased for ~$50)
- 3 backstraps
- Manual and all paperwork, lock, all in original case

If I can't sell it for $500 cash, I'll just end up keeping it as it's a great gun.  However, I would like to sell it to help pay for an upcoming vacation.

Has had Meprolight night-sights installed (three-dot/green).  Also included is one OD two-point sling, and three 30 round mags (one of which is translucent).  If you are unfamiliar with Arsenal or the 106 series, Arsenal is more or less the Rolls-Royce of AK production, and is generally considered superior to most/all other AK's on the planet.  The 106/107 series are their flagship series of AK's.  

The 106CR features all-polymer furniture, with a sidefolding stock, and fires the .223 round (rather than the traditional SKS round).  This makes it a great compliment to any black rifle you may already own, as they will fire the same ammunition.  The 106CR in particular is popular as a SBR platform, so if you are looking to build a short barreled rifle this could be it.  Please don't intentionally lowball, as I will not sell this for a fraction of asking price.  Thank you for your interest.

I am not particularly looking for anything in trade at the moment, so if a trade is included it must be at exceptional value.  Don't hesitate to throw out cash, trade, or partial trade offers."

I will sell or trade the rifle, cash price is $600.00 OBO. Right now I'm looking for a CCW/Home defense weapon to replace this rifle. Im looking for something in 9mm or larger autos preffered but might consider the right wheel gun ie. Taurus JUDGE, ect. Glocks, Sigs, Ruger's, Smith & Wesson, 1911 frames or ???? Tactical shotguns or AR's also an option, other varmit caliber or slug guns for deer hunting out East might be an option too. Possible trades for current issue MILITARY gear also. Im looking for a straight trade on my end no cash out of pocket but if your trade falls a little short Ill except partial cash to even a deal. Im located near Ft.

Marine owned from day one and I take care of my firearms meticulously. The Tasco Pro-Point works flawlessly and has a knob adjustment for red dot light intensity for different light conditions. The Pro-Point basically compliments any pistol or rifle in making the operator have dead on target acquisition much quicker than tradition sighting. I also kept the batteries out of the Pro-Point during the long intervals between shootings. The Browning Buckmark also has adjustible rear sights for calibration if you decide to remove the Pro-Point. I dont see a scrape or a mark on this thing. Just very minimal wear in the slide area. The Wood Grips look to be Brazilian Walnut and fit the hand perfectly. Comes with the original 10 round magazine and instruction manual and good batteries for the Red Dot. You will not be disappointed. If you have any questions call or email anytime.

P.S. I'm 20, not 21, my girlfriend is 21, and I need a handgun for the home and to store in her glove box (which is legal in Missouri), she was robbed by some lunatic with a gun a week or so ago and he punched her across the jaw, she's deathly afraid to go out without me beside her every step of the way now.
She's 5'2 and 110 pounds, she really needs something to put her mind at ease when she goes to work or the store or whatever.
We can't afford to buy one though, so I'm trying to do some trading to get one for her, our anniversary is coming up in late November and I'd like to give her a nice handgun as a gift so she can stop depending on me to go everywhere with her and get her CCW, it doesn't have to be a $2,600 Colt 1911, just something decent that she can use if she needs it."

Getting harder and harder to find anymore due to history. Becoming collectors item. Need to sell to fund further projects. Safed for past 8 years so there is some very light surface rust in a few spots.

The DC-9 is picky about the types of ammo it will feed reliably. It feeds hard round-nosed and pointy-nosed FMJ types very reliably, even aluminum cased CCI/Blazer ammo.
The DC-9's feeding preferences are stated very clearly in the DC-9 owner's manual, but some critics tend to ignore this and complain about feeding problems when they are really just using ammunition for which the gun was not designed.
