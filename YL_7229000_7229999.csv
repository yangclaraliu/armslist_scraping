Preferred Florida DL and Concealed Carry License Holders.I bought this gun from a local person then sent it to Wet Dreams Gun Customization Shop and they completely went thru the gun replacing or updating anything needed and then two toned the gun. I do not have the box it came new in. So What you see is what you get. This is a perfect beautiful gun. I've got close to a $950 in this gun.

This is the actual Makarov design with the grip/magazine well and magazine design modified for double-column mags, raising from the 8 round single-stack capacity to 12+1 of 9x18 Makarov in a very compact package. Specifically designed and marketed to the western civilian marke, it is reliable, accurate, comfortable, and fun.  The gun is in excellent condition. Low wear, not many rounds, and no carry wear. It's low mileage. It was purchased it at the tail end of the Clinton gun ban of '94 (somewhere around 2003 or 2004). They didn't import many of them and they are hard to find. No Makarov collection is complete without this gun.  It comes with 3 ""high capacity"" mags. One 10-round ""Clinton compliant"" mag and two 12-round mags. The mags are even harder to get than the gun. The 10ers go for as much as $100 and the 12's can get up to $150.  Included in the deal is the the original box, adjustment/take down tool, cleaning tool, Inspector's quality certificate, manual, all original documents and paperwork, including warranty cards and safety manual. Basically I saved everything except for the original receipt."

But I've got an M1S90 and just got rid of a 22"" M2 Comfortech and just like those guns, you can't pull the trigger fast enough to out run it. It will blast off 7 rounds in a heart beat!Asking exactly what I have in it, less the transfer fees and shipping. $460 firm face to face in N Raleigh.

I have the twin of this barrel on my benchrest rifle and it will shoot 80 grain Sierras into the 1s and eats up 55 grain varmint bullets like candy. These barrels are the most highly polished barrels I have ever scoped. I installed the Anschutz sling rail and pillar bedded it into the stock so this could be used a prone rifle or you can use it as an accessory rail. The trigger is the stock Accutrigger and I lightened the first stage. EGW extended scope rail included. I will also include a SSS improved extractor kit included for the 223 bolt that I bought and never installed. I have set the barrel nuts in place with Loctite so you don't need a Savage wrench to remove them. The barrels can be easily removed and reinstalled and the headspace is constant just like a shoulder barrel. This is a very serious Savage.$1250"
