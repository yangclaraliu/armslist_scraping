I took it to a professional who specializes in these types of firearms.  He told me that it is definately French and was probably sold to the confederacy by the French as a means of supplimenting confederate supplies during the American Civil war.  After the war it was probably sporterized and used on a farm.  Caution * still loaded *.  Make me an offer.

Will ship and take PayPal :) Text REDACTED for quickest response.DANIEL DEFENSE M4A1 UPPER RECEIVER GROUPThe Daniel Defense M4A1 Upper Receiver Group features the M4A1 Rail Interface System (RIS II), which has been in use by US Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II Weapons System since 2005. This two-piece, free-floating rail system allows the mounting of devices like a M203 grenade launcher without influencing the barrels harmonics, eliminating problems like wandering point of impact that plagued other mounting designs. The two-piece design also allows for partial disassembly of the rail to aid in cleaning around barrel without completely removing the entire rail system. The weight of anything attached to the RISII rail system is fully supported by a sturdy bolt-up system, using 6 grade 8 bolts, leaving the barrel completely free floating for best possible accuracy and dependability. The M4A1 features a 14.5” Cold Hammer Forged M4 Profile barrel with a permanently attached Daniel Defense Improved Flash Suppressor to meet the NFA required 16” length. Daniel Defense complete upper receiver groups come complete with bolt carrier group and charging handle."

Please visit us at tzarmory or facebook/tzarmory to check out our other firearms for sale and other firearm finishes that we've done!Many years in the making, we’re pleased to announce the latest addition to the CZ line of handguns — the P-10 C. Much more than just our take on the striker-fired pistol, the P-10 is decidedly CZ, from the way it feels to the way it shoots.First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who’s picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless.Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical 3-dot sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt.Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with our legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 is the complete package.Item #:     91520UPC:     REDACTED0Description:     CZU CZP10 9MM BLK 15RDBrand:     CZ-USAModel:     CZ P-10 CompactType:     Pistol: Semi-AutoCaliber:     9MMFinish:     Black PolycoatAction:     Double ActionStock:     Polymer FrameSight:     Fixed 3 Dot SightsBarrel Length:     4Overall Length:     7.5Capacity:     15+1# of Mags:     2Receiver:     Polymer FramePackaging:     Plastic Case with Cable LockFeatures:     Fits Glock 19 Hosters;                        Squared Trigger Guard, Striker Fired"

Up for sale is the best New Jersey legal AR-15 you could possibly build. I'm moving out of state and trying not to bring more than I can fit in my car with me when I leave, so this has to go. It has a Faxon 14.5"" pencil-profile barrel with a pinned Midwest Industries muzzle brake,which makes the upper super lightweight, leaving the whole rifle very balanced and super easy to hold/point.
I will also be including all of my 15 round magazines (a few Hexmag 15/30s, a few MFT 15/30s, a few Thermold 15 rounders, one Magpul 15/20) as well as 270 rounds IMI 5.56, a 120 round battle pack of PMC M855, a 200 round battle pack of PMC .223, a rifle case, a 4 magazine bandolier, a boresnake...plus a bunch of M-Lok attachments (vertical grip, GoPro mount, etc). Basically you're getting everything I have for this rifle.Asking price is $750, which I believe is fair considering everything you're getting with the rifle. Must have matching New Jersey Driver's License and Firearms ID, and sign a New Jersey COE, or we can meet at my local gun shop and I'll cover the cost of going through an FFL to transfer it to you.

I was on a waiting list for close to a year to get this gun. I believe they are still pretty hard to get. Have owned for about two years. Barely broken in, about 200 rounds fired. Very clean and looks as it did the day I brought it home. I can send additional photos if desired. I paid just over 1700 for it, asking 1500 but willing to negotiate. I really don't want to sell, but I need the money. I can't ship. No trades, please don't ask. Cash only. This is the more rare model that is not the full length 1911 frame. Much easier to carry if you intend it to be your EDC. All origional accessories come with it as well as the case. Thanks for looking."
