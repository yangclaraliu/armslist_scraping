One guy (nice guy actually) met up with me and then asked me to essentially swear on a stack of Bibles that it would never ever jam, ever, for the rest of his natural born life irrespective of what ammo he put in it. Ummm? It's a .22LR AR-15, a range toy. They jam sometimes. This one ran flawless with Remington Golden somthing or other HPs but I didn't try every ammo ever made or ever to be made.
Details:
LOWER: 
This was a brand new Anderson lower receiver I bought a couple weeks ago. I installed a brand new lower parts kit in it, a commercial spec buffer tube, a MagPul grip (painted OD green) and CAR style stock (also painted OD green).
Upper: 
This is a factory built Chiappa Pro Series II .22lr upper with free float quar rail. There are some finish marks on the underside of the barrel.

Here's the deal: Please ask all questions before saying ""I'll take it"". Please be willing to bring cash to a meet up location fairly close to Bradenton. Sorry, I cannot ship, cannot drive to Palm Beach, cannot trade for an X-Box and a case of Zima. Let me answer the most important question first: NO. I will not take ""$200 CASH"" even if you put ""CASH"" in all caps. I will not take $259.99. I will take $260.00 in cash. Sorry to sound like a jerk but some of the people on this site are abusive. Also, I'm sorry, but due to the amount of no-shows and last-minute back outs I'm going to have to stop meeting people halfway. I'll have to ask that you come to me."

In the pics below is the extras. 2 Magazines (10 and 25 round, both can be easily disassembled for cleaning and maintenance), bore light, bore cleaning rod with one attachment, Midwest industries rear iron sight (This does line up with after market sights, at least on my magpul front sight it does), The original hand guard it came with (I hacked it up to run a rail on it, but a new rail would cover it up), a magnetic flashlight holder you put on the barrel, a daniel defense QD sling attachment and a rifle storage bag that's new and unopened.

Also included is a truglo red dot that hasn't had really any use on it.

This thing is a blast to shoot! But it's a bit heavy for my Bob and I was going to train with it to save on ammo, but my employment status has changed.

I have ran different types of ammo without issue. 

However, I have some older Remington thunderbolt and it choked on every round. It doesn't seem to Like that brand! lol

Nice accurate little shooter.

LOW ROUND COUNT!

Below is a picture of my lower receiver where I had this upper attached. The bolt from the upper took the finish of after 300 rounds as you can see. It doesn't look like it hurt the metal, just the anodizing Just being upfront. I forgot to add this and am lowering the price. And no, this is not the reason I am selling it. You could probably use some sort of soft or plastic shim if this bothers you.

I have found them incredibly accurate and durable.  

Great for deer or furbearer hunting. 

My daughter can reload her Rossi 243 break barrel just as fast as I can reload my bolt action.  With a little practice, this is a deadly hunting rifle with the added safty fearure of a hammer gun.  

This rifle cannot fire until the hammer is cocked, what a safe way to climb a blind.

A few hours in a tree stand holding this rifle, will prove it's worth to you.

Youth model only means that the barrel is 22 inch instead of 23 inch

The forearm is a little shorter.

By the way my daughter shot a deer at 300 yards with this exact model gun yesterday.

Weaver rail, hammer extension, and Safty lock key.

Purchased from AIM Surplus few weeks ago as 'Grade 1' ($250 + $15 shipping + $15 transfer +$16 Wolff springs=$296 invested).  I saw that classic has them for $200, but from what I've seen they aren't in quite as good of shape. It shoots well, I just didn't think through how small the pistol really is and my XXL hands, single stacks are just too small for me. It's in great shape and I only put 15 rounds through it over the weekend and decided I just didn't like the feel of it. I did install the 22# recoil spring and 18# hammer spring from Wolff springs to lighten up the double action pull and it worked great. I have the original springs, two mags, leather holster, and 485 rounds of ammo to go with it. 
The only issue I had was the second magazine needs a little work to feed reliably, had a couple rounds get caught when being picked up and getting caught on magazine tabs, nothing a Dremmel and ten minutes can't take care of.

We use a heavier 10oz cow hide leather, available in  Brown or Black and heavier Kydex for the shell.  The holster is curve to fit closer to your body helping make it more stable and concealable.

I got lucky with my bow for the first time. Now, I'd like to sell the high-end gun I bought for modern gun season, since I will not be needing it. I hate to see this gun go, it's extremely nice. I've got almost $1000 in this sale, it's a steal at:
$400 for the gun ($530 new) , ammo and scope mounts! $620 with the LEUPOLD VX-II ($300 new) scope and bi-pod!!!
Here is a link to 19, close up, high quality pictures I just took:
https://flic.kr/s/aHsko1EU8i
WEATHERBY VANGUARD S2 CARBINE, .308 cal.(7.62 NATO) with a perfect 20"" barrel (research shows this length is very accurate per inch for .308), plus it has a SUB-M.O.A. guarantee! No one else offers that. For those of you who are not clear on what that means; This gun will put bullets in less than a 1"" circle at 100 yards, GUARANTEED by Weatherby. If for whatever reason, it EVER shoots worse than that, they fix or replace it, no receipts or registration necessary.
Read the reviews online, this is the bolt action gun to buy in this price range. Extremely well reviewed. You can see the quality when you hold it and feel the quality when you pull the trigger. I'm all around very impressed, I'm sure anyone would be! By far the nicest trigger pull I've felt on a stock gun.
It was just broke in according to Weatherby's instructions (40 rounds, very tedious, cleaned barrel around 20 times I think). I haven't put another bullet in it since. I just put the scope and Weatherby factory Talley custom fit mounts on for the last 3 rounds....it's already shooting within .75"" of dead center at 40 yards with just the bi-pod on a unstable table!! Within 5-10 more rounds you should be able to have it zeroed out to 100 yards. Some hunters I know would call it good enough for hunting already. Personally, I would take it to the range and make it perfectly zeroed at my target distance (before hunting over 60-70 yards) but, that is just me.
Here is a link to Weatherby's page about this gun:
http://www.weatherby.com/products/rifles/vanguard/vanguard-carbine.html
The scope is a Leupold VX-2, also very high end. Has Leupold's lifetime 'gold ring' warranty. It is well matched to this gun, look at the factory standard length Vanguard + scope combo, that Weatherby offers. Both 3-9x40mm but, this one is a definitive step-up in performance and quality by anyone's standards.

Something they got cheap, freely given, inherited, or neglected/abused in youth. I like to buy these guns and spend time fixing or just enjoying them. I think some ""ugly"" firearms look just fine as is, as long as they function.

I'm not looking for potentially unsafe or broken beyond simple repair firearms. Just old stuff that someone can't find use for and is reasonably priced. I don't really look to spend more than $150. Especially if I have to find stocks, or parts to refurbish it. I don't pay anywhere near $150 if it's really rough.

I'm fine with a rusted bore as long as I can easily find a replacement online. Surface rusts on firearms is fine. I'm not a collector. I'm a shooter.

Let me know what you have, what you want, and the overall condition of the gun with pics if possible. I don't buy with the intention to resell. I just enjoy minor tinkering and shoot them. 

I like single shot shotguns, 22lr rifles, black powder arms, and inexpensive pistols/derringers. I don't buy anything in 25acp.

This is the predecessor to the P220 compact.  I bought this used and have put about 250 rounds through it.  The slide has been professionally refinished; it's black,  and the finish has held up well to the times I've carried it.  The rails are in good shape, with some wear towards the rear, but absolutely no gouging or scratches.  

**Please be aware that the white stuff in the rail/slide area is grease--I like to take good care of my guns**

I replaced the recoil spring 75 rounds ago, so it has a new recoil spring installed.  It also has a Wolff hammer spring installed.  I believe it's an 18b spring, down from the factory 20.  Trigger pull is excellent in both DA and SA, and it hasn't had a problem running stuff with hard primers (two boxes of Tulammo and a box of S&B).  

Included:

Gun, factory case, two 6-round magazines with pinky rest base plate, 1 seven round magazine, new recoil spring (installed), new recoil spring (in package), factory hammer spring, short trigger (installed), Looper brand leather belt slide holster, Remora holster.

For an additional cost, the following is available:

450 count 185 grain Xtreme plated FP in 45ACP
400 count 250 grain Xtreme plated RN in 45ACP
20 count box of Hornady Critical Duty in 45ACP
50 count Blazer Aluminum, 45ACP
50 count Fiocchi (brass case) 45ACP
28 count PPU (brass case) 45ACP


Also a bunch of deprimed brass and at least 100 primed brass if you're into that.  


I'm out of FA10s for the year; if we're going to trade, I'm fine with making a deal now and trading after January 1.  If you're interested in buying only, FFL fee is negotiable."

Our H-Bar Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a bull barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 Profile. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of 4150 Chrome-Moly Vanadium Steel They are Cryogenically Heat treated and Stress relieved to a Hardened Rockwell C 28-32 Spec, and Nitrite Treated (QPQ/Melonite) for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition.The Barrels are manufactured under the ISO 9002 Quality System, and go through a Final Inspection before shipping. MELONITE/NITRIDE/QPQ TREATED: READ ABOUT THIS PROCESS BEING BETTER THAN CHROME LINED BORES These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more Finicky  processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as Parkerizing or carbonizing. ACCURACY: Our H-Bar Barrels are capable of 1/2"" MOA 5 shot group at 100 Yards. This means all 5 shots will be touching.  SPECIFICATIONS:  Length: 16"" Profile: H-Bar Competition Rifling: 1/10 twist, 6 groove button rifled Chamber: .7.62 x 39 Gas System Length: Carbine Alloy: 4145 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel Nitride Melonite lined bore and exterioir for superb corrosion resistance!

Our M4 Competition barrels offer the accuracy of a heavy barrel but the lighter weight approaching that of an M-4 ""pencil"" Profile. M4 Profile for increased Strength, and Cooling, while Reducing weight compared to Standard 18-20"" heavy barrels. Custom Machined from solid Bar Stock of Chrome-Moly Steel Hardened to 26-32 RC Spec and then Cryogenically Stress relieved and nitride/melonite finish for prolonged accuracy under heavy use/competition. NITRIDE TREATED:READ ABOUT THIS PROCESS BEING BETTER THAN CHROME LINED BORES These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding.  PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT: Our Socomm Barrels are capable of 1/2""-3/""  MOA 5 shot group at 100 Yards.

Walther PPS (Police Pistol Slim) is short recoil-operated, locked breech pistol that uses modified Browning-type locking with tilting barrel. Frame of the gun is made from impact-resistant polymer. Trigger is double action only, striker fired, with pre-cocked striker system. This system requires a manual recocking (by partial slide retraction) in the case of misfire. Gun is fitted with automated trigger safety and firing pin block. The removable backstrap of the grip, QuickSafe, offers an additional ""storage type"" safety; once backstrap is removed, the firing pin is automatically decocked and gun is blocked until the backstrap is reinstalled. Sights are low profile, with rear sight adjustable for windage.

Comes with everything pictured: pistol, two different length mags (7 & 8 round), second backstrap, original molded case, lock, and owners manual."

The finish is black hardcoat anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 Class 2.  These uppers take PA10 ejection port cover assemblies as well as PA10 forward assist assemblies.The AR10 platform does not enjoy a common design between manufacturers, like the AR15.

I have owned this rifle for about 25 years, I got it from my father who owned it for about 35 years, this rifles were issued to the U.S Army in the early 1900's for target training purposes, rifle has the U.S Mark and flame, it shoots .22 short, has a very heavy and thick barrel, the original stock was replaced somewhere in the middle 60's with a heavier target stock with cheek rest, the rear site was removed and the rifle was tapped to accommodate the scope mounts, I'm selling the rifle without a scope but it comes with the original military issued sling, rifle has 85 or better percentage of bluing left on it and it's in perfect working order, great for shooting aspirins at the range.
To the collectors....  I realize this rifle is not all original there for I'm pricing it accordingly, inquire only if serious about making a deal.
Buyer must have a valid FOID card and a ISP bill of sale will be signed by me and by the buyer.
Again this rifle functions and shoots perfectly, please contact me with a phone number and I will call back as soon as possible.

I'm open to a trade for a decent ak47 or a cetme 308, I have a valid foid cardThanks for looking.
