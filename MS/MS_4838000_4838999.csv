Featuring a lightweight synthetic stock, custom shop quality components, and protected with a hearty Cerakote® all-weather finish, the Model 48 Patriot is ready for any condition Mother Nature has to offer. With available cartridge chamberings ranging from the 22-250 Remington to the hard-hitting 35 Whelen, there is a rifle for everyone in the Model 48 Patriot lineup. When used in conjunction with Nosler’s Trophy Grade Ammunition, shooters can expect sub M.O.A. three shot groups at 100 yards. Whether you are punching holes in paper, or putting meat in the freezer, the Model 48 Patriot is sure to become the rifle you reach for time and time again. Quality components through and through, the Model 48 Patriot features a stainless steel, hand-lapped, match-grade stainless steel barrel, finely tuned trigger, and glass and pillar bedding ensure accuracy, while the fiberglass stock and Cerakote® all-weather finish provide unmatched all-weather performance. A push-bottom style, lightweight floorplate allows for easy unloading, and a soft recoil pad helps to tame even the harshest recoil.
 1. A composite stock reinforced with aramid fibers and an aluminum bedding chassis provide a lightweight and durable platform for the Nosler Model 48 action. Weather will not cause the stock to swell or warp, leading to consistent shot placement in any condition. 2. Contoured to accept any standard 2-Piece scope base that would otherwise fit a Remington® Model 700™. 3. A shadow-line cheekpiece provides a consistent and comfortable cheek weld for repeatable shoulder position. 4. Guaranteed MOA Accuracy when used with prescribed Nosler Ammunition. 5. 1” Recoil Pad and straight stock design reduces felt recoil. 6. Fully free-floating barrel ensures maximum shot to shot accuracy. 7. All external metal surfaces are coated with the NIC Industries Cerakote™ finish. Designed to protect against rust and wear, Cerakote™ products can withstand tremendous impact with no coating loss, and can resist corrosion in a variety of tough conditions. We have found Cerakote™ to be the best firearms finish available. 8. A lightweight aluminum floorplate allows for quick unloading, without adding appreciable weight to the rifle. 9. A textured finish ensures proper grip in cold or wet weather."

The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle.

The design is a rifle version of the popular Kel-Tec PMR-30 pistol. The same 30 round magazines are used. The single action trigger mechanism, bolt stop, ambidextrous safety levers, and mag catch are also identical. The CMR-30 rifle includes a collapsible stock and the 16” barrel is threaded 1/2”-28 to accept many different muzzle attachments. The multi-position collapsible stock allows for a short overall length of 22.7” with the stock collapsed, and 30.6” when extended. The long top picatinny rail will accept a multitude of different optics, and the removable under picatinny rail is included. The ambidextrous operating handles are non-reciprocating and latch in the forward position. The stock latch lever is also ambidextrous and located just in front of the trigger guard. An integral sling loop is included near the rear of the grip, on both sides.  The CMR-30 is constructed of hard-coat anodized aluminum for the upper assembly and rails and houses the steel barrel. The collapsible stock is made with aluminum stock rods, and a nylon butt plate. The stock was designed to have a natural cheek weld when extended. The grip, mag catch, safety levers, stock latch, and operating handles are made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel). The grip houses the frame which is made of aluminum. The bolt assembly houses a captive recoil spring assembly. Magpul® flip-up sights included. The extensive use of aluminum, and a lock time lower than most bolt action rifles makes the CMR-30 a very accurate rifle.Technical specificationsCaliber .22wmrBarrel length 16.1""Barrel threads 1/2""-28 TPIBarrel twist rate 1:16""Total capacity 30+1Weight empty 3.8lbsLength (Stock collapsed) 22.7""Length (Stock fully extended) 30.6""Length of pull (Stock to trigger) 10.3""-14.2""Height 6.6""Max width (Across operating handles) 2.9""Width across majority 1.2"""

The model K226 is suitable for ladies, youths or indeed most adult shooters as this particular model is of standard dimensions and not intended for smaller youths.

Construction is based upon a design typical of guns from the Brescia region of Italy, featuring two large hardened steel trunnions set into the receiver’s front inner side walls upon which the barrels hinge for opening and closing. A full-width locking bolt is set into the bottom of the standing breech face and this engages with a locking wedge recess machined into the monobloc breech below the bottom barrel; a conventional top lever operates the bolt. This arrangement is well established as being sound, efficient and reliable and Turkish maker Khan has adopted the system well. Barrels are built using the monobloc method, the breech block sides nicely jewel-finished, and chambers bored for 3-inch cartridges. The two tubes are joined by ventilated side ribs for lighter weight, improved balance and heat dispersion; they have been polished before being well blacked. A brass front sight is also fitted.

Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again. Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The .416 Barrett caliber brings new levels of precision shooting to the Model 99. With the enhanced accuracy and increased velocity of the .416 Barrett cartridge, this rifle offers incredible long-range precision. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. M1913 STEEL OPTICS RAIL, PARALLEL WITH BORE, 13.75 IN LONG (35 CM) UNITIZED BARREL AND ALUMINUM RECEIVER DETACHABLE BIPOD WITH ADJUSTABLE LEGS Model: Model 99 Rifle System Caliber: .50 BMG or .416 Barrett Operation: Single Shot Bolt Action Rail Length/MOA: 13.75” (34.92 cm) 27 MOA Weight: 25 lbs (11.4 kg) Overall Length: 50” (127 cm) Barrel Length: 32” Heavy (81.3 cm) Rifle Twist: 1 turn in 12” (30.5 cm) for .416 Barrett Magazine Capacity: Single Shot The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob. BORS instantly takes care of the data work by drawing from several tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors so you can focus on the task of achieving first round hits. After determining the range to target, simply turn the elevation knob until the BORS screen matches your target's distance. Internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature and barometric pressure, calculates angle cosine and displays rifle cant. The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic PC Software that's pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. BORS USB data cable allows the transfer of user programmable custom loads to BORS from his or her computer. Designed primarily to withstand military operations, BORS is rugged and able to operate with a variety of scopes, calibers and rifles. AROUND 800 ROUNDS OF AMMO ALSO AVAILABLE FOR SALE.

This rugged and powerful autoloading rifle is capable of delivering magnum-level power with pinpoint accuracy. From its matte black alloy receiver and hammer-forged barrel to its multi-lug bolt, this BAR is ready to put rounds right on target and meat on the table. The BAR LongTrac Stalker is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet. Action Length: Long Action Caliber: 300 Win Mag Barrel Length: 24"" Overall Length: 44"" The hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy. The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy. The matte black aircraft grade alloy receiver on the BAR LongTrac model is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform. The BAR is a gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel. The seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges. The strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration. The buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability. The bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves. The floorplate on the BAR LongTrac Stalker model is hinged, allowing access to the detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading. Magazine capacity on the BAR LongTrac Stalker model is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers. The BAR’s trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod. The generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves. The stock and metalwork on the BAR LongTrac Stalker model are intended to shrug off everyday wear and reduce game-spooking reflections. The charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard. The crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. The Composite buttstock on the BAR LongTrac Stalker model is user-adjustable for cast-on, cast off and drop at comb via interchangeable shims that insert between the stock and the receiver. All Composite stock models of the BAR LongTrac Stalker have overmolded panels on the pistol grip and fore-end to improve your grip, something you’ll really appreciate when shooting in cold and wet conditions. The well-formed recoil pad on the BAR LongTrac Stalker has optional interchangeable pads to let you adjust length of pull and greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching. Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling.  COMES WITH LEUPOLD SCOPE - VX1 3-9X40mmThe redesigned Leupold VX-1 series is better than ever.

490,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4838490,"For Sale:  5.56mm IMI Galil, Model 372, imported by Action Arms","Tustin, CA, Orange County, California","$ 2,650","Listed On: Friday, November 13, 2015",Rifles,Israel Weapon Industries                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Another Action Arms IMI Galil from Easy7 (if this site retained its past ads you'd be able to see I sold another top-notch Galil here about a year ago and the buyer is very happy with it). If you're reading this, you probably already know this rifle's durability and reliability are by which all other rifles are judged. Galils shoot no matter what. They don't fail to feed, fire or eject under ANY circumstance, and are the most accurate Kalashnikovs ever made. Not one of my Galils has ever failed in any respect, including this one. And, assuming you keep the bore clean, the gun will last for generations.

Unlike the last one I sold here, I can not in good conscience call this a 99+% and that is for just two reasons, one of which I feel I've more than made up for.

The first is the original owner (I'm the second owner, having bought it in 1986) stored, and likely carried, it with the stock folded. Great, except that doing so rubs the finish on the right side of the receiver and makes a mark. Some folks might not be bothered by that but you really can't say a gun is 99% with a mark like that, even though it comes with the territory. 

The second issue is the rear sight's tritium capsules either fell out or were never installed to begin with (the front night sight still works, and although fairly well faded, you can still see it in the dark). In any case, I didn't discover this until after I bought the rifle. And I didn't act on this little matter before the People's Republik of Oppressifornia made the idea of shipping one's “evil” semi-auto out-of-state a very iffy proposition, a situation, as we all know, made worse on a federal level shortly thereafter. Needless to say, Action Arms soon closed their doors forever and no one was offering tritium capsules to John Q. Public that I could find (the Internet wasn't anything like what it is today. It was either a very embryonic AOL or just SOL for us common folk back then, and that was that). 

Galil night sights with new tritium capsules are now available, but for $120 a set. So, why didn't I order them? Simply because nowadays combat optics are where it's at and I've addressed that issue to a “T,” rendering so-called night sights redundant (except on handguns and maybe some shotguns, of course).

Back when I was buying my Galils I examined their options for mounting scopes or some other form of optical sight because even back then “combat doctrine” called for some form of optic instead of iron sights. But I wasn't happy with IMI's solutions. ALL versions of their scope mounts had two serious drawbacks. The first was that mounting them would mar the surface of the receiver as they all slotted into the machined recess on the left side of the gun and I didn't like that idea. The second problem was they are all cantilever designs, meaning they held the scope at some distance away from their actual mating surface to the gun. Any accidental drop or unintentional side load could, and probably would, result in the slightest bend and you would no longer be sighted in. I didn't like that idea either. I was really surprised by this because at the time the perfect solution existed and IMI knew it as it came from the same folks that supplied them with everything they needed to know in order to build Galils; Valmet. Lord knows why they didn't take advantage of it. Maybe they didn't want to pay still more in royalties. But I took advantage of it and am very happy I did.

To the rescue came a top-drawer military component from Finland and that was a top cover made by Valmet for their M76 rifles WITH an integrated scope rail and back-up Iron Sight. As you know, the M76 (to be more precise, it was actually the Finnish RK 62, which later - in semi-auto form - became the civilian M76, both by Valmet) is the same gun Israeli Military Industries used to design their Galils. These top covers fit Galil receivers tighter than O.J. Simpson's gloves (except they actually fit). Once snapped onto place it is every bit as secure as the original top cover. I am being wholly honest when I say it feels like it's welded to the gun, it is THAT secure. And it has a beautifully machined weaver-like rail both riveted and welded to the top, on which ANY optic can be mounted as it's a simple dovetail base; an Aimpoint, ACOG, Holosight or a good old-fashioned 1-4x or 1.5-5x scope with an illuminated reticle. Why the Israelis didn't opt for this I don't know. Any of these, especially a good red-dot sight or one of Leupold's superb 1"" scopes with an illuminated reticle, are an infinitely better proposition than any iron sight, tritium-equipped or not. (Please feel free to argue with me on this point if you feel otherwise.)

With this base comes a one-piece set of 1 inch steel scope rings with its own mount for the base (see pictures). For the record I never did get around to installing a scope using this setup as my son immediately took possession of the intended Leupold and stuck it on his M76. (I couldn't say 'no' as his grades were too good, luckily for the both of us.) The crush tape within the rings are still new and unused.

Lastly, I decided to have the Valmet top cover Cerakoted by OC Custom Coatings to match the rifle's finish, which it does perfectly. It isn't Duracoated. It isn't painted. It's the real deal and I've got the receipt to prove it. It was done in a satin black to match the rifle and naturally it is gorgeous. The Valmet BUIS was left parkerized, however, to reduce any glare that a satin finish may induce (and even Valmet's parkerizing on the sight blade is a thing to behold, perfectly done). 

Now, if none of that appeals to you, I'll lower the price $120 so you can order the tritium sights yourself, and I'll keep the top cover with rail and the scope rings. That way, you can have tritium sights at no extra cost. You'll just have to find some other means to mount an optic if you want to. That's fair, is it not?

In addition to the above this beautiful rifle comes with 5 magazines (four 35 rounders plus one 50 rounder. Only two of the 35 round magazines have ever been in the gun), a non-marring sling and a HARD rifle case. Just about every FFL around here ships via United Parcel Smashers ground (you are welcome to pay for air shipment but you shouldn't have to). I did not fully appreciate how vital a hard case was until after I shipped my last Galil. It survived unscathed, but only just. So I went to the trouble of digging out a hard case from my storage. It's a Gun Guard brand, if that means anything to you. Rest assured nothing UPS does will harm the gun or its contents unless the truck crashes.

Great, hi-res pictures of everything upon request. Ask ANY question. I'll ship to any of the lower 48 the law allows if the buyer contributes 50% of the shipping (I'll cover the insurance entirely. To me this is fair). Thanks for your valuable time reading this!"

This Millett scope comes with lens covers, Sun Shade cover, cleaning cloth (unopened) original box, and paperwork.  I have listed this scope as “Used” because of small scratches on the turret top and on the side.  I purchased this at a nationally known sporting goods store as floor model.  I have never mounted this scope, as I went in different direction with my rifle.  However, because of the minor scratches, I could not in good conscience, sell this as new, even though I believe it qualifies.  There are no defects on the tube or lenses and only slight blemishes as described.

 ·        Heavy Duty one-piece scope body

·        Solid brass cam and guide tube zoom assembly

·        Reinforced power adjustment ring

·        Special seals retain the nitrogen gas and protect against fogging.

·        Superior coil spring system

·        Re-settable dials to zero

·        Anti-reflection baffles

·        Illuminated reticle option

Any questions please let me know.  I have done as best as I can in describing the scope.  This is a great scope for varmint hunting (which is what I had wanted to use it for) but believe it would work just as well for other small game, deer or antelope to name a few.  I am offering FREE SHIPPING to Winning Bidder, Continental US Only. Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico are actual cost only.

This is a 9mm (9x19, Luger, Parabellum), semiautomatic, striker fired pistol which holds 10 rounds in the magazine (10+1) and has standard 3 dot sights.  The pistol comes with three Wilson Combat marked factory magazines.

This model has been out of production for a few years; however, Wilson Combat does still offer new magazines, replacement parts and service if needed (which this pistol has not).  It is small enough to fit comfortably in the waistband, but is large enough to shoot well and hold 11 rounds of 9mm.  It has not given me any problems with ball ammo or hollow points ranging from 115 to 147 grains.

I can meet around Tallahassee on the surrounding area for a FtF transaction.  For a FtF sale I can provide my FL ID and CWP and I ask that you do the same.

Transferring to any dealer in the lower 48 is no problem.

Cash, money order, cashier's check, and paypal all work for me for payment, but I'm open to any other secure option.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions.

Initially the Vepr-12 was made at Izhevsk Machine-Building factory then drawings were transferred to ""Molot"" where Vepr-12 expanded to whole family of smooth-bore semiautomatic guns. Later passing the way for Saiga-12 030 Taktika.The shotgun (carbine) Vepr-12 is created by rather new development on Molot plant (Vyatskie Polyany). As a direct competitor for widely popular in Russia Saiga series shotgun the main purpose of new gun is sports (practical shooting under rules of IPSC), and also protection of the house and security personal. The Vepr-12 is the good weapon of support for militia and other armed divisions.Base design for the Vepr 12 was based on Kalashnikov machinegun or RPK that was tested with time and produced at the Molot factory, but in their engineers considered the requests of shooters-athletes, and additional elements were introduced to the shotgun - a double side safety lock, magazine well, last round bolt hold open, etc. These Vepr-12 series are issued in four configurations with different barrel length; 305mm, 420mm, 520mm, and 680mm.The smooth-bore Vepr-12's inherited the general configuration of machinegun (RPK) Kalashnikov, with gas venting mechanism and locking bolt carrier. Naturally, carrier group and a receiver were redesigned. The use of hunting ammunition, trigger group bolt automatic release, the self-regulating gas mechanism allows to shoot 2 ¾ or 3 inch ammo without additional adjustments. Aiming adaptations from Kalashnikov AK, with adjustable front and rear sight installed on the gas tube. The receiver cover is hinged and opens up-forward, as on the AKS-74U machinegun. In addition cover of a receiver has welded Picatinny rail allowing for fast and convenient installation of various optical sights. Feeding of ammunition is accomplished by utilizing plastic single-row magazine with a capacity 4-8 cartridges, bolt hold lock system was integrated in all shotgun configurations, allowing for bolt carrier to be locked in open position after discharging last round (for quick magazine reloading). Butt stock is metal, skeletal design with rotating sideways cheek rest. Outside the buttstock is covered with plastic for comfort of firing in hot or cold temperatures. Handguard and gas tube has an additional directional Picatinny rail for installation of laser, tactical light or any other accessory.The safety lock is similar AK rifle, but has additional levers on the right and at the left, making weapon handling safer and more convenient. The basic configuration short barrel Vepr 12, which is mostly manufactured for Russian market, has an additional safety mechanism blocking fire when buttstock is in folded position.

This gun was part of our Lend/lease program we had with some of our allies during the war.The gun was originally chambered in 38 Smith & Wesson but in 1942 when it was sent to Great Britain for the war it was rechambered in 38 special. After the war it was nickel plated by Parker Hale of England. The purpose for this was to hide any scratches or scuffs made from combat and to make it more desirable to sell to the general public. After the nickel plating was done it was sent back to the United States and sold for civilian use. It originally came with wooden grips which at some point in time someone replaced with rubber ones. This would be considered a K Frame revolver."
