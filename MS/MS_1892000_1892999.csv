Here is a bit of history on this gem:

The Remington Model 51 is a small pocket pistol designed by John Pedersen and manufactured by Remington Arms in the early 20th century for the American civilian market. Remington manufactured approximately 65,000 Model 51 pistols in .32 ACP and .380 ACP calibers from 1918 to 1927, though small numbers were assembled into the mid-1930s.

John Pedersen designed or helped design many firearms for the Remington Arms Company. He had worked in concert with John Browning to design the Remington Model 17 which served as the basis for the Remington Model 31, Ithaca 37,Browning BPS, and Mossberg 500. He designed the Pedersen device that converted the M1903 Springfield into an autoloading intermediate-caliber weapon. Pedersen later worked for the US Army and provided competition to John Garandbuilding an autoloading rifle to fire a full-power rifle cartridge. His design used lubricated cases and a toggle-bolt system much like the Luger pistol but eventually lost out to the M1 Garand.Made in .380 ACP and later in .32 ACP caliber, it was marketed as a pocket pistol. While the European market embraced small-caliber pocket pistols, the American market favored revolvers. More expensive than the Browning-designed competition, the Model 51 was not much smaller. Furthermore, Remington was a company known for their long guns; their handguns had previously been limited to revolvers forced to play second fiddle to Colt in terms of sales.Due to these factors, the Remington Model 51 enjoyed only limited commercial success. If competing with cheaper single-action blowback autoloaders made sales difficult, the stock market crash made sales nearly impossible. 

General George S. Patton owned a Remington 51 and was thought to favor the weapon.

Stock # MMH132816RT. SERIAL # 97xx. A very rare Luger variant that is referenced in “World of Lugers, Proof Marks” by Costanzo. The pistol was originally a WWI Luger, dated 1916, and was reworked somewhere between 1923-1935. Some of the known Simson markings on the pistol are the E/6 on the toggle, and the Crow/BC proof, which indicates acceptance of an out of spec item. The pistol was re-numbered during the rebuild, somewhat in the fashion of a Russian Capture, which, of course, this is not a Russian Capture gun. Grip conditionrates 85%, and the finish rates about 80%, with some freckling on both sides of the receiver, and some very noticeable pitting on the takedown latch. The pistol has a “Stark” magazine, the number does not match the gun. This is a very rare Luger that belongs in an advanced collection, and it should be regarded as an investment piece as well.."

Here is a bit of history on this gem:

The Remington Model 51 is a small pocket pistol designed by John Pedersen and manufactured by Remington Arms in the early 20th century for the American civilian market. Remington manufactured approximately 65,000 Model 51 pistols in .32 ACP and .380 ACP calibers from 1918 to 1927, though small numbers were assembled into the mid-1930s.John Pedersen designed or helped design many firearms for the Remington Arms Company. He had worked in concert with John Browning to design the Remington Model 17 which served as the basis for the Remington Model 31, Ithaca 37,Browning BPS, and Mossberg 500. He designed the Pedersen device that converted the M1903 Springfield into an autoloading intermediate-caliber weapon. Pedersen later worked for the US Army and provided competition to John Garandbuilding an autoloading rifle to fire a full-power rifle cartridge. His design used lubricated cases and a toggle-bolt system much like the Luger pistol but eventually lost out to the M1 Garand.Made in .380 ACP and later in .32 ACP caliber, it was marketed as a pocket pistol. While the European market embraced small-caliber pocket pistols, the American market favored revolvers. More expensive than the Browning-designed competition, the Model 51 was not much smaller. Furthermore, Remington was a company known for their long guns; their handguns had previously been limited to revolvers forced to play second fiddle to Colt in terms of sales.Due to these factors, the Remington Model 51 enjoyed only limited commercial success. If competing with cheaper single-action blowback autoloaders made sales difficult, the stock market crash made sales nearly impossible. General George S. Patton owned a Remington 51 and was thought to favor the weapon.

A Railed Free-float hammer-forged upper!

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine-length gas system.   The M4A1  style barrel is high pressure tested, magnetic particle inspected and then phosphate coated to mil-specs.  Barrel is finished off with a Midwest Industries SS12G2 12"" free-float rail, low-profile gas block and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 Flat top AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring M4 feedramp cuts & T-marks,  these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.

These uppers may have slight imperfection in the finish of the upper or the rail that will not affect function.  The imperfections include, but are not limited to, forge marks under the finish, nicks, scratches, or finish irregularities.   This particular one had what looked like some white scuffs on the rail which rubbed right off.  If there is a blem other than that I dont see it.

 Each upper is assembled to order, and test fired to check gas function.  Does not include bolt carrier group or charging handle.

This gun is new and has never been fired. It has a 22"" heavy bull barrel and features a new laminated thumbhole stock, new BSA ""Sweet 17"" 3-9X40 rifle scope. The scope is very good quality and is made for 17 HMR rifles. I like it just as much as my Nikon scopes. I purchased this rifle as a project and just completed it tonight. I replaced the stock and slapped a new trigger guard on it. This is not an upgrade that is done easily. The trigger guard and screws are not in stock anywhere, not even Marlin has them available for private purchase.  Lastly, I am including 4 unopened 50 round boxes of Federal Premium V-SHOK 17 grain TNT HP 17 HMR (200 rounds total). My total investment is $500.00.  THE LEATHER SLING IN THE PICTURE IS NOT INCLUDED.

There are a few very small nicks on the stock. The rifle got up against an ammo can in the safe.  The nicks are not noticeable unless you really look hard for them. I can send pictures if you like.

PRICE IS $475.00 FIRM, which is less than my investment.  A similar .17HMR rifle WITHOUT the heavy bull barrel and without a scope is $440.00 at the store and that's if you can even find one.  FTF Knoxville area. Buyer will be required to show valid Tennessee State I.D or HCP (preferred)."

I lost access to the farm I used to ""blast away"" at so this pistol has not been shot since the first range test.  2 boxes of Remington 115gr, and 1 box of PWN 155gr were shot that day, 60 rounds total.

The entire 9.5 inch barrel assembly is from GPI custom gumworks here in Jax.  The gas block has their logo laser etched on it. ($245 + $22 + $12 ) See the parts on their site.

The forearm is a 10"" Troy ALpha rail.  It can easily be removed to place the little rails where you want them. Still have the box for the forearm. ( $160 )

The charging handle is a Bravo Company ""gun fighter"" with medium latch.  ( $45)

The BCG is also Bravo Company.  BCG's have become more avail. but not Bravo Company. ($185 )

These are all "" before panic"" prices except for a $15 added for the BCG, I paid $170 for it at Gun Gallery, beach blvd.  Total, $800 for parts alone.

$725 For the upper

The pistol tube is the best.  It is PWS enhanced.  It does not have a castle nut.  It stays firm and indexes with hex screws.  Read about it here.

These are sold out everywhere!  To tame the pistol system with super sonic ammo, I put in a Wolfe extra power spring and heavy buffer.

Has all the goodies like:

 High impact synthetic grip, forged steel barrel, military style adjustable sights, able to accept high capacity mags, coated with scratch and chip resistant paint. 

Oh, the barrel has a hole in it for the bullet to come out, it has a trigger, (but that's extra), it comes with a stock for your shoulder, the rifle also has a grip for your hand so you have something to hold on to when you want to pull the trigger. The barrel comes with lanes and groves to put a spin on the bullet for you(I'll throw those in for free).

The mag comes with a spring inside of it so it can push the bullets up, the trigger is set up in a way so that it actually fired the rifle when you pull it. I have plenty of top of the line gear for it if you want to pay more than retail for used gun show NcStar crap.

I also have steel cased ammo that I will sell with it for twice the price I paid for it at Walmart, even though there is plenty of 223 and 5.56 ammo on store shelves right now, today.  

I also have cheap 22 ammo that I want to make a fortune on. You know you can't find 22s anywhere cause I buy it all up before you can, so if you want to shoot, hit me up.

The Tactical Machining AR-15 lower receiver is built from 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the United States. The contour is fully machined leaving no flash marks from the forging and we take extra care when machining our lower receivers resulting in tolerances that are tighter and fits that are better than other lower receivers. We adhere to mil-spec tolerances to ensure that our lower receiver remains compatible with any quality aftermarket parts you can find. After the machining process is complete the lowers are checked for quality and shipped off to our finishing facility for type III hard coat anodizing.

Mine is a true Arsenal rifle, stamped Arsenal Inc!! These are not imported anymore with the Arsenal stamp!

Made in the popular 5.45x39.5 caliber. The brainchild of two of the best gun makers in the world, the SGL31-61 rifle is manufactured at the world-famous Izhmash Factory in Russia then imported and remanufactured by Arsenal Inc, Las Vegas, NV into its final configuration. 

The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31-61 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31-61 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31-61 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

This is one of the finest AK systems imported into the US. Anyone that truly knows AK systems, knows that Arsenal Inc. makes some of the best AK's in the world. I purchased this AK back in December brand new. When I purchased this rifle, it came configured as a true Arsenal SGL-31 61 with the black polymer furniture on it. I have since upgraded the rifle with new furniture and converted it to a sgl-31 94. Meaning I removed the standard buttstock and put on the ACE folding stock. The Ace folding stock is the second best folding stock made, behind the true folding stock that's standard on the 94. The Ace folding is made of light weight Aluminum and features an unique push button actuation method that securely locks the stock to the side when folded. It is a rock solid stock with no ""wobble."" I chose this stock because of the robust and durability characteristics it displays. 

Now for the features and upgrades:

*Chrome lined hammer forges barrel 
*front sight block with bayonet lug
*stamped receiver and magwell dimples for no magazine wobble (its an Arsenal!!)
*Ace Folding stock with locking mechanism
*US Palm battle grip
*Tapco G2 Trigger group
*XS Night sights (still have original sights as well that will come with package)
*Kreb's custom retaining plate
*Midwest Industries Rail system
*AK74 muzzle break
*Magpul AFG (black)

I ordered 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines from KVAR.com at $50 dollars each that I will include in thie package. Two of which are brand new, never used. The remaining 6 have been used but are in great working condition. These are the best magazines ever made for this rifle. It also includes 1 factory 10 round magazine. This is great for sighting in or hunting! 

I will also include 1,000 rounds of 5.45 ammo to get you started with this rifle.

Arsenal sgl-31 61...........................$1199.00 from KVAR.com
Accys/upgrades.............................$500
Magazines.....................................$400
Ammo..........................................$200

Basically over $2200 in this package. These prices are legitimate and can all be verified online with a little research. I know where I bought everything from and know what I paid for them. 

Obviously, I can not expect to get the same amount of money that I put into it. Having said that, I will not respond to lowball offers, please be respectful and I'll, in turn, do the same. Please make a reasonable offer and we'll talk!

*******I will take $1500 cash for the entire package if you buy it before the end of July!****"

Up for grabs is a very gently used, rare and hard to get version of the H223 from Hogan Guns.  If you are reading this you probably know about Hogan, how they used to make all of POF’s stuff ( Patriot Ordnance Factory ) and are well-known in the AR world for outstanding quality.  They are backordered for several months.  Their gas piston design is second-to-none.  This is the Rolls Royce of AR15 ‘s.  Extremely accurate and a blast to shoot, we had a customer order this rifle early last year.  He claims to have put exactly 200 rounds through the rifle, I have no reason to doubt him, the gun isn’t even broken in.  I personally cleaned it and took it to the range just to see how it performed.  I meant to only put a box of 20 through but that soon became 60 or 70 because almost all my shots were touching at 100 yards, and I let a couple fellow shooters squeeze a couple off…which they regret because it’s hard to go back to your standard AR after shooting this baby.  So less than 300 rounds total, I ran a cleaning rod through the barrel a few times, and gave the rifle a quick cleaning…easy to do with the piston system, bolt and carrier stay nice and clean. 

The original buyer of this rifle traded it back to me for a handgun and some cash that he needed to fund his $1500 custom bow that he just had to have.  He mounted a Cabela’s brand 4-16x Alaskan Guide scope, 30mm tube, 52mm objective, duplex reticle.  The hunter rail on this upper allows for the use of some big optics, due to the rail section cut down ( tactical model has top rail running the full length of the upper).  It’s a decent piece of glass, good bright sight picture, comes with original box and paperwork, flip-up lens covers that barely fit and a set of see-through covers.  If you are not wanting this optic with the rifle because you have your own set-up in mind, we can deduct $250 from the final winning bid and we will remove and keep the scope and rings. 

Comes shipped in the hard case with the manual on a CD from Hogan (saves paper) and the 30-round Troy Battle Mag that the rifle came with originally.  It also includes extra rail sections that can be mounted on the sides or bottom of the handguard (which is cut from one solid piece of aluminum, super light-weight but incredibly strong).  This rifle has all the desirable features: Hogan Gold-standard trigger, ambi bolt release, VLTOR adjustable stock, safety selector markings color filled red and white like an H&K, etc.

  If you are looking for something unique, special, a good investment, a rifle to fend off the zombie hoards, or an awesome tool to dominate the local coyote or prairie dog population, look no further.  Maybe you want a long barreled DMR ( Designated Marksman Rifle ) to mix up that stash of 16” AR’s you have in your safe.  No disappointments here.  Pics are of actual rifle up for sale.  If this rifle is not legal to own in your area, please do not bid.  No reserve.  Thanks for your support of a Veteran-owned business.

NIGHTFORCE:C356
The U.S. military asked for a scope that is exceptionally fast and applicable to a wide range of targets at various distances. The 3.5-15 x 50 F1 NXS is the answer. The reticle is located in the first focal plane, which has distinct advantages in high-stress situations and when the user might encounter targets from up-close to 1000 yards or more. A first focal plane reticle remains in the same visual proportion to the target across the scope’s entire magnification range, making it especially appropriate with rangefinding reticles. Combined with Nightforce highly tactile and intuitive adjustments, it makes for a scope that is extremely quick, accurate, responsive and utterly reliable.

The 762-SDN-6 also functions as a superb multi-caliber suppressor for multiple hosts, providing excellent performance on 7.62 NATO, 300 AAC, 6.8 SPC, 6.5, and 5.56mm NATO.

It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets. 

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."

LWRCI’s new Individual Carbine was developed in response to the requirements of the U.S. ARMY’s Individual Carbine program. It features some radical new features while maintaining the same basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture.

The new IC and its variants feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch/release, magazine release, and fire control mean that right and left handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. It also means that when the shooter transitions to their offhand side due to barriers or injury, they can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. This new lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The upper of the new IC is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced in 2011. It features a 2-position gas block, user configurable rail system, and a revolutionary new upper receiver that has the mounting base for the handguard machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight. The 2-position gas block has settings for Normal and Suppressed fire. The full size 14.7” IC is compatible with the U.S. M320 40mm Grenade Launcher, the M26 breeching shotgun and the M7, M9 or OK3S Bayonets. 

The new Individual Carbine from LWRC International is proof that at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward."
