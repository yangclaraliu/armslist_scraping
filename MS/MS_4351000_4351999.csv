He is dragging his feet, so I thought I'd put it up here for a little exposure before the Winston Gun Show this weekend. I gave $400 for it. That's what I'd like for it. I'd just as soon trade it for a non-safety SAA - particularly for a 44 Special.  I'd also consider other centerfire handgun trades, or a 357 Rossi levergun. I could add a little cash, maybe $50 or so. As usual, I'll need to see your permit.  FTF around Lexington ,NC or at the Winston Gun Show Saturday morning. Thanks"

This is the model with Novak sights (Front sight is a tritium night sight) and the accessory rail. 

The Lionheart LH9 features a unique ""Double Action Plus"" action where when you chamber a round, you can simply just press the hammer up so it is decocked and then instead of a long, heavy double action pull. You have a long, kind of two stage trigger pull where the first part of the trigger pull quickly brings the hammer down to single action. If you release the trigger when the hammer comes back, it will stay back until you fully press the trigger. (kind of hard to explain in text)

Comes with the Original case (which is a nice case), 1 13-round magazine that fits flush with the base of the grip and 1 15 round magazine. And it also comes with a Incog IWB Holster (lightly used)

Has a low round count (less than 500) and is a great shooter.

Marlin Model 444 big bore lever action that chambers the powerful .444 Marlin cartridge.  Manufactured in 1969, this is a ""1st Model"" and features a 24"" barrel with two barrel bands and a straight gripped Monte Carlo stock without checkering.  This rifle has no cross-bolt safety.  Overall condition is excellent with light handling wear only.  I'd grade this rifle at 97-98% and free of rust, pitting, cracks or chips.  The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent.  It comes with a vintage Tasco 3x9x40 rifle scope that's in very good condition mounted in Holden Mod 704 See Thru Scope Mounts that allow the use of the iron sights.  This way the scope can be zeroed for longer ranges and the iron sights zeroed for 100 yards and in (just an example).  It also has a JM marked hammer spur (extension) as well as a leather sling.  The .444 Marlin cartridge provides exceptional stopping power in a fast handling lever action rifle and is fully capable of taking any North American big game.  Also included will be 14 soft point cartridges.

I wore this combo on my hip, everyday at work, for two years. Almost identical to the Glock...which is a great firearm, but better ergonomics are awarded to the Springfield XD..in my opinion... The XD also has the grip safety that requires you to be gripping the pistol for the trigger to fire, versus snagging the trigger causing an accidental discharge. Glock nor Springfield has a mechanical safety so this is a nice touch.  Also comes with the original XDGear holster, the XDGear magazine loader assist, factory hardshell pistol case and lock. And I will throw in two boxes of brass .40 S&W ammo. I'm moving and need the add'l money. Priced well at $400.00 even. Text 502-294-4 two two 5 or reply by armslist email"

This is my norco custom 70s import that i built myself. Your first impression is norinco? Thats a chinese gun. BUT anyone who knows 1911s knows these are special guns. Nvrmnd where its made. Besides that most guns are imported from somehere. But heres the thing, they no longer import these so the ones that are here are it. Second the steel on these norcos are made from melted down tools and the like. VERY VERY high quality steel. Alot of guys that shoot competitively seek these out for custom builds. Well i didnt build mine to race but i did build it for protection. I striped it down and left only 3 stock parts on it besides the frame. The sights, because i dont care for night sights i like combat sights and these are already dead on. Second is the barrel because its already a match barrel it comes amazingly fitted and is accurate as hell. Third is the trigger because i like the small solid combat gi trigger. Now the rest of the parts including the hammer, hammer spring, sear, beaver tail, mainspring housing all of it is WILSON COMBAT. so basically heres the run down. I wanted a 100% reliable full size hair trigger accurate punisher 45 and i built it myself. Designed it perfectly to be a man stopper. It shoots any size 45 ball or hollow. The trigger is extemely light and crisp. Absolutely no failures of any kind. Not even before the tune up. Full length tungsten guide rod. Look i can go on and on but put simply its the best 1911 ive ever shot. By far. Ive had kimbers, colts, rocks, all those other brands and honestly those guns are the reason i built this 1. Yea ive had kimbers fail. Any other 1911 ive had to run wc mags to get it to work. My gun will run on 10$ colt mags. Ive put about 6-700 rnds of all sorts with no probs at all. The only downside i see is that it is heavy. Remember its made from high quality real steal from the good ol days. But on the other hand it helps to control recoil. Just depends on how you look at it. Now ive never shot a dan wesson or republic forge or wilson combat but i have to believe my gun will run with any of them. Its smooth as silk the recoil is just a dull push. The recovery and follow up shot is very natural and fast. Its basicly a custom wilson combat on a norco frame. Now heres the thing im just seeing whats out there. Im not desperate i dont need the money. This gun is my baby. I can build a 1911 with my eyes closed its very safe and 100% reliable. I wont come down. I wont trade it for no junk. But i am open to all kinds of offers. Ars, glocks, anything but its gotta be fair. Keep in mind how rare and special this gun is. Even colts are run of the mill. This gun is custom tuned. Email only for now. Thanks ppl i hope you all can appreciate as much as i do."

Brand new Taurus Ultra Lite, I have yet to shoot this weapon.
I bought it as an extra carry gun and after carrying it for about a week I've decided to stick with my G19. This would be a great gun for females, small framed men, and old folks, I'm none of those but I handled it just fine too.
It is a 5 shot .38special with a +P rating, single/double action, and super reliable (because, well, it's a revolver)

And the original box and all paperwork.

325rds Federal AutoMatch, 40 grain solid lead, 1200fps

I'd consider trades of equal value, I like Glocks, a Sig p250 would be nice, M&P Shield, hell anything that catches my eye.

I'd value this bundle around $525-$565.

Product Description
The GI LTC is a big gun with a small price tag. Para's customers asked for a compact version of the GI Expert and here it is. They wanted it lightweight, so it comes with an alloy frame. They asked for custom extras like a beavertail grip safety, a competition trigger, and Para's fiber-optic front sight, so you get them all at a production price. Anodized steel slide with a nitride finish. 8 + 1 capacity.

Double Action Only pistol with one 12 round mag.  No box or papers.   The gun functions perfectly, any wear is just cosmetic.  The DAO trigger is 6.5 LBS.
The gun has a good bit of holster wear, and the finish shows wear on many high spots.  The night sights are dim, and just about done as far as providing any illumination.  I got the gun as a project gun and intend to refinish the stainless slide and replace the night sights.
  In my opinion you could either make a re-hab  project out of it, are just carry it as is,  good car gun, since it is already worn any wear or scratches from carrying it would not be a concern.
I rate the gun’s condition at approx. 95% and its value is approx: $650.00. I would like to sell this gun and I am asking $560.00. 

Cash only and a FTF meeting only. Ohio DL required, and CC permit preferred. I will do a bill of sale if desired. In my opinion this is a good gun, and to the best of my knowledge 100% functional and as described above.  I am offering No warranty or guarantee, this is an AS-IS sale. I am willing to meet within about 25 miles of Parma Ohio. I will answer all messages first-come-first-served.

The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is the most stable, collapsible stock available due to the innovative cam-lock system developed by Bill Rogers, famed shooting instructor, inventor of holsters, target systems, and other related products, and his staff of engineers. The cam-lock system completely removes any slop or play inherent with collapsible stocks. Once the desired stock position has been selected, the stock can be locked down solid simply by clicking the cam-lock lever upward. Pressing the quick-release lever will disengage both the cam-lock, and the detent pin, allowing you to quickly readjust the stock position. The innovative Rogers Super-Stoc™ also removes the guesswork involved with buffer tube sizes. Our stock will fit both a Mil-Spec sized buffer tube as well as a Commercial sized buffer tube with a few simple adjustments. Weighing in at only 7.3 oz, it is among the lightest stocks available, but rugged enough to pass a 36"", fully loaded drop test. The Rogers Super-Stoc™ is simply the best collapsible stock for your AR style rifle.

Some Lipsey Exclusive guns happen fairly fast, others take some time. The Bearcat Shopkeeper is one gun that has been on the drawing table for several years. It all started with a visit by Lipsey to one of our biggest and most loyal dealers in Alabama. He showed them a beautiful little 3"" barreled Ruger Bearcat. Everyone agreed it would make for a great Lipsey's Exclusive, and after talking to Ruger, they agreed to take a look at it.
Ruger decided to produce a round butt or birdshead type frame to go along with the 3"" barrel. In addition to the 3"" barrel and birdshead gripframe, they had to use a couple of other unique features to make it all work. Due to the short barrel, Ruger had to use a ""button head"" cylinder pin and a crescent shape ejector rod so that the spent cases could easily be extracted from the cylinder. Ruger is also using a steel ejector rod housing that matches the rest of the gun verses the aluminum one used on the standard Bearcats.
Even though it took 3 years, the wonderful engineers at Ruger made it happen and now we have a true ""Shopkeeper"" size Ruger Bearcat.
This is one of those guns that once you put it in your hands, you will have to get one.

Bought this when the Gen 4 was first released, and it has been a safe king ever since. No scratches, no dings, basically brand new, just test fired (one day at the range, no more than a box of ammo through the pipe) I figured since I'm not using it someone else can get some joy from firing it down range. I like to put some minor touches on all of my firearms, which is the reason for the upgrades without practically any use. I keep all my firearms looking clean and brand new at all times (using frog lube for the last several years exclusively) 

Not in a rush to sell, the price is set and the trades are specific.

If the trade I am asking for is worth more we can work out a deal or vice versa. 

Also, trade for the XD, revolvers, or Sigs I mentioned will be more of a direct trade as those I just like more than glocks and are worth more to me. Serious inquiries only, thanks!"

The gun has been reliable for me. Only problems with liberty ammunition light weight JHP. Ate hydrashock just fine and fed about 20 Speer Gold Dot without issue. I love the gun but shoot mostly Glock in USPSA and the grip angle difference is proving to be a problem. I trust the gun but not myself enough to EDC it. Which is really what this gun was built for. The gun has some honest wear, nothing drastic. The HexMag sticky grip decals seen in the photo have since been removed.
