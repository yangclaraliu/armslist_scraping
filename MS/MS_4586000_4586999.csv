Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design.

The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A shooters have come to love and expect.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design.

The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A shooters have come to love and expect.

Each new rifle in the M.A.R.C.901 family is an evolution of the LE901-16S, which means the upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Colt upper receiver chambered in .223 Rem (5.56 x45 NATO) with the conversion kit (INCLUDED.) Bolt and magazine controls are ambidextrous for flexibility and ease of use. Be it for whitetail hunting in Maine, target practice at the range or law-enforcement use, the Colt M.A.R.C.901 family of rifles have the power and versatility you need. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel, and users can now find their perfect balance with customized mounting of accessories such as optics, bipods, lasers and more.

Factory night sights
FDE frame with backstraps
3 magazines (10 rounds)
Apex Tactical FSS and Aluminum Flat Face Trigger
Apex Tactical jig
Factory hard case, manuals, spent case
Original trigger parts

Background:
I am the original owner, and purchased this about a month ago. As soon as I got the gun I ordered an Apex Tactical forward set sear and aluminum flat face trigger. I had never shot an Apex trigger M&P before, but now I know what all the support is about. I've never felt a better trigger on a striker fired gun. It has the reliability of a striker fired M&P but with the smooth and light trigger pull of a 1911. I put 100 rounds through it and it shot great. Super easy follow up shots. I was originally going to shoot USPSA limited 10 with this but chose to continue shooting production with my Glock 34. This gun really needs to be seen, these triggers really are amazing. The gun itself goes for around $600 with the factory night sights. The Apex parts cost me $175. You could always buy this, install the factory trigger and sell the Apex parts and have yourself a great gun and some extra cash.

Price:
I am asking $575 firm.

Buyer must have valid Ohio driver's license. Buyer must be able to legally own a handgun. I prefer buyer to have valid CCW license.

This DPMS AR-15 A3 Bull Barrel Upper Receiver Assembly comes fully assembled and ready to install on any standard small pin, mil-spec lower receiver. The versatile A3 Upper configuration is constructed of Forged 7075 T6 Aircraft Grade Aluminum, and features a Picatinny Top Rail for ease of mounting optics. The 20"" Stainless Steel Bull Barrel sports a well-executed target crown for superior accuracy, while its additional length and heavier contour moves extra weight to the front end of the rifle for faster shot-to-shot recovery, decreased perceived recoil and less muzzle flip. 

This upper is chambered for 223 Remington, and uses 1 in 9"" Twist Rifling that is ideal for use with light- to medium-weight projectiles of up to about 69 grains. A Rifle Length Free Floating Aluminum Handguard rounds out the package and further aids to enhance accuracy potential by removing all shooter-induced pressure from the barrel. Comes complete with a single rail gas block, commercial bolt carrier assembly, charging handle, forward assist, ejection port door and shell deflector.

The XPS2-0 runs on a single 123 battery, making it small enough to leave plenty of rail space for rear iron sights, magnifiers, and other tools (the shortened base requires 2.75 inches of rail space maximum). EOTech also eliminated the battery cap and latch and replaced them with a simple O-ring tethered cap, helping the sight achieve better sealing. Note that the XPS2 is not night vision compatible.

     Up for sale is my LC9 NRA Edition...and let me tell you, this is one sweet shooting gun!
There has been less than 200 rounds through this gun, so it's not even broken in yet....  Oh, and did I mention the amazing camo pattern, and the newly installed Talon grips!

Included with the LC9, are the original factory Ruger gun box, unopened Ruger gun lock, all paperwork/warranty info, gun key, 2 magazine plates (flat and extended), factory fired round, new Talon grips, factory magazine, and Ruger factory zippered carrying case.  

This is an amazing gun, but as I already have other LC9's in my possession now,  and the need for money is great right now...I need to let the pride of my LC9 collection go.  I have taken several pictures, but can only post three.  Feel free to contact me with offers, or inquiries for other pics.  I'd love to hear from you.

Upon purchase, please be prepared to show a valid Indiana carry permit, and be willing to sign a release form/receipt.  

Thanks much!

It does have some wear along the slide courtesy of the previous owner. However, it is in good condition and shoots without skipping a beat. In my opinion, it is the best pocket .380 that you can get and it shoots surprisingly well.

Rifle was always shot from a bench and bi-pod. Carried into the field only once. No scratches, no scuffs, looks like new and still has a factory sticker on the stock.

$380 for rifle, ammo, and limbsaver. It's about an $80 savings. The Nikon 3-9x50 BDC scope and bi-pod are not included. I'm not crazy about it, but to avoid you having to re sight the rifle, I'd  sell the mounted scope and rings for an add'l  $220 (you save $20+ on the scope and rings, save a $40+ box of ammo, and the time needed to sight in). $600 firm for everything shown but the bi-pod.

In all, you save 80+20+40 = 140+time+ piece of mind it's a shooter

The rifle is hunt-ready. It's sighted in at 2-1/2"" high at 100 yards. This puts you about 2-1/2"" low at 220 yards. The 444 is the fastest and flattest shooting straight walled cartridge for ohio deer.
