This isn't your Big 5/Cabela's $200 M91/30. This is a collector's rifle, not a rifle you buy to chop down and throw in a tacticool stock. This is an original configuration pre-war Finnish rifle, not some cheap war time Soviet rifle with production numbers in the millions.

$500 for the rifle. The only trades I'm interested in are AKs (depends on the make/manufacture; nothing too tacticool) or HK handguns (USP 45 preferred, no .40S&W or P30s). I know it's a long shot with trades because I doubt there are many Finnish collectors out there, but I will be willing to combine my Finnish rifles for a trade.

The vast majority of VKT rifles were arsenal refurbished post war and this rifle was never arsenal refurbished. This rifle has a matching bolt, receiver, barrel shank, and magazine floorplate. The barrel is a VKT manufacture. There is still some cosmoline in the rifle as I never got around to cleaning it all out.

The bayonet is an original with light rust and some very minor pitting, and the scabbard has the wear you'd expect leather to have being 70 years old. The vast majority of these bayonets were scrapped after the war. Reproductions push ~$150, while originals on eBay push ~$550. Not for the faint of heart.

This isn't your Big 5/Cabela's $200 M91/30. This is a collector's rifle, not a rifle you buy to chop down and throw in a tacticool stock. This is an original configuration war time Finnish rifle, not some cheap war time Soviet rifle with production numbers in the millions.

$400 for the rifle, $450 for the bayonet, or both together for $800. The only trades I'm interested in are AKs (depends on the make/manufacture; nothing too tacticool) or HK handguns (USP 45 preferred, no .40S&W or P30s). I know it's a long shot with trades because I doubt there are many Finnish collectors out there, but I will be willing to combine my Finnish rifles for a trade.

I'd rather not ship these.  I""d prefer to sell them to someone who lives close enough to Federal Way, WA to pick them up in person, and pay cash.  I won't give you my exact address here, but the following address is within a couple blocks:  I'll give you my exact address if you decide to buy them.  An address very close to me is:

I'd consider shipping them, but the problem is it wouldn't be cheap.  It'd probably cost around $35.  But if you really want to maybe we could work something out.

I'm hoping there's a bored licensed/insured electrician out there willing to trade work for an m4 style rifle. New unfired etc

I'll explain the projects and if you have extra time and parts lying around.. I'm willing to provide some manual labor as well hopefully we can make a deal. 

Firstly:

I want to run power to my father in laws shed. Its about 60ft from the house.  He wants a couple motion lights/boxes on the exterior and lights and plugs on the interior. 

My best assumption is a trench would have to be dug for the wire to run underground adjacent to the driveway etc

Also,   id like to have a 220plug installed in my garage for my generator.  The panel is the basement on the same side of house as garage so hopefully just a quick run of wire down the wall and into garage

I know electricians aren't cheap but all I have is a new rifle to barter for it. 

So if you have extra materials(wire/outlets/lights etc) please give me a shout and hopefully we can set something up soon

Thank you"

For whacking and stacking swine, nothing delivers like our new Hog Hammer®. It penetrates even the thickest-skinned pigs with a Barnes TSX® Bullet at its heart. With all copper construction for 28% deeper penetration than standard lead-core bullets, it's the toughest expanding bullet on the market, offering near 100% weight-retention on-hog, while expanding rapidly to deliver devastating wound channels. Hog Hammer utilizes a flash-suppressed propellant for nighttime or low light hunts, and uses nickel-plated cases for reliable feeding in today's hog rifles."

I have here a Chinese made replica of a ""Microtech"" (yea they cloned Robbie Dalton's ""Ranger"" get over it) Halo style knife. This knife operates buy firing the blade from the front of the handle when the release/lock button is pressed. The dimensions of this knife are more similiar to the ""Halo 2 and 3"" models. The blade is 4"" long and actually thicker than the Microtech made variant with a blade thickness of 4mm. The lock up on this model is excellent and actually as good, or darn close to Microtech from my experience. Handle as is: I have it with an aluminum anodized (black) back piece, carbon fiber top plate, titanium charging handle, and the blued hardware. A ""deep ride"", titanium pocket clip was added to the aluminum handle (could not be added to the titanium handle) by a man who goes by ""STR"" on knifeforums.com 
Also included with this knife!!: A full set of internal parts the original aluminum top to the aluminum bottom, the original titanium bottom handle piece, a tri angle bit for take down/reassembly, additional blade. BOTH blades are shaving sharp. I sent then to Willey Knives in Delaware and had them reground to a 30 degree edge profile. You are getting an AWESOME value here."

I'm not really looking for trades other than the HK, but I suppose you an try me. I like striker fired 9mms (Gen 4 Glocks in particular), not really interested in Rugers or anything in .40. Any trade that doesn't include an HK45c would have to be pretty lopsided in my favor."

 One of two new offerings in Mission’s MXB series of crossbows is the Mission Dagger. Based on the MXB 320, the minimalist design, including the black squared stock, pistol grip and ventilated barrel, along with the short forearm and scope mount rail, fairly scream “Mission Crossbow.” (And if that doesn’t tip you off, the characteristic lack of a stirrup should make it obvious. More about that later.)

At 30 inches in length, it’s short by any standard—in fact, it’s Mission’s shortest crossbow to date. The 10-inch power stroke is even more remarkable, especially given the Dagger’s respectable speeds. It’s powered by the new WX-cam, a perimeter-weighted cam that hearkens back to the perimeter-weighted cams introduced by sister company Mathews on its vertical compound bows. The function is much the same: to increase efficiency by adding momentum while at the same time serving to reduce noise and recoil. That, together with the 220-pound split limbs, are behind the Dagger’s speed.

Adjustable draw weight is another Mission crossbow feature, and this is accomplished by simply turning limb bolts in the same manner as adjusting draw weight on most vertical bows. The Dagger has a peak draw weight of 220 pounds, adjustable all the way down to 125 pounds. (Even at the minimum 125 pounds, the Dagger produces more than adequate speeds up to 243 fps.) Mission dubs it the ALRS (Adjustable Limb Retention System), and it offers the added advantage of enabling shooters to relax the limbs for changing strings or cables without a bow press. It’s a very nice feature.

Earlier I referenced the lack of a stirrup. Instead, the MXB crossbows employ a tread that is inside the limbs, on either side of the barrel, which Mission refers to as the RS (Riser Step) Tread. Essentially, the foot is placed on the riser tread, instead of the more conventional stirrup, to cock the crossbow. Durable synthetic “bumpers” extend from the limb bolt insertion points on the outside of the limbs, and these are placed on the ground to protect the limbs when the crossbow is cocked. As Mission points out, this eliminates the considerable weight of the stirrup, and it also places the crossbow closer to the ground and farther away from the shooter’s shoulders as it’s cocked, which makes for an easier draw. It also tends to move the crossbow’s balance point farther back for better overall balance.
 The MXB series crossbows come with a soft case, quiver, three bolts, and, depending on the package purchased, one of several Hawke scopes. The package tested included the Hawke XB Pro Scope, variable from 1.5-5×32 with two-color illumination and a speed adjustment dial. Several optional accessories are available, most notably Mission’s new RSD (Removable Silent Draw) system, essentially a mechanical cocking aid that reduces effort by a factor of 25.
 Fit and finish on the model tested was excellent. Earlier I referenced the “minimalist” design features. I intended that as a neutral observation. Beauty is famously in the eye of the beholder, but to my eye, the camo quad split limbs and undercarriage, contrasting with the black barrel, stock, scope and cams, make for a sleek and sharp-looking crossbow.

Today it is still involved in the development and manufacture of handguns, submachine guns and hunting rifles. FEGARMY exports the majority of its weapons, which reach nearly every region in the world. The company's main customers come from the Unites States and Europe.About the Cartridge:Designed by John Browning and introduced by Fabrique Nationale of Belgium, this cartridge has achieved world-wide acceptance and has even been adopted as the standard pistol cartridge by several governments. One reason for the round's success is that it is the largest practical cartridge that can be easily adapted to small automatic pocket pistols. Ballistics fall far short of even the 9mm Luger, but still prove adequate for most self-defense situations.

MANUFACTURED TO MEET AND EXCEED DOD MIL-SPEC 961 STANDARDS. Bolts are made of 9310 steel. We went with 9310 because it has been proven to be stronger than the selected steel for mil-spec standards (158A Carpenter Steel). That is just one of the things about mil-spec, it doesn’t mean it is the best, but rather it is the best compromise between design and material cost for mass production for a desired function. We decided to stop compromising and offer a superior package by going with 9310 steel for BOTH the bolt and extractor. Leading manufacturers have successfully proven the benefits of 9310. However, we are one of the SELECT FEW that offers a 9310 Extractor. We machine our extractors from round stock giving our customers an absolute solution vs. offering a metal injection molded (MIM) extractor. 9310 negates all of these issues with increased strength at all the high wear points of the bolt (cam whole and LUGS, especially the smaller lugs adjacent to the extractor). All of our gas keys are staked as per Mil Spec standards. Bolts are MPI and HPT(batch tested)"

In 1857 they produced the first metallic cartridge breech-loading revolver. Their first double-action revolver was produced in 1880. In 1964 the company passed from Wesson family control, and subsequently several conglomerates took control of it. From 1987 to 2001 Tomkins PLC, a British company, owned Smith & Wesson. In March 2000 Smith & Wesson signed an agreement with the Clinton Administration in order to avoid lawsuits. This agreement was not at all liked by the gun owning public and boycotts and floods of used S&W firearms in the market nearly ruined the company. On May 11, 2001, Saf-T-Hammer Corporation acquired Smith & Wesson Corp. from Tomkins PLC for a fraction of what Tomkins originally paid. The new company, Smith and Wesson Holding Corporation, publicly renounced the Clinton agreement which was received positively by the firearms community.About the Cartridge:This cartridge was developed by John Browning and was adopted by the United States Ordnance Department along with the Colt-Browning automatic pistol in 1911. It has also been made the official military handgun chambering by several other governments, notably Argentina, Mexico and Norway. The 45 Automatic is the most powerful military handgun cartridge in use today. This is a heavy and powerful sub-sonic round. Although its muzzle energy can exceed 400 ft-lbs, its velocity and bullet weight creates a steep trajectory curve that limits its effective range to self-defense distances.Type PistolCaliber .45 AutoAction Recoil Operated Semi-AutomaticTrigger Double-Action / Single-Action (DA/SA)Safety Slide Mounted Safety / Decock LeverMagazine 6-RoundFrame Aluminum AlloyGrips Hogue Wrap around RubberSights Novak Lo Mount Front, Fixed 2 Dot RearBarrel Length 3.25 InchesOverall Length 6.5 InchesWeight 23.9 Ounces"

Includes cleaning kit and magazine. This weapon has already been converted, and is fully 922r compliant. Includes pistol grip, Tapco no-slap G2 trigger, and a stock with rubber butt pad and storage space for the cleaning kit. Barrel is chrome-lined, which is good news if you like to shoot inexpensive corrosive mil-surp.

This is not some Century parts kit. This is a newly manufactured weapon from the Izhmash plant in Russia. Don't settle for anything less. 

On 16 July 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama signed an Executive Order banning the importation of Russian-made firearms (which include the Saiga) into the United States in response to Russian military intervention in Ukraine. The price of these guns will continue to go up.

Absolutely flawless, no issues whatsoever. Like new condition. This weapon was cleaned once to remove factory grease, then stripped and cleaned again after firing a couple of mags to ensure accuracy and reliability. No FTF/FTE or other issues. Irons are dead-on from the factory.

I also have several hundred rounds of 5.45x39 Hornady Steel Match and Silver Bear in a .50 cal ammo can. Don't settle for Wolf, and don't worry about hosing down your gun after firing corrosive mil-surp. This is brand new, top-quality, non-corrosive ammo!

Asking $800 or best offer for the weapon.
Asking $900 or best offer for the weapon with ammo. The ammo set me back $210, so you're getting several pounds of free bullets.

Will trade for a KSG, PMR30 + cash, Ruger GP100 + cash, any Calico weapon + cash, or a quality 1911.

I have a second weapon in 7.62x39 (AK-47); same condition, same price. You can see both weapons in the pictures. I also have new 7.62x39 Brown/Silver Bear ammo for that weapon.

I also have a brand new UTG quick-detach side mount dual scope rail, which you can see in the pictures.

I'm willing to take $1700 for everything, or trade for an M1A.

PS:
Please don't send offers that include ""junk guns"". This is not some $500 Century WASR-10 with canted sights. I am open to reasonable offers, but please understand that this is a newly manufactured authentic Russian weapon that is now banned from import. An unconverted Saiga (which will need about $250 worth of parts and gunsmithing) is $700 from Bud's. I am in no hurry to sell, as the price on these is going to keep going up. Thanks for taking these things into consideration when making an offer."

I prefer MOA or BDC based reticles and adjustments. I can also include your choice of American Defense mount, I have two options, one AR style and one low style perfect for bolt guns. Can provide pictures.

I would trade straight up for the same Mark AR scope with a fine duplex reticle, the MilDot tends to cost $50 more.

Otherwise looking to see what else is out there. I have two new rifles that need glass, one Rem 700 AAC-SD 300BLK and one AR10.

If anyone has a Leupold Mk4 LR/T or Nightforce NXS and would like some cash + my scope in trade I may be interested in trading up.

I would love a Nightforce NXS 2.5-10x32 (C468) or 2.5-10x42 (C459) with MOAR reticle, possibly the next level up 3.5-15x50mm (C429).

As far as Leupolds go Id like something like a 10x40mm, 3.5-10x40mm, or 4.5-14x50mm with a duplex or TMR reticle.

Iv done plenty of research and scoured Armslist, Snipershide, ARFcom, etc to see what is out there. Im not here to lowball, I am willing to pay a reasonable price, just want to see whats out there locally"

The Ruger 10/22 VLEH features a 16"" Ruger CHF (cold hammer forged) barrel and a Hogue over-molded stock with the Ruger crest embossed on the bottom of the grip. The VLEH retails for $599. 

The best feature on this rifle is the 16"" CHF barrel with a parkerized finish and the VLEH is the only rifle that has it. To me, it provides the perfect balance of accuracy and nimble handling characteristics. The Ruger target model barrels have the same CHF barrels but are longer and consequently, more suited for bench rest shooting. Importantly, I replaced the Ruger stock trigger assembly with a much better Ruger BX trigger group. I also installed a set of Tech Sights peep sights. The combination of the Hogue stock, the 16"" CHF barrel and Tech Sight peeps sights gives this rifle a very fast target acquisition capability and with the BX trigger, accurate, consistent and fast shot placement. 

The upgrades are as follows:
Tech-Sights TSR100 peep sights w/ .920 bull barrel adaptor= $75
Ruger BX trigger= $90
Extra Ruger BX-25 25 rd. magazine= $25
Total for upgrades= $190

I have over $650 in this rifle as it sits and that's what you would have to spend minimally if you bought a Ruger VLEH and added these upgrades. Price is firm.

The original Ruger scope weaver style mount and screws are included and unused. Also included is the original box, owner's manual and Ruger trigger locking mechanism."
