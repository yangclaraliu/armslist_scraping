Factory information:
""Vyatskie Polyany Machine-Building Plant MOLOT"" (a.k.a. MOLOT) was founded in 1940 mainly for producing the Shpagin machine pistol PPSh guns, which was one of the major infantry weapons of the Soviet armed forces during World War II.

In the 1950-60s the MOLOT factory was the only producer of the 9mm Stechkin automatic pistols APS, 7.62mm Kalashnikov light machine guns RPK and 30mm automatic grenade launchers Plamya AGS-17, which were highly recognized for their outstanding quality and reliability.""

VEPR's parts are manufactured using the same equipment as the very well known lightweight machinegun RPK. Its extra heavy duty receiver and hammer-forged barrel provide much better accuracy and durability. A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore.

The rifles come with adjustable open sighting devices (iron sights) and a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without using a riflescope. ""

I have a very nice FNS-40 that I just purchase last spring. It has night sights, 3 magazines, and a leather paddle holster. It has pretty much been in the night stand by my bed for home defense. I have shot about 50 rounds through it. The gun is very well balanced, shoots nicely, and comes with an extra backstrap so the fullness of the grip in your hand can be changed. I also have 500 rounds of 40 S&W ammo that I will sell with the gun for $175 extra."

The Henry Pump Action Octagon .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom's apple pie, a restored '57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue octagonal barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. It also sports a grooved receiver for mounting a scope, and Marbles semi-buckhorn fully adjustable rear sights with standard 3/8"" dovetail slots enabling you to change sights if you choose to do so. Beautifully finished American walnut is used for the stock. The .22LR version can hold 15 rounds of .22LR and as much as 21 rounds of .22Short. If you must extract an unfired cartridge from the chamber, Henry has included a grooved release button at the right front of the trigger guard. When pressed back, the lever unlocks the forend allowing it to be retracted to eject the unfired round.

It's in really great condition. I'm building a bolt gun and will use that for longer range shooting so I'm looking to sell my Elcan becuase I won't have a specific need to shoot longer ranges with my AR. Many would say this is really the best combat optic available because it's like a red dot site combined with an ACOG. I agree and have found that the bullet drop reticle is spot on while using 62 grain M855 military ammo. It's darn close with anything else from Russian crap to heavy match grade stuff. It was designed to be use with a 16'' bbl with the 62 grain m855. These are around $2,200 new. I've listed some things I'd want to trade for but it never hurts to shoot an offer. I can send more detailed pictures to people who are seriously interested. I also have an email from Elcan verifying that the sight is authentic per the serial number; so there is no scam here. It comes with the box, manual, and the killflash. Thanks for looking!"

Honestly, this is one of my favorite guns, and if I didn't have more pressing priorities right now I'd be keeping it. This is probably the most accurate .22 rifle I've ever fired, even more so than my 10/22. It is in excellent condition. Comes with a green padded case shown in the picture. I added some leather gripping to the forend to give the rifle a more western look but it can be easily removed if thats not your thing. Action on this thing is smooth as butter, and there's few things in life more fun or satisfying than running through 15 rounds on a lever action rifle. Makes you feel like Clint Eastwood, Chuck Connors, Lee Van Cleef, or whoever your western hero is. Anyway buyer must posses a valid Arizona I.D. and be willing to sign a bill of sale for my own personal records. This is a great rifle for a fair price.

This ammo sold out across the country almost immediately following the sanctions against Russia last year. According to one of their largest importers, SG Ammo, whether or not we will receive any more is questionable, and the factory may be producing for the Russian Gov't rather than US sales because the sale price is double in Russia vs. the U.S. 

If you own a weapon chambered in 7.62x39mm, you want to have some of this in your emergency stash. The bullets are sealed at the case neck and the primers are sealed as well. The bullets are boat tailed FMJs that have an air pocket at the front end, which means they fly straight and they tumble and fragment reliably. This ammo is remarkably accurate our of my SBR. Huge difference between Golden Tiger and Wolf when it comes to consistency and accuracy. Don't take my word for it, do some research and see for yourself.
