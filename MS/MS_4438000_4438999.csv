I purchased it with new, unissued metal and a re-purposed stock. The bore, receiver, BCG, bolt, mag, etc, are all in excellent condition, however the stock is a little dinged up. 

All serial numbers on this rifle are matching and the entire rifle is stock, with the exception of the sights. The front sight post was replaced with a slightly thinner one to aid accuracy. The rear sight leaf was removed and replaced by a tech site rear aperture sight. This also contributes to the rifle's excellent accuracy. 

Here is a link to the tech site website in case you are not familiar: 
http://www.tech-sights.com/sks.htm

I also have the original sights and they will be included with the rifle in case you want to restore it to its original form. 

I estimate that I have put 400 rounds down the pipe, so it's safe to say that the rifle hasn't seen much use. It was cleaned after every range trip.

Neutral-center-of-gravity trigger design for a crisp, clean pull. Trigger is adjustable from 3-4.75 lbs. Ambidextrous composite stock and reversible cocking spur. Includes: DuraSightÂ® Dead-Onâ¢ one-piece scope mount, CrushZoneÂ® recoil pad for improved shooting comfort and QuakeÂ® ClawÂ® sling. Cal: .50. Barrel length: 25"". OAL: 40"". Wt.: 6.35 lbs.

These are amazing rifles. Comes with one magazine and factory paperwork. From the factory: The TAVORÂ® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situationsâ¦or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the usersâ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVORÂ® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines â but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. Payment of the weapon plus shipping and handling can be made with Postal Money Order/Certified Check or Paypal. Shipping charges are extra to Alaska or Hawaii. Insurance is not mandatory but highly recommended for your protection."

This rifle is in excellent / pristine condition.  It has a stainless barrel and receiver, and a black composite / synthetic stock, with nice soft recoil pad.  It has a 17"" barrel and short (youth) length of pull, but an small-statured adult can use it if you keep the optics far enough forward.  Ultimate lightweight and fast-handling woods rifle, with low recoil but significantly more energy and flatter trajectory than a than a .30-30 win.

Note that the optic shown in the pictures (a brand new / never used Trijicon RMR-DI with 9 MOA green dot), is NOT included with this rifle, but is available potentially if you really want it (for an additional $595, which includes the Picatinney mount).

Price is $640.00.  This price INCLUDES a brand new box of 20 Remington Express Core-Lokt Reduce Recoil loads - this ammo is $36.99 plus shipping right now at www.midwayusa.com - go check!

For comparison purposes this complete rig including the optic shown there, is only 5 lbs, 15.5 oz.

The LCP utilizes a double-action only, hammer-fired mechanism, with the hammer recessed into the rear of the slide to prevent snagging. The double-action only firing mode makes it simple to use in stressed situationsâno levers or switches to rememberâjust point and shoot. The LCP features low profile front and rear sights integrated onto the slide that do not snag on clothing when pistol is drawn from a concealed position, and all sharp edges have been eliminated on the LCP to aid in concealment and to reduce wear on clothing. This LCP model features an alloy steel slide with a blued finish. Right-handed shooters can comfortably reach the magazine release on the LCP with their thumb, while left-handed shooters have no problem using their trigger finger. The mag release pushes in easily, but not so easily that the magazine pops out unexpectedly. Unlike many small semi-automatic pistols that operate with a blowback action, the Ruger LCP operates on a locked-breech system, which mitigates recoil and does not necessitate the user to pull the slide back against an excessively heavy recoil spring during loading. The LCP also has a manual slide hold-open latch for inspection and cleaning. The Ruger LCP is a well-designed, reliable Semi-Auto Pistol that one can count on in an emergency.Manufacturer: RugerModel: LCPCaliber: .380Action: Double ActionBarrel: 2.75"""

(Information below was taken from an NRA article on NM Garand's. I added a few âadded notesâ as to this Rifle for your information.)
Between 1953-1955 Springfield Armory produced the first of the NM series rifles the NM-1 (Type-1), serial numbers will be between approximately 5,800,000 and 6,100,000. 
Most of the unaltered original Type 1 NM rifles will exhibit the following characteristics
-Markings on right receiver leg: Drawing number, â6528287-SA;â Heat Lot, T 1 to T 10 - Z 5 to Z15 (added note: This Rifle receiver drawing no: F6528291 Heat lot; Z6A, Which matches Springfield Armory records for NM receiver. Left side receiver is stamped with ""S"")
-Barrel: Marked âTâ for (targeted); âPâ for (proofed); âSA F6535448â (Add Note: This Barrel is marked ""SA F 6525448 drawing number with two ""S"" stamps over the F); Month and year of barrel production; Heat lot code, âmâ (magnetic particle testing) and Defense Acceptance Stamp (Added Note: This Rifle has additional inverted ""P"" with punch mark center ""P"" loop which was used as early NM marking).
-Bolt: â6522887-SAâ (with heat lot code) (Added Note: This rifle Bolt ""6528287-SA)
-Windage Knob: âDRCâ
-Elevation Knob: âWCEâ (Added Note: This rifle has ""DRC"" Elevation Knob)
""""It should be noted that the early production examples (1953-1955) may have different parts from those listed above."""" Stocks for NM-1 Rifles were not glassed, but rather hand selected for tight fit and uniform wood grain.
Springfield Armory engineers and armors worked closely to prefect the Nation Match 1 rifle.  
The exact number of Type 1 National Match rifles made is unknown. There is a much-published chart purporting to give a breakdown of M1 National Match production from 1953 to 1963. 

This is a rare find for the shooters or collector. NM-1's are rare in this condition.

Note: Buyer Pays: Shipping and DOJ registration fees
I will consider reasonable offers. 

This is a nice accurate shooting rifle in excellent condition and all the marking as stated above.. For Shooter or Collector. Rare find!
Please, contact me with any other questions you may have about this M1 Garand."

I have a very High End Custom Built Field Dark Earth AR15. I am a Certified Licensed Gunsmith so this isnt a sloppy build done by an amateur, this is a very High Quality Custom Rifle that was Professional Built with only the best of the best parts. I am looking to either outright sell this rifle for $1600.00 or wI'll trade for Handguns, Rifles, or a combination of the two with cash. I would prefer to trade for a Sig Sauer Carry Pistol and cash or comparable brands with cash. NO 380's and I DONT HAVE PAYPAL AND WILL NOT SHIP!!!  I will list the parts used to build this rifle and will provide every receipt for each part in this rifle to the new buyer (Total cost of this build for parts alone was well over $2500 and when I am done adding them up will most likely be right at $3000.00. So this is going to be the deal of the decade for someone.  I am selling this rifle due to the original person who wanted it built flaking out and not being able to pay for the build once I finished it.)  Anyways here is the itemized part list.  Any questions or offers call or text me at REDACTED if no answer leave a messege I will call right back but text is fastest response.  If you have something else to offer let me know and maybe we can make a deal.

 Might be more I have forgot and if I remember I'll update post.
