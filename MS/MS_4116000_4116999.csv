	Hey Everyone,
	I have up for trade or sale a sweet AK47. This is a wasr10/63 Romanian AK with chrome lined barrel. It is in great condition and is already an awesome little setup and is one of the nicer wasr10/63s I’ve seen. It will come with 3 metal 30 round magazines and 1 metal 5 round magazine. I also have some ammo available as well. I have the factory wood furniture i could include for extra or swap out if desired. 
	Also included is an installed collapsible and side folding ATI butt stock with adjustable cheek rest. A installed Guntec USA rail setup that replaces the upper and lower hand guards. This also has the optional optic rail mount on the side of the receiver. Also has the cleaning rod as well from my other AK (this one didn’t have it from the factory). 
	I mainly am looking for cash, but I’m not in a hurry and i don’t “need"" to sell it either. In terms of trades, I am “somewhat” open. Although, I mainly am looking for: AR15 patterned rifle (must be metal upper/lower and a factory unit, not a home-brew setup),  partial trades would include GP100, Security six 357, certain rifles or pistols. Honestly, just shoot me an offer, worst I can say is no! Some trades i can add boot one, some trades will be even, some will require boot on your end. All I ask is you be fair on your value and so will I. Need to meet up in Norman on this if at all possible due to my schedule. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Up next is my Arsenal Saiga .410 AK based shotgun.

I bought it as a base gun.  Then, I added the Midwest Industries 4 rail handguard, the Hogue overmolded grip, and the Tapco 6 position stock.  I bought two SGM Tactical 10 round mags to go with it as well.

So, here is a rundown of what is in this gun:

Arsenal Saiga- $699
Midwest Industries handguard- $125
Grip-$20
Tapco stock-$45
(2) SGM 10 rnd mags- $100

I have right at a grand in it.

These are hard to come by and this one has never been fired...EVER.  I built it, then put it in the safe.  $700 cash takes this one.  No trades.  I will not hold for anyone.  Show up with the cash, and you take it home.

Because this sling holds the rifle close to the torso, fast transitions between rifle and pistol are possible simply by swinging the rifle to the small of the back or along the side. 1.25 Inch Quick Detach (QD) Swivels at each end, attach to all LaRue handguards and any stock with a 1.25"" QD socket. The forward-section of the sling has a sewn-in QD Swivel connected to a small side-release buckle, allowing the rifle to be quickly dismounted while wearing cumbersome chest gear and bulky helmets.

The sling can be shouldered off the right or left shoulder, depending on shooter's preference. Once slung, the length can be shortened to desired length by pulling on the strap. A cam locks the length in-place.. The lightweight aluminum and steel adjustment cam is the familiar ALICE strap adjustment cam used by the military for years. The 3"" pull-cord makes releasing the cam easy, even with gloves on or in the dark.

I was going to buy an 18.5"" barrel but $110 (Midway) but figured I would try selling it as it is. That way the buyer can purchase the barrel type/length of their preference.

Great condition with maybe 1000 shells through it...only used it for plinking during camping.

Also have an almost brand new Eagle Industries case that can be carried like a case or used as a backpack.  $50 if purchases as a combo. 

So $200 for everything or best offer.

ALSO INCLUDES: 2 extra accessory rail sections for the hand guard, 1 modd'd P Mag to allow the follower to tilt a little, 

Built a 5.45 upper, bought 3 crates of surplus ammo. Before all my ammo arrived the ATF bans 7n6.  Took it to the range a couple times & shot up half of a tin (540 rd). Sure I ran it a little hard those days, but I let it cool between magazines, and its a melanite bore heavy profile barrel and the bore is bright and perfect. Ejection was good strong and consistent at 3:30.. I have a short vid of me doing a mag dump, it ran really great. 

Because of the corrosive primers, both times I cleaned the everloving hell out of it in the kitchen sink w/ soapy water, then dried it at 170f in the oven for a few minutes, the oiled it w/ oil base lube (rem oil), so it is in excellent condition. 

With the 7n6 ammo suddenly more costly to replace, and demanding cleaning regimen, I decided that having this extra chambering and upper was just not for me. I've sold the SF stock. I sold the five and half tins of the original six I had ordered. http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_7_133/1409135_WTS_76N_5_45_surplus_ammo_F2F_in_FL__GA_or_SC.html 

upper and charging handle are standard. HG is and a Middy JP FF Tube. I rounded off the back of the front sight rail so that it won't chafe the thumb. I will include a couple extra accessory rail sections. 

Barrel: Ballistic advantage 8.3"" melanite/QPQ coated inside and out, new for $140 currently: 
http://ballisticadvantage.com/8-3-inch-545-spr-pistol-performance-barrel.html 

KAK slim flash can ($35) on there that protrudes past the HG. The HG is actually longer than the barrel so you would not be able to use a typical flash hider comp or brake on there w/o shortening/replacing the hand guard. 

BCG: Ballistic advantage phosphate coated, shot peened HP/MPI: bought it for $75. Carrier is a BCM M16 carrier. 

Gas Block: .750 BRT Pinnable low pro ($40). I got and drilled/pinned it myself so I'd never have to worry about locktite failing w/ hard use. This makes the barrel and gas block fitted parts, another gas block could be used if it a clamp on type of course, but this upper really works great and you wouldn't run a suppressor on this upper so I see no reason to ever replace it: 
http://www.blackrivertactical.com/concrete5/micropin-gas-block/ 

I travel around by car for my job alot all over SC, GA, FL. I can fly w/ it too no prob. Flying to NC & VA next week... 

If course, if you own AR15s, for you to leagally own this upper requires that at least one of your AR lowers is a SBR or pistol, or new stripped. 

w/ a $100 handguard, basic CH, gas tube, $50 upper & $50 carier, it would still cost over $500 easy to build, plust the effort. 

I'll also sell some of those HK416 mags if interested... 

Possibly interested in a trade for 22 LR barrel or upper. I alreay have a CMG Ciener type rimfire bolt but find accuracy through 5.56 barrels too poor."

I am selling it because I bought a new CCW so I don't need this one. This gun looks and feels exactly like the famous Walther PPK used by James Bond. I've only fired about 300 rounds through it and never had a failure to feed/eject. It is a very accurate gun for its size with very low recoil.

I don't have any shells for it and don't plan on buying any because I am not going to keep it. I was told by the previous owner that it was appraised by a firearms expert at $950 in it's current condition but that cannot be confirmed. I have looked up the serial number and it was manufactered in 1954. I would say the condition is good to very good.

Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.
The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.
The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

I have everything the gun came with box, paperwork, and trigger lock. the gun itself is a 12GA. 2.75 chamber and the original barrel was 30"" and could only handle target loads, so I wrote Remington and found out if you got a regular 1100 barrel it would shoot regular field loads so I bought a 26"" barrel for pheasant hunting, that's included but I wont split them up. the 30"" barrel came with 5 choke tubes. it also has the adjustable comb, and the wood on the gun is absolutely beautiful. I only took the gun hunting maybe three times this year, and maybe has 125 rds thru it mostly trap shooting as that's what its designed for. Im looking to get $1250 for the whole package, or id be willing to trade straight up for a new browning A5(wood stocked version) 12ga or im open to other guns as partial trade let me know what you have worse I can say is no. I like pre Remington marlin levers (been looking for a .308 marlin express), really want a Remington 700 mountain LSS (laminate stocked stainless barrel) in .280 im located in chester county, I go to Bass Pro and cabelas pretty regularly so that is always a possibility and I get up around lake nockamixon about every other weekend.

I am selling an ar-15 that I recently started building. My reason for selling it is because my wife and I are expecting a baby soon so I really won't have time (or money) to finish it. I have several other ar's that I built so seeing this go isn't really heart wrenching. All that would be needed to complete this rifle is a barrel, hand guard, muzzle device, and a set of sights. If you want the rifle to finish it but do not know how to install the needed parts (or have the tools to do so), let me know and I can help you install everything. I have all the necessary tools and know-how. The parts that I have on this rifle are as follows with the prices I paid:
DPMS Stripped Lower Receiver - $135.00
DPMS Stripped A3 Flat Top Upper Receiver - $103.99
Spike's Tactical Enhanced Lower Parts Kit - $169.95
Magpul MOE Stock Kit (Already Pinned) - $69.99
Magpul ASAP Sling Attachment Plate - $29.99
Magpul MOE + Grip - $22.75
Magpul MOE RVG (Rail Vertical Grip) - $22.95
BCM Gunfighter Medium Charging Handle - $47.99
Forward Assist Assembly - $18.49
Ejection Port Assembly - $9.99
Spike's Tactical Punisher Skull / American Flag Ejection Port Cover - $9.95
Midwest Industries Low Profile Gas Block (.750') - $42.99
Mid Length Nitromet Gas Tube - $16.99
2x Magpul P-Mags (15 round mags in a 30 round body) - $43.98
Total - 745.00

The HK45 Tactical comes standard with a threaded barrel and night sights. With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator s hand for optimum shooting. The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Using HK's unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. All HK45 pistol series are made at HK's American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting. ariant 1 is a DA/SA with a manual safety/decocking lever) on left side of frame.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: 745001TA5Category: PISTOLSType :PistolAction :Single/DoubleCaliber :45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Barrel Length :5.16 inCapacity :10+1Safety :Safe ActionGrips :Interchangeable BackstrapsSights :NightWeight :27.68 ozFrame Finish :BlackFrame Material :PolymerBarrel Type :ThreadedSlide Description :BlackCase Type :Hard PlasticHK HK45 Tactical link to deguns.net"

The HK45 Tactical comes standard with a threaded barrel and night sights. With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator s hand for optimum shooting. The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. Using HK's unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. All HK45 pistol series are made at HK's American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting. ariant 1 is a DA/SA with a manual safety/decocking lever) on left side of frame.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: 745001TA5Category: PISTOLSType :PistolAction :Single/DoubleCaliber :45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Barrel Length :5.16 inCapacity :10+1Safety :Safe ActionGrips :Interchangeable BackstrapsSights :NightWeight :27.68 ozFrame Finish :BlackFrame Material :PolymerBarrel Type :ThreadedSlide Description :BlackCase Type :Hard PlasticHK HK45 Tactical link to deguns.net"

Gun works great and comes with sales receipt and everything a new one comes with.  (ie. trigger lock, keys, papers, magazine plates).

The only issue is that one of the magazines malfunctions, as in it does not hold more than a few rounds or so im told. So for all intents and purposes assume only one magazine is fully functional as two magazines are included.

Description From Trijicon:

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system. It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included)."

The barrel was cut down to 16.25"" and the end was threaded with a standard 1/2"" x 28 thread, so it should accept standard muzzle attachments.
The factory front sight was then machined so it screws onto the end of the barrel and appears to clock back into the correct position to use the iron sights.  I never fired the barrel with the iron sights, so I cannot verify the sight alignment.  
I fired maybe 200 to 300 rounds through the barrel, so it's like new.  
I had a dot scope on the little rifle and was using it to shoot steel plates and it worked fine for that."

I fired 200 rounds of m855 through the rifle last summer when I was home in Kentucky. The rifle has since been cleaned and locked in a safe. I do not live in KY anymore so now it sits in storage at my mother's house. I have since fallen out of love with the rifle although it functions flawlessly and is quite accurate even with milsurp ammo. I am currently in the process of downgrading my firearms collection and my loss is your gain.

I currently live in Washington so the sale would have to be from FFL to FFL but I'll include the transfer in the price of the rifle. Feel free to contact me with any additional questions you might have."
