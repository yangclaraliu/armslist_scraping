The other is a 16 gauge auto, not sure if it is sweet sixteen, it is in rough shape and has been fired by me, have fired roughly 300 rounds. The stock is old and worn and the barrel looks to have sweated coming in and out of a safe without it being cleaned every time. The 16 looks to be older than the 12 so I believe the 16 is in the 60s and the 12 is in the 70s. But I am not sure. Can send better picture if you ask. Asking $300 cash on the 16 and $600 cash on the 12. 

If interested call or text REDACTED, have other firearms on other listings. Located in Wallingford ky 41093, pick up only in Wallingford ky. 

Only trades that would interest me would be a AK-47 or a AK-47 with cash. Don't be offended but a AK-47 is not worth over $700 to me. I prefer I sell the Brownings and buy a AK-47 from a legitimate firearm dealer for $300-$500."

It has seen modest use in my hands as I was shooting on a college budget but was owned before me. When converting the gun I couldn't get the wood hand guard off the original gas tube and ended up buying and using a Tapco gas tube + Hand guard instead. 

The Norinco SKS has been modified with a Tapco Intrafuse Stock system where you have a piccatinny rail on the bottom for accessories as well as the gas tube. Therefore the rifle is incompatible with any folding bayonet however I still have the old one that comes with it except I lost the spring.

It's a great shooter and comes with: 
1 40 round steel magazine
2 20 round Tapco magazines
Original 10 round box magazine (if you want to covert back to wood)
Original Spike bayonet minus spring
Original Cleaning rod
Original Sling
Bipod specific to the SKS bayonet lug 
Original SKS gas tube 
Additional Tapco piccatinny handguard + rivets for a SKS gas tube.
Additional rubber buttpad for comfort (The tapco kit doesn't provide one)

Because I have kept all of the original equipment and matching # parts, if you bought your own wood furniture set you could easily convert it back to the traditional style.

Now read carefully as I will blatantly disregard anyone who doesn't follow these instructions:
I want Cash only, no trades of any kind whatsoever.
When we meet up I will require that I look at your Nevada Driver's License. That is to 1) Confirm you're a Nevada Resident 2) Confirm you are over 18
When I sell you this rifle I will provide 2 copies of a Bill of Sale (one for me, one for you) where I need you to print and sign each. The Bill of Sale requires no information from you BUT your signature itself. 

Feel free to email me or text REDACTED with offers, I will work down the offers first come first serve to whoever gives me the closest cash offer to my target price. I work swing shift so mornings to early afternoons work best and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

A few years back I purchased a new Glock 36 because it fit my hand perfectly and I loved the sights.  Put 50 rounds down the pipe to test function and accuracy, then cleaned it and put it in the safe where it has sat ever since.  Great pistol, but I'm more comfortable with revolvers.

This is the subcompact, slimline, 6+1 45 ACP model, designed for concealed carry for individuals with smaller hands.  This is a very reliable, accurate, and soft recoiling pistol.  Pistol is like new, never carried.  Comes with original box and everything it came with, 4 factory mags with optional +0 finger-rest baseplates, bore brush, 2 custom IWB holsters, and I can add ammo to the deal as well.

I am looking for a pre-lock 442 in excellent condition.  A bit of a turn line and minimal amount of holster wear is fine, but lockup needs to be tight.  No interest in one that's been shot loose or has half the finish worn off.  Strongly prefer the pre-lock 442.  Would consider a later model with the lock, as well as the 438, 642, 638, and 640.  Would have a possible interest in other Smith J-frames as well.  Might even consider a Taurus if it is a ULCH, Total Titanium, or No View model.  Not really looking for a Ruger or Charter Arms, but would consider offers.  Can add ammo to match what you have or sell at a reasonable price.  Can add cash for the right gun (Scandium AirLight, Performance Center, etc).  NO INTEREST IN SELLING, TRADE ONLY.  Local transaction only.  Only interested in J-frame 38s and 357s.  Might consider an old alloy framed SIG P230, but that's really it.  Pre-lock 442 in excellent condition is primarily what I'm looking for.  Thanks."

I do need a very minimum of $600.00 to accompany any and all trades. This is non-negotiable, thanks.

The bike starts, runs and rips very well. It has been rebuilt, bored and jetted a season ago, so it runs great. Starts first kick and idles well. I recently repainted the side fairings, as they weren't very nice to look at it. There plenty of new parts including rebuilt forks, aftermarket suspension, new seat, front and rear fender, and newer tires. There are other items that I'm sure I'm leaving out. 

Cons:
Bike could use new clutch/brake levers as the tips are broken at the very very ends
Could use new grips on the handlebars
If you want it looking perfect, you could use new plastics
Surface rust on exhaust pipe but can easily be refinished

From Colt: Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt® Law Enforcement Carbine delivers.

The only marks on this fine piece of machinery are several surface scratches on wood where the forend leaves the action -- nothing significant. I am ashamed to admit this, but I have only fired a half-dozen rounds since I acquired it. This rifle is sweet! I would be glad to take photos of the left side for interested parties. Scope NOT included.

This is Chilean Military Surplus, circa 1976.  Comes packaged 15 rounds to a box in original cardboard boxes.  7 boxes of 15 along with some loose rounds for 126 total.  Reloadable brass case fmj ammo, but I am unsure of the bullet weight.  Some of the cases have some corrosion on them but they should all still be firable. However as this is old surplus I can't guarantee that there won't be some bad primers in the bunch.  Fired several hundred rounds of this through my mauser and only had a few duds but this has been close to a decade ago.
In any case this is great ammo if you have a Spanish mauser, particularly if you reload for it.
I also have 10 rounds of Federal soft point hunting ammo

buying online is cheaper, Buds Guns, Kentucky Guns or search slickguns. Finds the best price on the net....  most ship to your FFL for free and your FFL charges a fee. Mine is $20.00 for the transfer. Oh and did I mention no sales tax???? If you live in another state. Be a smart consumer and stop paying new prices for used guns! #:D 

If you have a new firearm that means you are an FFL dealer and it hasn't been transfered. Trying to sell anything for what you paid for it is crazy. I would pay extra and go through an FFL and have a warranty from the manufacturer.... it doesn't matter if you have never fired it it's still used. Let's face it you took it to a gun shop and they were going to give you maybe 50% of new if you were lucky. That's why your here!!!! Please list as new or like new guys and gals..... if you want full value trade and give the other person the same consideration. Work something out realisticly..... This post is not directed at one person, just 60% of you and you know who you are.... I just picked a a manufacturer out of the the blue."

This is a great rifle that I hate to sell. I've put about 500 rounds through it and it has shot flawlessly. I have cleaned the entire rifle and lubricated the action after every use (though that's not necessary).  It has sub MOA accuracy and 100% reliability. When you pull the trigger, you know this thing is going to for and not malfunction. The ultimate home defense or SHTF firearm. My loss is your gain. MSRP is $1666. I'm selling this like new rifle for $1300 cash. That is a steal."

Contact me right away!


This gun is NATO certified, meaning that this pistol must be 100% reliable in extreme conditions, the following is a list of some of the minimum requirements.


Must be able to complete the following without failure:


4000 dry firings


3000 De-cockings


Operator level disassembly 1350 times with out ware or damage to components.


Complete disassembly 150 times, this is all the way down, pins, springs etc.


100% interchangability, any number of pistols randomly selected, disassembled, parts mixed and reassembled with no failures of any kind including loss of accuracy.

Safety requirements:


Drop test


1.5 meter (4.9”) drop test, this is done 54 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked. Dropping the pistol on the butt, the muzzle, back of the slide, sides of the gun, top of the slide, in essence, any angle that you could drop the gun from. This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.


3meter drop (9.8”) 5 times with the pistol loaded (blank) and the hammer cocked, This is done on concrete and 0 failures are allowed! A failure is the gun firing.


After these tests are complete the gun must fire without service.


The factory contracted an independent lab to do additional testing on guns that previously passed the drop tests.

These pistol were dropped an additional 352 times without failure.


The pistol must also complete an environmental conditions test:


This means cold, heat, dust/sand and mud.


The pistol must fire after being frozen for 24 hours at –35C (-36F).


The pistol must fire after being heated for 24 hours at 70C (126F)


The pistol must fire after being submerged in mud, sand and combinations including being stripped of oil then completing the sand and mud tests again.

Service life:


The service life requirement from the Czech police was 15,000 rounds of +P ammo!


The pistol will exceed 30,000 rounds with ball 9mm.

Reliability:


The reliability requirements for the P-01 pistol are 99.8%, that’s a .2% failure rate.


This equals 20 stoppages in 10,000 rounds or 500 “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF)


During testing, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired, this is a .05% failure rate, a MRBF rate of 2142 rounds! Over 4 time the minimum acceptable requirement.


The U.S. Army MRBF requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols with 115 grain Ball ammunition."

I have an RWS 54 Air King in .177, TO-5 trigger 

Seated with my left arm resting on knee and right arm on chair arm rest I get  1/2"" at 25 yards out of this gun.  
The wood is nice and metal is in good shape, both with a mark or two here and there. 
 Shoots Crossman Premiere  7.9grn  hollow points pretty good.
I have recently installed a HW50 spring bought new from Airguns of Arizona.
It slowed things down and is a lot more enjoyable to shoot. Chronos at 892 for 10 shot average on 4/18
It ate the air rifle  scope in the pictures along with two others. No scope for now but good factory open sights and factory scope base.
I don't expect anymore scope damage with the HW50 spring.The HW spring is identical in dimension to the factory RWS spring with about an 1"" to 1 1/2"" less preload
Gun still has ample power for pest out to 40-50 yards.
Can be put back to a hard to cock, scope killer in a matter of minutes.
You are welcome to come shoot it.

I've ordered guns from them before but they will give you a real good idea as to new gun prices.  You will see that most postings on this site are higher than Buds.  Keep shopping around or do what I do and send them a link to the exact gun on buds and ask them to come back with a more sensible price.  So far I haven't received any responses from the ones I've sent the link to.   Shocker.

So, to the guy trying to sell his XDS .45 for $500 (and to all the other ignorants trying to sell used pistols for more than new gun price, I give you this link below. I can buy a new XDS .45 for $434.  Even with transfer fees I'm saving $40 or more.  Buds doesn't charge shipping so there you have it.  I don't work for Buds but I do price compare others to Buds.  If I can't find it as cheap, I just order off of Buds or I keep looking.  Don't give in to the jerks trying to gouge others.  Shop around or order off of Buds!

I easily have 43 lbs of brass, maybe up to 47 lbs.
At 8.6 lbs per thousand that would give an estimated count of 5,000 to 5,400 pieces.

This is from an estate sale so I do not know the  history.  It appears like most 9mm range brass.  It is all reloadable brass.  There is a strong possibility that some cases have crimped primer pockets.  Most are not crimped as evidenced by the commercial headstamps.

The previous owner had them bagged and it looks like they were separated as a mix of commercial h/s to military h/s.  A few of the bags split and now those are mixed. 

Long story short, to take advantage of this great deal, the buyer must be able to cope with crimped primer pockets.  These will also come as is, not cleaned beyond how you see in the pictures.  

Cash only, pick up in University Place, along Bridgeport Way W. between 27th and 40th.

Unless you modify them with aftermarket parts, etc., their price remains fairly the same, used or new given a few dollars. This is dependent on, make model, caliber, demand, and scarcity. Many of the used guns on Armslist haven't even reached the recommended break in of 500rds or more.  I have a Colt King Cobra 4"" that I only shot one box of ammo through it in 1987 and it has remained in the box since. I paid a little over $300.00 brand new.  What do you think it is worth?  Don't be a dumbass complaining with your childish rants on Armslist when you have no idea what you are talking about. You turn yourself into a complete and utter DOUCHEBAG."
