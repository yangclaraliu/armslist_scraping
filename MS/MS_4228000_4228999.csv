I am also including a lot of other stuff in the deal including more than 1000 rounds of 7.62x39 (probably closer to 2K but not going to count the loose rounds it was 3K rounds at one time but I shot some) I also have the wood stock, a tactical stock set, a folding stock set, and a crap ton of stripper clips\other odds and ends to go with it. So we are on the same page during our negotiations I value the items as follows:

SKS	$250
7.62x39 Ammo	$225
Additional stocks	$150
Stripper clips (empty)\odds ends	$50

To clarify the add there are 40 unopened boxes of 7.62x39, 32 full stripper clips, a few empty stripper clips and the .30 cal ammo can full of loose rounds. Also I intend to keep the Ammo Cans so if we make a deal plan on bringing something to carry the ammo home in.

I figure the total value of my stuff is worth around $675 I will accept that in cash firm.   I would rather trade however."

The stock is simply beautiful, it's has a really nice tiger stripe that has great luster, overall it's an exceptionally beautiful firearm.

K31s are simply the best of the Milsurp bolt actions.  They fire the 7.5x55 Swiss, which is very similar in power to a .308 Winchester.  GP11 rounds are common and can be found easily on sites like SGA in crates of 480 cartridges for around 50 cents a shot.  GP11 is a match-grade brass cased and non-corrosive round, and it was the round originally issued for these rifles.  Because of that, K31s tend to have great bores that do not have rust or pitting, which is the case with the rifle in this sale.  PPU also makes several loads of 7.5 Swiss including hunting cartridges, and Hornady makes an A-Max ballistic tip defense/hunting/match grade round as well.  The K31 feeds from a detachable 6 round box magazine and can be fed with stripper clips.

The K31 is a straight pull bolt action, so it's quicker to work than a Mosin or a Mauser.  You also have an extra round in the mag over both other rifles, and the gun locks open on an empty magazine.  This K31 shoots MOA and has a fantastic crisp two-state trigger.  

Price on the gun is 500$, I'm asking a premium because of the condition of the gun and the figure in the stock.  Simply put, it's the most beautiful figure in a K31 stock I've ever seen, and I collect these guns.  Also all of the parts match and they're in great condition.  K31s like this can go for 1500$+ with collectors, so honestly this is a steal.  

You'll need a NC DL, CCW prefered but not required, and you'll need to sign a bill of sale for FTF.  Willing to ship to an FFL of your choice on your dime.  It's 50 state legal to the best of my knowledge, so if you live in a commie state I can ship to you."

RETICLE (IC) #60, RAIL MOUNT NOT INCLUDED IN PRICE. R93 iC Illumination Control Blaser and Carl Zeiss revolutionise the operation of rifle and rifle scope Is the rifle cocked, then the illuminated reticle is on. With the iC concept from the two innovation leaders Blaser and Carl Zeiss this is always the case. Activating the illuminated reticle in crucial moments can no longer be forgotten. For the first time, rifle and rifle scope are synchronised in their functions. In the same moment the hunter cocks the R93, the illuminated reticle of his Varipoint rifle scope switches on. A small magnetic encoder in the cocking slide of the R93 iC is connected to a sensor on the underside of the Varipoint ocular thus activating the illuminated reticle. This results in a calmer approach to the moment before the shot is taken. The following situation is well known to many hunters on a driven hunt: when silently and unexpected a fox or wild boar comes into view, there is very little time to take the opportunity to shoot. The rifle is quickly mounted and aimed and then the shooter realises: the illuminated reticle is not on. Being irritated to such an extent, it is hardly possible to hit accurately. The same can also happen when hunting from a stand by night. With iC, events like this are a thing of the past: the hunter carefully mounts his rifle into the correct position, silently pushes the cocking slide forward and aims accurately thanks to the illuminated reticle which was automatically activated when cocking the rifle. The advantages of the iC concept are crystal clear: even when being under great pressure, forgetting to switch on the illuminated reticle cannot occur anymore. Through the cocking slide, the illuminated reticle is illuminated and remains illuminated as long as the rifle is cocked, no matter in which position the control button on the rifle scope is adjusted. Thanks to the ergonomically favourable position of the cocking slide of the R93 iC, the trigger hand remains on the pistol grip, whereas the leading hand must no longer be removed from the forearm to switch on the illuminated reticle on the scope. Shooter, rifle and scope are connected as one unit. The memory function which is integrated in the Varipoint iC ensures that the light intensity which has been adjusted last, is provided immediately. Independent from the position of the cocking slide, the light intensity is adjusted when the control button is pulled out and is saved when the button is pushed down. Every R93 can quickly be retrofitted with the iC at an affordable price. The Blaser dealer sends the bolt assembly to the Blaser factory where the iC cocking slide can be fitted. The premium line of riflescopes equipped with the most sophisticated ZEISS optics, state-of-the-art components, and highperformance features to meet the requirements of the most discriminating hunters and shooters. LotuTec® lens coating along with fully T* multicoating on all air-to-glass surfaces provides superior light transmission and optimum contrast, critical for twilight hunts. Large fields of view and precision adjustments get you on target quickly and accurately every time. The most versatile, high-performance optics with sophisticated illumination control for the perfect shot at any time of the day. The illuminated red dot is always clearly visible, in bright daylight as well as in extreme low light situations. When magnification is changed, the crosshair in the first image plane adjusts in size automatically, while the illuminated red dot reticle in the second image plane remains constant – so targets are never obscured, making Victory Varipoint rifle scopes the premium solution for fast and precise target acquisition and in excellent condition.."

C&R eligible. I do not ship to CA,CT,DC,MA,Nj,NY. There is a 3% charge for credit card orders Cost of shipping is higher to ALASKA. The seller hereby expressly disclaims all warranties, either express or implied and assumes no liability in connection with the sale.

Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 850,"Listed On: Friday, April 10, 2015",Rifles,no type,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a Standard Draco pistol that I permanently attached an extended Krinkov style muzzle brake to bring it to just over 16"". Get the NFA look, and performance, without the $200 registration. This gun surpasses all 922r requirements so you can use ANY magazine you want. It has a chrome lined bore for durability and corrosion resistance.

This gun is gassed PERFECTLY, has an amazing trigger and dead nuts reliable. Using Wolf 123 grain bullets the carrier stops about 1/4"" from the trunion. This not only protects parts from damage it also results in a significant reduction in felt recoil. It does not throw brass into the next county like a typical over gassed AK.

Here are the modifications: 
TAPCO trigger that is adjustable for take up giving it a 3.5 pound trigger. It is better than any other AK trigger out there and better than most AR triggers.
Gas tube drilled to bleed off excessive gas to keep crud out of the receiver
Gas piston drilled to make sure it isn't over gassed 
Extra power recoil spring installed to reduce felt recoil
Side rail installed
ACE lightweight 9.5"" stock, with 1"" butt pad, installed (Folds to the right)
Stormwerkz hinge installed
US Palm grip installed
US made polymer forearm with molded in rail installed
Trigger group, bolt and carrier polished for reliability
Extended Krinkov style brake from CNC Warrior (I will include the cone that goes in the brake)
Sling loop made out of 550 cord installed

The ""package"" will include one 30 round magazine, one 75 round rear load drum (you can leave this one loaded), a Bushnell Trophy Red Dot with its own mount, a Tru Glo 1.5-6 scope with its own mount and 100 rounds of Wolf 123 grain FMJ. Both scopes are zeroed for 123 grain bullets at 100 yards as is the iron sight.

Gun has about 150 rounds through it to ensure reliability.

Package deal $1,100
Gun with one 30 round magazine $850

Honestly I would love to keep it but I enjoy building guns much more than owning or shooting them so I must sell it to fund the next project. This gun is a fun gun to shoot and is SUPER easy to bump fire with the trigger. Bursts or mag dumps are no problem with this gun.

Feel free to ask ANY questions."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position."

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.  Might also consider an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm or a Beretta M9a1 or 92a1 (really want one with a rail), maybe a 92fs. Maybe a Glock 26

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $525.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

Designed for extreme sighting speed and superior long-range accuracy for AR platform rifles and .223 cartridges, the P-223’s entire optical system is fully multicoated for extreme brightness and provides light transmission up to 98%.The P-223 3x32 Carbine is an incredibly compact optic designed specifically for fast-handling, shorter barrel ARs. The all-new, fast-sighting BDC Carbine reticle was developed specifically for the 3x32 and .223 Remington cartridge to make engaging targets quickly and accurately both in-close and out to 600 yards. With tactical-style turrets with Zero-Reset feature to simplify field adjustments, the 3x32, like all Nikon AR riflescopes, is optimized for use with Nikon Spot On Ballistic Match Technology. Spot On allows you to discover all of the exact aiming points on the BDC carbine reticle for your exact ammunition and load. ""

*********2105 Special 11/2"" guarantee*********

Les Baer's Premier II© has become the industry standard to which all other factory or custom built 1911s are compared. The 5"" long Government Model (pictured above) is the best single stack duty, defense or competition pistol you'll find in America -- the best quality, the best value and the best performance. No wonder so many of them show up at IPSC Limited Class matches. The Premier II© is even guaranteed to shoot 1.5"" groups at 50 yards! We've sold so many in the USA and abroad, the Premier II© has become the flagship of our line. It performs like a million bucks but it costs a whole lot less. 
Features include:

Baer NM steel frame, NM slide and NM barrel with stainless bushing • Slide fitted to frame • Double serrated slide • Low mount LCB adjustable sight with hidden rear leaf • Baer dovetail front sight • Lowered and flared ejection port • Tuned and polished extractor • Baer extended ejector • Baer checkered slide stop• Baer speed trigger with crisp 4 lb pull • Baer deluxe Commander hammer and sear • Baer beavertail grip safety with pad • Flat serrated mainspring housing • Beveled mag well • Polished feed ramp and throated barrel • Baer extended ambi safety • High checkered front strap @ 30 lpi • Pistol tuned for total reliability • Baer Premium Checkered Cocobola grips • Blued finish • (2) 8-round premium magazines

New, these are in the $800.00 range plus tax etc.  I have reduced the price from $700.00 to $650.00 FIRM that includes the box, paperwork etc. I will not go below $650.00 so please don't ask. This will sell eventually as hunting season nears.  Phone 715 4 three two 11zero9. Photo is a stock photo of this model of rifle. My camera is giving me problems right now. If you want actual photos send me a text msg. or email and I'll send them off of my phone. Thanks."

Years before freedom Group, Inc. bought them and Remington started producing them in 2011.
 It's in excellent condition for a 62 yr. old rifle and functions flawlessly. I'm able to shoot a 3 rnd. 1-1/2"" group at 100 yards using 200 gr. Remington Core-Lokt ammunition. I'm sure tighter groups are possible with a different scope or a better shooter. The scope that sells with the rifle is a older fixed power Bushnell Sportview 4X32 with see through rings.
 The rifle has a 24"" barrel and the wood is darkened with age and in great condition, it adds to the overall look of the rifle. It's a classic woods deer/bear rifle.  Not looking for any trades at this time only cash, I can not travel and face to face sell only

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment."
