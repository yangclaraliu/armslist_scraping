These are extremely hard to find and retail for $3,850.00 for just the Mp40 itself. The mp40 mags that these replicas use retail for $55.00 a piece and additional ones can be purchased from Nekata. This breaks down very much like the original and has alittle play in the stock. These stocks are know to droop alittle over time much like the original but does not affect it's function. These take a special 9.3mm bfong blank which fires the blank backwards through the mp40. This is one of it's major reasons it's approved by the BATF.

I like the higher end stuff and always buy with cash. But lately, some of you...wait, most of you are getting absolutely fucking insane. 

Im so tired of seeing some of you asshats list completely generic guns (ones that generally any FFL can get overnight if not already in stock) Such as Glocks and rugers. Especially newer models.

Heres a few examples pulled from just missouri that were listed today

http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298466/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--fde-gen3-glock-17   OH SHIT!!! An FDE GLOCK 17!!! Ive never even seen one before, I hope he gets what its worth. Oh wait, its a FUCKING GLOCK. I can get it BRAND FUCKING NEW for 70 dollars less. That means zero rounds, zero chance of hero here fucking it up or dropping it etc...
http://www.reddotarms.com/shop/firearms/handguns/glock-17-9mm-4-49-flat-dark-earth.html

Oh this ones nice
http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298631/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--nib-smith-wesson-m-p-shield-9mm

Its a shield, I mean have you ever even seen these NOT in stock at an ffl? Let alone out of stock at the distributor? Oh, buts it new ""never been fired"" or say he says. But lets be honest, is he an FFL? Nope, he bought it from one. Maybe hes famous? Nope, doesnt seem to be. Well, maybe hes including ALOT of ammo for it? No? So why the fuck does he think hes worth $30-50 more than retail? Oh, so because YOU GOT FUCKED SIR, you think everyone here wants to get fucked? Get real, I hope you never sell it for any price.

Heres another gem http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298857/kansas-city-handguns-for-sale-trade--m-p--22-full-size-pistol These things are buy it now for $330 on GB, so I bet an FFL probably has it for 350 or so, then tax, so youd be at about 370. This guy is asking 370, but again ITS USED. Regardless of how many rounds you ""didnt"" fire out of it, its used. Would you pay retail for a car from a private seller? Lets assume you couldnt see the miles since you cant see the round count for this, would you? No? Okay.

You ""enthusiast"" are literally some of the dumbest people ive met, with some smart guys peppered in between. Just today in belleville I saw assholes trying to sell PS90 for 1400+, you serious? Or the mosin nagant specials for 260+, get real. 

You guys think shit turns to platinum after you own it, and generally you are trying to sell shit i can get anywhere, at anytime. You people do realize that new gun owners might be here trying to get into the hobby and your pricing them out of it right? Meaning less people buying, meaning less people keeping the doors open on the few good local shops that still exist. 

And just because you add some bullshit generic red dot or 3x scope doesnt add 300 in value to your already retail priced used gun. Neither does the ""custom"" bullshit some of you do, like im supposed to trust billy bob didnt fuck something up while he was playing with the bolt or barrel. 

Another thing ill address is how much you guys bitch about EVERYTHING. ""obama isnt letting me own an M240B or the full auto AK"" Wah, fucking wah. You idiots couldnt afford an M240B, you couldnt afford to shoot it, and I am certain most of you couldnt even operate the damn thing or shoot accurately with it. But god damn it, you need it. 

Tell ya what, when you guys can keep from shooting yourselves while cleaning your shitty ass glocks and rugers, maybe the government will give you machine guns without a class 3? Maybe when you stop fear mongering and bulk buying anything and everything that ""might, maybe, one day soon"" get banned they will allow it. Or maybe you dont need a 240 anyway? How many of you have ACTUALLY fired an M240 in combat? Or any machine gun? But you read on a forum somewhere, so Im sure youre an expert. 

Speaking of that, how many of you actually form your own opinions on firearms? All I hear anymore is how ""so and so tested the ballistics so I know my 1911 with my wal mart ammo is good for conceal carry"" You mongoloids do realize that a 45 doesnt ""knock people over"" this isnt the matrix or some shitty action movie. This is real life, it takes more than a low velocity 45 to knock someone over (especially a grown ass man trying to kill you/rob you) 

As I said before, Ive met some very knowledgeable people in my time in the Army and outside who love firearms, but most of you really shouldnt even be handling them. You guys arent buying them to ""potentially"" use them to fight a tyrannical government, youre doing it in the HOPES that you get to, most of you cant even wipe your own ass, or are so old that youd have a heart attack once the first round cracked by your ear. The rest who can wipe and arent old typically rant and rave about the 22lr round like god himself mints the fucking things, shitty, dirty ass, non effective round is all that thing is. 

Seriously, if you wanna sell your generic X pistol or rifle, ask a decent fucking price. It is USED after all, hell modern weapon systems (who has a nice store btw) has listed things NEW for less than some of you guys are charging USED, and theyll be like a page apart. Basically, in the end. Get fucking real. And the ones who bulk buy and stockpile that give me and other RESPONSIBLE SANE gun owners a bad name. FUCK YOU."

These are actual test results from .460 Rowland Buffalo Bore ammo in 5” barrel pistols not test barrels!

There are two key elements to the .460 Rowland concept. The first is a sharp increase in cartridge maximum pressure over the .45 ACP and .45 Super. Maximum Average Pressure is: 45 ACP (21,000 PSI), .45 ACP +P (23,000 PSI), .45 Super (28,000 PSI), and .460 Rowland (40,000 PSI). 

The second is to use a compensator to damp or reduce the velocity of the slide to manageable levels. The first delivers magnum level performance and the second allows the cartridge to be easily and reliably fired from compact, light weight, high capacity, autoloading pistols. 

This pistol features the conversion by Clark Custom Guns, and if you know about pistolsmiths, is one of the very best at the craft! Also with the pistol, you will get all of the original parts, a bushing wrench and 5 magazines. You can convert it back to .45 ACP if you want to.

The pistol is based upon the Norinco 1911A1 which I was told was what Rowland used to develop the concept.

This conversion reliably fires .45 ACP +P, .45 Super and .460 Rowland ammo interchangeably. It is also rated to handle conventional .45 ACP ammo but I have not tried it. This let You have .44 magnum performance in a 1911 platform! The Hogue wrap around rubber grips add a nice touch.

I have 27 185 grain JHP rounds in .460 Rowland, 10 rounds of .45 Super JHP and 32 rounds of .45 ACP +P  Hornady 230 grain XTP ammo as a part of the deal.

I value the pistol, original parts, magazines and ammo at $800 so please don't low ball me. I can throw in some cash if you have something really nice to offer.

I have several additional photos that I can send. Just let me know.

In addition, I have a limited amount of Winchester Black Talon 230 grain SXT ammo that could also figure into the trade."

You will not find a better specimen short of taking one fresh from the box. Sako rings are included. The buttplate is Sako, but is a bit proud over the stock all the way around. The serial no.

You are looking at a Nice Condition Mosin Nagant M91/30! 7.62 x 54r !

It's a 1944 Izhevek! Matching number #'s Bolt, and receiver! 

I've done some work on the bolt, it's been sanded smooth, just needs to be chrome plated! Bolt stuck when bought, the usual sticky bolt Mosin! But works much better now, just needs bolt polished! Also, redid the stock to a more natural wood color, not the usual red color! 

Barrel is bright and shinny! As in the pictures!

I come on here fairly often looking for those certain weapons that just grab my eye. I like the higher end stuff and always buy with cash. But lately, some of you...wait, most of you are getting absolutely fucking insane. 

Im so tired of seeing some of you asshats list completely generic guns (ones that generally any FFL can get overnight if not already in stock) Such as Glocks and rugers. Especially newer models.

Heres a few examples pulled from just missouri that were listed today

http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298466/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--fde-gen3-glock-17 OH SHIT!!! An FDE GLOCK 17!!! Ive never even seen one before, I hope he gets what its worth. Oh wait, its a FUCKING GLOCK. I can get it BRAND FUCKING NEW for 70 dollars less. That means zero rounds, zero chance of hero here fucking it up or dropping it etc...
http://www.reddotarms.com/shop/firearms/handguns/glock-17-9mm-4-49-flat-dark-earth.html

Oh this ones nice
http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298631/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--nib-smith-wesson-m-p-shield-9mm

Its a shield, I mean have you ever even seen these NOT in stock at an ffl? Let alone out of stock at the distributor? Oh, buts it new ""never been fired"" or say he says. But lets be honest, is he an FFL? Nope, he bought it from one. Maybe hes famous? Nope, doesnt seem to be. Well, maybe hes including ALOT of ammo for it? No? So why the fuck does he think hes worth $30-50 more than retail? Oh, so because YOU GOT FUCKED SIR, you think everyone here wants to get fucked? Get real, I hope you never sell it for any price.

Heres another gem http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298857/kansas-city-handguns-for-sale-trade--m-p--22-full-size-pistol These things are buy it now for $330 on GB, so I bet an FFL probably has it for 350 or so, then tax, so youd be at about 370. This guy is asking 370, but again ITS USED. Regardless of how many rounds you ""didnt"" fire out of it, its used. Would you pay retail for a car from a private seller? Lets assume you couldnt see the miles since you cant see the round count for this, would you? No? Okay.

You ""enthusiast"" are literally some of the dumbest people ive met, with some smart guys peppered in between. Just today in belleville I saw assholes trying to sell PS90 for 1400+, you serious? Or the mosin nagant specials for 260+, get real. 

You guys think shit turns to platinum after you own it, and generally you are trying to sell shit i can get anywhere, at anytime. You people do realize that new gun owners might be here trying to get into the hobby and your pricing them out of it right? Meaning less people buying, meaning less people keeping the doors open on the few good local shops that still exist. 

And just because you add some bullshit generic red dot or 3x scope doesnt add 300 in value to your already retail priced used gun. Neither does the ""custom"" bullshit some of you do, like im supposed to trust billy bob didnt fuck something up while he was playing with the bolt or barrel. 

Another thing ill address is how much you guys bitch about EVERYTHING. ""obama isnt letting me own an M240B or the full auto AK"" Wah, fucking wah. You idiots couldnt afford an M240B, you couldnt afford to shoot it, and I am certain most of you couldnt even operate the damn thing or shoot accurately with it. But god damn it, you need it. 

Tell ya what, when you guys can keep from shooting yourselves while cleaning your shitty ass glocks and rugers, maybe the government will give you machine guns without a class 3? Maybe when you stop fear mongering and bulk buying anything and everything that ""might, maybe, one day soon"" get banned they will allow it. Or maybe you dont need a 240 anyway? How many of you have ACTUALLY fired an M240 in combat? Or any machine gun? But you read on a forum somewhere, so Im sure youre an expert. 

Speaking of that, how many of you actually form your own opinions on firearms? All I hear anymore is how ""so and so tested the ballistics so I know my 1911 with my wal mart ammo is good for conceal carry"" You mongoloids do realize that a 45 doesnt ""knock people over"" this isnt the matrix or some shitty action movie. This is real life, it takes more than a low velocity 45 to knock someone over (especially a grown ass man trying to kill you/rob you) 

As I said before, Ive met some very knowledgeable people in my time in the Army and outside who love firearms, but most of you really shouldnt even be handling them. You guys arent buying them to ""potentially"" use them to fight a tyrannical government, youre doing it in the HOPES that you get to, most of you cant even wipe your own ass, or are so old that youd have a heart attack once the first round cracked by your ear. The rest who can wipe and arent old typically rant and rave about the 22lr round like god himself mints the fucking things, shitty, dirty ass, non effective round is all that thing is. 

Another thing, if a company or organization is anti gun, get over it. They have a right to be, theyre people, people have opinions. I find it hilarious that a few times the last year Ive been verbally scolded for wearing wounded warrior gear. Hey, bitchtits, if I wanna wear a t shirt showing support for a group that does ALOT (See also, more than you) for people like me, deal with it. Does it REALLY surprise you that a group that is made up of people who have been blown up, shot, and those dealing with severe mental health issues is anti gun? Ill always wear my gear, and if you dont like it, TOO FUCKING BAD. You would go batshit fucking crazy if some group tried to dictate what you can and cant like (and you do, often, in great detail). I dont give a shit how you feel about the WWP, I dont care how you feel about target not letting people carry. If your precious religious bigots can be against anything politically (hobby lobby, chic fil a, any other shitty network of companies) opposition can exist. Target doesnt give 2 fucks if you boycott them, just as hobby lobby isnt missing my money. I dont need a 5 minute lecture on how you dont support the WWP, but when I ask what youve done for veterans you wet your poor little glock branded panties. Get the fuck over yourselves, no one cares.
Seriously, if you wanna sell your generic X pistol or rifle, ask a decent fucking price. It is USED after all, hell modern weapon systems (who has a nice store btw) has listed things NEW for less than some of you guys are charging USED, and theyll be like a page apart. Basically, in the end. Get fucking real. And the ones who bulk buy and stockpile that give me and other RESPONSIBLE SANE gun owners a bad name. FUCK YOU."

Im so tired of seeing some of you asshats list completely generic guns (ones that generally any FFL can get overnight if not already in stock) Such as Glocks and rugers. Especially newer models.

Heres a few examples pulled from just missouri that were listed today

http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298466/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--fde-gen3-glock-17 An FDE GLOCK 17!!! Ive never even seen one before, I hope he gets what its worth. Oh wait, its a GLOCK. I can get it BRAND NEW for 70 dollars less. That means zero rounds, zero chance of hero here messing it up or dropping it etc...
http://www.reddotarms.com/shop/firearms/handguns/glock-17-9mm-4-49-flat-dark-earth.html

Oh this ones nice
http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298631/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--nib-smith-wesson-m-p-shield-9mm

Its a shield, I mean have you ever even seen these NOT in stock at an ffl? Let alone out of stock at the distributor? Oh, buts it new ""never been fired"" or say he says. But lets be honest, is he an FFL? Nope, he bought it from one. Maybe hes famous? Nope, doesnt seem to be. Well, maybe hes including ALOT of ammo for it? No? So why the fuck does he think hes worth $30-50 more than retail? Oh, so because YOU GOT SCRWED you think everyone here wants to? Get real, I hope you never sell it for any price.

Heres another gem http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298857/kansas-city-handguns-for-sale-trade--m-p--22-full-size-pistol These things are buy it now for $330 on GB, so I bet an FFL probably has it for 350 or so, then tax, so youd be at about 370. This guy is asking 370, but again ITS USED. Regardless of how many rounds you ""didnt"" fire out of it, its used. Would you pay retail for a car from a private seller? Lets assume you couldnt see the miles since you cant see the round count for this, would you? No? Okay.

You ""enthusiast"" are literally some of the dumbest people ive met, with some smart guys peppered in between. Just today in belleville I saw douchebags trying to sell a PS90 for 1400+, you serious? Or the mosin nagant specials for 260+, get real. 

You guys think shit turns to platinum after you own it, and generally you are trying to sell shit i can get anywhere, at anytime. You people do realize that new gun owners might be here trying to get into the hobby and your pricing them out of it right? Meaning less people buying, meaning less people keeping the doors open on the few good local shops that still exist. 

And just because you add some bullshit generic red dot or 3x scope doesnt add 300 in value to your already retail priced used gun. Neither does the ""custom"" bullshit some of you do, like im supposed to trust billy bob didnt fuck something up while he was playing with the bolt or barrel. 

Another thing ill address is how much you guys bitch about EVERYTHING. ""obama isnt letting me own an M240B or the full auto AK"" Wah, fucking wah. You idiots couldnt afford an M240B, you couldnt afford to shoot it, and I am certain most of you couldnt even operate the damn thing or shoot accurately with it. But god damn it, you need it. 

Tell ya what, when you guys can keep from shooting yourselves while cleaning your shitty ass glocks and rugers, maybe the government will give you machine guns without a class 3? Maybe when you stop fear mongering and bulk buying anything and everything that ""might, maybe, one day soon"" get banned they will allow it. Or maybe you dont need a 240 anyway? How many of you have ACTUALLY fired an M240 in combat? Or any machine gun? But you read on a forum somewhere, so Im sure youre an expert. 

Speaking of that, how many of you actually form your own opinions on firearms? All I hear anymore is how ""so and so tested the ballistics so I know my 1911 with my wal mart ammo is good for conceal carry"" You mongoloids do realize that a 45 doesnt ""knock people over"" this isnt the matrix or some shitty action movie. This is real life, it takes more than a low velocity 45 to knock someone over (especially a grown ass man trying to kill you/rob you) 

As I said before, Ive met some very knowledgeable people in my time in the Army and outside who love firearms, but most of you really shouldnt even be handling them. You guys arent buying them to ""potentially"" use them to fight a tyrannical government, youre doing it in the HOPES that you get to, most of you cant even wipe your own ass, or are so old that youd have a heart attack once the first round cracked by your ear. The rest who can wipe and arent old typically rant and rave about the 22lr round like god himself mints the fucking things, shitty, dirty ass, non effective round is all that thing is. 

Another thing, if a company or organization is anti gun, get over it. They have a right to be, theyre people, people have opinions. I find it hilarious that a few times the last year Ive been verbally scolded for wearing wounded warrior gear. Hey, bitchtits, if I wanna wear a t shirt showing support for a group that does ALOT (See also, more than you) for people like me, deal with it. Does it REALLY surprise you that a group that is made up of people who have been blown up, shot, and those dealing with severe mental health issues is anti gun? Ill always wear my gear, and if you dont like it, TOO BAD. You would go batshit crazy if some group tried to dictate what you can and cant like (and you do, often, in great detail). I dont give a shit how you feel about the WWP, I dont care how you feel about target not letting people carry. If your precious religious bigots can be against anything politically (hobby lobby, chic fil a, any other shitty network of companies) opposition can exist. Target doesnt give 2 fucks if you boycott them, just as hobby lobby isnt missing my money. I dont need a 5 minute lecture on how you dont support the WWP, but when I ask what youve done for veterans you wet your poor little glock branded panties. Get over yourselves, no one cares.

Seriously, if you wanna sell your generic X pistol or rifle, ask a decent  price. It is USED after all, hell modern weapon systems (who has a nice store btw) has listed things NEW for less than some of you guys are charging USED, and theyll be like a page apart. Basically, in the end. Get real."

Im so tired of seeing some of you asshats list completely generic guns (ones that generally any FFL can get overnight if not already in stock) Such as Glocks and rugers. Especially newer models.

Heres a few examples pulled from just missouri that were listed today

http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298466/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--fde-gen3-glock-17 An FDE GLOCK 17!!! Ive never even seen one before, I hope he gets what its worth. Oh wait, its a GLOCK. I can get it BRAND NEW for 70 dollars less. That means zero rounds, zero chance of hero here messing it up or dropping it etc...
http://www.reddotarms.com/shop/firearms/handguns/glock-17-9mm-4-49-flat-dark-earth.html

Oh this ones nice
http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298631/st-louis-missouri-handguns-for-sale--nib-smith-wesson-m-p-shield-9mm

Its a shield, I mean have you ever even seen these NOT in stock at an ffl? Let alone out of stock at the distributor? Oh, buts it new ""never been fired"" or say he says. But lets be honest, is he an FFL? Nope, he bought it from one. Maybe hes famous? Nope, doesnt seem to be. Well, maybe hes including ALOT of ammo for it? No? So why the fuck does he think hes worth $30-50 more than retail? Oh, so because YOU GOT SCRWED you think everyone here wants to? Get real, I hope you never sell it for any price.

Heres another gem http://www.armslist.com/posts/4298857/kansas-city-handguns-for-sale-trade--m-p--22-full-size-pistol These things are buy it now for $330 on GB, so I bet an FFL probably has it for 350 or so, then tax, so youd be at about 370. This guy is asking 370, but again ITS USED. Regardless of how many rounds you ""didnt"" fire out of it, its used. Would you pay retail for a car from a private seller? Lets assume you couldnt see the miles since you cant see the round count for this, would you? No? Okay.

You ""enthusiast"" are literally some of the dumbest people ive met, with some smart guys peppered in between. Just today in belleville I saw douchebags trying to sell a PS90 for 1400+, you serious? Or the mosin nagant specials for 260+, get real. 

You guys think shit turns to platinum after you own it, and generally you are trying to sell shit i can get anywhere, at anytime. You people do realize that new gun owners might be here trying to get into the hobby and your pricing them out of it right? Meaning less people buying, meaning less people keeping the doors open on the few good local shops that still exist. 

And just because you add some bullshit generic red dot or 3x scope doesnt add 300 in value to your already retail priced used gun. Neither does the ""custom"" bullshit some of you do, like im supposed to trust billy bob didnt fuck something up while he was playing with the bolt or barrel. 

Another thing ill address is how much you guys bitch about EVERYTHING. ""obama isnt letting me own an M240B or the full auto AK"" Wah, fucking wah. You idiots couldnt afford an M240B, you couldnt afford to shoot it, and I am certain most of you couldnt even operate the damn thing or shoot accurately with it. But god damn it, you need it. 

Tell ya what, when you guys can keep from shooting yourselves while cleaning your shitty ass glocks and rugers, maybe the government will give you machine guns without a class 3? Maybe when you stop fear mongering and bulk buying anything and everything that ""might, maybe, one day soon"" get banned they will allow it. Or maybe you dont need a 240 anyway? How many of you have ACTUALLY fired an M240 in combat? Or any machine gun? But you read on a forum somewhere, so Im sure youre an expert. 

Speaking of that, how many of you actually form your own opinions on firearms? All I hear anymore is how ""so and so tested the ballistics so I know my 1911 with my wal mart ammo is good for conceal carry"" You mongoloids do realize that a 45 doesnt ""knock people over"" this isnt the matrix or some shitty action movie. This is real life, it takes more than a low velocity 45 to knock someone over (especially a grown ass man trying to kill you/rob you) 

As I said before, Ive met some very knowledgeable people in my time in the Army and outside who love firearms, but most of you really shouldnt even be handling them. You guys arent buying them to ""potentially"" use them to fight a tyrannical government, youre doing it in the HOPES that you get to, most of you cant even wipe your own ass, or are so old that youd have a heart attack once the first round cracked by your ear. The rest who can wipe and arent old typically rant and rave about the 22lr round like god himself mints the fucking things, shitty, dirty ass, non effective round is all that thing is. 

Another thing, if a company or organization is anti gun, get over it. They have a right to be, theyre people, people have opinions. I find it hilarious that a few times the last year Ive been verbally scolded for wearing wounded warrior gear. Hey, bitchtits, if I wanna wear a t shirt showing support for a group that does ALOT (See also, more than you) for people like me, deal with it. Does it REALLY surprise you that a group that is made up of people who have been blown up, shot, and those dealing with severe mental health issues is anti gun? Ill always wear my gear, and if you dont like it, TOO BAD. You would go batshit crazy if some group tried to dictate what you can and cant like (and you do, often, in great detail). I dont give a shit how you feel about the WWP, I dont care how you feel about target not letting people carry. If your precious religious bigots can be against anything politically (hobby lobby, chic fil a, any other shitty network of companies) opposition can exist. Target doesnt give 2 fucks if you boycott them, just as hobby lobby isnt missing my money. I dont need a 5 minute lecture on how you dont support the WWP, but when I ask what youve done for veterans you wet your poor little glock branded panties. Get over yourselves, no one cares.

Seriously, if you wanna sell your generic X pistol or rifle, ask a decent  price. It is USED after all, hell modern weapon systems (who has a nice store btw) has listed things NEW for less than some of you guys are charging USED, and theyll be like a page apart. Basically, in the end. Get real."

First is the Finnish M39:  It is a VKT 1944 in excellent condition.  The receiver and bolt are matching.  The bore is pristine and the trigger is fantastic.  I have fired the rifle at 100 yds and was able to easily keep all rounds in the black on a standard NRA silhouette target with surplus ammo.  It is a fantastic shooter.  I am asking $425 if bought separate.

Second we have the Soviet M91/30:  This is your standard round receiver Izhevsk M91/30 made in 1943.  It is not numbers matching and is counter-bored.  The bore is dark and has seen better days.  It does shoot and operate just fine, however.  I have the bayonet, sling, cleaning kit, oil bottle, ammo pouch and several stripper clips for this rifle.  I am asking $100 if bought separate, you get all the accessories with this rifle.

I also have two spam cans for the rifles.  One is opened with less the 100 rounds used from it and the other is still sealed up.  I am asking $150 if bought separate.

I would like to sell all of this together.  The package deal is $600.  I am selling local only, we must meet at an FFL dealer (or someplace safe and public).  I will only accept Cash, USPS Money Order, or Cashiers Checks for payment.

This pistol has about 50 rounds through it and has been broken in properly. A 10.5"" barrel is the minimum practical length, and the carbine gas system enhances reliability as well as reduces wear. Accuracy was very good and the rig is very controllable for follow up shots. Looking mainly to trade as I don't need to sell. Willing to travel for the right trade. 
I put the value in the $1k range based on others on the market and money invested.  

I have a ruger american 308 compact with 2 stocks I could include for the right trade as well. ~$400

Thanks

These went very fast last time. Aero makes VERY high quality AR products. Their stripped lowers are second to none.These are NOT blems.

The anodizing is excellent.It is a deep black and looks great.

I built a rifle recently with an Aero Precision upper and lower. The fit and finish is excellent.

The price for a single lower is $87.50 which includes tax and background check.The price on 2 or more is $85.

Get started on a new build with high quality parts. Or put one away for a future build.

I have had a custom made pistol grip. That and a hand guard have professionally refinished. There is also an additional unfinished hand guard. I have a link below of photos of everything that would be included in trade. Also, photos of what the rifle will look like with the upgrades (these are not my photos, I saw this idea on a VEPR forum). Forgot to mention, I have parts for both an AR stock (folding) and a skeleton stock also folding. Everything listed and pictured in total cost me over $1100. I am not interested in ANY trades at all (sorry). I do have another hand guard and custom pistol grip that I did with an ebony finish (this is what reminded me it needed to be done by a professional) that I will give away as well...

By itself, the body armor vest protects the user from shrapnel and 9-mm pistol rounds. When the protective Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI) are added, the system acts as a ballistic barrier to 7.62-mm rifle ammunition. The same plates are used with Interceptor Body Armor Outer Tactical Vest (OTV), and further developments in vests, such as the Improved Outer Tactical Vest (IOTV), the USMC Modular Tactical Vest (MTV) and theUSMC Scalable Plate Carrier (SPC).

The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) is made of a boron carbide or silicon carbide ceramic with a Spectra backing, a material significantly stronger than Kevlar. It stops, shatters and catches any fragments up to a 7.62 mm round with a muzzle velocity of 2,750 feet per second."

Selling or trading my Saiga in 5.45. It's been a fun rifle, cleaned and oiled thoroughly between range trips, with less than 750 rounds through the tube. These things can last for at least 30,000 rounds with the russian barrels. A true AK74. Sadly I'm consolidating calibers and only looking for more 7.62x39. 

Will trade for a CLEAN AK in 7.62x39. Or ammo trades as well. I've been in the AK game for several years now, so no time wasters please.

Rifle has a standard threaded barrel (14x1mm LH). Some light paint wear that really gives the rifle character. Included is one Bulgarian commercial steel lined poly magazine. Also installed is a Manticore Eclipse (the best flash hider on the market). This is the softest shooting rifle I've ever owned.

I have ammo for sale if interested, as well as Bulgarian Circle 10, 21, and 25 magazines.
