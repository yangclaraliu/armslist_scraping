Like new condition.  2 mags CZ case.
I have a chance to buy back a firearm that I've always regretted selling.  

At 5″ tall with a barrel length of just under 4″, the Compact model shaves a little more than 3/4″ off the length and about 1/2″ off the height of the full-size CZ 75. Its reduced size allows it to readily disappear under regular clothing. The CZ 75 DA/SA action with a manual safety lever provides the user with two options for carry: hammer-back with the safety on for single action operation or manually decocked for a double action first shot with no need to remember to take off the safety before firing. Because the 75 Compact retains the steel frame of the original 75, only 2.4 oz of weight is lost, making it the softest-shooting compact in the CZ 75 line."

I've knocked a few dollars off each item's brand new price, which they ALL are, received this week, because I realize these will be second owner items, but certainly aren't used by any means. Like I said, no rounds have been fired or even loaded in this upper. Considering shipping prices you'd save a good chunk buying these from me.

Will consider trade for AR upper with 16 inch barrel and preferably free floated hand guard

The anatomically formed grip provides an ideal hand seating angle and comfortable grip dimensions to permit rapid, accurate, instinctive shooting. The Desert Eagle is designed for two-handed shooting. When the last round in the magazine is fired, the slide remains in its maximum recoil position for rapid magazine change and immediate chambering of a round for instant resumption of firing. It features a full Weaver-style rail on the barrel from the end of the chamber to right behind the front sight and standard ambidextrous safety. This model is chambered in 44 Magnum with a 6"" barrel and a cheetah finish with black appointments."

NIB never-fired EAA Witness steel frame .45/.22 combo with Picatinny rail. Possibly the best survival handgun ever made with .45 caliber personal protection peace of mind and .22 LR for small to medium size game hunting with reasonable hunting accuracy from 4 1/2 in. full size barrel. This is my second of these. After I sold my first one after years of trouble free use, I regretted it and bought this one plus a bunch of accessories. Unfortunately my life drastically changed shortly afterwards and I have not had any chance to get to the range. I have a Bersa Thunder Pro Ultra Compact .45 as my  main personal carry and a Bersa Thunder 380 Concealed Carry as my alternate carry firearm (love those guns too..). 

Since it's unlikely I'll ever get around to using this Witness as intended for sport shooting, it's up for sale with the extras.

The pistol features a double action/single action with decocker switch. Basic white dot sights which can be replaced with the aftermarket sights of your choice, and a front rail for any lights or lasers you desire.

You'll notice the rail has a little dink in it. This is from a misaligned screw that was on a light I had, but it does not prevent any proper alignment or function of the rails and doesn't affect attachments.

Otherwise the pistol is in great shape. I've fired only 15 rounds of some hollowpoints through it and other than that it's as good as new.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

It has been developed from the highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. Grips are olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

This gun is great for concealed carry at a great price.  Purchasers must have either a NC concealed carry permit or a permit to purchase.  This is a new gun and is priced at wholesale/distributor pricing"

This knife just doesn't get pocket time since I got my PM2, so it's up for sale.

This was carried a few times, opened some boxes, cut some paper.....really easy use type stuff. Never abused or beat on. It's in super nice shape and very clean. Still has the factory edge.

Steel is FANTASTIC. 3V is some GREAT stuff. The titanium lock side on this knife is also really cool with all of the milling that Spyderco did. It's a shame these were discontinued. They're some of the best hard use knives out there. Every bit as beefy as a Strider or Grayman. The blade is a BIG chunk of bad ass steel on these.

The knife is in fantastic shape. Locks up like a bank vault. At the most, you can probably find a few scratches that show up when the light hits it just right. This knife is in really nice shape, pics speak for them selves.

Great centering, and less than 50% lock bar travel. You couldn't ask for more.

Best fit and finish I've ever seen out of a production folder barring Chris Reeve. This knife is awesome.
Comes with the original box as well (in pics).

Remington 750 Woodsmaster 750 Carbine in 35 Whelen.
I am cleaning out my safe.  Up for sale is a brand new in the box, never fired, Remington 750 Woodsmaster chambered in 35 Whelen.  This rifle was made in 2006 and was one of last few made before Freedom Group purchased Remington and discontinued this rifle in this caliber.  These are extremely difficult to locate especially in brand new condition.  This rifle has beautiful dark walnut and deep bluing.  Included with the rifle is the original box, a new Leupold base and set of medium 1 inch Leupold rings.

Bear Whitetail II archery set. I experimented with archery hunting last year and it did not do it for me. Try it cheap!

Bought the bow used and took it to a shop to have it looked at. They said it looked good and operated fine. Grabbed some wax and coated the strings. I shot it a bunch and it is pie plate accurate out to about 35 yards or so. Comes with 4 carbon arrows, 3 100 grain triple broad heads, wrist guard, two types of releases.

TAKEN FROM THE AMERICAN RIFLEMAN:

""Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard.

This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail hand guard attached."""

$110

This mount is more brand new; one test trip to the range to check stability a few months ago. (It passed with flying colors btw.)  I now don’t have a need for this set up. Larue makes wonderful high quality products, but once used/mounted they won’t accept return. 

New item cost is $135 (I am not selling the flashlight)

Does include QD adjustment wrench.

Ring size is 1.040 inches. This mount fits SureFire G2X (that is the flashlight I used to have in it). LaRue’s sizing chart also shows it will fit SureFire 6P, 9P, G2, G2Z and M1. It will fit other lights and applications.


Direct from LaRue’s web site:

“Put your favorite light in-line with your thumb for easy access. 

Simply loosen the ring screws, insert your flashlight, and tighten the screws...clamping the flashlight's body securely in-place.

1” inch mount with quick-detach  

$180

This mount is absolutely terrific. I am selling it for a simple reason: LaRue makes a very similar product (SPR-S LT158) which is actually the one I needed for the set up I had…  but by the time I figured that out I already had this one mounted and tested at range and in the field, hence the “no return” policy by the manufacture. 

I still have the original packaging if that interest you. It also comes with the adjustment tool from LaRue. It list on their website new for $210. Larue make wonderful high quality products.

From their website:
“The LT104 is the best mount made for attaching high-power riflescopes onto flattop-style AR15's, period.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range.”"

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this mount. It’s practically brand new - only two trips to the range with a traditional hunting scope set up. 

Also selling the 1” rings that I purchased when I purchased the ARMS #5 mount. The rings use four torque screws for securing a 1” tube.

Both the mount and the rings have recoil lugs.

Direct from ARMS’s web site:

“The #5 Multibase is a Quick detachable, multiple eye relief mounting base that attaches to weaver type rail and flat-top receivers. The multibase is compatible with both weaver style rings and NATO STANAG mounts. It raises your sight platform 3/4"" and features a spring loaded clamping bar and self locking captivated thumbnuts for solid, zero movement mounting to your existing rail. The #5™ multibase also features a see through channel for use with iron sights.”

It's a great gun, but I am left handed/have small hands and prefer a Gen 4 Glock 17 for that reason.  If I can't get what I need/want I'm sending it in for a grip reduction.  Just trying to save myself a few bucks instead.

This particular gun has Glock night sights, a brand new stainless guide rod/spring, steel frame pins, Talon Grip, factory Glock minus connector bar (along with the ""25 cent Glock trigger job"", basically just polishing internals), 4 - 13 round mags with Pearce +2 extensions, and a 3 mag holster.  I also have 60 rounds of HP ammo for all the mags that I will include, and have some range ammo that I can add if necessary to even out any trade.  Also have the Glock Tupperware and the stock parts that came off the gun.

This thing runs flawlessly and looks pretty good for an 8 year old gun.  The minor trigger work really did wonders for it.  It does have some holster wear on the top of the slide, but nothing major.

The basically brand new (been sitting in my safe) TLR-1 HL could be included or not, depending on what you have in trade, or +$100.  I'm happy to keep it for my next pistol as well.
