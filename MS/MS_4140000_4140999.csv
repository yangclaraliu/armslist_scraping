This SLR-101S has a chrome lined, hammer forged barrel that offers great accuracy and wear resistence. Milled reciever AKs are considered top of the line, with Arsenals being king. Extremely smooth action and crisp trigger. This rifle is my baby, and I am sad to see it go but it must. I'd guess I've fired about 500 rounds through in the year of owning it. The only wear marks on the rifle: paint is coming off of the cleaning rod (GASP from using it) and slight wear on the flash hider. Comes with original box, cleaning kit, sling, 10 round magazine.

One is all the Swiss parts and the other is also, with the exception of the bolt carrier as this was when they started to run out of Swiss parts and use the American made ones.  The Swiss triggers are comparable to match triggers as I let someone shoot one that was using an accutrigger on his rifle and he stated these ""assaulty rifle"" triggers are better.  
They are flat tops.  Round count is seen on the receiver, so I have about 300 through each of them, so they're broken in and run like a piece of Swiss engineering, throwing brass 30 feet.  They eat anything and the only difference you'll see is where the brass is thrown.  Great way to tell how good the ammo is because the piles of different manufacturers will be separate, so the smaller the piles, the more consistent the ammo loading is.

Not open to trades as the only reason why I'm selling these is I need the cash to help purchase a boat for disabled wife.   $1500 each or both for $2200."

It has rubberish synthetic furniture which I suspect not original (but do not know for sure, this is how I got it). The metal and finish are in superb condition.

I got this from a client/friend of mine who keeps his guns nothing short of IMMACULATE. I suspect it was unfired before I got it, I shot three clay rounds with it plus a few shells to function test it before going so I want to say 350 shells fired, maybe 400. It is totally stock and has not been modified in any way.

Price, I'm not really sure as I couldnt find any others for sale so I'll start it at $700 plus actual shipping, unless you're local than a FTF sale with PADL and PA-LTCF. I will also throw in a few boxes of sporting clay shells.

My family wanted me to start go shooting guns with them again after a long absence.  At the time I bought this two years ago .22 ammunition was in short supply and so I went with a .223.  I didn't realize how much louder a 223 is and isn't the right gun to be used as a ""plinker.""  I've bought a 9 mm carbine for the plinking purpose and am selling this gun.  Bought at Academy with the options I'm selling on the gun and tax, cost about $350.  It's had about 100 rounds shot through it for target practice and I cleaned after each use.  I took the scope I had on it off and put on my carbine and so that's why no scope included.

The options don't have one for .223 only, so I had to choose .223/5.56 NATO but I don't think you are supposed to use .556 NATO because of the higher pressures, I didn't."

Windham Weaponry SRC Carbon Rifle
30-round Magazine
Rifle Sling
Hard Plastic Gun Case
Windham Weaponry’s Transferable Lifetime Warranty
Owner’s Operating and Safety Manual
A team of the finest firearms people in the U.S.A. has been re-assembled to bring to market the highest quality AR type rifle possible. These good Maine folks - all former employees of Bushmaster Firearms - offer many years of experience in the industry, and all look forward to working with you, to serving your needs, and to building you a great rifle. And, Windham Weaponry, Inc. will back up that promise of quality with a Transferable Lifetime Warranty on their rifles.

The Windham Weaponry Carbon Fiber SRC was born out of the latest carbon fiber composite molding technology to bring you an AR type rifle of incredibly light weight - without sacrificing any Windham Weaponry quality, durability, accuracy or value. All the same high quality components of Windham’s standard models are married with carbon fiber molded receivers, and with their Lifetime Transferable Warranty, you can be guaranteed Windham Weaponry will stand behind its quality for a lifetime.

Firearm Specifications

Carbon fiber receivers will dissipate heat faster than aluminum, have no surface finish to wear off, and the carbon fiber composite has an inherent lubricity that enhances long wear. Windham Weaponry’s receiver molds were created at a state of the art design facility to yield a superior fit and function while utilizing many standard AR parts.

These Carbon Fiber Receivers retain all the recognizeable features of the AR platform, but are molded with a unique “billet machined” appearance – think Darth Vader meets the AR world!

The Navy SEALs and Special Boat Teams consider it a favorite, and use it as their standard carry pistol as it is small, light, durable, accurate and easy to conceal. The M11 is a recoil-operated, semi-automatic pistol that fires a 9mm NATO round in both single- and double-action modes.

Produced to the exact same specifications as those which have been the official sidearm of the Navy SEALs since 1986."

Has a straight cocking tube, good cocking tube gap, a bolt that has NOT been ground, and the bolt gap is within specs.  I ran 60 rounds through it on Thursday with not a single malfunction.  Every round fed, loaded, shot, extracted, and ejected like it should.  You'd be hard pressed to find a better put together one.  Trust me, I know.  I have owned 4 and looked at many others, and this is the only one 100% in spec that I have found.

It is in great shape, with very few rubs from use.  And from looking at the bolt carrier and internals, less than 500 Rounds through it.

It has new, American Made Cetme wood furniture on it.  I also have the original plastic furniture.  Comes with 2 steel Cetme 20 round mags, a 1 Aluminum G3 20 round Magazine.

Speaking of HDMI, this receiver has 7 HDMI 1.4a inputs (6 back, 1 front) which provide 3D pass-through for Blu-ray and Broadcast content, and also supports Audio Return Channel.  There are also 3 Y/Pr/Pb component inputs (capable of up to 1080i), 1 D-Sub (15pin) VGA input, 4 S-Video inputs, 4 RCA composite inputs, 3 coaxial digital inputs, 2 optical digital inputs, and 8 analog stereo RCA inputs.

Handling all the video from the many analog and digital inputs is Furoudja DCDi Cinema video Processor.  The Furoudja DCDi upconverts and deinterlaces all signals to a native 1080p (24fps or 60fps) resolution, but does not have ISF Certified Calibration Controls.  The dual HDMI 1.4a outs are also a nice feature, especially for those alternating between both a flat screen and a projection setup.

With Windows 7 and DNLA 1.5 Certification, the DTR-40.2 is also ready to stream music from the internet and on your home's broadband network.  Using the unit's Ethernet jack to connect to the internet, users can enjoy Pandora, vTuner, Napster, Mediafly, Rhapsody, and may others.  This receiver is also HD Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio ready.

I've had fun with this gun but its been sitting in the safe for too long and I think its time for someone else to have some fun with it.  There are two cosmetic issues:  one is the completely normal wear from the safety lever and the other is around the trigger group where the conversion exposed some metal and wasn't refinished.  Neither effects functionality and can be cheaply fixed on your own.  Email is best way to contact me.  Thanks for looking.

Most is rings and chains. All but 2 pieces is stamped with its purity. I Have acid tested all of the gold. The marks are correct. Here's a list of what I have..... 

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright. I can acid test it in front of you to show purity

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar. 

Now for what I'm looking for. I'm really looking for guns, AR's, bolt actions, lever actions, pistols. I will also trade for ammo, reloading supplies, gun safes, hunting equipment. As for specifics.....

Easy to use, makes sight installations a breeze, < 5 minutes easily for most sights. The standard pusher works well for most Glock sights, the tall pusher works much better for Warrens and Heinies. As you can see from the photos, both are in the excellent condition. Includes original box and instructions.

I bought these when I was experimenting with different sight combinations on my Glocks and didn't want to spend too much money on sight installation fees at my gunsmith or risk marring up nicer, high-end sights with a hammer and punch.

A no-brainer if you are planning on trying new sights on your Glock, pays for itself pretty quickly if you try more than a few sets or if you have more than a couple pistols. Also, very nice if you want to make small windage adjustments while at the range.

Asking $80/pusher or $150 for both. Don't miss this opportunity to pick these up, in excellent condition, at a nice discount. Keeps resale value too once you are done with them!"

This rifle has a low serial number. I'm not sure when this rifle was made. If I had to guess I would place it with in the first or second run of the civilian issue (18.5"" barrel). The rifle has age marks as you can see in the photos. I think it's a very cool rifle that shoots nice. I don't think this has been shot a lot. I've shot it maybe 20 times. The 22LR cartridge fits tight and you have to push it in (I don't think this is really an issue, just want to be transparent). The 410 drops in as it should. It fires both barrels nice. The firearm is all original and in nice shape for its age. No issue strapping this nifty survival riffle to your back and using it as intended.
