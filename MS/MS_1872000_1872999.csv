I've had it for about a year, I think I'm the second owner (have original bill of sale), its a 1993 I believe. The insides were pretty gunked up when I got it, but I cleaned the heck out of it before I shot it, and its really clean now. It has never failed to feed, fire, or eject for me (The extractor failed to hand cycle when I first bought it, but after a cleaning and oiling, it hand cycled fine). 

Must be able to prove that you are an IN resident and can legally own a gun. A current and valid LTCH and drivers license will be fine.

This build was inspired by those.

Up for sale is my AR15 Pistol.  The upper/lower combo is a Mega Machine shop upper/lower.  The barrel is an Adam Arms Voodoo Custom Mid-length 5.56 1x8 16"" barrel professionally cut down and re-threaded/treated/crowned 12.5"" barrel  It's a lighter weight profile, not pencil.  The gas port was opened up carefully to allow a soft recoil impulse, and still cycle almost any ammo.  The grip and handguards, trigger guard are all Magpul.  The rear sight is a fantastic removable A2 style.  The front A2 sight post is pinned on.  The lower has a Rock River Arms two stage national match trigger, which is extremely clean.  The BCG is a nickle boron M16 full weight Bolt carrier group.  This pistol was put together with a lot of attention to details, and with a lot of top notch parts.  The cheek rest is a CAA Sidesaddle (approved to be legal on pistols by the ATF, I have the letter).

Google ""Stickman Mega"" and you'll see various examples of why the Mega AR15s are the best out there.  Also note, when you see ads, they often say ""high quality LIKE Mega, Seekins, POF, BCM, etc.""

THIS IS NOT A RIFLE:  This means legally, you need either a pistol purchase permit to buy, or a CCW, or follow NFA rules (i.e. You have a registered or pistol lower to transfer this upper to).  If you wish, I can order a Barrel, and Buttstock, and make this a 16"" barreled AR-15 Rifle instead.


Don't mistake this for a cheap AR-15, it's not.  Very few guns listed on Armslist are of this quality.  It's in very good condition.  With a fairly low round count, only to make sure form and function in it's current condition.  If I get my asking price, it comes with Case, 5 Magazines, Safety lock, etc.

(Only listed as rifle because it was easier to put in caliber, etc)  Sorry for the terrible cell phone pics.

The Benelli Cordoba is a lightning-fast 12-gauge shotgun especially built for hunting. Inspired by the high volume of dove shooting found around Cordoba, Argentina, the designers of Benelli shotguns engineered this one with all the advanced features of a serious sporting clays model. Incorporated into the Cordoba is the 10-mm tapered sporting rib favored by competition shooters and porting to keep barrel climb to a minimum.

The ComforTech stock cushions the blow when ammo isn’t measured in boxes, but by cases in an afternoon. The ComforTech system also helps reduce barrel climb and puts the shooter back on target 69% faster, so that the Cordoba just may be the fastest field gun ever built. A Crio barrel and extended Crio choke tubes put more pellets on target. And the whole package is finished in matte black GripTight coating, so a reflected flash won’t give you away.

This shotgun ships in a fitted hard case.

Either Remington Golden Bullets or Mini-Mags seem to work best in these pistols, so I will include at least 100 Golden Bullets to get you started.  I'll throw in some KG7 moly powder which, in this pistol, is much better than oil and also makes it easier to clean.  I'm asking $450 which is less than what I paid for everything (and you can't buy the high capacity magazine), and I'm happy to answer any questions."

This rifle has a ridiculously low round count, in exactly 12 rounds this rifle was zeroed and used to harvest a Whitetail. A phenomenal deer rifle chambered in arguably one of the most versatile calibers around, this gun has been an absolute blast to use and will not let you down.
Also included is 20rds of Federal Vital-Shok Premium 140gr, and 17rds of Winchester Super X 150gr Power Points.

I think the new Colorado gun laws are ridiculous just like everyone else, but I'm not about to become a criminal so this exchange will have to occur at an FFL where we can pay Uncle Sam to tell us if you've been a good enough boy or girl to have this or not. 
PRICE:
Please feel free to contact me for more pictures or with any other questions. I am asking $425 which is less than what I paid for rifle, scope and ammo, and I am not in any extreme hurry to sell, but I will consider fair offers.
TRADE:
I would be willing to trade for anything related to small game/waterfowl hunting. I have a bolt action .17HMR for rabbit, but I could always use a 20ga, and a 12ga in 3.5"" for duck and goose would also interest me. Lastly my girlfriend has been asking for a Glock 20 (10mm) so if you have one of those on hand let me know.

Anyways, thanks for reading!

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability
and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct
lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic
ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 600, which I also own in 20GA is an incredible shotgun. Every bit as good as my Belgium Browning lightning and Citori & every bit as reliable as my Beretta 686. I've never shot clays with this gun, so all things considered it doesn't have a ton of rounds through it. 

28"" Barrels. 14"" Length of pull. Choked Modified/Full. 

The engraving is magnificent and I always get a lot of compliments on her. The recoil pad is fine & doesn't need replacement. This gun has been in my family since new. It also has a pink fiber optic front sight. 

As you can see in the pictures, a bit of the blueing has worn on the underside of the receiver from handling and the furniture has a nice patina to it. See Hemingway quote below on this. 

Needs nothing but a good owner. I'll answer any questions I can. 

Will consider straight trades for a SXS 20 or 12GA of similar quality

I prefer electronic methods for payment, but if you're unable, I'm willing to discuss.

Barrel Length:	 3""

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

I bought it used about 2 years ago, was in great shape and super clean when I bought it, have run about 400 rounds through it since then and always clean after every range trip. It's more accurate than I am. Great paper puncher and bolt always locks back after empty mag (Common problem with these). This is a great running, clean gun, with no problems to speak of, and a lot of cheap fun!
A dead ringer for an MP5K, this is a 'pre-lawsuit' model, which resembles the real deal quite a bit better and has the correct H&K style ring sight.

We have a guy who is posting anywhere between 2 and 6 scams a day now. Be sure to double check any items posted. This guy is offering low prices and what we expect to be a good deal or reasonable prices for a firearm, generally AR-15s. 

Ways to spot him:
1. Drag and drop any gun images, he likes to take pics from other auction sites.
2. His listings are straight listings on the guns info, taken straight from other sites.
3. Sometimes he has listing in multiple states

In 1961, Grady & Ann Phillips opened “The Sport and Hobby Shop” in an 840 sf vacancy in the Pruitt Shopping Center in Anderson, SC. This store stocked model cars, fishing supplies, athletic goods and a total of two guns. Growth came quickly and in 1963, the store was moved 3 doors down in the shopping center to a 1,400 sf location. Here Grady and Ann added more firearms, toys, games and even Barbie Dolls!

As the business continued to grow, it was moved in 1965 to a 2,400 sf building in the then-new Belvedere Plaza Shopping Center. Horseback riding equipment, western wear and more toys and hobbies were added to the inventory. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Sport Shop” – a name by which some people still refer to us today.

In 1969, Grady and Ann decided to focus on the core business – hunting and fishing. The store was moved one door down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 3,600 sf location. The variety of hunting and fishing equipment was expanded and a mail-order division was started. Grady began producing direct-mail flyers which are still our most effective form of advertising today.

Explosive growth came in the early 70's and the store was moved 3 doors down in the Belvedere Plaza to a 7,000 sf building – almost double the size of the previous location. 10 years later, Grady and Ann felt that a free-standing building would best serve our customers. Property was secured in our current location and a 9,800 sf building was constructed. The name was also changed to “Grady’s Great Outdoors” at this time.

Over the last 22 years, the original structure has been expanded and remodeled to its current 19,000+ sf size.

Our current line-up of products includes: Hunting, Fishing, Camping, Kayaks & Canoes, Casual & Work Clothing, Casual & Work Footwear and much more!! We carry virtually all of the major brands as well as many hard-to-find specialty items.

Grady’s Great Outdoors continues to be owned and operated by the Phillips Family. We cannot express how much we appreciate the support of our customers over the last 50 years. We look forward to serving you for the next 50 years!"

The M1A I picked up last year is my personal SHTF battle rifle. I haven't had the resources to fire it much, and only did with some Winchester 147gr NATO rounds. It shot great.
