This gun was an impulse buy and unfortunately it must go to fund another project. This gun would be perfect for a concealed carry pistol, and there are tons of holsters and accessories available. This gun was used by the Polish police before being import by CAI in Vermont. The price is firmly set at $400. I would challenge you to buy a nicer P-64 and 1,000rds of 9x18mm for the same price after shipping, fees, etc. I'm not trying to make money, just get back some of the money I paid for it, I think this is a fair deal. The buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale. The buyer must also be able to provide a NC license along with a valid concealed weapons permit, proper C&R license, OR a pistol purchase permit. NO EXCEPTIONS. I will not let a pistol find its way into the hands of someone who is not legally allowed to posses one. I can meet in the Fayetteville, Sanford, Lillington, Greensboro, or Raleigh Areas during the week.

Other info: 
Made by the Czechs for Romania during the early days of WWII at the BRNO Arsenal in Czechoslakia.  BRNO is well known for high quality firearms, even the Nazis used teh VZ24 to augment their weapons stores after invading Czechoslakia in 1939. The serial # is low, which puts it being made Pre-Nazi Occupation of Czechoslovakia. Scrubbed crest, miss-matched bolt are common, but ALL PARTS ARE CZ Marked, and everythin has a good fit. Exposed metal is worn and the finish is pretty much gone, but under wood, everything is still good. Small import mark on the front of the barrel.

Model: M48A 

Price: $350 (includes Bayonet)

Rifle: 
Beautiful example of the Yugo Mauser. ALL MATCHING, beautiful finish and a perfect bore.
Looks great, and shoots AWESOME!!!  I have put 20 rounds through it, just to make sure everything works correctly.
The stock show some wear, but the metal and bore look almost unissued. My guess is that it was arsenal refinished prior to export. (Import marked)

10 times better than those mix-master low-grade Yugos that Big 5 is selling for $300.  And this one includes a Bayonet!!!

Bayonet:
Serial# does not match the rifle, but is correct for the M48 Series. Nice wood, good finish
Scabbard is in good shape with no dents or dings
Includes Leather Frog with “trench art” (ie someone carved letters in it  )"

The Carrier can be with or without plates, but not ceramic plates. It can also be with or without mag and equipment pouches as long as they can be added later. I'm also looking for a Tac Vest, but it cannot be cross draw as I prefer a holster either on my hip or in a leg drop. I am left handed so if it is currently set up for that, I need to be able to rearrange it. I'd love to buy a set from AR500 since they have them at $275 with Level III plates, however for a completely set up model their production time is 10-14 weeks. I'd rather not wait that long if I don't have to. I can be reached by email or text at REDACTED. Thanks."

A lot of places charge less but there charge extra for everything but the wood, cant do custom paint schemes, and they use cheap materials that just does not look the same or last as long as the good wood. I do this as a hobby and have been making boards for over 3 years now take a lot of pride in the work I do. I am not mass producing these for the money, each set is made to order. This is a set that will last you a long time. I can make almost anything you need as long as there is a decal. I can even make custom decals (as long as its not a Trade Marked image). They are made with Oak or maple and top of the line 2X4s and painted then covered with three coats of urethane so they will last a long time. The legs fold under the boards for easy storage. I enjoy making them so you wont find the quality of these boards for the price anywhere else. All my boards are custom so I have about a 7 day turn around. If you are looking for a quality set that will last for many years give me a call. The proof is in the pictures. Just compare the pictures people post on Criagslist and you can see the difference. Thanks for looking. I am looking to trade for electronics, guns, etc. What do you have.  Here is my Craigslist add link with 24 different photos of boards I have made.

It is in excellent condition inside and out. The chamber looks like it just came from the factory and this particular setup kicks like a .22lr. The MSRP for this rifle is $1459, I paid $1400 plus tax so this is not your rack grade AR. The price listed for the rifle without the Strike Eagle scope package is $1290. Due to the excellent condition as well as numerous extras I have put on it I believe this to be fair. If you want the entire 3 Gun Package with the Strike Eagle Scope, Vortex Mount and Throw Lever the price is $1765. I will not sell the scope without the rifle so please do not ask. I have had numerous requests for more than what I paid and the answer is no. I am sorry. If I do not sell the rifle I want the scope on it. NOTE: The rifle is shown with a Burris FastFire 2 mounted at a 45 degree angle. This does not come with the rifle. I am going to keep that and did not include that in price. Sorry I pictured it but I didn't want to remove it just to take the picture.If you know what this rifle is then you can just move on to the extras but if you do not… This is a 3 Gun Ready Rifle with a ton of options. Here is what the 3G comes with from the factory: • 18” Stainless Steel Fluted Barrel. It is button rifled with a 1:8 Twist. • Rifle Length Gas System (Kicks like a .22lr)• Stag 3G Compensator • Geisele Super 3G Trigger (3 pound break and the best 3 Gun trigger on the market) • Sampson Evolution 15” Free Floated Handguard with three proprietary aluminum rail attachments • Enhanced semi-auto Bolt Carrier with a manganese phosphate coating • Magpul ACS Stock (A $90 option on all other rifles) This rifle currently has the Vortex Strike Eagle mounted on a Vortex Cantilever Mount with a power THROW LEVER made specific for the Strike Eagle. Listed below is what I paid for it when I finally found it in-Stock on Amazon. I will only sell the Strike Eagle and accessories with the rifle. If someone wants just the rifle and not the scope then I will sell the scope at a later time. If I do not sell the rifle and keep it I want the scope so sorry... it's freaking awesome... Here is what I paid for the scope package.* Vortex Strike Eagle ($329 Amazon)* Vortex Cantilever Ring Mount ($89 Amazon)* Vortex Throw Lever ($59 Amazon)I could bore you with how accurate it is and how well it shoots at distance but I will not. I am willing to meet at any range you want so you can see the Rifle, shoot it, see how accurate it is yourself and know that you are getting a deal (I will even provide the ammo). I have also added a few extras that do not come with this rifle new and the prices listed are what I paid. I have added: * Samson Evolution HK Sling Adapter (Designed specifically for the Evolution for a clean line ($45 from Samson) * Magpul Enhanced Trigger Guard ($19 on Amazon)  * Magpul 40 Round Magazine ($25 Gun Shop) * Blackhawk HK Sling Adapter - Buffer Mount ($39 Amazon)With all of the additions you are basically getting $1500 plus in value without paying tax. So the $1290 I'm asking in the excellent condition the rifle is in is a good deal in my book.I will only sell this Rifle to someone who has a valid CCW permit and NC License. If you do not have that then I will be fine with an FFL transfer at a gun store. Most only charge $20 for this and those are the only two options I am willing to do. I will not compromise on that so please don’t ask. If you are interested, I travel for a living across most of NC so if you want to meet and take a look at it please let me know and I’m sure we can work something out. Thanks for looking."

This pistol is awesome, and I really don't want to sell it. I've put about 300 rounds through it (all of the same ammo it is being sold with) and have not experienced a single failure. It was purchased NIB from a firearm store in Wisconsin while I was deployed, so the rounds I put through are the only ones it has fired. See the bottom of post for the MK2 features if you are unfamiliar.

I have taken meticulous care of this firearm, and cleaned it after each use (per the owners manual). The SN matches the SN provided on the factory fired test round.

Purchased new for MSRP (1299). With the 30 round magazine and ammo, I am selling for 1100 OBO, don't even bother with low ball prices. Interested in trades as well, see below.

-Sorry if the pictures are blurry... Too much caffeine today apparently.

FEATURES:
- One piece metal slide (under polymer cover. Previous versions were two welded pieces. Welds=points for failure)
-Front and rear slide cocking serrations
-Adjustable 'combat sights' (MK-2 available with fixed or adjustable. Fixed sight models feature an extremely awkward hold)
-Slightly wider grip compared to previous IOM/USG models (better ergonomics)
-Ambidextrous safety AND reversible magazine drop
-Tight checker pattern on sides/front of grip and horizontal grip pattern on the rear (much more comfortable if you are shooting bare handed, but that's just my opinion.)"

Lastly, I have an old-school ALICE gear belt with a UTG 3-mag AR-15 magazine pouch. Kinda worn and its easy to see that it's been used. Selling for $10.

If you're interested in all these items, I would consider some sort of package deal with reduced pricing.

I am willing to do some travelling if interested in purchasing."

Firm 70$ yugos go for 25$ a piece, but one is a battlefield pickup and you can really tell by the patina its been in the yugo/balkan war, the one that made former yugoslavia.now serbia.
I think that would merit that mag being worth more than 25$ to a collector but the other two yugos are regular surplus.

Then the bakelite mag ha, look up a price on it. They were for 39.99 but those places are sold out. They go for 70$ now when you find them, so i think thats worth it alone.

Here is a unique and amazing weapon, and I am considering trading it for a specific brand of firearm... I am in no rush and will ignore lowball offers. This is my bushmaster ACR enhanced, and comes with plenty of extra goodies. It has seen 600 rounds, functions better and more accurately than my SCAR, and is a hell of a lot more fun to shoot than half of what I own. It has been babied by me, cleaned thoroughly and treated very well. 

I will include an extra fixed stock as well as the folding stock, and I have installed the OSS bannar bravo comp (120.00), and will add as many mags as you do. I have plenty of ammo if balance is needed, but I will most likely NOT include the leupold optic. This package carries a value of 1850.00."
