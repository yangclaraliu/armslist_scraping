This is the perfect AR as it hits harder than a 223/556 and has less recoil than a 308. This was my “ultimate” build but now need the funds as other priorities have suddenly come up.  I had Redmond Hydrographics do a custom paint job on the rifle.  The lower parts kit and barrel are cerekoted graphite black and the rest of the gun is done in a snake skin camo dip.  The rifle is absolutely beautiful.  The 16 inch barrel is manufactured by FNH USA that uses the “machine gun steel” grade of metal for the rifle barrel.  The forearm is a super slim UTG that is very streamlined and light.  The lower receiver is Bushmaster.  I built this gun to be as light as possible and it comes with a mission tactical stock that also has the graphite black and snakeskin paint and hydro dip.  I also have (2) Barret 30 round magazines that come with the gun.  One mag is snakeskin camo to match the rifle and the other is standard black. These are the best mags for the SPC II.  The rifle comes with a nickel boron bolt carrier.  I did do a barrel break in procedure on the rifle using an Otis kit and only have 30 rounds down the barrel.  I will meet serious buyers out at COSSA (gun range east of Bend) if you want to test fire the rifle.  I am only asking $1,399. This is less than I have into the gun and all the work is already done for you.  I am not interested in trades.  Cash only please.  Also, I will pay for the transfer at Lost Creek Armory in Bend because of the recent change in the law.  The scope is brand new and can include for an additional $200.  It is a Vortex Spitfire and is brand new with box."

Springfield Armory's Description and Specs 

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® redefines what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is available in your favorite calibers. It’s time for you to get serious about winning. It’s ready. Are you?

Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.
All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.
The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.
Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.
The modular design of the USP's internal components allows the control lever function to be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol for left-handed shooters. The USP can also be converted from one type of trigger firing mode to another. This includes combination double-action and single-action (DA/SA) modes and double action only (DAO) modes.

The pistol is in new condition with very low round count.  It will come with one 12rd magazine and soft pistol carrying case.  Keep in mind this pistol retails at $1350!  I would like to sell it for $900 or trade for the items listed below.  I will take multiple items in trade.  Trades must be of equal value.  +/- cash as necessary with trade offers.
