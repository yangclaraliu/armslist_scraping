I think they'd look a lot better on a typical dark finish (like bluing,cerakote,whatever).
They're a very solid, hard polymer, not a cheap,thin, hollow plastic. They're in brand new condition, and should fit any full-sized ""government"" or ""commander"" sized pistol just fine.
To occasionally switch-out the looks of your 1911, you can't beat 'em for only $10 bucks !!
Thanks for looking......."

This rifle is like new and in great shape. It's only had approximately 250 rounds fired through it. I'm out of space in the safe, so it's time for someone else to enjoy this rifle.

The SIG556® HOLO features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by Swiss Arms and marries it to a CNC machined from 7075-T6 grade aluminum forged trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG556 HOLO features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The SIG556 HOLO has a proven two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system joined to a lightweight alloy trigger housing that accepts standard AR magazines. The vented non-slip polymer forearm has three Picatinny rails for accessory mounting. Sight options include front combat sight, flip-up rear sight, and a red dot style holographic sighting system that allows for quick target acquisition, with four illuminated reticle patterns with adjustable intensities. The SIG556 buttstock is collapsible and has a rubber butt pad and a number of sling attachment points.

Bi-pod, one 30 round Sig Sauer magazine, owner's manual, and hard sided case are included. 

I can send more photos, upon request. 

The scope and rings shown in the photos are not included with the purchase of the rifle; only the Holographic Red Dot sight is included.

The scope and rings can be included for an extra $400. I'm not trying to sell it (it's brand new, just mounted), but would sell if someone wanted to buy it. The scope is a brand new Burris Predator Quest, 4.5-15x42mm, with side focus and an ARD. Price would be a total of $1350 for the rifle and scope."

 Fancy maple stock.

 Green Mountain rifled, octagon to round barrel with wedding band at 42 inches.

 Chambers Late Ketland Lock,very fast and sparks like the 4th of July.

 Tennessee style rifle with custom ordered musket style buttstock...much more comfortable to shoulder and shoot.

 59 inches over all and points well. 

 Finished in Aqua-Fortis with 10 coats of hand rubbed boiled lindseed oil...Not the fake stuff!

 All browned furniture.

 Mirror bore...sharp lands and grooves...I take care of my bores...I didn't order the round counter attachment, but I would guesstimate about 300 rounds...FFF Goex only. 

 Simple, beautiful, and accurate...It is a joy to shoot. 

 About 6 years old, but looks 150...in a good way!

 A few very light handling marks, but certainly no cracks.

 I also am throwing in a Lee 5 cavity .520 mold and about 3/500 pure lead cast round balls, as this is the only rifle I have that shoots the 520 ball best...I use a 1000 patch.

 Green Mountain barrels are notoriously tight. You can stuff a 525 or 530 down it and do just fine, but why fight it?

  Would prefer to meet at Sapulpa/Bristow/Glenpool China Marts during daylight hours. I will however, if your seriously interested, drive up to 75 miles to meet you for a no obligation look. No tire kickers or BSers, please. We must agree on terms b4 meeting.

 Asking $950.00 FTF cash for everything. This is probably about half the replacement cost...not counting extras.

 I'm not a good photographer, but I have some more pics I can email on request.

Would rather sell for cash, as I have a new Northwest Trade rifle to pay for, but I am a hopeless accumulator of quality firearms, so send me partial/full trade offer if you like. If we cannot trade, all I can do is give you a polite, No Thanks.

 Have a good day and tnx for looking.

 Semi-Auto-22. A living tribute to the genius of Browning. Few autoloading rimfire rifles have endured the test of time and the marketplace like the Browning SA-22. The SA-22 is one of the first autoloading rimfire rifles ever made, and one the most desirable. One John M. Browning’s final designs, his genius shines through in every feature. The slim, forged steel receiver and slender barrel takes down into two compact units without tools.

The SA-22’s tasteful engraving and select walnut make it an object of lasting beauty and enjoyment. Though nice to look at, these rifles are meant to be enjoyed in the field as much as they are admired as heirlooms.

If one word were to describe the Semi-Auto 22 it would be ""CLASSIC."" Like the famous Automatic 5 shotgun or a Hi-Power pistol, the Semi-Auto 22 gives you a real sense of the incredible design skills and genius of John Moses Browning. And the quality of wood and steel will exceed your expectations. People sometimes say ""they don't make 'em like they used to."" With the Browning Semi-Auto 22, they still do!

I would put a USED trade value of $800. If you make an offer where your valuing your gun at what you can buy it for at a retail, then my trade value will also go up to retail price.

It has around 1,000 rounds through it, but I don't have an exact round count. I don't think I've ever put more than 150 rounds through it at one time. Probably more like 30-60 rounds per range session, or less. I've used it to take a few coyotes using Black Hills 40gr V-Max bullets, which have worked quite nicely. Got it in 2005."

While it's an excellent rifle, it's just too much for my rebuilt shoulder, and too much money to just sit in the safe. The 3 Gun Heavy has the same setup for the upper as they did with the original DMR rifle (rifle length gas system and lower profile upper/rail), which they've since changed. Barrel is threaded by Sig and comes with a thread protector. Very accurate, very nice rifle, but after about 20 rounds unsuppressed I start to not like it as much. It has about 80 rounds down the pipe since I bought it new, and other than that it's LNIB. No hickups at the range, no functional issues, no problems at all, besides my weak-ass shoulder...
This rifle is a shooter, and comes from the factory with a Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA) trigger installed. I attached a few targets from the range, one showing the sight-in unsuppressed at 50 yards and one showing the best group I shot suppressed at 100 yards.

Comes with everything SIG included; 2 PMags (one unopened), rail ladders, mil-style cleaning kit (which you really don't want to use), gun lock, and empty chamber indicator.

I want to get $1,550 for it + actual shipping/insurance,no trades. Payment by USPS Money Orders."

I had this rifle posted before but I added a couple more things to the package and a little more info.

I have a Mag Tactical Systems 9mm rifle thats in great shape. I fired 500rds through it and its a really fun gun to shoot. Easy to break down very similar to an AR, you push out the take down pin, the charging handle comes out, and you're ready to clean. The rifle is left hand charging, but works fine with a left handed shooter. This fun little gun's upper and lower are made of machined billet T6 aluminum (unlike some other 9mm rifles that are poly lowers) and equipped with a standard mil spec buffer and tube and its made right here in Indiana (Newburg).

The gun comes equipped with the following:
Four 33rd mags,
One 15rd mag,
One 50rd drum that's been correctly fitted and comes with original box (first picture),
ETG XP-6E light and red laser combo, cheaper model but works well, 
Vortex strikefire red dot and 2x magnifier and original box (I think),
Magpul MOE stock and grip,
UTG Slim rail,
Reign Supreme 3 prong muzzle break,
Original factory furniture and muzzle protector.

$800 cash or $850 trade for everything in the package that's listed above, I will not split up. If this was all to be purchased new then it would be well over $1000.

Located in Vincennes, but will be traveling to Indy on July 11th and could meet there. I also make it to Evansville and Terre Haute every now and then. Must have valid Indiana drivers license, LTCH and be willing to sign a bill of sale with DLN. If you don't have a LTCH then a transfer must take place at a local gun shop at buyers expense. Cash price is firm."

Our Assessment: > The 1911 and 1911-A1 pistols served the military of the United States from 1911 to 1985, through two World Wars and the Korean and Vietnam wars. They gained a reputation as a reliable handgun with plenty of stopping power, and are held in high regard by those who have used them. This is a WWII manufactured 1911A1 pistol made by Colt and is part of a group delivered to the U. S. Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance. It is in about Very Good condition, with thinning and handling marks over about 10% of its finish with little pitting. It is missing its magazine. This weapon has a great bore. This weapon will provide a wonderful addition to any collection!

We have two dozen pictures. Please email us if you wish to see more pictures or discuss the weapon. mmonetta ""at"" dssinc ""dot"" org. I can also be reached at REDACTED

With the Spectre 22, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility.The Spectre 22 has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre 22 has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily.SPECTRE 22CALIBER:.22 LR.17 HMR.22 MAG.22 WMR.22 HORNETFN 5.7X28WEIGHT:6.8 OZDIAMETER1.000”LENGTH:5.98”AVG SOUND LEVEL:.22LR – 113.8 dB.17HMR- 123.3 dB5.7×28- 125.8 dBFINISH:Black OxideMATERIALS:Baffles & End Caps: 17-4 Stainless SteelTube: 316 Stainless SteelThread Mount: 17-4 Stainless SteelFEATURES:Full Auto Rated for .22 LRDurable Stainless SteelChemical ResistantLifetime WarrantyUser Serviceable with CTA Baffles"

Now, I acquired a lightly used Socom 16 in a trade and decided that I would keep it for myself and build an EBR (Enhanced Battle Rifle) out of it. So far I have replaced the ghost ring sights with a national match front and standard rear aperture; replaced the gas cylinder, gas cylinder plug, and gas piston with brand new Springfield parts; and I installed the firearm into a Sage ALCS chassis (EBR). Aside from that I have thoroughly cleaned the entire firearm, this thing is immaculate as far as cleanliness goes. I'd love to keep it and continue the build, but I've got too many projects going at once and selling this should give me the funds to finish the others. 

Included with the firearm is: FOUR 20 round magazines with 10 round mag blocks (1 was taken out for the pic); ONE 10 round magazine; TWO 5 round magazines; the original sights, gas cylinder, piston, and cylinder plug; and a USGI M14 multi tool.

It takes a SPARC to light a fire. The new, compact, daylight-bright SPARC (Speed Point Aiming for Rapid Combat) is packed with performance features and lends itself to a wide variety of firearm platforms—including AR15s, shotguns, and pistols. The modular three-piece base offers four separate mounting heights for user- and weapon-specific customization: 18.5mm (.725 inches), 22mm (.875 inches), 36mm (1.425 inches), 40mm (1.575 inches). Digital rear-facing and side controls for power on/off, dot brightness and night vision mode. Aircraft-grade 6061-T6 aluminum body. Get on target fast with the SPARC. The versatile multi-height mount system of the SPARC accommodates AR15s needing absolute or lower 1/3 co-witness heights and uses a standard Weaver or Picatinny base (not included). The SPARC is also threaded to accept accessory ARD and comes with a 2x magnifier.

I have for sale a top of the line POF Warhog! Please google this rifle and you will see how outstanding this gun is! It is without a doubt, the best piston system money can buy and I have owned all the best piston rifles on the market (LWRC, POF, PWS, etc..) This is POF’s Premiere rifle at the current moment. i bought this rig to varmint hunt with.. My needs have changed and I am going completely away from the AR platform. I intend to focus entirely on the long range bolt gun platform now… Im selling to fund a build. Below is a break down of everything included in the package and what I paid for it. I have all the paperwork, boxes, manuals, warranty cards for everything. gun has been fired less than 60 times. I had zero problem hitting a 12” steel swinger at 600 yds. The barrel is 1/8 twist so it will stabilize all ammo from 55-77gr. This rifle coupled with the Leupold glass is a great setup. The scope has the Kenton Industries turrets with yardage marks on the elevation turret. Rifle is dialed at 100yds. Just range target, roll turret to specified yardage and fire! its dead on out to 600yds. Minus wind of course :)  Thanks for looking!

It has all the benefits of the Silver Pigeon I plus more extensive game engraving and a stock oval for the owner’s initials, while not featuring the gold inlays of the Silver Pigeon V. Weighing only about 7 lbs, it handles wonderfully as a game gun while not being too light for a long session at the clay range. It is available in 12 and 20 gauge, or in 28 gauge with a petite scaled frame. Natural Pointability, Swing: The Silver Pigeon is built on the legendary 687 action, a long-standing favorite among hunters and competitive shooters. It features two conical locking lugs at mid-action, right between the barrels, giving it great locking strength and durability while keeping the action’s profile considerably lower. The advantage is that the eye of the shooter is a lot closer to the plane of his supporting hand, resulting in a considerably better swing and hand-eye coordination. Tough, Accurate Barrels: The Silver Pigeon III is a shotgun designed to last several lifetimes in spite of its lightness and fast handling."
