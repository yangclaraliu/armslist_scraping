I have a rifle for trade listed below. But I am also looking fr a nice wood stock set for an ak. I'll swap an arsenal all black us made stock set for your wood set. Text pics of your set if interested. 


Up for trade is an awesome arsenal sgl21. It's in good shape (I would rate 90%). There are a few marks but over all very very clean. For the enthusiast/collector my rifle has an earlier legion stamped rifle. For most this won't mean anything but from a collector stand point this is more sought after.  Has seen around 500rds. Super smooth trigger. A very nice rifle. Being these are rapidly gaining popularity because these Russian aks are longer being imported, I figured I would see if I can turn it into something else I have been looking for. I'm looking for around $1200 in value out of it. If you look for these rifles for sale gunbroker is about the only place around to find them and they are asking much much more than that for them. 

Quality 14.5"" or 18"" ar15. Bcm, spikes, colt etc. 

Other quality ak in 7.62 or 5.45 plus cash. (Mak90 an $475 cash)

Nice grain,  color in person is a little lighter than what you see pictured on the model sidearm and the inside grip is a little darker than the outside grip.
These grips have been worn for twenty years or so on a full sized 1911. 

They have wear from use but not worn out. One grip has been repaired from a crack. The repair is close to 15 years old and is probably stronger than the grips.

It was originally a short action .308 700 VS, and the action has been timed and trued. The bolt handle has been extended and has a larger than factory knob on it. The barrel is a Pac-Nor Super Match stainless chambered for 6.5-08 (aka .260 Rem). Twist is 1 in 8"" and the contour is medium Palma. It's in an HS Precision Pro Series stock with Remington bottom metal. The scope is a Bushnell Elite 3200 10x40 with mil-dot reticle and MOA adjustments, mounted in Burris quick-release rings. This gun used to be an NRA High Power match rifle so the receiver is drilled & tapped for an iron sight base and slotted for loading with stripper clips. The muzzle is also turned down to .750"" for mounting a front sight.

I also have a bunch of reloading supplies to go with the rifle. I have a Forster Ultra seating die and both full-length and neck-only Redding Type-S bushing sizing dies, along with a Redding 7mm-08 sizing die for necking down .308 cases. I have about 400 cases formed from Winchester .308 brass.  I have roughly 300 Lapua and Sierra bullets, about 1300 CCI primers, and roughly 1.75 pounds of Varget and .75 pounds of H4350. Everything is included in the asking price. If you are already reloading for a rifle caliber this is everything you need to load for this rifle.

I am looking to purchase a decent SKS or trade. The reason I chose an SKS is because i do not have a ton of money and they seem to be a nice high powered rifle. At the moment the only rifle i own is a Ruger 10/22 with a nice folding stock and 6 25 round mags 1 30 rounder, 1 50 rounder and 3 10 round mags that are connected by a trimag holder. My 10/22 also comes with the stock locking system and all the extra picatinny rails that came with the stock and it comes with the original black stock. Well lets face it every prepper needs atleast 1 high power rifle and a 22lr just doesn't cut it. So if you are in the dmv or near by and are looking to sell you SKS please contact me. I also have about 800 to 1000 rounds of 22lr i can include. I just put the stock barrel back on my Ruger 10/22 but it also comes with a threaded barrel. My Mossberg 500 comes with a Blackhawk recoil reduction stock and a pistol grip. I also have about 100 to 200 rounds of 12 guage. Thanks

If your SKS is in excellent condition and comes with high cap mags and a nice stock i might be interested in trading either my Ruger 10/22 or my Mossberg 500.

Honestly i would only be looking to spend between $300-$400 cash. Thank you.

If you are interested in trading plus cash I would also be looking for a nice Ruger mini 14, Ar15 or any 556 or 7.62 semi auto rifle. I chose the SKS because it is a decent high powered rifle that will not cost an arm and a leg. So if you have any of those other rifles I would have to do trade plus cash. Which I can only put out about $300-$400 in cash. I am not looking to rip anyone off so if you want to trade make sure your firearm is in the range of trading one of my firearms plus the cash I have. Thank you.

Now one last thing if you live in the state of MD I can not just hand over my high cap mags to you because that would be illegal. So if you are in MD I would have to meet you outside of MD or I can ship them to an address outside of MD. Thank you all for taking the time to read and I hope we can make a deal. If you have any questions what so ever PLEASE ask. Thank you.

The revolver in the picture is an antique and it does not have a firing pin. So it is pretty much a collectible. Thank you"

Here is what I want right now. Either of these would be a 1:1 trade. I am very familiar with both of these, and very familiar with what the going rate of them is.  I have 2000 rounds of 9mm I could trade for parts, mags etc for the guns being traded. I don't mind if yours is slightly used. No crazy paint jobs though or irreversible modifications. For the record, this pistol is not unobtanium, however supply is backed up and if you can find it for that price from a dealer now I would scoop it up.... That ""$850 MSRP"" is a joke. These won't be that price until production picks up. That being said, what im asking for (either one) I believe to be a very fair trade.

New EAA Witness P Purple & Black 9MM Semi Auto 12 Rounds For the discerning female shooter who appreciates Italian design and craftsmanship. The new WITNESS POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness P offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

From the late 19th Century throughout most of the 20th Century the answer to the “If I could own only one gun” question was, hands down, the Winchester Model 1894. The serial number on this one dates it to sometime in 1973. It is in very good condition for its age with just enough love marks to give it some character. The bore has strong rifling and the rifle is incredibly accurate. Estimating fewer than 500 rounds have been fired through it.

This model features full stainless steel barrel/action and a Hogue Overmold stock. Overall, it is a very durable bolt action hunting rifle and lightweight configuration. The action also has a drop plate, so extra rounds can be removed without cycling them through the action. The rifle is extremely accurate, I used it for hunting with a 2-7 power scope (not included) and was able to shoot MOA. Scope bases are included as shown on the rifle. I bought the rifle for hunting two years ago and I am selling because I recently inherited a similar power rifle and have no need for both. 

The rifle also comes with two boxes of premium hunting ammunition. One box is Nosler Trophy Grade, the other is Remington Premier Scirocco Bonded, each of these boxes is $45 to purchase new, but are included with the rifle.

Designed to replace the grip on the wildly popular Smith & Wesson J-Frame round-butt revolver line, the LG-105 features a hard, smooth polymer surface that provides for a prompt, snag-free draw. Once mounted, the grip's front pressure switch immediately activates the laser as you hold the pistol in a natural firing position.

Some finish wear as pictured, but overall in fairly clean shape for a 105 year old rifle!  The serial number on this Winchester, 61xxx, puts the rifle at having been produced in 1910.  Rifle has spent many years well-maintained and sitting in our family's gun case, but it's time it moves on to another home.  Barrel is a bit dusty, but rifling is fully clean and intact.  Action is smooth, with everything working as it should.  

On the history of this model, the model 1903 was the first commercially available semi-automatic rifle produced by Winchester.  Chambered in .22 Winchester, this rifle WILL NOT take standard .22LR.  That said, 22 WIN is still commercially available if you ever decide to take the rifle to the range (I know JG Sales carries 22 WIN).

One of the Mags is a factory Colt 1911; one I believe is a Wilson's Combat mag, and the third one is a no name BUT, oddly enough, it seems to work just as good as the other two. This gun can share many parts with the Standard Colt 1911, except for the grips. They do make custom blanks online though that you can drill and notch yourself. Most other parts are available online at Numriche.com or possibly your local gun smith. This has been a great pistol that has been VERY well taken care of and fires very well without jamming. It has a polished Feed Ramp and polished finish as well. There isn't a speck of rust anywhere on the gun at all. I have seen them go upwards of $450-500 on this very site alone. I am selling mine with the three clips for $350. It does need a new plunger housing and spring, which goes between the Slide Release and Slide Safety on the outside of the gun. Part is compatible with a Colt factory replacement part, but they have the original Lllama ones on Numerich as well for $23. All it takes is just two small screws so NO need to go to a gun smith at all. I hate to see it go but I have other projects I am trying to fund as well."

Up a Fantastic shape, October 1942 M1 Garand Parkerized ($600 process) used in service during the WWII war. This gun WAS NOT BUILT but actually used in the War! It has 2 little scratches in it but overall people have told me ""this is in excellent shape"" for a service rifle. 

Now onto the important parts of buying an M1 Garand, the parts. This gun is 95% original and I have all the serial numbers of each part as well. The reason its 95% is the bolt and hammer have been changed out when most of the M1's were sent to Korea to be refurbished in the 50's after the war. Since this was a service rifle and corrosive primers were used, the bolts corroded and they replaced them in bulk. Some people like this history of the gun so I left it as is. No worries though on you can get the original serial numbered Bolt for that year (new in box also) for $89 and its a 100% rifle (I even have the guys email you can get it from)

I have attached a few photos attached, it comes with what is shown in the photos and I can meet anytime as well.

These things are not fixed, you can do them yourself as you see fit. I want $1600 for the van. I am willing to do a partial trade for firearms or firearm related items. I need $1000 cash minimum so whatever the trade is, should be around $500-600 give or take. The van is far from perfect but runs well. It has near 200k miles but it's a Toyota so could keep on keeping on. I'm in Salem and cannot meet anywhere other than by my house because it's not registered at the moment.

I'm located in Wagoner, Oklahoma and I can meet you any time that's convenient for you.  
This 3.5x35 ACOG scope provides a dual-illuminated reticle using fiber optics and tritium for a bright aiming point in any light condition. The 300 blackout reticle with merged aiming points has been optimized for simplicity and efficiency. It allows the user to instantly switch between supersonic and subsonic ammunition without having to re-zero the optic. The supersonic BDC (out to 600 yds.) has been merged with the subsonic BDC (out to 200 yds.) to provide one set of aiming points for both types of ammunition. The reticle drops are based on an average of commonly available off-the-shelf subsonic and supersonic ammunition from a 16"" barrel. This BDC reticle is not limited to one or two specific bullets: a majority of commonly available ammunition will fall within the 2 MOA diamond aiming points. The 2 MOA diamonds offer a balance of speed and versatility based on the unique performance of the 300 Blackout caliber. The drops in MOA for each aiming point are provided for users who wish to develop their own handloads for use on firearms with a barrel of 16"" or shorter, or for those who wish to deviate from the recommended zero distances.

I have 2 of these Walther PPQ M1 9mm.  I prefer the M1 over the M2 cause I don't like where the put the thumb mag release on the M2. My personal experience I think this pistol has the best trigger out if the box for a striker fire, you will be impressed. Just youtube it for the reviews. Has had maybe 200 rounds through it with no malfunctions what so ever. But I just picked something up so no point of having 2 of the exact same guns, that's just silly. I'm asking $600 firm for the complete package. The IWB holster and ammo is not pictured but I can assure you it is good quality as the firearm. Cash is my main preference but I'm open to hear trade offers of firearms only. Would only consider 9mm pistols."
