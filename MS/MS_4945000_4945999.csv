Their trigger work is amazing as well, breaking around 2-2.5 pounds with no creep or grit. The frame was also done by PRP in a large stipple pattern. The frame was finished off by adding a matching hard chrome colored magwell, which is easily removed if preferred. It comes in the factory hard cas, including all parts as it did factory new. All 3 19 round mags have oversized baseplates. This package also includes the multi weight recoil/striker spring pack from Wolff. These will allow you to tune it to run anything, from under powered competition loads all the way up to heavy defensive type rounds. There was right at $1800 total invested in this package new, but we are only asking $1200 cash total out the door! Why spend hundreds more and wait months to get your hands on a new PRP custom, when you can get this one right now at a fraction of the price. You have to see and shoot this one to appreciate it. We also accept credit card payment, card use forfeits a 3.5% cash discount. Shipping to a local FFL is available, if necessary. All firearm trade offers are welcome and will be evaluated. Blackacre Arms is a FFL licensed custom shop located in Stanfield, NC. All federal, state and local laws apply. Contact me with any interest or questions. I can be reached by message, text/phone or email. Thanks for your time and we look forward to your business."
