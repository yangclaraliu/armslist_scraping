http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

Used Springfield Armory Mil-Spec Stainless 1911 in .45ACP with Trijicon tritium front sight. Finish is in very good condition, minor scratches on brushed flats as well as on media blasted areas, no rust. Previous owner had front sight dovetailed and had Trijicon tritium front sight installed- unfortunately the dovetail is not square in relation to the back sight and is slightly canted slightly to the left (if looking from back sight to front sight.) Also has issues with loading from full 8rd magazines (Chip McCormick, Wilson Combat) and has occasional (1 in ~50) failures to feed with 7rd magazines.

In the interest of full disclosure, I do not consider the gun suited for defensive purposes in its current state. I fully believe that it is a good gun that would make an excellent platform for a build, however, I do not have the time nor the financial resources to be able to do such currently.

Aprox. 200rds put through gun in my care (FMJ only), previous owner estimated another 200rds (HP only).

Comes with the following-
2 7rd Magazines (OEM)
Smith & Alexander MSH/Magwell GMAS (Government Model Arched Stainless)
Extra recoil spring (unsure of weight, I believe 2lbs heavier than stock)
OEM Black plastic grips
Extra grip set (wood- unknown type, aftermarket)
Factory Case
OEM OWB Holster
OEM OWB Mag carrier
Chamber Flag
OEM Bore brush.

This rifle uses standard AR-10 mags (like Pmags), so you don't have to bother with expensive model-specific mags.  Comes with the original 10 round factory mag and a 20 round Magpul Pmag.

For cash sale of the rifle: FTF in Harrisburg area with proper PA ID and signed bill of sale.  Private transfers of long guns in PA do not require an FFL transfer.  I'm happy to do an FFL transfer at your expense if you are more comfortable with that.

For trades that involve the transfer of a pistol from you to me, I will cover the costs of my background check at an FFL.

I also have a Stoeger Cougar Compact in 9mm and a modified Glock 21 for sale/trade on armslist.  I'm open to a 2-for-1 or 3-for-1 trade, depending on what you're offering.  Any deals involving pistol transfers to you will require an FFL, and we will each pay the cost of our own background checks.

I'm in Harrisburg, but willing to travel reasonable distances for the right deal.

Trades: mainly interested in 1911s, but will consider guns in 9, 40, 45, 10mm, 357 or 44.

I've shot less than 500 rounds through it, and the gun doesn't even have a single scratch on it!  This gun has the much more desirable/rare stainless steel slide rather than the nitron slide.  This helps make the gun significantly more durable, and also in my opinion looks much better.  This Sig does have the optional upgraded SIGLITE® Night Sights which were quite costly up front, but are very handy for home defense at night.  I'm also including the original carrying case, instructions, and 5 magazines (12 rd capacity) as well.  This gun is completely ready to hit the range, or for defense right out of the box.


The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. In use by the US Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few; the P226 has continually proven itself. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this high capacity full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, 40S&W or 357SIG, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. Additional features include a reversible magazine release and easy conversion from 357SIG to 40S&W with SIG SAUER factory replacement barrels.

I have for sale a gently used high quality Kydex concealment holster by Dale Fricke Holster. This is not a cheap homemade holster. Retail is $95. 

I am also including a single horizontal mag pouch holder from same company. Retail $40

Asking $60 for both

From DaleFricke Holsters:
The Archangel© is the latest holster in the (AIWB) Inside the Waistband Appendix Holster family. The Archangel was specifically designed to retain the concealment advantages of Appendix carry as well as the speed of draw offered by its predecessors. We changed the “J” hooks to dual snap belt loops and did away with the tuckable feature.

Additionally, while the the tuckable feature is important for some end-users, it does add some bulk to the overall holster. The Archangel does not feature a tuckable design and is intended to be worn with a shirt-tails out concealment. The holster itself is very minimal in design and rides very comfortably inside the waistband. The result is a slim-line holster with reduced dimensions and yet just as secure and fast as its other KYDEX® predecessors.

This piece was custom ordered from what I consider to be the best semi-custom 1911 maker on the planet, GUNCRAFTER Industries. My preference is a trade however I have listed cash prices as well. 

#1 - GUNCRAFTER INDUSTRIES ""NO NAME"" commander bobtail (aluma grips, flush cut slide stop, reverse crown barrel, etc) This gun has less than 200 rounds on it. It is flawless and literally as new.  These bobtail commanders are rather hard to come by, I've never seen another come up for sale in CA (*NOTE: the govt GC pictured has been sold) 
$3500 

#2 - NIB HK P30L V1 light LEM trigger - unfired in original box
Cash price - $1250
My cost was $995 plus $89.55 tax plus $175 SSE fee plus $90 (2 ten round factory mags as the gun was shipped with none due to high capacity)
(My total cost $1349.55)"

It is a registered assault weapon in California.  (That’s right, no bullet button.)  I am the original owner and it is like new.  This is the good one, ""Made in Greece"" model, not the funky looking knock off.  Nor is it one of the ""overstamped"" rifles that were stamped a second time to avoid the ban.  This is the real Springfield Armory SAR-8 rifle, manufactured in Greece.  

This is from Wikipedia:  “Licensed copies of the G3 and HK-91 were produced in Greece by Hellenic Arms Industry or ""EBO"", using factory tooling purchased from Heckler & Koch. A small number of these HK-91 clones, which are functionally and aesthetically identical to the German-made rifles, were imported into America by Springfield Armory, Inc. and sold under the designation SAR-8. These rifles, which ceased being imported in 1994, are not to be confused with later Springfield-made SAR-8 model rifles which feature cast aluminum receivers and are considered of markedly lower quality, being valued at far less than the original Greek models.”  

This rifle has been a safe queen.  There are no scratches, dings, nothing.  The original stock has a removable cheek pad installed to compensate for the scope.  Round count is about 200 rounds.  I've only shot factory ammo through it.  It comes with the original box and what you see in the photos.  It also comes with FIVE HIGH CAPACITY POLYMER MAGAZINES.  

The overall length is 42.5 inches and the barrel is 20 inches long.  It weighs less than 11 pounds without the bipod and scope/mount.  

As you can see from the photos, there are some extras.  I purchased a nice bipod specifically designed for that line of rifles.  I've only shot off that bipod once and I loved it.  I also purchased a full set of olive pistol grip furniture.  The black furniture is original.  The olive gives you the thin stock and pistol grip and thin fore-end giving the HKG3 look.

It has the claw type scope mount.  You can still use the iron sights with that mount.  It also has a compact Leapers 3-12x44 mil-dot reticle with illumination, zero locking/resetting target turrets and side wheel parallax adjustment.   

This rifle is really accurate.  I used it in a couple local long range tactical matches.  I performed pretty well with it.  I'm selling it because it has just been sitting in the safe since the 1990s.  Every year I wipe it down and swab the barrel with an oily rag/mop using CLP Collector’s.  

It functions flawlessly.  I've never had an issue or a single jam with it.  Recoil is very light.  Less than an M1-A.  Great rifle to lay down and hit targets quite a distance away with a quick follow up shot.  It is also a very short rifle, much shorter than the M1-A.  This is a bad @!# rifle you can easily shoulder and shoot off-hand.  This rifle brings a lot to the table.  You can lay down and fire or shoot off-hand.  It is easy to operate with due to its short length, but it packs an accurate 308 punch. 

Complete kit with scope, bipod, magazines, and extra furniture.  $1900 plus $50 for shipping and insurance.  

I am happy to provide you with information so you can confirm who I am and how to contact me prior to you sending me any money.  I will hold the purchase funds until you receive the rifle and gear and inspect it.  I can also give you my iTrader rating on other gun selling websites.

If you don’t know what these rings can do, check them out on Barrett’s website. It has pins to make the rings give a 15 MOA or a 40 MOA cant for extra-long distance. 

I am the original owner and the rings come in the original box, complete.  They were mounted on a Barrett once and 50 rounds shot through it.  These rings are ROCK SOLID.  They are cosmetically pristine, like new.  Mechanically perfect.  

They retail for $236 plus shipping. Manufacture's SKU is 13319.  I had to sell the rifle because it just sat in the safe and I needed to pay off some debts.  

Easy to use.  Impossible to shake.  

These high-tech scope rings give you the perfect interface between your scope and rifle with Barrett’s ZERO-GAP technology. Manufactured from 7075 aluminum alloy, they grip tight even under the heaviest recoil without adding unwanted weight.

Barrett’s exclusive ZERO-GAP technology also allows you to avoid the usual challenges that other optics-mounting systems present. With traditional rings, attention must be given to maintaining an equal gap between the lower ring and the ring cap. The scope may potentially rotate out of perfect alignment while the cap screws are being torqued. Barrett’s scope-clamping ZERO-GAP design allows you to simply tighten the cap on the indicated side until there is no gap between the lower ring and ring cap, check for perfect reticle alignment, tighten the other side and fire away.

ZERO-GAP rings are available in 30 mm and 34 mm and a variety of heights, offering the perfect fit for everything from a low-mounted, action-hugging scope on a hunting rifle to a high-mounted, large-objective optic on a tactical rifle.

This thing is a hammer.  I am the original owner.  It comes in a huge Pelican 1750 rolling case that is very sturdy. It has a cleaning kit and an oily mop, pictured in case. This rifle is like new. I’ve kept it well lubricated with a thin, shiny coat of oil. I’ve only put 50 rounds down the tube. The muzzle brake is incredibly effective.  I live in San Diego but will travel a reasonable distance.  I will ship for $75.  

This thing is absolutely new.  No scratches, scrapes or marring of any kind.  It is like factory new.  Used it only to put 50 rounds down range, and that’s it.   Overall length is 50 inches.  It has a 32 inch barrel.  It weighs 25 pounds.  

Because this is a big ticket item, I am happy to provide you with information so you can confirm who I am and how to contact me prior to you sending me any money.  I will hold the purchase funds until you receive the rifle and inspect it.  I can also give you my iTrader rating on other gun selling websites.  

Power, pure and simple.

Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy.

The .416 Barrett caliber brings new levels of precision shooting to the Model 99. With the enhanced accuracy and increased velocity of the .416 Barrett cartridge, this rifle offers incredible long-range precision.

The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain.

The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.

Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on."

This is not the ""Benchrest"" scope.  This is the rock solid NXS model.  I don’t think the 12-42x56 NXS model is being manufactured anymore.  So if you want this magnification in a rock solid scope, this is it.  It has a lifetime, transferable warranty by Nightforce, not that it needs it.  It has high speed turrets.  No Zero Stop.  It has the 1/4"" Minute of Angle (""MOA"") adjustments at 100 yards with the Mil-Dot reticle.  The glass is perfect.  I only used a Leupold lens pen to clean the glass once.  I babied the rifle and scope.  Scope comes with Butler Creek scope caps.  I don’t see any ring marks or scratches or dings or chips.  Again, glass is perfect.  Function is perfect.  

I'm selling it because I had to sell my extra-long distance rifle.  Living expenses caught up to me and I needed to take care of some past debts.  The rifle just sits in the safe, so I have to sell it.  

I am happy to provide you with information so you can confirm who I am and how to contact me prior to you sending me any money.  I will hold the purchase funds until you receive the scope and inspect it.  I can also give you my iTrader rating on other gun selling websites.  

From the Nightforce website:  

The Nightforce NXS 12-42x56 is the highest magnification Nightforce scope manufactured before the introduction of the Competition model. Rifle scope reviews often comment that this model provides resolution comparable to quality spotting scopes with exceptional clarity across the entire magnification range. In the past, accomplished long range shooters could only wish for a scope equal to the capability of modern long range calibers. Now the question becomes, does your rifle measure up to the NXS 12-42x56. 

Quite simply, to achieve the absolute maximum accuracy from your rifle, your scope must be as close as possible to perfect. Less precise rifle scopes can and will fail to match the potential of a well made firearm. With Nightforce, whatever your rifle is capable of, your scope will more than measure up.

From the Nightforce website re WARRANTY:  

We are proud to back up Nightforce ATACR™, B.E.A.S.T.™, Benchrest, Competition™, NXS™ and SHV™ riflescopes with a transferable Limited Lifetime Warranty which covers mechanical defects in materials and workmanship in the optical and mechanical components of the riflescope. In the event of a defect in materials or workman ship that is covered by this warranty, we will either repair the riflescope or replace it at no charge, with a comparable product at our discretion.

Exclusions to this warranty include intentional or accidental damage, abuse, misuse,   unauthorized modifications or repairs, and improper mounting. This warranty does not cover any consequential or incidental damages resulting from the inability to use the riflescope. Any serial number obliteration or alteration on the product will void the warranty. SHV™ models maintain waterproof integrity with their protective caps installed.

The original handguard, however, has been replaced with a B5 systems keymod forearm. This part from B5 not only lowers the weight significantly, but also gives the forward hand a better grip and easier balance while shooting. Keymod also enables a whole new way to directly connect accessories without having to add rails everywhere (though that, too, is still an option).

Up for sale is my perfect condition, full size, HK45. I've put about 400 down the barrel, and it was always with Federal or Winchester ammo ONLY. Gun has a decocker lever built into the safety lever. If the firing pin is engaged and you don't want to pull the trigger to release it, you can press down on the safety lever and it will disengage the firing pin. No need to do it the old school way of pulling the trigger. 

Comes with original hard case, gun lock, manual, 2 magazines, 40 rounds of Federal HST 165 grain ammo, 40 rounds of Winchester PDC Defender 230 grain ammo, and 100 rounds of Winchester 230 grain FMJ ammo.

Gun is virtually flawless and shoots super accurate. The sights are not night sights, but if they are in sunlight or under indoor lighting for a few minutes, they will glow in the dark for at least the same amount of time they were exposed to the light.

Asking $1,000 cash. You can call or text anytime. REDACTED

Thanks for reading.

The rifle runs flawlessly and cycles extremely smoothly.  I just have too many rifles and need the cash for other builds.

The receivers, handguard and buffer tube have been Cerakoted by Atomic Tactical in Atomic Tungsten.  The color is very close to that on the BCM Jack Carbine.

The only real flaw in the finish is a small ding right by the front pivot pin on the left side (circled in red in one of the photos).

Krugerrands are the most popular gold bullion coin in the world and offer a great value way to invest in gold. Krugerrands are 22 carat gold, but weigh more than a troy ounce and therefore contain exactly 1 troy ounce of fine (24 carat) gold.

As a cartridge it is almost identical to the Creedmore matches used .44-77 Sharps round. It is NOT an export/re-imported military rifle even though it is stocked in military configuration. Remington sold these guns in this configuration and many calibers to the US civilian market. A previous owner had a globe front sight and ramp soldered on the front of the barrel and a tang sight tapped and mounted on the back. Both of these have been removed, though you can still see where the ramp was soldered. Of course the screw holes are still in the tang. There is nothing wrong with the gun.  This is an extremely accurate rolling block and could easily be used in silhouette matches if you wished to replace the sights.

Aside from the large SW1911 on the slide they are about as close as you can get to buying a factory custom without the price. Early guns were assembled by the PC team to train the line staff. They came with Briley, Wilson Combat, Les Baer, McCormick, etc. internals. S&W at that time only produced the frame and slides


One of the first few 1000 smith and Wesson 1911s assembled by the performance center. 


If your SW 1911 has a JRD (Jason Dubois) followed by a sub-1000 s/n ie. JRD0999, it should be one of the first 1000 produced with assistance from the Performance Center.


Serious buyers only. 

The gun is in great condition and the pictures were taken today. 

Price is $1400 but could be  Neagotiaded if the deal is smooth 
And without issues.

This ammo is from a fresh factory run of ammunition that did not meet spec for a military contract. The cases of the ammo may be dented or otherwise not 100% uniform in a way that does not affect performance.

The two most common 5.56 rounds are the 55gr M193 and the 62gr “green tip” M855, both of which are used by the US military. The US made M855 is painted with a green tip to distinguish it from M193, so that troops do not shoot M855 in their 1 turn every 12 inch twist barreled M16's that would fail to properly stabilize the heavier and much longer bullet (length being a primary factor in bullet stabilization). The NATO SS109 62gr steel core “penetrator” bullet is used in the M855 round. The steel penetrator makes it more effective at penetrating hard targets and such.

5.56 ammunition is only to be used in rifles labeled 5.56mm, and must NOT be used in those rifles labeled .223.

The SBX features a more slim design with a thicker strap for extra stability. This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol. Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user. Features Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter. ATF compliant* Veteran designed Made in USA Quick and easy to install * ATF has reviewed this product and determined that attaching the SB15 to a firearm does not alter the classification of the firearm or subject the firearm to NFA control.
