It has approximately 1000 rounds through it, all by me. This was my carry gun, so there is a little bit of holster wear on the slide. It comes with ten Tanfoglio-made 12 round magazines, 3 of which will be full of 180 grain defense ammo (1 is Winchester PDX-1, the other two are Fiocchi XTPHP). 6 of the magazines are brand new in packaging.

If the buyer/trader is interested (and provided I'm not trading for another .40), I could include a 3 piece set of Lee reloading dies, some brass, primers and ~750 180 grain cast FP projectiles for added cost/trade value. Not looking to get rid of reloading supplies on their own, and all magazines must go with pistol if you take it. 

As per norm, buyer must be willing to sign a bill of sale, and have valid WI driver's license. CWP holder or other proof of background check is STRONGLY preferred. Note that I will not sell you a pistol if you come off as someone who shouldn't own one. 

Would want $425 cash for the pistol, mags and JHP ammo if I were to sell. Shoot me an email and we can go from there."

When I found this Cougar I was looking for a handgun for general purpose shooting.. I purchased this and man, it's a great firearm! I absolutely love it! Accurate, solid, feeds well, feeds every time, etc. No issues at all.. so I bought the Blackhawk Serpa CQC holster for it - now wanting to carry concealed (we just moved to TX will be getting our CPL's here) but, it's simply too big to carry concealed :(   [I can carry the Cougar 'concealed' comfortably, but the size just gives it away]

This is a PERFECT handgun for home defense, a vehicle handgun, target shooting, etc. and I hate to give it up..

I'd also prefer a handgun that my wife can carry too - Ruger LC9, Walther PPS, etc.

The Walther PPX M1 Center-fire Pistol is made of rugged polymer with the famous Walther ergonomic grip which is hammer fired DOA (double action only), not striker fired like the PPQ. The low-profile, three-dot combat sights aid in rapid aiming and target acquisition, and rear sight drift is adjustable for windage. Tenifer™-coated slide and barrel have a matte finish and are resist corrosion. Ambidextrous slide stop locks back on empty and is extended for easy gloved operation. Two drop safeties and a firing pin block make for a safer carry. Magazine release is conveniently located and reversible for left-or right-hand use. Yet again Walther Performance Design comes to the defense of your pocket-book.

Its a great, lightweight carry gun (I carry it daily in my pocket) but I prefer to carry a semi auto.
If you aren't familiar with these guns they are Taurus's take on the ruger lcr and s&w bodyguard .38.  Not quite as pretty as them maybe but this one is solid and soaks up recoil well, shoots .38+p comfortably all day.

Id be interested in trading for a compact or subcompact 40 caliber handgun.  This is the ONLY trade im interested in, so please don't offer me other calibers,though i may still look at something in .45.  
 I also don't need to sell it, Im just looking to see what else is out there, so don't ask me for a sale price.  I have a fair amount of .38/.357 magnum ammo to add for .40 ammo or to even out a trade.

Controls are located in the same familiar spots as on the Colt rifle, but this weapon is blow-back operated and constructed with a polymer frame. The carbon steel barrel measures 6-inches in length and is threaded for the A1 style flash hider. The handguard features the popular picatinny rails that allow for all kinds of accessory options. The sights are fully adjustable and can be removed for scope mounting if desired. A Hogue finger-groove rubber pistol grip has been installed and the factory original is included as well. While previously owned, this weapon is in excellent overall condition with just a few minor handling marks. I'd grade the gun at about 95% overall. The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order and the bore is excellent. It comes in the original box with three 25-round magazines, owner's manual, and safety lock. The M&P15-22P has been discontinued and are getting hard to find already. This should be a fun little rig that'll raise a few eyebrows at the range."

What Sig Sauer has to say about it: ""Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

The feed ramp and ejection port work had been done at the factory so I was just making sure all worked as claimed. I took the 40 rounds I bought and started filling up the mag's, I mixed fed them into the two mags and proceeded to test her out, no hickups, or stovepipes, and the factory mag locked the slide when empty and dropped out like butter, she function perfectly as claimed, a very nice pistol. I carried her for about a month in a Galco fitted SOB leather holster, then put her in the bottom of my gun safe, where she has sit since the Clinton Administration.

She came with Hogue wraparound finger grips, and they rock. REDACTED John"

All synthetic Remington 870 Pump shotgun with 4+1 capacity and having a 26"" Vented Rib Field Barrel.

Comes with Cylinder Choke, Imp. Cylinder Choke, and Full Choke. Along with the removable restriction rod that limits the magazine tube to 2 shells.

I have put under 120 rounds through this gun, and works fantastically as long as its kept clean (Remington's Rem-oil wasn't actually doing much good and seemed to mess with the ejector action a bit.  switched to CLP for anyone that plans to pick this up, found it works great)

Comes with original box and Styrofoam (I am first Owner and it is about 7 months old).

For those of you unsure, this is THE pump shotgun to own, with the most accessories and most sold, it is the tried and true pump shotgun that all others are trying to copy.  Don't settle for anything less!

*Warning* this shotgun will NOT take 3"" Super Magnum shells, please note this before purchasing and attempting!"

It adds center balance weight, and helps reduce lift, Hogue Extreme hex screws, Hogue finger grooved rubber grips, and Meprolight Tritium Night Sights. They are larger than the factory sights, and are awesome in daylight or low light situations. Comes with the CZ case and owner's manual, two sixteen round clips, and a Pro Tech Italian leather holster. I have put around 500 high quality rounds through it with no issues. This is best feeling, and best shooting pistol I have ever owned. Dead accurate and 100% reliable. CIA agents carry these. The CZ75B is the most widely carried sidearm by military and law enforcement in the world. It has been called the world's perfect pistol. Do some research.  These are getting very difficult to find. CZ has stopped exporting from the Czech Republic to the U.S. to meet government and military contracts. All factory parts go with the gun.

 I will not separate the light from the gun, I don't have any other pistols with rails so it's useless to me. The price is more than fair for the whole package deal.It's all or nothing. Willing to consider trades for a NICE hunting rifle but I can't throw in any cash so don't bother offering your super custom H&H magnum, I can't afford it.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it.  It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely.  I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it.  It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day.  I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

The 10 gauge will come with about 50 bucks worth of steel shot and a 12 gauge adapter which makes it a fun gun to pull out at the trap range from time to time. It also has a brand new trigger and hammer that I ordered for it. I was going to work the trigger but never got to it.

997,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1926997,For Sale:  2005 Gibson Les Paul 1960 Gold Top tribute,"Marion area, Columbus, Ohio","$ 1,300","Listed On: Friday, July 26, 2013",Miscellaneous,Springfield                                                                                ,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a tribute to the 1960's era Les Paul's. it has burstbucker pickups and a thin fast neck. The lead tone is crispy and hot, while the rhythm tone is a warmer sound more reminiscent of the humbucker. The trapizoid inlays have a slightly aged appearance giving it a great vintage feel. This is a great sounding guitar for a wife range of music. I have aged it in church band for about a year and lived it. I'm ready for a Springfield EMP, so if I could trade this guitar for an EMP in .40 plus $400 cash that would be perfect. I have seen this guitar go for $1,300 to $1,500 on eBay. A used EMP sells for around $800-$900, so the math works. I would consider other 1911's, just let me know what you have. Not really interested in Rock Island Armory or Taurus.
Thanks"
