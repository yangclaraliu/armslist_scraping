It is without a doubt, the best piston system money can buy and I have owned all the best piston rifles on the market (LWRC, POF, PWS, etc..) This is POF’s Premiere rifle at the current moment. i bought this rig to varmint hunt with.. My needs have changed and I am going completely away from the AR platform. I intend to focus entirely on the long range bolt gun platform now… Im selling to fund a build so there are very few things I’m interested in as far as trade goes…. Below is a break down of everything included in the package and what I paid for it. I have all the paperwork, boxes, manuals, warranty cards for everything. gun has been fired less than 60 times. I had zero problem hitting a 12” steel swinger at 600 yds. The barrel is 1/8 twist so it will stabilize all ammo from 55-77gr. This rifle coupled with the Leupold glass is a great setup. The scope has the Kenton Industries turrets with yardage marks on the elevation turret. Rifle is dialed at 100yds. Just range target, roll turret to specified yardage and fire! its dead on out to 600yds. Minus wind of course :) Please Please Please do your research before making an offer..Im not hurting for money and I don’t HAVE to sell it. Lowball offers will be ignored!!! This is NOT an Academy, Wal-Mart AR….. Thanks for looking!

For sale/ trade is an AK-74 built by Ohio Rapid Fire on a Century sourced receiver. I am the original owner and still have the receipt. Receiver was stamped and bent at Century but was built in its entirety at ORF on an unissued Bulgarian kit. Sights are not canted and these kits were not affected by the key-holing issues that plagued the cheaper polish Tantals.

Rifle is Bulgarian and comes with all the accessories you would expect including bayonet, sling, magazine, 4 stripper clips, guide, and cleaning kit. Furniture is in excellent shape with very minor finish wear from the sling’s metal connectors contacting the laminate. Receiver finish is excellent. Rifle has approximately 300 rounds through it.

Bulgarian and US pistol grip (for 922r compliance)

4 East German made bakelite magazines with pouch. These are becoming hard to find and are easily worth $140-160 depending on current availability. Check gunbroker if you don’t believe me.

I broke it down and cleaned the entire gun. I have not shot it personally but it seems to function flawlessly. It is in very good condition inside and out and comes with 3 mags, approx 20 rounds of self defense ammo, carrying case and standard ear buds.

It is a very recent production per the test fire envelope, and comes with the original back strap & grips, as well as everything it came with new. I will only consider trades for HK pistols in similar condition. LEM is preferred. I have a little over 1300 bucks into this fine pistol, and if wanted to buy will be $1250 cash. This gun is flawless & shoots as beautiful as it looks. It's just been sitting in my safe and I feel that it would be better for someone that will actually use it and enjoy it, rather than be a safe queen. I may be open to a partial trade of a glock, but must be bnib or LNIB in 9mm or .45, but you will have to add cash. I will not accept any offers from people that  overprice their glock. I am mostly interested in the following Hks : USP , p30 lem, p30L lem, HK45,  or try me with another hk. The worst I can reply would be a very polite no thank you. I will run this ad for 2 weeks, and if it doesn't move then I'll gladly keep it, as I really don't need to sell or trade it, but would like something that's more my preference."

Perfect for target shooting or handgun hunting. 

The scope on the .357 is a Thompson Center Arms 3x power pistol scope, you don't want to hold that baby too close to your face.
The scope on the .22LR is a Browning 4x12 Variable power rifle scope since eye-relief isn't an issue.  
Both are zeroed in and off a bench, are absolute tack drivers!
(Free-hand, I can't do crap!)  Unfortunately, that's the rule in Silhouette.  Standing, free hand....lol
The hammer has a lever you move to one side for all center fire applications, and the other side is for Rimfire.  There might be a center position for ""Safety"", but come on, it's a single shot.  Just don't load it or cock it until you're ready to shoot!
Closest comparable set I found on Gunbroker was $749.99.

This Weatherby-made gun is in excellent condition. Chambered in 300 Weatherby Magnum, it's ready to hit hard. The 300 Weatherby Magnum had the flattest trajectory, longest range and the greatest killing power of any 300 magnum on the market until the 30-378 Weatherby Magnum came along. Based on the 300 H&H Magnum, the 300 Weatherby delivers 300 more fps than its British cousin. Introduced in 1944, this is the all-around cartridge for the big game hunter.

You can take your shooting experience to a dominant level with faster target reacquisition, increased accuracy and improved shooter confidence with the Axiom Thumbhole Rifle Stock. It gives law enforcement personnel, hunters and shooting enthusiasts alike the ability to reduce felt recoil. At a retail price of $265, this isn't some cheap gimmick. It has Fiberglass-reinforced polymer and alloy construction with aluminum pillars, Dual recoil-compensation systems reduce harsh recoil, Comfortable 13.75” length-of-pull, Convenient rear storage compartment and has Knoxx's Patented Recoil Reducing Technology.

This one has been fired approximately 80 times. It comes with a good starter scope that is a 6-24x40 with a mil-dot reticle. The scope initially walked, which left lines on the scope body. I lapped the rings and reinstalled the scope and it hasn't moved since.

Attached and included is a folding bipod and LimbSaver deresonator.

This Texas Commemorative Derringer preserves the heroism and romance that make up the history of the Lone Star State.

This pistol is a stainless steel over/under American Derringer. Each barrel is chambered in .45lc (45 Long Colt) and will accept a .410 shell. Being a double-barrel, load one in the top and the other in the bottom and be prepared for anything. It is rifled and has the long 6"" barrel, so accuracy isn't terrible, so I wouldn't enter a marksmanship competition with it. But for taking care of snakes or those who are trying to harm you, it's well at home. 

This one has aftermarket larger grips, which means that the recoil isn't all absorbed by the knuckle of your middle finger like with the factory grips. These wood grips are nice and smooth and comfy. 

Also included is a holster and ammo holder that were not designed for the derringer, but make for a nice way to transport the pistol and a selection of ammunition. Included are a few .45lc rounds, some .410 shotshells, and even some .410 PDX rounds. 

American Derringer is well known for making quality guns. This one is no exception. It is fully stainless with a polished finish. This one, like all American Derringers has a hammer-block safety, so you can carry it with a round in each cylinder. Each time you cock it, the mechanism switches between barrels so there is no need to manually flip a lever to take a second shot, unlike some lesser derringers.

Reason I'm Selling:
Kind of a complicated issue; bear with me.  There is a small mechanism in the magnification knob that clicks when you reach 10x(very helpful for changing power without taking your eyes off target).  A few weeks ago, I realized that the mechanism's spring was poking from the knob.  I sent it in to the manufacturer to get fixed.  They basically cleaned it up, did some basic maintenance, but sent it back without addressing the protruding spring.  I called them to find out what happened, they apologized for the mistake and sent me a brand new scope and told me to keep the old one.  So now I've got an extra scope without a rifle to put it on.  I could get it repaired myself, but I'd rather just have the cash. 

Bottom Line: 
If you're looking for a high quality precision rifle scope at a discount, consider this one.  It all works fine besides the little wire sticking out of the magnification knob.  No issues with adjusting or holding a zero.  If you want to get it fixed, it's a pretty easy and inexpensive thing to do. Alll the info is here:

Someone once said to beware of the man with a single shot rifle as he is likely to know how to shoot it.

This New In Box Uberti copy of the famous Winchester High Wall is outstanding in every detail. It's a handsome, no-nonsense rifle with beautiful casehardened colors on the receiver and lever, perfect bluing of the barrel, perfect wood, Winchester style rifle sights, and a wonderfully sweet trigger pull. And the .45-70 chambering will allow you to hunt anything in North America, and most everything in Africa, too.

These Ubertis are known for their fine long range accuracy with either factory ammo or good handloads. This short-rifle style corresponds to the Sharps Business Rifle having a 28-inch round tapered barrel which makes it shorter, lighter, and handier than the standard High Wall rifles. It also carries a cleaning kit hidden behind the trapdoor in its shotgun buttplate.

This configuration in .45-70 is extremely hard to find. This rifle is unfired, brand New In the Box and ready for the upcoming Spring shooting season.

This rifle is private property and the sale will be a private transaction.

DESCRIPTION
The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.
Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

Trigger has been modified to reduce effort at high air pressures.

It's loaded in bright, shiny, annealed brass cases with a 182 grain lead core bullet making it acceptable at most all shooting ranges. Bullet is completely non-magnetic. Primers are sealed with a red lacquer so this ammo will last for a very long time. The cartridges I inspected from an open box that is not included in this listing had a 1976 headstamp date. 

This ammo is regarded as some of the best quality, and most accurate surplus available anywhere today. It also delivers much more energy to its target because of the heavy 182 grain bullet.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I will be pretty picky and will not be interested unless the value is there.  If offering a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Below are items I will consider.

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP(HK, Beretta, XDM 5.25, maybe the 4.5"", depending) maybe .357 Sig or 10mm, but may consider others, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.    

Less interested in, but may consider bolt-actions, lever guns(.357 & .44) and shotguns(prefer Mossberg 590 models & 930 SPX), depending on the deal and values etc.

This is a step above that with a better barrel, dust cover and bolt carrier group. It was $1060 brand new. I'm also going to throw in 800 rounds of ammo for free, which is worth an additional $300.
