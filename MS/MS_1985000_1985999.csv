 Details
 The 10 and 2 Industries Full Auto Bolt Carrier Assembly includes a complete 5.56mm bolt, firing pin, carrier and gas key. The group comes fully assembled with properly torqued and staked gas key. Made by a mil-spec contractor, these feature a Carpenter 158 steel bolt. This Bolt Carrier Group is complete and ready to drop into your new AR15 build.

 This drop-in bolt and carrier group has a hard Nickel Boron, self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon that lead to cycling failures. Nickel Boron coatings produce exceptionally hard surfaces (68 Rockwell C). That’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. The surface is harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. 

 Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. As a bonus, the reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too - fouling wipes right off.

Don't let it go, you will never loose money on this gun, the model C is very hard to come by, great investment!!

The action is fully bedded and barrel free-floated, for superb sub MOA accuracy. Included is a mounted crystal clear and sighted in 3X9 Leupold scope, and (2), 4 round flush fitting magazines.
I really like this gun, it’s lightweight (like 6.4 LBs), shoots like a dream, and crazy accurate. I originally bought it because I A. I wanted a highly accurate bolt action rifle B. I wanted to go hunting. I have since found out A. I’m a terrible rifleman, and can’t shoot it well at all (my friend sighted in for me, and easily achieved sub MOA groupings), and B. I hate hunting, and thus no longer have use for it.
A total of 16 rounds have been shot though it during the break-in/sight-in period. After that it was stored in my climate controlled safe, and never shot again.

If you’re looking for the finest BCG on the market today, search no more! Coated in Nickel Boron by FailZero using their EXO Technology. And yes, it’s High Pressure Tested and Magnetic Particle Inspected (HPT/MPI) Nickel Boron has proven itself to be the most durable finish on the market. It’s much smoother than Hard Chrome, it’s easier to clean, makes the rifle cycle smoother, it can be run almost lube free for thousands of rounds, and it will never chip, peal, or flake off! Because of these benefits, Nickel Boron is being adopted by the Military as well as many Government agencies. As you can see, these BCGs are a huge improvement over a standard Phosphate BCG and it’s even an improvement over Hard Chrome.

One is a Russian 91/30. I've  ""sporterized"" it, and put on a long eye relief scope in place of the rear sight leaf. It holds zero and is properly and solidly installed on the dovetail mount. I have the original rear sight leaf and pins, if the new owner wishes to return it to stock. This rifle is accurate for a Mosin. With surplus ammo, I can get 2 inch 5 round groups consistently. The bore is shiny with sharp grooves and lands. It's matching numbers.Comes with bayonet and sling. 

Next is my Chinese type 53. This is the Chinese version of the m44. It has the side folding bayonet. I had to reluctantly put a new aftermarket stoock on this, because the receiver and barrel moved around in the original stock. The bore is a little frosty, but is still in good shape, and is a good shooter. I haven't shot it past 25 yards, but it hits point of aim.

I have put about 60rds through it before I ordered the stock and have not put a single round through it with the new stock or bottom metal. I decided before even getting the stock to sell it to pay some debt off and eventually get a Scar 17 instead.

I've got about $1900 into it with all the mods plus the cost of the rifle. The rifle weighs 7 lbs 2oz without a magazine inserted. The qd mount is pretty hefty and I bet without it would be under 7lbs. The mount also adds a couple inches in length.
Here are the list of mods with associated costs:
Manners MCS T4 Stock w/ 90% carbon fiber shell, KRG Tikka Lug installed, Flush cups on front left and rear left side for QD sling swivels, front and rear sling swivels on the bottom, painted desert brown:$700
CDI bottom metal: $209 (no AICS mags included)
Hinterland Oversize bolt handle: $95
Annodized aluminum bolt shroud: $50
EGW 0moa rail $60
YHM QD Phantom flash hider $78
Adco cut barrel to 16"" and thread $140
Adco Parkerizing: $50

The bipod was only used for pics it is NOT INCLUDED and will not be sold. Also it comes with no mags as I only have a couple of AICS mags for my other .308. I have not shot it with the stock or cdi metal so both those items are basically new. I misplaced the action scews but more will be here by Monday 8/12/13.

This also comes with the original box, manual, and original bolt handle. I expect to take quite a loss but my price isn't going to drop much or soon as I am in no hurry and would rather keep it than give it away. Please no trades,

PRICE IS $1300 ftf. I am in the Kingston/Durant area and will be in OKC Sep 7. I can take $50 off if the qd flash hider is not wanted as I can use it later if I ever get the Scar for my suppressor.

The lack of a letter at the start of the SN indicates it was not one of the later Browning's made by Remington, thus is significantly more rare.  I inherited this one and it appears to be all original.  The stock does have a few dings and there is a hairline crack in the foregrip which would not affect function. Everything seems to be working just fine.

Here's some background on these:
When John Browning sold his ( right to manufacture ) Autoloading Shotgun to Fabrique Nationale in March of 1902, he reserved the right to sell in the United States. FN could only sell outside of the US. In order to show his trust in the new gun, John Browning made an agreement to purchase 10,000 guns. These guns were to be marked ""BROWNING AUTOMATIC ARMS Co"", and he would distribute through the Browning Bros. Company in Ogden Utah. Not all 10,000 guns were actually delivered due to contract disputes later on with Remington (another story)In 1903, after John Browning returned from Belgium, he sold the manufacturing rights to Remington for sales in the US only. Remington started manufacturing in 1905, it was an instant success in the US. One of the agreements with Remington was to start the serial numbers of these guns at 10,000. He didn't want FN guns with the same serial numbers as the Remingtons. (Remington historians are still trying to figure out why they started at 10K)Production continued at Remington until 1910 when the change was made in the model number and the gun became the Remington Model 11.

Note:  From 1940-46 Remington produced the A5.  These have the letter A (16ga), B(12ga) or C (20ga) in front of the SN (which the one being offered does not).

I have put about 60rds through it before I ordered the stock and have not put a single round through it with the new stock or bottom metal. I decided before even getting the stock to sell it to pay some debt off and eventually get a Scar 17 instead.

I've got about $1900 into it with all the mods plus the cost of the rifle. The rifle weighs 7 lbs 2oz without a magazine inserted. The qd mount is pretty hefty and I bet without it would be under 7lbs. The mount also adds a couple inches in length.
Here are the list of mods with associated costs:
Manners MCS T4 Stock w/ 90% carbon fiber shell, KRG Tikka Lug installed, Flush cups on front left and rear left side for QD sling swivels, front and rear sling swivels on the bottom, painted desert brown:$700
CDI bottom metal: $209 (no AICS mags included)
Hinterland Oversize bolt handle: $95
Annodized aluminum bolt shroud: $50
EGW 0moa rail $60
YHM QD Phantom flash hider $78
Adco cut barrel to 16"" and thread $140
Adco Parkerizing: $50

The bipod was only used for pics it is NOT INCLUDED and will not be sold. Also it comes with no mags as I only have a couple of AICS mags for my other .308. I have not shot it with the stock or cdi metal so both those items are basically new.

This also comes with the original box, manual, and original bolt handle. I expect to take quite a loss but my price isn't going to drop much or soon as I am in no hurry and would rather keep it than give it away. Please no trades,

PRICE IS $1300 ftf. I am in the Kingston/Durant area and will be in OKC Sep 7. I can take $50 off if the qd flash hider is not wanted as I can use it later if I ever get the Scar for my suppressor.

One 15rd is full of some killer Underwood 135gr jacketed hollow points. Awesome full power 10mm ammo. (If your new to 10mm I highly recommend looking into Underwood Ammo.) For the two 10rd mags I will include a 20rd box of some CorBon PowR'Ball ammo & I can include a 50rd box or two of some ammo to run thru the other 15rd mag. This is an older Glock (gen2) but it is still in great shape. Other than the lack of an accessory rail I can't see any reason why someone would have any issues with it. It's really a fun gun. I plan on replacing it in the future but right now I need some money to take advantage of a crazy good deal on another firearm that is too good to pass up. I'm asking $500 & am not really interested in any trades because as I said, I'm raising money for another purchace. But if you really want to throw a trade offer my way feel free. The worst I can do is say no. But just to avoid wasting yours & my time I will tell you  now that I would really only be interested in a good deal on a.357mag revolver w/4""-6"" barrel, 1911, AR-15 or maybe an MAC 10/11 or AK.

I bought this firearm from him several months as my first 1911 thinking I would like the bobtail commander style more than I do. 

This entire gun is Ed Brown parts with the only exception being the frame. The frame is a Springfield. The fitting on the firearm is excellent. There is, of course, the necessary minimal amount of play in the slide and frame, but this is custom fitted to the frame. 

Gun shoots dead accurate, has a phenominal trigger as well. 

Comes with 2 Wilson mags. 

Will consider trades for Les Baer, Ed Brown, or Dan Wesson 1911's. Not really big on the commander style, unless its a V-Bob/C-Bob from Dan Wesson, I may consider that.

Asking $1400 OBO
I will listen to all reasonable offers.
Willing to ship on buyers dime.

Only shot 200 rounds thru it. Selling it to buy another noveske upper with a switchblock for use with a suppressor. If you know your stuff then you know Noveske is a top tier manufacturer. Their barrels are among the most accurate in the business. This features a 14.5 inch Noveske stainless steel barrel with a pinned and welded Battlecomp 1.5 which makes it the legal non NFA 16 inches. The battlecomp is an outstanding comp to which most people hold the standard to. The barrel has a mid length gas system 1/7 twist 5.56 NATO. It has a pinned low profile Noveske gas block. The rail is the Noveske 13.5 NSR (key mod) which is the lightest and slimmest rail on the market to my knowledge. The upper receiver is Noveske marked and is the rigid VLTOR MUR upper with forward assist. The charging handle is a Noveske marked BCM gunfighter mod4 (med latch). Bolt carrier group is Noveske as well. This upper is factory built by Noveske and is extremely accurate. Great for any application. I will include the Noveske hand stop panel kits and NSR keymod QD swivel attachment as seen in the photos. What is NOT included is the iron sights, flashlight, or Aimpoint. The lower and parts are obviously not for sale either. Just the complete upper with handstop kit and QD attachment. This is a $1300 complete upper. The two polymer hand panel sets were $24 and the keymod QD swivel mount was $18. Asking $1150. Condition is excellent and like-new."

It comes with the rings you see it mounted it. It has one scratch on the windage cap. Springfield Armory no longer offers these for sale since they stopped selling the M6 Scout rifle several years ago. Its a great extended eye relief scope and would complete your M6 Scout if you own one, this scope also works great on other rifles that require extended eye relief. There is nothing wrong with the glass or the scope at all. Just the scratch you see in the photo on the windage adjustment cap. 

I would like to say if you have been looking for one of these specific scopes then you know how hard they are to find. I do also, I am open to reasonable offers. Also Springfield Armory still stands behind these with their famous lifetime warranty and will replace or exchange it even though they no longer market a line of optics."

This was a gift from my grandfather and although I'd love to keep it I don't have a real use for it. I recently had the gun re-blued and thoroughly checked. It looks as good as the day it was made. The serial number puts it in the 1920 year of manufacture. The slide is smooth and the gun is solid. Has original grips and clip from my understanding. Shipping is $20 from my FFL to yours. Contact me if you need any further information."

Its a Husqvarna rifle imported by Smith and Wesson. I've guessed the date to be from around 1969 from the serial number. It's chambered in .308 Win. Has a beautiful high gloss mannlicher style stock with a Monte Carlo cheek piece. The rifle has never been fired. The stock has a few very small dings from moving but nothing major, the overall condition is excellent. The rifle is missing the bolt, which is why I'm trying to sell/trade it. I don't have the time to try and track down a bolt for the gun, but I do know they use a small ring Mauser action, this model uses the later 1900 style. I absolutely love this gun and hate to see it go, but I just don't have the time to invest in completing the action. Would make a fantastic project gun or would be great for a collector. These guns are very rare and hard to find, but have a prestige like none other for accuracy and feel."

I was happy with the build and the distinct sound the bull barrel made.  But I'm looking to get rid of the AR since I already have another and would like to venture into the bullpup world.  The specs are as follow:

Specs and prices I paid::

Mega Arms Billet upper and lower set ($450)
Samson evolution rail $180
Samson evolution rail extension $70
Wilson Arms 24"" .223 Wylde 1x8 bull barrel stainless steel ($300)
Spikes Tactical Nickel Boron BCG (no longer in production, $250)
Armalite Tactical 2 stage trigger and lower package kit $200
Magpul Prs stock $240
Buffer tube setup $60
CAA pistol grip $40

That puts this roughly around $1800 for the build give or take some. This build took me a few months to gather the stuff, but I did it before all the craziness happened. 
I know I'm missing out on something just can't remember it all. I took it out literally 1 time with 50 rnds through her. Between the upcoming wedding and buying a house I haven't had a spare minute to go back out. All she had was a initial break in which isn't fully done yet. I had my ACOG mounted on her, but would like to keep it. Let me know what you have to trade.  As stated I'm looking to go into bullpups, or even a HK rifle as a trade.

Unfortunately I don't know how many rounds have been through it but it doesn't look like many. I personally put 72rds through it, 44 being .44 Special and 28 being .44 Magnum. This gun is in excellent condition and the trigger is really sweet. This is the -5 model, which is the last one made before the internal lock was introduced. Just the gun and box included. Not sure if the box is the original.

I'm looking for $700 or possible trade for a 5"" 1911. Models I am NOT interested in are series 80 or anything with a firing pin block, GI models, and compacts. I'm not a 1911 expert, but the models I am interested in are Springfield, Dan Wesson, S&W without the firing pin block, maybe a Colt series 70, etc. Just let me know what you have and I'll let you know if I'm interested. I'm not looking for anything super fancy, but I am willing to put money on top depending on what it is. I'll need to see a WA DL and CPL.

I can sell you a lightly used, tan Galco DAO holster for this gun for an extra $50.

EDIT: Looking at my old bill of sale, I paid less for this gun than I remembered so I've dropped the price to $700."

Factory New





The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.



The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

Factory New





Neos means ""new"" in Greek, and Beretta's American design staff started with a clean sheet when drawing up this new line of .22 pistols. The lines are meant to appeal to a new generation of shooting enthusiasts who are respectful of the past while bringing a fresh attitude to the shooting sports. The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve.

SOPHISTICATED.
In the unmistakable design and style of Giugiaro. The valuable collaboration between Beretta’s engineers and noted Italian designer continues to fruition. The sleeker and ergonomic U22 Neos with its captivatingly designed gun case is guaranteed to appeal to Beretta enthusiasts.

MODULAR.
Constructed of five assemblies which are easily disassembled without tools, the U22 Neos is manufactured in the classic Beretta blue or inox to satisfy the tastes of all shooters. The ergonomic grips in fiberglass reinforced technopolymer with anti-slip finish can be substituted with optional colored or rubber inlay grips.

PERFORMING.
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and notably precise thanks to the 4.5” barrel featuring an integral rail that accepts Weaver style scope mounts, and a fully adjustable target rear sight.
The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack magazine made from inox steel (with a 10 round capacity) boasts a practical device which facilitates loading.  The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged either with the firing pin cocked or uncocked.

Factory New





Neos means ""new"" in Greek, and Beretta's American design staff started with a clean sheet when drawing up this new line of .22 pistols. The lines are meant to appeal to a new generation of shooting enthusiasts who are respectful of the past while bringing a fresh attitude to the shooting sports. The Neos pistols feature cutting-edge design, modular construction that allows personalization and the flexibility for many shooting disciplines. Available at popular prices, the Neos is ideal for new shooters, but it won't easily be outgrown as skills improve.

SOPHISTICATED.
In the unmistakable design and style of Giugiaro. The valuable collaboration between Beretta’s engineers and noted Italian designer continues to fruition. The sleeker and ergonomic U22 Neos with its captivatingly designed gun case is guaranteed to appeal to Beretta enthusiasts.

MODULAR.
Constructed of five assemblies which are easily disassembled without tools, the U22 Neos is manufactured in the classic Beretta blue or inox to satisfy the tastes of all shooters. The ergonomic grips in fiberglass reinforced technopolymer with anti-slip finish can be substituted with optional colored or rubber inlay grips.

PERFORMING.
Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and notably precise thanks to the 6” barrel featuring an integral rail that accepts Weaver style scope mounts, and a fully adjustable target rear sight.
The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack magazine made from inox steel (with a 10 round capacity) boasts a practical device which facilitates loading.  The ambidextrous manual safety can be engaged either with the firing pin cocked or uncocked.

This is a Model 1894 that I inherited.  I am not too familiar with Marlin and I have no idea what this is worth.  It does have some rust on it, but it is almost 120 years old.  No finish is left on the barrel, and the received has about half left.  No major pitting.

The rear sight appears to be soldered on, not sure if they came from the factory like that.  The stock also shows signs of wear.
