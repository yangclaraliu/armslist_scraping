This rifle has some light marks on the stock from me bumbling around in the woods during elk season. Rifle has roughly 120 rounds through the barrel.

Rifle comes with an unbreakable Nikon Buckmaster 4x fixed power scope on Nikon rings. Also has a rock mount 9-13"" bipod, Uncle Mikes sling mounts, Butler Creek magnum sling and a removable Beartooth recoil pad.

I purchased her new in 2009 and she is still beautiful, dangerous and accurate. She shoots 1moa with 270gr noslers. 375 h&h is a monster cartidge and will take any game in North America and most of Africa honestly. The CZ single ""set"" trigger helps a lot with recoil anticipation. Recoil is intense but not unmanageable.

I really would like to keep her, but I'm moving soon to a place where the game is small and unfit for this rifle.

He is selling a few guns to get one short action deer/coyote gun in stainless. He's wanting a 25wssm but if the deal is right he will consider it. It has a Leupold 4.5-12x40 with Leupold rings and base. It also has a custom sling that hold 7mm mag bullets perfectly. So perfectly that t won't hold 300 mag at all and anything smaller just wobbles around. It is Belgium made and is way better looking than any new BAR I've seen at the stores. The sling was like 60$ and he gave nearly 400$ for the scope. Then you've got 60$ rings and base. That makes this gun at 1000$ a very good deal in my opinion. I once owned this gun and gave him the good friend discount and he's just wanting to get the money he has in it back. So basically your getting the good friend discount. You can also text REDACTED

So Look around on here and on Gunbroker,   these sell used for $150 to $250 and up  - and this one is a nice shooter right in the middle of the road.  I might even be willing to trade for ammo, and other toys.    And if the balance goes the other way, I can throw in a few boxes of 9mm factory brass ammo to even things out (ammo is about $18 a box).   So - if you are comfortable with a  moderately reliable range gun,   shoot me an offer.   FTF, Wa ID, or CPL Meet in Kelso.   Thanks!"

Mine is a true Arsenal rifle, stamped Arsenal Inc!! These are not imported anymore with the Arsenal stamp!

Made in the popular 5.45x39.5 caliber. The brainchild of two of the best gun makers in the world, the SGL31-61 rifle is manufactured at the world-famous Izhmash Factory in Russia then imported and remanufactured by Arsenal Inc, Las Vegas, NV into its final configuration. 

The absolute reliability and authenticity make the SGL31-61 the ONLY CHOICE for collectors, perfectionists, and AK enthusiasts alike. All authentic components, made according to the original technology, and detailed attention, which went into the manufacturing, make the SGL31-61 THE rifle you will be proud to own and show off to your friends at the shooting range. The ONLY truly configured AK-74 currently available in the US market that uses brand new Hammer Forged and Chrome Line barrel, the SGL31-61 offers the safety and reliability that you expect from your rifle, making it the highest quality AK-74 available on the market. 

This is one of the finest AK systems imported into the US. Anyone that truly knows AK systems, knows that Arsenal Inc. makes some of the best AK's in the world. I purchased this AK back in December brand new. When I purchased this rifle, it came configured as a true Arsenal SGL-31 61 with the black polymer furniture on it. I have since upgraded the rifle with new furniture and converted it to a sgl-31 94. Meaning I removed the standard buttstock and put on the ACE folding stock. The Ace folding stock is the second best folding stock made, behind the true folding stock that's standard on the 94. The Ace folding is made of light weight Aluminum and features an unique push button actuation method that securely locks the stock to the side when folded. It is a rock solid stock with no ""wobble."" I chose this stock because of the robust and durability characteristics it displays. 

Now for the features and upgrades:

*Chrome lined hammer forges barrel 
*front sight block with bayonet lug
*stamped receiver and magwell dimples for no magazine wobble (its an Arsenal!!)
*Ace Folding stock with locking mechanism
*US Palm battle grip
*Tapco G2 Trigger group
*XS Night sights (still have original sights as well that will come with package)
*Kreb's custom retaining plate
*Midwest Industries Rail system
*AK74 muzzle break
*Magpul AFG (black)

I ordered 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines from KVAR.com at $50 dollars each that I will include in thie package. Two of which are brand new, never used. The remaining 6 have been used but are in great working condition. These are the best magazines ever made for this rifle. It also includes 1 factory 10 round magazine. This is great for sighting in or hunting! 

I will also include 1,000 rounds of 5.45 ammo to get you started with this rifle.

Arsenal sgl-31 61...........................$1199.00 from KVAR.com
Accys/upgrades.............................$500
Magazines.....................................$400
Ammo..........................................$200

Basically over $2200 in this package. These prices are legitimate and can all be verified online with a little research. I know where I bought everything from and know what I paid for them. 

Obviously, I can not expect to get the same amount of money that I put into it. Having said that, I will not respond to lowball offers, please be respectful and I'll, in turn, do the same. Please make a reasonable offer and we'll talk!

I will take $1400 for the entire package if you buy it before the end of August!"

The barrel and cylinders look pretty worn but the rifling is still visible.  It comes with a bag of about 100 loose rounds that appear to be ancient,   and a partial box of about 40 rounds that are probably from the 70's  It also comes with an Ideal mold and primer seating tool in .32   Before I broke it,  I put a few rounds through it,  without any issues,   it's inaccurate as hell, and has less recoil that a .22 LR.  I then took it apart and cleaned all the rust and crap out of the interior, and busted a pin retainer while re-assembling it.    If you are familiar with these, the main spring is held in place under the back strap by a single pin,  and that pin is anchored to the backstrap by two paper thin castings on the frame.   I broke one of those off and now there's no good way to anchor the mainspring in place.    SO -   If you're good with silver soldering or brazing you should be able to attach a new flange,   otherwise it's just a really cool paperweight.       These go for about $60 in parts on Ebay, but frankly I just don't want to mess with selling individual parts, so I'm making a package deal and setting a realistic price that will sell.  $50 Cash or trade for the equivalent in ammo,     make me an offer folks."

The choice of America’s best shooters. Kimber is the most popular 1911 pistol in the world and Kimber quality is unequaled by any other manufacturer. The Custom family is where it all began.

Accuracy and dependability right out of the box

The Custom II .45 ACP established the Kimber legacy by offering custom pistol performance for a production pistol price. Standard features ensure the kind of accuracy and dependability that made Kimber the most popular 1911 brand in the world, and 1911 ergonomics make it ideal for carry and defense. The Custom II has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the .45 ACP cartridge, the Custom II is ready for everything from duty carry to recreational shooting and personal defense.

It is pretty much impossible to find anyplace unless you go on gunbroker and are willing to pay about $900-$950 for one.  CZ hasn't shipped any new ones in months and no dealers have them.

This gun is a tack driver, tactical rail, double or single action shooting, tru dot night sights, less than 500 rounds fired.  Great gun for the range or home defense.  Competition grade.

It comes with the original hard plastic case plus the cardboard box around it, plus the factory issue cleaning parts, lock and 2 10 round magazines.  This model has the safety.

Copied from CZ's website:

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

Springfield Armory (xd line up, especially need some for my xds)

These are only examples, Im willing to take a look at anything that might not be mentioned in the examples. Most pawn or gun stores will give you dirt or not even anything at all for your holsters, yet I will most likely be interested so shoot me a email with what you got and I will make you a offer. I like buying stuff in lots, so if you got a shoe box full of old holsters nobody wants I will see what I can do. Thank you and hope to hear from you soon!"

BUT with this reliable .22 rifle ammo is dirt cheal you can shoot up to (I'm not sure how far but I shot 100 yards with a scope accurately) very fun to practice adjusting windage and elevation and sniper skills whiteout having to pay 50 cents a shot.  also fooling around with the sights at closer ranges could be twice as fun 30 yards and less has two options on rear sight, it can be folded down  in order to see the surrounding of the target more easily (moving target).  Or lifted up for more presice target action Lifting or lowering rear sight does not affect range or sights what so ever so you don't have to adjust them, it comes like this stock from the factory.  must see to appreciate

DS Arms is a fantastic gun maker, most famous for their superbly built FAL rifles, and are gaining a stellar reputation for their line of AR-15's. 
Their AR's have some great factory features such as m4 feed ramps, dust cover, forward assist and a super comfortable hogue grip.

I purchased this gun 2 months ago, have not fired it, but have added a Colt removable carry handle rear sight and a Delta aluminum quad rail. 
It also comes with 7 magazines: 2 window Magpul P-mags, 3 GI mags, 1 5 round Promag hunting mag, and the factory DSA mag. All hold 30 rounds except for the promag. Combined, they have fired about 300 rounds, except for the DSA, which, like the rifle, is unfired. It also includes a hard case. 

Value:
Rifle with factory case and mag: $788
Upgraded handguard: $50
Colt Rear sight: $50
6 Extra Mags: $100
Total: $988

Yours for only: $800
This is less than the list price plus taxes and fees, without any extras. 
I also have 1050 rounds for sale in my other listing. Purchase both and get a super deal.

This gun is a beast, I can load up a 75rd drum and it will fire every round without a hiccup, I have never had an ejection failure, EVER. It also has a 1.6mm thick receiver where other non-milled AK's have 0.5mm. The barrels are also thicker and based off of a milled AK47 platform. These are considered some of the most rugged and durable AK's ever produced. The only thing negative I can say about this gun is the finish looks kind of bad as you can see in the picture. I was going to Cerakote the whole gun for $50 but would rather discount it and sell as is. I just bought a SAM7R milled Bulgarian and don’t need 2 AK’s so sadly this one has to go.

It has 5 brightness settings for both colors. It was only mounted and fired on a bushmaster Ar15 and it always held zero. The rifle was used as a truck gun and placed on a window mount so the scope doesn't have any dents and dings, not even a scratch from what I can see, but the nuts that hold it to the rail have slight rusting which is to be expected for a vehicle gun sight. Nothing else is rusted, not the sight itself or the bolts that hold the nuts. A simple nut exchange would make the sight look perfect and could easily be resold for more if you wanted.

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 SAS is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with rosewood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® Night Sights. The SIG SAUER P238 SAS is has a lockable hard case, one kydex holster and one 6 round magazine. The SIG Sauer P238 is a compact .380 ACP caliber, single-action pistol. It is a version of the Colt Mustang pistol with a classic SIG Sauer scalloped slide and finger relief under the trigger guard. Grip panels are fluted polymer making this an all-metal frame firearm in competition with plastic-framed pistols in the same class like the Ruger LCP, S&W Bodyguard and the Kel-Tec P-3.
