493,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4305493,For Sale:  Swedish Model 1881 Jarmann Rifle,"OH, Lima, Ohio","$ 1,400","Listed On: Monday, May 4, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"exceptional condition and quite rare, Swedish Jarmann Model 1881 bolt action repeater chambered in 10.15x61R. Barrel is 32"" barrel with an excellent bright strong bore. This 1883 dated trials rifle is in excellent overall condition with the finish retaining about 97% original blue that has light handling wear and is lightly flaking to brown with a few areas that have specks of very fine surface oxidation present. The steel buttplate shows the most wear with light oxidation and abrasions, most likely from spending a good portion of its life on a rack. The bolt assembly is in the white and has a light gray patina slowly spreading over its surface and mixing with a few lights spots of surface oxidation. The receiver and barrel markings are all crisp and all numbers are matching. The left side of the receiver and barrel are both marked ""(crown)/C / J.P 1883 J.G."" The wood has some light added finish but otherwise rates excellent having only a few light dings. The area under the action has a blank brass diamond held on with two screws, which most likely would have served as an ID plate had the rifle been adopted and issued. The rifle's features include an eight shot tubular magazine and magazine disconnect on the left side of the receiver. The forward sling swivel and cleaning rod are missing but the rifle otherwise is complete. Only about 1500 of these were manufactured, and were never adopted for service. The first 500 were the two-band variation, made for the Royal Life Guard, and the remaining 1000 were this three-band variation produced for the Navy. Many were destroyed by the Germans or sold as surplus and/or converted to the M28 Harpoon rifle ..

Gun has been in sage for years before I got it and I haven't shot it since I've had it for a year and a half so I'm sure it needs a good cleaning but gun is in great shape to be as old as it is. I'm not wanting to sell it but have ran into a hard time and need the extra cash to pay off a bill so someone is going to get a heck of a deal on a awesome old shotgun. I'm located in Laurens and the first person to come to me with $425 cash gets it. Not wanting to trade because if that was the case I'd just keep the 1100.

When it comes to reliability and tactical flexibility, nothing matches the FABARM FP6 Series shotguns. Security professionals agree that a pump-action shotgun is still the best choice for a defensive shotgun. FABARM FP Series shotguns are built to take the toughest abuse confronting today’s law enforcement and security users.

 FABARM pump-action shotguns use the same advanced design and manufacturing techniques found on their premium arms. Twin action bars, deep drilled TriBore™ barrels, durable sandblasted anodized finish, make the FP6 one of the strongest and most tactically adaptable pump-action security and utility shotguns available. The ability to mount accessorys with the rail mount built onto the receiver of many of the FP6 models further enhances the tactical utility of this shotgun.

 Features:
• Tribore™ chrome lined barrel with heat shield 
• free carrier for quick, smooth reloading 
• twin forged action bars for smooth reliable operation 
• 3"" chamber 
• large safety button 
• choice of blade sight or Picatinny rail

*Every firearm received is safety and function checked before any work is started.
*Supplied rings and bases (you supply) are confirmed to work for your application.
*Scope rings will be lapped to ensure full contact with scope body to safeguard against loss of zero, increase repeatability, and maximize system strength.
*Scope reticle (crosshairs) will be leveled and then adjusted to your personal requirements.
*The scope will be positioned to your personal setting for eye relief.  We’ll work with you to determine your personal requirements for each scope and rifle.
*Every scope and rifle will be boresighted.  This process allows the reticle (crosshairs) to generally align with the bore so there will be enough adjustment during the zeroing process.  The zeroing process will prove to be much quicker and easier.
*Bases, scope rings, and windage screws are thread-locked and torqued to correct ft. lbs. to ensure tightness longevity and consistency - even with heavy recoil firearms.
*The process ends by wiping down your scope and firearm with quality gun oil and protectant and placed in a protective plastic bag.
*A checklist of the finished process is provided indicating the entirety of services performed.
*Confidence - should your scope, rings, or base EVER become loose or it tumbles down a hill (it happens), simply contact us for a complimentary scope and rifle remounting (does not apply to QD AR scope mounts)."

05.04.15



SB 941 has passed the Oregon House. That was the last stop before it goes to the Governor who will sign it.



Today's debate was very long. The House Republicans gave it all they had. We are indebted to them, but, in spite of mountains of evidence that this bill will do nothing but hurt the law abiding, the House Democrats just continued to parrot the same tired lies they have been telling since the bill was introduced. Oregon will soon have one of the worst background check requirements in the country.



The carrier of the bill willfully mislead the chamber about what the bill did, but it really didn't matter. The minds were made up.



Three Democrats joined all the Republicans voting no. They were Jeff Barker, Brad Witt and Caddy McKeown. We appreciate their support.



Two Democrats we thought we could count on folded. They were Debbie Boone and Brian Clem.



We think at this point we will see more legislation related to this issue before the session is over, but that could turn out to be another false promise, or it could make things worse, but no matter what, we will keep you informed.

We want to say to each and every one of you who worked tirelessly and against the odds, that we are truly and deeply thankful. Your efforts were heroic in the face of a very deceitful majority.  We also want to say the battle does not end.  As you know, many counties and sheriffs are on record opposing this and we believe there are still opportunities to throw up roadblocks. We will be exploring all of them.

Now that the bill is passed, the clock is no longer ticking and we can take our time in planning responses.

But one thing won't wait. As you know there are recalls underway for three of the supporters of this bill. There may be more in the future.  Please do all you can to support these efforts.
