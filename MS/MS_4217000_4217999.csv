Cash Price: $850.00
Location: Spring Hill, TN

M&P Sport with tons of upgrades:
This started out a value AR for my son.  He see’s mine and talked me into multiple upgrades:
Magpul CTR Carbine Stock
Magpul Handgard w/ rails (2- 4’ & a 2’)
Magpul MOE Pistol Grip
Magpul Rail Vertical Grip
BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle
NcStar 3-9X42 USS GEN II/ P4-SNIPER w/ Micro Red Dot (I was amazed at this scope for the money)
PMAG 30 M3 Window= 2 Window, & 1 Stnd
(All Magpul upgrades are in OD Green)
Also comes with factory M&P furniture, Soft case, and 120 rds of American Eagle 556

We have at least $1000.00 invested in this baby but his interest these days are leaning towards things with two wheels and handle bars.  I provided the truck but not a bike, these proceeds will go towards his bike fund.

I will consider trades but they will definitely be in my favor and trade value is higher, especially since I will then have to contribute to a fund that I am opposed too (No AR’s or anything .40 – boot possible either way).

Must be legal to purchase gun in TN and sign a bill of sale."

I bought the gun in late 2014, and carried it perhaps a total of 10 hours, enough to break the holsters in. It is in nearly new condition, has about 250 flawless rounds of 124 grain HST and Hydra-Shok and 147 grain Winchester Ranger T's through it. Very accurate, and includes Siglite night sights. Unlike a 1911, you can clear the gun or do press checks with the safety engaged. It has an ambidextrous, ambi 1911 style safety, which does not lock the slide. Great single action trigger, which feels like it's about 5 pounds or so.

MSRP is $1,243.00, and I paid $1,100 for it. Original case and owner's manual and 2x15 round mags included, as originally sold. I also put a new set of Hogue Extreme G10 black/gray Piranha grips on it at a cost of $115, and include the original plastic grips, as well. I have $1,200+ in the gun and grips alone.

I also include the following custom holsters for it:

- Ritchie CQQR OWB black leather, IWB, broken in but otherwise as new (cost $135)
- Garrett Industries Silent Thunder GT IWB, broken in, nice condition, set at about 20 degree cant but adjustable down to straight drop (cost $85.00)
- TT Gunleather custom black leather ""Slim"" IWB, similar to but IMO better than a Milt Sparks VMII
(cost $110 with a 10 week wait, just broken in, incredible holster that should cost at least twice that)

Lastly, I have an additional, factory Sig 18 round magazine (cost $45)

I will sell the entire package for $885, which is $700 less than I have into it, and everything is essentially new.

FTF sale only in LaGrange/Brookfield/Lyons area. 72 hour wait and all other laws to apply, of course."

The upper receiver is monolithic and has a quick detach barrel feature.
The rifle is piston driven. The piston is part of the barrel, this configuration allows the barrel to be swapped out for different length and even different calibers (300blk and 6.8 Grendel). Note: not interchangeable with 7.62Nato.
As configured the rifle is stock except for the pws brake and the ALG defence quality milspec trigger. The bipod is currently not for sale.
As configured I would like to get 1750 out of it.
I could probably let it go for 1600 with the factory bird cage flash suppressor and the factory trigger.
All in all a great rifle, about 700 rounds through the tube.
It's pretty much built to last a lifetime. Don't want to let it go, but I need cash for something else.
Let me know if you have any other questions or want more pictures.

For sale is a lightly used Glock 34 Gen 4 with a Burris FastFire II installed using a Burris Glock Dovetail Mount. No drilling or tapping was performed on this slide. 

I purchased this firearm brand new at Simpson's Hardware in Sumter, SC last year. I have run maybe 350 rounds through it since then (that's a very conservative estimate as it was most likely significantly less). It has performed flawlessly and is an excellent firearm. I am moving to a different pistol for my 9mm needs and this guy needs a new home to help fund it. 

I am including the following items:

Glock 34 Gen 4
Original Hard Case
3 OEM Magazines
Original Backstraps
Original Rear Site
Burris FastFire II with Glock Dovetail Mount
Additional Burris Picatinny Mount
Original Paperwork

I live in Sumter and am willing to meet within 30 minutes of where I am for interested parties. Face-to-face cash deals only. No checks. No money orders. No PayPal. I would be more than happy to meet at a local gun shop of your choosing or a well-populated public area. I do complete a basic bill of sale for firearms for my records. SC CWP permit holders preferred, but not required. 

I'm looking for $675 OBO for the whole kit n' caboodle. This gun retails for about $600 and the optic with Glock Mount runs about $239. Please email with questions or offers. I will provide additional photos on request.

Thanks,

Along with that stuff I have a Blackhawk single mag carrier, and a brand new, never worn Alien Gear tuckable IWB holster (RH) I just received. This package is ready to be traded for or bought and carried the same day. 

The SA was one of the XDS' affected by the recall, but it has been sent in for the work. I have EXACTLY 150 rounds through this pistol, I keep a log on all my guns, and all of it was factory .45. No +p ammo was used.

There is a small mark on the left side of the slide, does not intefere with functrion at all, from where I had pocket carried it for a short time. I have learned that if you use the 5 round mag with the flat baseplate, this makes a nice pocket gun, and with summer coming up, who doesn't need a .45 caliber pocket gun?

The only reason I am looking to trade is I just prefer Glocks. Nothing wrong with this pistol at all, and the recoil on such a small pistol was suprisingly soft.

I am looking to trade this for a Glock in .45. My trade preferences, in order, are: Glock 41, Glock 21 Gen 4, Glock 21sf, Glock 30s, Glock 30sf, or Glock 30 Gen 3. I would be willing to accept one of these Glocks with only 2 factory mags, but I would prefer 3 and maybe a decent concealment holster, but it won't be a deal breaker if one is not included.

Since I have to put a price on the XDS package, I will list it for $575 OBRO for the package, and remember that's with a seperate mag holder and brand new holster.

As I'm sure you know, this is the same Colt 1911 pistol that the 'United States Marine Corps' ordered from Colt, but then decided that they did not want civilians walking around w/ a pistol w/ USMC markings. They sent Colt Firearms a 'cease & desist' letter which halted production of these guns. Colt continued producing this 1911 without the USMC roll-mark, which in turn made the pistols WITH the USMC roll mark highly collectible! This is one of the original pistols that has the USMC roll mark, as well as the desirable Pelican Case. This USMC marked pistols will most certainly continue to appreciate in value, so DO NOT hesitate or she will be gone!"

Modifications/Blemishes:
*I have made several modifications to this rifle and nothing has made the gun unsafe. I am a person of honesty and integrity and do not want someone to see the rifle in person or take home after buying and be upset about anything I tried to ""sweep under the rug"" on them. I want all the good and the bad to be seen on this rifle by the buyer before purchasing. The gun functions great and I would not being selling it if it did not perform well. I would rather swallow my pride and admit that I'm not the perfect gunsmith out there and be honest with you up front about what I've done than have you upset at me later for not being truthful.

- Lower handguard has had several rails and a Magpul vertical grip mounted to it at one time or another, it's still functional and the pictures show what's been done (several holes drilled and indentations)
- Buttstock has a rear sling attachment point added that is functional and very secure, the wood was dremeled out to allow the mount to sit flush, the work is marginal in my humble opinion and their is an area that started to chip that lead to me putting a small square of clear two-part epoxy on it (this is pictured)
- Side rail for the scope mount has three rivets that secure it to the receiver that I felt were loose and I made a rivet squeezer out of a 24"" bolt cutter set to attempt and crimp the rivets tighter (Google it, it's actually a popular thing among AK people). Well the rivet squeezer worked and did tighten the rivets up, however their are wear marks as a result of this and the rear rivet was crimped too much in my opinion, but is still tight and holding. The other two rivets came out good, but I have included a picture of the rear one for your viewing pleasure.
- Bolt carrier had what I thought was an issue when slowly racking the bolt and was popping up at the rear most travel and getting hung up on the receiver side rail (there is a factory cutout area there where it allows you to remove the bolt during disassembly). I thought the issue was with the carrier and got the old dremel out to ""smooth and taper"" the area on the bolt carrier. It did not correct the issue. After getting educated from Google I realized the issue was the recoil spring guide rod needed tweeked a little and was pulling the bolt up slightly. That corrected the issue for the most part from what I can tell. Every AK I have owned (2 Wasr and a Polish Tantal) also did this when cycling the bolt by hand slowly. I really don't think there was ever an issue to begin with and I just couldn't leave well enough alone. The pictures show what I did and the one pic compares to the other side for reference. I just ran 90 rounds through this yesterday with zero issues. Sorry for the long story, but wanted to be detailed on this.

I will include four 40 caliber magazines ( three 13 and one 15 round), and several different beavertails and back straps of various sizes.   Everything inside this gun has been polished and it shoots flawless. I did white inlay work on the slide and installed a custom back plate with the Glock logo on it. I also have 480 rounds of 40 caliber fmj's that will be included. I have close to if not over a $1000 invested in this set up. I will let everything go for $750 FIRM.

In 1927, the Argentina Arsenal ""DGFM-FMAP"" began manufacturing the Model 1911A1. The slide is marked with one line on each side and reads ""SIST.COLT.CAL. 11.25mm MOD.1927"" which means Army of Argentina. The other side is marked D.G.F.M. - (FMAP) These guns were made in Argentina under license from Colt, with Colt machinery, and with help & supervision from Colt engineers, and are known as ""Model 1927 Sistema Colt"" or Colt system. 

This particular ""Sistema Colt"" has matching serial numbers on the frame, slide, barrel and every single part is original with the exception of the grips, Beavertail Grip Safety, Hammer, Trigger and the finish. I have added NEW very nice walnut wood grips and will include a original style 7 Round Magazine and two 8 round mags too. I have all of the original parts and you or I can return it back to stock in a very short period of time. 
The extended slide stop is also not original to the pistol but I do have the original.
The gun is fully functional, however, has collector value since it has all matching serial numbered parts. This is a GENUINE Colt 1911-A1 made in Argentina by Colt machinery and Engineers. According to what I can find online it was made in 1957.

This is a great shooting gun. 
The case will come with the gun.
I will be giving 50 rounds of Selleir & Bellot FMJ ammo with it too. 

I also have several other extra Magazines and 250 more rounds of ammo at an extra reduced cost to the buyer of the gun. 
4 Magazines are 10 round Argentine made. These were the best feeding that I ever used. Rubber bottom, made to somewhat match the grips on the gun so that the grip is extended."

I have decided to let go of this beautiful custom CM9 that I have spent a lot of time and effort into making it the best compact single stack 9mm on the market.

I purchased the gun brand new last month and am the first and only owner. I've put roughly 500 flawless rounds through the pipe without a single hiccup. The gun is remarkably accurate for being so small. 

The slide has been cerakoted in disruptive grey. I've also added Trijicon night sights. The frame has been stippled very clean. One other thing I want to mention, I have done a mild trigger undercut on the frame when I did the stippling which allows a higher purchase on the grip.

Here are details from the KimberAmerica website:

The Kimber legacy of offering the finest production firearms available today continues with the Solo®, a new pistol that puts the power of the 9 mm cartridge in a micro-compact size usually reserved for smaller calibers. Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare.
