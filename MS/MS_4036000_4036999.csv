I used the bow as a starter. It's very accurate and fast. At 40 yards I can group very well. I'm pretty sure the draw length is a 30"" or maybe even a 31""

I took it to an indoor range to try out the new arrows (see below) and make sure I wouldn't have to change any sights. While it was there I tested the pull. It's currently set at 65# but is adjustable. I'm going to be moving onto a much more expensive bow so I'm selling all this to someone who wants to get into the sport inexpensively.

Includes:
Updated illuminated fiber optic sight. (Sighted in for 10, 20, 30, 40 yards with pins)
Trigger release
8 carbon fiber arrows. 6 are new - see pic with box and receipt ($45.00)
Extra field points
Extra vibration dampers

Several years back I had Cabelas install a new string. (I would advise that any used bow you purchase you have a new string put on unless there is a receipt showing it was just done.)

USPSA season is starting and he needs a un damaged used or new bar!
If you have one you would sell,  know of any in stock somewhere or are a dealer with any in stock please call Jeff at REDACTED or message me and i will forward it to him. S&W has them but is only supplying to dealers for some dumb reason. He really doesn't want to buy a new pistol to rob the bar. If you have one in a pistol you never shoot...like if you plan on shooting next year or when ever they are in stock maybe you can help him out. 
I say this because he can give you his which still works fine but USPSA season he will pass 5000 rounds by June. So if you dont shoot comp or a truck load of rounds this bar will last. 
He may be interested in a 9mm compact as last resort if price is right like you need some cash and a No BS buyer with cash. Either way lemme know"

Jewelry is hand crafted and made from recycled bullet casings. All powder has been removed from the casing prior to jewelry being assembled. We machine the head stamps of the bullet casing so when the stones are set the crystals have a nice bezel setting, unlike some of our competitors that just glue the stone to the primers - which can be easily knocked off with daily activity. 

We can make the jewelry out of any casing we have in stock. Items are available in your choice of Swarovski crystal stone (if in stock) or we can leave the primer in.

If you have any bullet casing(s) that have sentimental value to you and you would like a keepsake item made from it, please contact us. You would just send us the casing so we can make your item and return the completed item to you. Many people will use the first few casings either a loved one or themselves fired from a specific firearm.

Again, not a big deal, but some people think there's something wrong with it. I shot a full throttle bottle at 75 yards on the first shot with iron sights... so they are on target. Rest assured, everytime you pull the trigger, this rifle goes bang. From Russian steel cased ammo to match grade, it will eat it. Do a quick Google search on the quality of the Mak90, a lot of enthusiasts consider this AK to be the best stamped receiver AK 47 on the market. You can shoot 300 rounds thru it and barley have any cleaning you will need to do. I love this gun and am in no hurry to part ways with it. just seeing what's out there."

Seller has indicated this is a private sale.
12 Gauge 870 Express 28"" Remington Vent Rib barrel with mod choke. 
(Barrel only). for 2 3/4 or 3"".

This is the older style barrel finish (the quality was better then).
I received the shotgun in 1989 as a B-day present.  Shot less than a box of shells through it, cleaned it, and it stayed at my parents house, and wasn't fired again during my entire Military career.  Recently, I changed the barrel out to a shorter one, and I have no plans on ever hunting, or using a 28"" barrel.  It's very clean, and well taken care of all these years, even though it was not used.  

Thank you."

Specifications are accurate and were built to this link below:  http://www.nramuseum.org/media/940325/1842%20article.pdf 

These were the official sidearm of the Mexican war (not the Colt Walker as many believe) and they were used up into the Civil War.  They were also very popular on the Oregon trail from the 1840s through the 1860s due to a government program at the time that allowed civilians to buy military guns at the same price as the military.

No FFL required. Shipping is $30.

This ammo has a mild steel-core penetrator. Despite what the ATF or any other ignorant person might say, this is NOT armor piercing. Mild steel cannot go through hardened steel plates that are used for body armor. The steel core would have to be hardened steel to be able to penetrate (or tungsten carbide). Simple fucking physics. Here is a pic of the mild steel core of an XM855 round not going through a piece of cast iron, which is nowhere near as strong as body armor. The copper jacket peeled off just leaving the penetrator barely sticking in it."

872,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4036872,For Sale:  Custom Magpul MOE Handguard,"Trempealeau, La Crosse, Wisconsin",$ 45,"Listed On: Friday, March 20, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling this custom Magpul handguard.  As you can see I've customized this rifle length handguard to work with a mid-length gas system.  It adds a sleek look and you'll be the only one on the range - I know, because I was.

I'm selling the handguard because I'm changing things up a bit.  Decided to go with a different look.  I've had this handguard on my rifle for about two years and it shoots great.  I'm no ace with open sights but I was able to put rounds on paper at 200 rounds.

As of right now the listed price is for the handguard only.  However, if you want to get this same look using the same components I would consider selling what you see in the picture also.  The components are the flash suppressor, handguard cap, handguard, and Magpul MOE sling mount.  The flash suppressor and handguard cap are for a lightweight .625 diameter barrel, but the handguard will work on any mid-length gas system barrel.  You could also use a low-pro gas block in front of the handguard cap to hold everything in place, that would be a slick look.

$45 or best offer (for handguard only).  Make me an offer.

Just had a new trigicon front sight installed by a professional gun smith with receipt for both sight and labor. And sight is dated 2014. If you want a great gun that shoots 1.5"" groupings at 25 yards this is it. Trigger pull in about 3.5 lbs. the mags alone go for $50 each. This is a 1911 in 45 acp. I may trade for some guns or guns and cash, I do not need any ar15s or glocks. Looking for a fs2000 or looking for a nice .308 bolt action. But will look at all offers. If you have a nice 4x4 ext cab may kick in cash for trade. If you want to trade it must be equal of cash added. If you cannot own a firearm legaly don't try. To make a deal must have a ccw permit with actual valid permit in hand. The wilson combat kz45 is a awsome and very accurate gun."
