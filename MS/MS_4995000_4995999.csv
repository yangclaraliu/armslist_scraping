It was used, and I was going to make it a project gun, but I'm going to go in a different direction. Gun is not 100% by far. The slide was painted sniper gray as well as the controls. I would repaint it personally. The barrel was cerakoted silver, which I thought looked tacky, so I had it PVD coated with TiCN, which makes it look dark metallic/tungsten and has a low coefficient of friction. The millwork and barrel porting look good. I would also change out the sights, as they are just regular paint sights. Was told the gun has $1100 total invested. I see the value in repainting and putting on new sights for sure. I just don't feel like doing it right now. Have more pics available. Feel free to call or text, located in Darien. REDACTED.

It also has a factory extended mag release and sweet grips. I shouldn't have bought it, because I NEED one with a 3"" barrel for work. My loss is your gain. See why Hickok45 (the most respected & knowledgeable reviewer around) compares it to his $3,ooo. plus Ed Brown. You can buy these for $ 899. to $ 949. plus tax depending on where you can find them. I would consider a trade for a 3"" to 4"" 1911. you will need a CPL or purchase permit. Call or text REDACTED

Testosterone Decanoate usage and dosage
Because the decanoate ester is so long lasting, users will only need to inject the drug once a week. The drug itself doesn't fully leave the body for 15 days. Users sometimes stack Neotest 250 with Deca-Durabolin and inject them at the same time, as they will last in the body the same amount of time. Doses as little as 250 mgs/week will see results and extreme doses of 1000 mgs/week have been recorded with little side effects, although use of an aromatose inhibitor is a must at extreme doses.

Usage :Testosterone Decanoate has been used as a part of the testosterone blend Sustanon 250 for a long time. Recently, it has become available on its own in a product called neatest 250. The decanoate ester makes this testosterone drug stay in the blood stream for an extended period of time, allowing the user to inject only once a week and still have strong gains to show from it.
Like all testosterone drugs, Neotest 250 will give the user large gains in strength and muscle mass, burn body fat, increase libido, increase the red blood cell count, increase IGF-1 levels and ease the recovery from strenuous workouts. And like all testosterone drugs, the effects of aromatization are likely as well.

Dosage instruction :
Testosterone Decanoate usage and dosage
Because the decanoate ester is so long lasting, users will only need to inject the drug once a week. The drug itself doesn’t fully leave the body for 15 days. Users sometimes stack Neotest 250 with Deca-Durabolin and inject them at the same time, as they will last in the body the same amount of time. Doses as little as 250 mgs/week will see results and extreme doses of 1000 mgs/week have been recorded with little side effects, although use of an aromatose inhibitor is a must at extreme doses."

PT-141 was developed from the tanning peptide Melanotan 2, which is a synthetically produced variant of a peptide hormone naturally produced in the body that stimulates melanogenesis that is known as alpha-Melanocyte stimulating hormone. MSH, activates certain melanocortin receptors in the process of exerting its effects. Indeed, MSH also exerts potent influence over lipid metabolism, appetite, and sexual libido. 

Resultantly, PT-141 has been shown in studies to exhibit libido-enhancing effects by activating the melanocortin receptors MC1R and MC4R, but not skin tanning. 

PT-141 is a potential remedy for the treatment of sexual dysfunction; specifically, male erectile dysfunction. 

Treatment:  PT-141 is the only synthetic aphrodisiac. The aphrodisiac effects of Bremelanotide are in a class of its own. Studies have shown Bremelanotide to be effective in treating sexual dysfunction in both men (erectile dysfunction or impotence) and women (sexual arousal disorder)."

Chemically speaking, trestolone acetate(MENT) actually an alright looking drug. It doesn't show much interaction with Sex Hormone Binding Globulin, which means that a good portion ought to stay unbound and active in the blood. Also, the drug is a potent binder to the androgen receptor, while showing minimal affinity for the progesterone and mineralocorticoid receptors respectively. Since it is not able to be 5a-reduced into a dihydro-version, it likely wouldn't cause many of the side effects commonly associated with Dihydrotestosterone. This is also a likely reason that it is less apt to cause prostate enlargement, and may even be indicated for the treatment of specific prostate issues.

Usage: Tetracaine HCl is synthesized from 4-butylaminobenzoic acid. The ethyl ester is formed through an acid-catalyzed esterification reaction. Base-catalyzed transesterification is achieved by boiling the ethyl ester of 4-butylaminobenzoic acid with excess 2-dimethylaminoethanol in the presence of a small amount of sodium ethoxide.

Tetracaine (INN, also known as amethocaine; trade name Pontocaine. Ametop and Dicaine) is a potent local anesthetic of the ester group. It is mainly used topically in ophthalmology and as an antipruritic, and it has been used in spinal anesthesia.
In biomedical research, tetracaine is used to alter the function of calcium release channels (ryanodine receptors) that control the release of calcium from intracellular stores. Tetracaine is an allosteric blocker of channel function. At low concentrations, tetracaine causes an initial inhibition of spontaneous calcium release events, while at high concentrations, tetracaine blocks release completely."

Testosterone Isocaproate will help in increasing the body weight and will also help in gaining the strength.  It also helps in losing fat in the body and gives an increase in libido, red blood cells, stamina and quick recovery after heavy training.  As told earlier it is very hard to be found in the market in its purest form but its raw powder form is available in the market in the form of Testosterone Cypionate and Testosterone Enanthate. Testosterone Isocaproate is useful in increasing the synthesis of protein in the body, reduction of the cortisol, increasing the ability to recover especially after heavy trainings, increasing strength and helps the person gaining more mass. It is also very efficient in both cutting and the bulking cycles.  But as it is related with the family of androgen it will have aromatizing properties as well. Apart from these benefits it has got all other benefits associated with it which are also associated with any other testosterone.

Testosterone suspension is an injectable preparation containing testosterone (no ester) in a Oil base. Among bodybuilders, ""suspension"" is known to be an extremely potent mass agent. It is often ranked as the most powerful injectable steroid available, resulting in an incredibly rapid gain of muscle mass and strength. This is largely due to the very fast action of this drug, as the water-based steroid will begin to enter the blood stream almost immediately after an injection is given. Unlike longer esters such as enanthate or cypionate which take weeks for blood levels to reach maximiun theraputic levels, with suspension it is just a matter of days. Clearly the anabolic effect of this testosterone will be realized much more quickly than we would expect with an oil based (esterified) preparation.

Testosterone Acetate combination of Testosterone and ester acetate, Testosterone Acetate is an androgenic steroid with a pronounced anabolic effect. Most acetate treatments deliver medication to the body relatively quickly. Testosterone Acetate has very low risk of water retention. Individuals that utilize this form of Testosterone also claim that it is arguably the most painless form of Testosterone.

Testosterone Acetate ester is much faster acting, and thus requires a more frequent schedule in order to keep blood levels as stable as possible. The benefit to this however, is that the steroid can be cleared from the body much more quickly after use is discontinued, thus making it a more preferable choice for tested athletes. Athletes use Testosterone Acetate to see dramatic gain in muscle size and strength, as well as an overall sense of well being and increases libido and sex drive.

Pentadecapeptide BPC 157, composed of 15 amino acids, is a partial sequence of body protection compound (BPC) that is discovered in and isolated from human gastric juice. Experimentally it has been demonstrated to accelerate the healing of many different wounds, including transected rat Achilles tendon. This study was designed to investigate the potential mechanism of BPC 157 to enhance healing of injured tendon. The outgrowth of tendon fibroblasts from tendon explants cultured with or without BPC 157 was examined. Results showed that BPC 157 significantly accelerated the outgrowth of tendon explants. Cell proliferation of cultured tendon fibroblasts derived from rat Achilles tendon was not directly affected by BPC 157 as evaluated by MTT assay. However, the survival of BPC 157-treated cells was significantly increased under the H2O2 stress. BPC 157 markedly increased the in vitro migration of tendon fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner as revealed by transwell filter migration assay. BPC 157 also dose dependently accelerated the spreading of tendon fibroblasts on culture dishes. The F-actin formation as detected by FITC-phalloidin staining was induced in BPC 157-treated fibroblasts. The protein expression and activation of FAK and paxillin were determined by Western blot analysis, and the phosphorylation levels of both FAK and paxillin were dose dependently increased by BPC 157 while the total amounts of protein was unaltered. In conclusion, BPC 157 promotes the ex vivo outgrowth of tendon fibroblasts from tendon explants, cell survival under stress, and the in vitro migration of tendon fibroblasts, which is likely mediated by the activation of the FAK-paxillin pathway.

Oxytocin is a hormone secreted by the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, a pea-sized structure at the base of the brain.

It's sometimes known as the ""cuddle hormone"" or the ""love hormone,"" because it is released when people snuggle up or bond socially. Even playing with your dog can cause an oxytocin surge, according to a 2009 study published in the journal Hormones and Behavior. But these monikers may be misleading.

Nandrolone phenylpropionate is one of the most popular injectable steroids. It is basically Deca, with a shorter ester ( phenylpropionate instead of decanoate ester found in deca durabolin or nandrolone decanoate), resulting in quicker release into the bloodstream. Although its shorter ester means it will require more frequent injections than decanoate, the positive side is that the amount of effective nandrolone in the blood and its levels are more easilly contollable. It's popularity is likely due to the fact that nandrolone exhibits significant anabolic effects with minimal androgenic side effects.

Dosage instruction: NPP is commonly dosed between 300-1,000 mg per week for a period of 8-16 weeks in length.  If one is using NPP solely for the alleviation of joint discomfort, a dose of 200-300 mg per week will usually suffice.

Nandrolone is a unique drug because it does not sacrifice the quality of muscles over its anabolic property. Its non-conversion to estrogen makes it possible to form high caliber muscles. This compound prevents the process of water accumulation and fats storage in the muscle. Because of this attribute, the muscles formed are tighter, leaner and more solid. The absence of excess water and fats is an advantage since the body will not demonstrate compensatory mechanisms such as high blood pressure, rapid heartbeat and cholesterol deposits. Nandrolone is known to relieve muscle pain and speeds up the regeneration process of the muscles.

This is really two guns in one. With the compact grip module it is similar in size to a Glock 19. With the subcompact module the grip height is closer to a Glock 26 which makes it more concealable. The subcompact module will accept both 12 and 15 round magazines. The compact will only accept the 15 rounders. 

This gun is very accurate and has a great trigger.

It has been kept in a ""HUMIDITY CONTROLLED"" safe since the day of purchase. It has also NEVER been fired. The buttstock, in addition to its folding feature, has a soft recoil pad, and the length and comb height are adjustable to fit the shooter. The AR-style thumb safety can be switched for right-handed or left-handed use. The pistol grip is of AR style also, and the MRAD will accept any AR-style pistol grip. The magazine release is perfectly located, easy to use, and ambidextrous. The muzzle brake is removable to allow for the use of a sound suppressor, and the brake is very effective. The Barrett MRAD is, so far, the apex of 338 Lapua rifle development. It is a rifle that is relatively light weight, very portable, beautifully crafted, and superbly accurate. It can reliably engage targets out to a mile and beyond, and does so with very little recoil. It is an excellent choice for those who want to reach out and engage long range targets, and to do so reliably. You will never regret buying the best. Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 Mil Dot Riflescope C239: Many consider the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 to be the ultimate long range scope. It’s 56mm objective lens provides maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This advanced field tactical scope has a wide magnification factor that allows precision accuracy at the longest ranges yet is highly effective for shots at close ranges. The design of this scope exudes ruggedness and that is exactly what it is. With 100 MOA of elevation travel and 20 MOA or 10 mils of travel per turret revolution respectively per turret version, no target will be out of range of this scope. Optional Nighhtforce Zero Stop elevation turret and standard illuminated reticle compliment the side parallax adjustment rounding out the most popular rifle scope Nightforce has yet produced. So whether you are a long range hunter or a tactical shooter, this rifle scope will be all that you will ever need.

Serial Number puts gun in the 1960's. The nickel has not been replated and only shows wear on the back of the grip frame and a little on the inside of the trigger guard in front of the trigger... the usual spots. I believe I checked the serial number when I bought it and found the revolver to be made in the late sixties. I also believe it to be a service gun having ""SPP 14"" stamped on the bottom of the grip frame. I have seen very few nickel guns on Gun Broker and they have all been longer barrels, not as nice of a condition, and none have had the original walnut grips on them. I bought this a few years back only because my first gun was an old Colt Army Special and this one was much nicer than that one. I think I only put a box of wadcutters through it back then and that was it. It has sat in the safe ever since then. It is a very straight shooting, accurate revolver. The timing on it is perfect and it locks up tight. I am only selling it because I have my eye on another gun.... you know the story. I don't shoot it at all and am not a collector so someone else should enjoy it. If you are looking for a nice old Colt in this state, here it is."

A collectible that is no longer manufactured, this Colt Python is nearly flawless with its original receipt and factory target. The only signs of wear at all are minor holster wear marks towards the muzzle. (The pictures may not show the wear at all, as minor as it is.) The box it comes in is custom made with leather inlays for protecting the revolver.

This revolver is in good shape for a new gun, let alone one that is nearly a half-century old.

I originally bought this pistol from a narcotics agent who used it as their ""back up"" concealment pistol. I replaced the recoil and magazines springs with factory ones when I first bought it. I have not had a single malfunction in this pistol the entire time I have owned it! Comes with the original packaging. Great tool for ccw and teaching people of slighter build to fire handguns.

What I have for sale is a very lightly used Smith and Wesson SD9VE. Only about 200 rounds down the pipe for a break-in and that's it. It's a great gun and cost efficient to shoot. It's a reliable gun at a reasonable price. I love it and the only reason I'm selling is to get something smaller for my CC. I know this gun retails for 389$ but here's the list of extras that it comes with and that are inside of it: 

TruGlo M&P Brite Sites Green rear Red front fiber optic

Talon grips (in my opinion these grips make the gun, even though they're not extremely expensive, you can feel an incredible difference in hand.

It has not been fired. I bought it and put it in the safe. It was bought for my 4 year old daughter for when she gets old enough to hunt but after thinking on it, I'm going to get her a bolt action 223. I feel the 7mm-08 is going to be too much for her. I assure you its not been fired, maybe at the factory for testing purposes but has not been fired since I bought it new. The scope isn't even sighted in. The micro midas is a youth/lades version with a shortened stock. It has a minox scope on it mounted with one piece mount. My price of $650 is FIRM. Or $700 with the scope and mount and i'll throw in a full box of federal fusion. If I can't sell it for this i'll keep it and just buy the 223 bolt gun anyway. Only trades i'd accept is a 223 bolt action rifle of equal value that has a barrel twist rate of 1:9 or 1:7 nothing higher."
