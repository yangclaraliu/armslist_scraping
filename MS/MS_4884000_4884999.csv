I have a Cz 75 SPO1 and Kadet 22 lr conversion kit for sale.  If this listing is up, I still have it.

The spo1 in 9mm has been converted to single action only with cz's competition parts (some original parts included) They include Adjustable S/A trigger, comp hammer, new springs/pins, etc.  The trigger is phenomenal and is completely safe (firing pin block is in place, manual safety is retained and works, all work completed by Czech custom shop).  The trigger could be even better by swapping the hammer spring to a lighter one (however the 22 conversion will light strike).  Overall the gun is in very good shape and features tritium night sights, Cz custom grips, 2 18 round mags, and has around 800 rounds through it. 

The 22 conversion kit is fit for the sp01 and allows cheap practice.  It shoots better than a ruger mark 3 and has about 1000 rounds through it.  It has a couple light dings on the top of the slide near the front sight (fell off a shooting bench).  Other than that it's in great shape.  Stainless barrel, adjustable sights, 2 mags, etc

All of the springs in the gun/conversion kit were new other than the 9mm mag springs.  It comes with different guide rod springs and hammer springs so you can adjust the gun if you want.  I have the manual for the 22 and I might have the sp01 manual.  I would prefer to sell them as a set with everything pictured.  New the kadet sells for 420$, and a stock spo1 sells for 650 to 700.  My gun has 350$ in custom work and extras.  I am thinking somewhere around 1000 for everything and I will throw in 300 rounds of 22lr and a couple other things.  
I will sell the pistol on its own with none of ammo pictured for 750$ And the 22 conversion for 250$ Without ammo.  


Note: I am open to trades for 500/460 smith revolvers or m1a rifles, or a glock 43 with extra cash.  I can throw in cash if needed on a trade.  Thanks"

870 Remington 12 gauge
NEVER FIRED

This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.
Key Features:

26"" or 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells"

OVERVIEW
SPECIFICATIONS
Model R-15™ VTR™ SS Varmint
OVERVIEW:
Remington  created an unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails.  designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. It comes with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

KEY FEATURES:
New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind

The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide. Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition.

The pistol has been refinished in black duracoat, however slight imperfections on the finish exist.  Also this pistol was originally built in 1986 and due to that it has some internal wear on the mechanisms. Your are buying a used/PREBAN pistol that has been in circulation for almost 30 years. 

Legal Disclaimer. All Massachusetts Laws WILL BE FOLLOWED. All transfers will be done at an FFL. You are buying the firearm AS IS. The last time I brought the pistol to the range it fired flawlessly, but it is a 30 year old weapon and parts wear out over time. I take no responsibility for any malfunctions or part wear after the transfer. It is your responsibility to make sure this weapon is safe and functional. 

Fun Facts. 
I originally bought this pistol at Gun-show as a project gun. I've had it for about 5 years now and have enjoyed it immensely. Its been a blast and now its time to pass it on to someone else. As time goes by these pistols are becoming harder and harder to find in Massachusetts. 

I've priced this pistol to about half of the money I have into It. As you can read above it has a tone of work done to it and comes with a ton of extras. These don't show up everyday so act fast it'll be gone soon.

Hawken 50 caliber percussion is a serious hunting rifle featuring a hardwood stock and 28"" octagonal barrel. It maintains the classic styling and handling of the time-honored Hawken while offering great performance and affordability. The 28"" octagonal performance barrel has a 1 in 48"" twist with click-adjustable rear hunting sight. Additional features include, Brass butt plate and nose cap, Brass patch box and trigger guard, Hooked breech for barrel removal, Double-set crisp triggers.
The Hawken rifle is generally shorter and of a larger caliber than earlier Kentucky Rifles. 
It was popular in the mid-nineteenth century. The term ""Hawken rifle"" technically referred to rifles made by Jacob and Samuel Hawken of St Louis, Missouri but was often used generically to refer to a variety of ""plains rifles"" of the period. The earliest known record of a Hawken rifle dates to 1823  when one was made for William H. Ashley, Ashley did several large scale fur trapping expeditions in the mountain west.  The Hawkens did not mass-produce their rifles, they were hand made one at a time. Famous men said to have owned a Hawken rifle include: Jim Bridger, Kit Carson, Joseph Meek, and Theodore Roosevelt.
