Overall, this is a great gun, and very accurate. Using bulk .223 ammo, I can end a 40round range session at 100yds with a 4"" circle. The furthest I have shot it has been 300yds and the holdovers for the scope were spot on. Very impressed with the scope. I was debating between the Bushnell and the Nikon M223. To my surprise, comparing them side by side, the Bushnell actually had clearer glass. 

The only reason I am considering selling is to fund my ultra light build. It has only had about 500 rounds through it and has been a range toy. Very well maintained. I have over $1500 invested. I'm asking $1200

If interested at a lower price, I can remove the scope and take $200 off."

The Winchester Model 69 was a bolt-action .22 caliber repeating rifle first produced in 1935 by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. It was marketed as Winchester's mid-priced bolt-action rimfire sporting rifle, positioned above inexpensive single-shot rifles such as the Model 68 and beneath the prestigious Model 52. An uncommon Model 69 variant, the Model 697, was offered with a telescopic sight and no provisions for iron sights. Production ended in 1963.

Origins and design
During the early 1930s, Winchester management was disappointed with the slow sales of the Model 56 and Model 57. Potential buyers considered the Model 56 and 57's 22 in (560 mm) barrels too short and the rifles' prices too high.[1] The Model 69 was conceived as a lower-priced replacement with a longer 25 in (640 mm) barrel. The rifle was designed in 1934 by Winchester employee Frank F. Burton,[2] production was announced with the release of Winchester's new price list on 1 January 1935, and the first completed rifles were shipped in March of the same year.

We just built upon the years of research and improved upon the already great RUC platform. We are so excited to introduce to you our new RUC MOD 2.

When we first introduced our original RUC, our focus was to develop a rifle that integrated a lightweight design while using the highest quality components. What we created was a high performance AR15 that took the market by storm. Introduced on the rifle was our ambidextrous charging handle, the Raptor as well as an ambi safety selector set up.

The RUC MOD 2 has slimmed down from it's predecessor and now weighs in at 6 lbs and 1 oz. It features our new Rainier Arms Force Rail 15"". We also redesigned our new Rainier Arms Compensator (RAC) which offers enhanced recoil management and almost fully eliminates muzzle rise. We needed a heavy duty barrel and we achieved it. Introducing our Mountain Series barrels. They are CHF Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel 5.56mm Nato barrels - the toughest out there, period.

All materials used are of industry-leading standards, each weapon carefully and meticulously assembled with a limited lifetime warranty.

It has been stripped and cleaned, loaded and carried a couple times but as of yet is unfired and is in like new condition. Will come with everything it came with new, the case, mag loader, and 2 Mec-Gar 15rd magazines.
I'm primarily looking for something that would be more practical for conceal carry. Mainly in the market for a single stack 9mm. Would really like a basic (Armscor, RIA, etc) 9mm 1911, but would also be interested in a basic officer size 1911 of any caliber. Otherwise would be interested in other single stack 9mm pistols (LC9S, BP9CC, Sig P290, etc- NO Shields though). Would also be interested in a S&W J-frame. I would also consider a trade down plus some cash for a Kel-Tec PF-9 or Taurus PT111 G2.

	Hey All, 
	I have another really great entry level AR for sale/trade. This is a Bushmaster XM15-E2S AR15 chambered in 5.56/223 REM. This will come with the gun, Ambi single point sling adapter, 4 Used Metal Surplus Mags, Quick Release NC Star Holographic multi reticle sight with blue illumination, forward assist, and dust cover.. This is a 6 inch barrel with 1:9 twist and a standard Bird Cage flash hider installed. This is a awesome little starter gun that I would keep, but i don’t need another AR at the moment. This is in used shape and shows some signs of use, but still feels fine and tight. 
	I would also consider trades for various items. Possibly Marlin Lever guns in 44, 357 etc., PLR-16, CMR30, AK47 under-folder, 30 carbines, Black Powder Revolvers, 45 ACP Carbines, 9mm Carbines, Redhawks, etc. Some trades will need boot on your end, some on mine. No 40s or 22s unless heavily in my favor. Honestly, just shoot me a message at REDACTED and we can go from there. Need to meet up in Norman on this one. 

Thanks for looking and happy hunting,

Fitted to the Task-And The Shooter

The two overriding questions that must be asked when purchasing a pistol are: How is it going to be used? and By whom? 

The P250 makes those questions much less critical by being adaptable to a variety of tasks and a variety of shooters. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers. And, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes.

1) replaced plastic mag follower with metal one
2) replaced stiff ejector spring with aftermarket
3) removed superfluous safety on top of bolt, filled hole with fitted plug

Rossi guns are decent enough guns for the price, but the are *rough* when factory new. Just pick one up in a gun store you will see! That loading gate is sharp.

The CompM4 features an internal voltage regulator that allows the sight to operate on any AA size battery available worldwide. This sight features a 2 minute-of-angle (MOA) dot size, making it perfectly suited for use with Aimpoint s 3XMagnifier scope module. The CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, and features an extremely rugged and easy to use 16-position manual switch with 7 night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings. The CompM4 sight body is designed to protect both the optics and adjustment components against hard use, and is waterproof to 45 meters (150 feet).

The CompM4 also features an improved QRP2 Picatinny rail mount, eliminating the need for a separate mounting ring. This mount has over twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and features a lower and wider torque limiting knob to improve ease of use and lessen the chance of the sight base becoming snagged on other equipment. The mount is keyed into the sight to absorb recoil forces. Vertical and cantilever spacers are available to allow the sight to fit on all M16 rifle and M4 carbine variants. The sight can also be used on any other weapon with a Picatinny rail mounting system.

This auction is for a F.LLI PIETTA GHIBLI 20ga 26"" SHOTGUN
The Ghibli continues Pietta’s tradition of naming their shotguns after famous winds and not as might be surmised the Maserati sports car of the same name. Gas powered with an all-black synthetic finish, the Ghibli as tested is a true European hunting 20 bore designed to do a job, be it sending shot towards its intended target or accurately delivering a solid slug. What you don’t get with any Pietta are items and accessories that you don’t need, the Italian company’s ethos being genuine simplicity that fulfils the shooter’s needs without unnecessary frippery.

Open the box and what you do get is a purposeful looking gasser, a set of three short, flush-fit choke tubes and a small key to effect the change. The one notable point is the chequering moulded into the synthetic stock and long well contoured forend at that besides its functionality it’s been designed to act as an attractive feature, adding an element of Italianate style to what at heart is a working weapon.

Both stock and forend are well formed, as is the fit and feel whilst a deep soft rubber butt pad completes the stock alongside a moulded integral sling mount, the forward mount being part of the mag cap. Chrome lined to facilitate non–toxic loads the 26” barrel comes with a short extension and 3” magnum load chamber and is finished with a semi-matte anodized finish, a small brass bead and a 6mm vented rib, the finish continuing along the top half of the alloy receiver, the top of which is dovetailed to facilitate the fitment of a small scope.

Inkeeping with the Ghibli’s all black demeanour the only ornamentation the receiver displays are the name, Pietta’s logo and the fact the gun is ‘Made in Italy’ on the left-hand side. The cross-bolt safety is where they all tend to be, namely in the rear span of the broad, oversized trigger guard whilst the bolt latch is tucked away in the forward span.

I wouldn't let this rifle go if I didn't have to.This is an awesome shooting rifle. I have only put 300 rounds through it. Broke the barrel in exactly how the manual(which i will include with the rifle) recommends to. No malfunctions what's so ever. Since it is using a piston system designed like the AK-47, so you don't get that feel of the bolt carrier slamming into the buffer tube and there is less felt recoil. The recoil is a very light push. It has a five position gas adjuster, one let's you take the gas adjuster off, then low, medium, high settings, and the last setting shots the gas off making it like a single shot rifle. It has a forward charging handle which is none reciprocating and can be switched to either side. This rifle is extremely well built. There is absolutely no play anywhere. Faxon is known for their precision maching. They only use high quality metals and every single part on and in this gun was made in the USA. The scope is a Vortex Spitfire 3X Prism. I also put on a Custom Muzzle Breaks Tactical Low Concussion break and a Magpul AFG-2. I suggest you check out their website to get the full specs of this rifle. www.faxonfirearms.com, Thanks for looking."

I've been successfully using this reloading equipment for 3 years but I have recently upgraded to a multi-stage press. It has been well maintained and cared for. I have all of the original directions and parts except the reloading manual. This a great kit for a beginner or someone looking to reload precision rifle ammo. My price is firm. I also have a set of RCBS 5.56 Dies and shell holders that I will throw into the deal for a total of $180. This kit is normally $350 new.

-Comes with Press, Reloading Scale, Uniflow Powder Measure, Hand Priming Tool, Case Loading Block, Debur Tool, Case Lube Kit, Powder Funnel, and Powder Stand.
-This kit will not reload shotgun shells.
