The gun comes from the factory with the shell stop feature on the slide, the coveted desert camo finish and ghost ring sights. 

The tube extension was $60, the side saddle $100 and the original gun was $650. Take it home for $650 or trade. You won't regret it. The gun was so reliable, I used to take my friend's light strikes or deformed cartridges and shoot them without issue.

Key Features

Text or email only please REDACTED
Patented BDC reticle: The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold 'dead-on' at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC's unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting, yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.
Extremely bright sight picture: Allows for high-resolution images even when hunting in the least desirable conditions.
Versatile magnification range: Offers the flexibility needed for any type of hunting situation, from heavy timber to the open prairies.
Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed.

Multicoated optical system: Multicoated lenses boost light transmission up to 98%—unheard of in similarly priced scopes.
Generous, consistent eye relief: Keeps your brow safe—even with the heaviest recoiling cartridges, lightweight rifles, and severe shooting angles.
Precise hand-turn 1/4-MOA click adjustments: Positive-click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting even with heavy recoil.
Sun Shade Adaptable: 40 mm & 50 mm models."

 I have for trade my Sig Sauer P227 Tactical. It is used, but in perfect condition. Around 150 rounds through it.

 The new, remarkably ergonomic SIG P227. It’s a .45 ACP that holds 14+1 rounds — but you’d hardly know it from the thinness of the grip. Take hold of this high-power, high-capacity pistol and you’ll see first-hand how we’ve stacked the odds in your favor.

 The P227 Tactical features:

 - Threaded Barrel
 - Short Reset Trigger
 - One 14 Round Extended Magazine and One 10-Round Magazine
 - Front Cocking Serrations
 - Nitron Coated Stainless Steel Slide
 - Black Hard Coat Anodized Alloy Beavertail Frame
 - Suppressor height Sig nite sites


 As the title states, I am ONLY looking to trade for the Sig P226 9MM Tactical / Elite Dark / possibly an Enhanced Elite plus

 I have extra magazines for the 227 and can ad them for appropriate 226 magazin"

Sig's description:
The P239® Tactical is the same pistol that was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. This P239 tactical is in 9mm."

Will consider partial trade for s&w m&p 9c or glock 19

here is what CZ has to say about it on their website.
""The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."""

I've used this rifle the past few years for deer and it's never let me down.
The upper is all factory Daniel Defense DDM4 v5, with a 16"" barrel. Only changes I made to it were to add magpul rail covers to the quad rail and a Yankee Hill Machine 7.62 QD muzzle brake for when I ran a suppressor. The brake also does a great job killing muzzle rise. I also added a Bushnell 3200 scope, mounted in a Nikon P-Series mount. Oh, I also just dropped in a badger ordinance ""tactical"" charging handle latch so it was easier for me to charge with winter gloves on.
The lower is Del-Ton, all mil-spec except for the Hogue grip and the two-point sling attachment backplate.
All together the msrp of this rifle was in excess of fifteen-hundred dollars, check my math if you'd like. I can provide links to confirm. I am looking for $1,200 OBO. No trades, I already have more guns that I know what to do with. Check, Cash, Money Order, Paypal accepted."

This came from my Sig 40 / 357 but I don't use the 357 so thought I'd see if someone else wants it.

I recently purchased this PSL at a premium price but have to take a loss as would like to sell quickly in order to finance something I just don't have quite all of the expendable cash to do so at the moment. If I don't sell this rifle quickly I will be keeping it or raising the price depending upon if I want to eventually keep it or not. The rifle is in very good condition. I've given it a thorough cleaning as well as buffed the furniture to a smooth finish. Rifle comes with the original LPS 4x TIP2 scope, scope cover, colored lens covers, rubber eye relief, rifle sling, oil bottle, and 4 mags.

PSL's have a chrome lined chamber and bore, and this bore looks very bright with a distinctly clear rifling profile. I'm guessing very little to moderate amount of use on this rifle. I haven't even had a chance to take it out to shoot yet as with kids, college, and full-time work, this daddy has little to no free time left. My loss is your gain, however like I said if it doesn't sell quickly I'll either be taking this post down or raising the price.

Any questions feel free to call, thanks! 530-720-5493"

They were used maybe 10 times over the years. These are pre recall as they were purchased around 2005. They were never left in the tree overnight. The buckles and straps are in excellent shape. I believe they fit trees up to 22 inches in diameter. The design of these makes them very sturdy and they don't turn when you are pushing off at an angle. These are getting harder and harder to find. I'm asking $100 for all. I am willing to ship for a little extra. Thanks.

It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.Manufacturer: Kel-Tec Model: P3ATCaliber: .380Barrel Length: 2.75"""

This is the real deal.



This Precision-Guided Firearm enables high-impact shots beyond what elite marksmen can achieve.  Your extreme-distance shots will be beyond belief—even with fast-moving targets.

Perfect impact on targets out to 0.75 miles, moving as fast as 20 miles per hour
The same Tag-and-Shoot™ technology found in fighter jets
Advanced target tracking technology
Comprehensive, purpose-built shooting system

Tag-and-Shoot™

Tag-and-Shoot is how a shooter actually uses a Precision-Guided Firearm. The shooter puts the reticle on the intended point of impact, presses the tag button, and then pulls the trigger when he has moved on to the designated point of impact. The Precision-Guided Firearm does the rest.

TriggerLink™

TriggerLink is an electronic connection between the tracking optic and the guided trigger. The tracking optic communicates with the guided trigger to ensure that the round is released at the precise moment required to make an extraordinary shot.

Permanent Zero

The shooter never again has to worry about whether his gun is properly zeroed. The Precision-Guided Firearm’s laser-based barrel reference system maintains a permanent, factory-set, perfect zero for every shot. It’s unaffected by shock, vibration, or other environmental factors.

Virtual Rest

Virtual Rest™ makes off-hand shots as easy as shooting from a stable rest. The Precision-Guided Firearm image is stabilized, so you can Tag-and-Shoot™ moving or stationary targets at extreme distances from an off-hand position.

Heads Up Display

HUD is the digital display that shows the field of view. The key user-interface between the shooter and the Precision-Guided Firearm, the HUD displays vital pieces of data including range-to-target, target velocity, shot angle, compass heading, gun cant, battery status, WiFi status, wind velocity and direction, kill zone size, ammunition type, temperature, barometric pressure, and time of day.

ShotView™

The ShotView app streams real-time video from the Precision-Guided Firearm to a ShotGlass™ on the Recon Jet™ wearable, smart phone, or tablet. It’s ideal for communication in hunting and target shooting applications. Friends, colleagues, or fellow soldiers can see what the shooter sees in his tracking optic."

It's a very handy gun with an impressive fireball, launching the cheap and powerful 7.62x54r.  That's right, the Mosin Nagant: because sometimes people hide behind things.

The barrel has been cut down to 16.25"" giving it an overall length of less than 36"" - barely longer than an M4.  The picture shows an M4 and a full size Mosin Nagant for comparison (though neither of them are for sale).  It was also given an 11* target crown and has a limb saver recoil pad installed - it is a blast to shoot.  I wouldn't hesitate to use it for hogs, aircraft carriers or just scaring people in the next county.  Unfortunately, I have to move into a smaller place soon and so I have to cut down on the number of toys I have.

Mosins are going for around 180-200 these days, which seems criminal to me.  I won't take a dime over $125 for this piece.

919,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4077919,For Sale/Trade:  Fusion Firearms Custom 1911 .45 ACP New Unfired,"Blaine, Knoxville, Tennessee","$ 1,800","Listed On: Tuesday, April 14, 2015",Handguns,Saiga                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I am considering letting go of one of my safe queens which is a custom, built to my specs, Fusion Firearms 5"" 1911 built by Bob Serva of Fusion Firearms.  I ordered it approximately 3 years ago and the build process takes about 1.5 years so the pistol has been in my possession for approximately 1.5 years.  As stated it is brand new and only test fired upon completion of the build.  The build specs are too many to list but I will do my best.  After owning several other brands of 1911's and being disappointed with the overall quality, I decided to move up to a custom pistol and after much research into other brands such as Wilson Combat, Les Baer, Ed Brown, etc., I settled on Fusion.  I am happy I did and wouldn't change a thing.  I am only considering parting with it because I would rather not have so much money tied up in one firearm that I do not actually use.  Once you rack the slide on this firearm and feel how the slide seems to be on ball bearings you will immediately recognize the quality that you only get from a custom 1911.  No Kimber compares.  As far as ""off the shelf"" 1911's go, the only one that would even come remotely close would be the Dan Wesson Valor which coincidently was designed by Bob Serva when he owned Dan Wesson before selling it to CZ and starting his own company.  My specs for this 1911 were intended for it to be a fighting or duty 1911 so it is entirely black (Satin/Matte Black Shield PVD on slide frame small parts and even the barrel) except for the hand selected cocobolo slim grips.  It has a magwell, XS sights, match grade barrel, ambi safety, extended mag release, checkered front strap, sure-grip slide serrations on the rear only, custom tuned trigger that breaks at a crisp 3.75 -4.25 lbs, recessed slide stop pin, full length guide rod, and the barrel is target crowned and flush cut, and the top of the slide and back of the rear sites are grooved to provent glare.  All edges have been softened for carry. It comes with an additional XS front tritium sight, case, and three magazines all tested for function by Fusion.  As for it's value, when I ordered it the total package was $1,800 and I assume they have gone up since then. If you are in the market for a high end 1911 this one is ready without the wait and is more than worth considering.  Don't pay for a name, pay for quality.  VERY SERIOUS inquiries only by PHONE CALL ONLY.  NO TEXT OR EMAILS WILL BE REPLIED TO.  I will email or text pics after we have a phone conversation so please do not email asking for them.  I will get them posted asap but am not willing to deal with emails and text.  I may be contacted at 8 six 5- three 2 three- 44 one 9.  I will require a bill of sale to be signed and prefer to deal with valid permit carriers only.  $1,800 value but will entertain reasonable offers.  No low ballers as I do not NEED to sell.  I am willing to listen to reasonable cash offers or cash plus any of the items listed as trade interest.   Thanks for looking!"

I bought it from a police officer probably 15 years ago.  The Trijicon H3 night sights were pretty bright back then; not so much now.  This particular pistol was carried quite a bit, but shot very little.  I've been contemplating having it refinished and just keeping it, but I thought I'd put it up for sale this once and see if there is any interest in the German made Sig P226 pistols.  In my very unprofessional opinion, the German made ones seem smoother and better built.  I have more than this one, so my opinion is based on more than this one pistol.

Anyway, I never received a box with it and only got one magazine with it.  It did come with a leather holster, but when I found it I discovered that it literally was falling apart so it got pitched.  I believe this pistol was manufactured in the late 80's, but I'm not sure.  I apologize for the poor pictures.  I apparently can't even figure out when my phone camera is going to flash and when it is not.  At least you should be able to tell what it is.  I will need to see proper Indiana ID and preferably carry permit as well."
