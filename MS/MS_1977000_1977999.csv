It is the USPc model and It is chambered in 40 cal. Great gun but I would like to fund another purchase so I am considering letting this one go. Possibly trading for the right gun is also an option. Like I said, HK made ONLY 500 of these in OD Green so they are near impossible to find. I have it priced at lower than the norm if you can find one (the last one to go on Gunbroker went for 1,300). I have carried it some so it does have a little holster wear but it is in good condition. Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

Prefer a cash sale. However, I will consider trades (partial, multiple or maybe even). Thanks for looking.  Asking $1,100 cash or $1,150 trade.  Thanks!"

The rifle is the full length barrel with Walnut stock. Condition of entire gun is very good, little wear to parkerizing or lumber, one slight dent near the rear sling mount from a different sling that was on it. U.S.M.C. logo and inscription have been laser engraved in the rear of the stock. Cleaning kit is brand new and never been installed in the gun. The scope mount is a Gen 4 Springfield Aluminum mount that is also brand new never installed. This gun has had the bolt locking lugs professionally lapped to the receiver to ensure full bearing on both lugs. This is a process of lapping the lugs while spring pressure dives the bolt back, and ensuring proper headspace is maintained. Bolt will close on a 1.6 go-gauge, several thousandths shy of closing on a 1.64 no-go-gauge, and clearly far from closing on a Field-gauge. The lapping ensures safety and precision as the bolt locking lugs fully share the bolt thrust during the firing cycle. The amount of headspace is about 1.63 which puts this at a chamber dimension consistent with that used by the military. It is not excessively tight, but will chamber either NATO 7.62X51 or .308 Win. without overpressure or carbon build up causing clearance issues. This is a very shootable gun. I have sighted it in per the military field manual for M80 147 gr. ball ammo. Elevation adjustments are dead on, I have shot it out as far as 500 yards open sight with precision you would expect from this gun. Also included will be the manuals, the lock, the padded travel case, the military standard marksman sling, 2 original 10 round magazines from Springfield Armory, as well as the scope mount with Leupold rings, and the cleaning kit. Overall this is a very unique, field ready rifle that is in pristine enough condition for a display piece."

It has fired approx. 250 rounds, so, it is hardly broken in. The finish shows very light scuffs in the parkerization, which should be expected on that type of finish.
-I've upgraded to a Wilson Combat beavertail, Wilson Combat match light trigger, and Wilson Combat hammer. The beavertail pictured has since been blued. I also installed Hogue rubber grips and a shock buffer(will throw in extra buffers).
-5 magazines; (4) 8 round magazines(1 original and  3 Chip Mccormick) as well as a 10rd Chip Mccormick, all feed flawlessly.
-I'm including the original grips/parts, a UTG right-handed drop leg holster that has been custom stitched to fit this gun snugly.

Gun=$400
Wilson Combat upgrades=$110
Extra mags=$75
Holster=$20
Total=$605: I'm only asking $550

The entire rifle has less than 20 rounds through it. Had the factory barrel replaced with a Noveske Recon stainless middy 5.56 barrel. I bought the barrel with a headspace-matched Noveske bolt (about $550) for even more accuracy and added a Phantom 5 slot flash hider ($30). Noveske barrels are built to some of the most stringent specs out there. Do a little research if you have never heard of Noveske Rifleworks. The gas block is PINNED to the barrel not only set-screwed. I then added a 13"" VTAC Alpha free float rail (about $200), Spikes nickel boron trigger group with KNS anti-rotation trigger pins (about $100). A Spikes aluminum winter trigger guard, a ERGO grip and a Magpul MOE stock (about $100).
The rifle is just like new condition as it has only been function tested and it is extremely accurate. If you know anything about Noveske barrels then you know what I am talking about. I have almost $2000 in the rifle without gunsmith labor. If someone wants a serious rifle that needs nothing (other than sights/optic) at a great price then this is for them!"

I am looking for something in very good/like new condition. I have a conceal carry license and prefer you do too.

If you have a really nice gun I WILL ADD CASH if the deal is right.

Ammo has been kept in a dry, sealed safe, brand new. I am tired of hoarding it, figured I would let some lucky fellow American enjoy it, as ammo is hard to come by these days. 

In particular looking for quality name brands like Glock, Springfield, Sig, Colt or a Mossberg. I have been leaning toward a 1911 recently. Surprise me.

I am not expecting the worlds nicest gun, I am open to all offers so don't be afraid to ask. 

I am not looking to make a profit or take a loss on my ammo.

Local deals only, if you want to drive to me that's fine. FTF only.

It is a Gen 3 in like new condition.  It has had roughly 500 rounds thru it since purchased in 2008.  I am the original owner and have cleaned and lubed it after every outing. 

I had the Tru Glo Brite Sites installed last December and still have the original sights too.  They are tritium/fiber optic sights that glow in the dark and have terrific visibility.  

Also installed is the NY1 trigger for a tighter yet smoother trigger pull for concealed carry.  I saved the original spring in case one wants to return it to stock condition.  

Comes with box, three 15-rd mags (1 extra over new Glocks), mag loader, manuals, and lock, as well as the Glock armorer's tool to remove the takedown pins.

This has been a great pistol with no failures of any kind.  Reason I am selling is I handled and purchased a Sig P228 as its grip angle fits my wrist better.  Would like to keep all but my safe needs more room.  

Price is $575 OBO.  Not really interested in trades.  Maybe a stainless 357 S&W revolver with 6-inch barrel, but a big maybe.  

Must be 21+, Ohio resident with ID, and legally allowed to own a gun.  CCL preferred.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks."

Comes with box, one 7-rd mag, and manual.

Pistol works in single or double action, and has the typical Sig de-cocking lever.  Pistol is very similar in function and size to a Walther PP, but I had no failures to feed unlike my prior Walther/Interarms PPK, making it a good and reliable CC gun.

This has been a great pistol with no failures of any kind, when I can find ammo for it that is.  Reason I am selling is I prefer my P225 for thin,, single stack concealed carry and can consolidate my pistols to 9mm.  Would like to keep all but my safe needs more room.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths and in either 5.56mm NATO or 6.8mm SPC. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

Barrel is High Pressure tested, and Magnetic Particle inspected, to ensure quality and dependability, and is finished off with an F-marked front sight base, Magpul OE hand guards,  and a pinned and welded A2 flash hider, which brings the barrel out to 16"".

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, these uppers are made for us right here in the USA.

""The FM35 is a red filter for flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.25"" bezel diameter. Produces a smooth beam of red light that will not degrade night vision as white light would. Hunters use the red filter to avoid spooking game during pre-dawn hours - deer see poorly in the red color spectrum. The filter is also useful for close range, non-tactical applications - such as map reading -- as it reduces the intensity of light output. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever keeps the entire unit securely attached to the flashlight.

Fits: All flashlights and WeaponLights with a 1.25"" bezel

Features:

- Fits 1.25"" bezels, including Z2, AZ2, C2, C3, G2Z, G2, 6P, 9P

Unlike a stripped receiver it is not required to be transferred through a Federal Firearms Licensed holder (FFL).
These are high quality 80% lowers made from 7075 t6 aircraft grade aluminium with fully broached magazine wells for perfect dropping al ALL magazines. They are made to 100% military specifications and will work with any Mil Spec Jig although I recommend the ones made for these lowers cause they work very well and come with all of the drill bits need to complete the job as well as detailed instructions. They come with a bead-blasted raw aluminium finish that looks very good as-is or is ready for paint. These are the ONLY 80% receivers on the market that have been given permission by the ATF to have the rear pocket area that the rear take-down inserts into already milled out for you. One of the most troublesome areas to drill out and its already done for you. Now you don't have to worry about the rear take-down pin detent bore being ruined as it is all perfectly milled to spec.
