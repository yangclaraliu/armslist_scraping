It's time to get an AR 15. Either you need your first one, or another one, or one for your brother, or your girlfriend. 

Get the M&P 15 Sport. The holy grail of budget ARs. Skip the cheap carbon fiber crap. Or the other no name cheapos. Research the 15 sport for about 10 minutes I challenge you to find a single negative review of it. Standard A2 front sight, picatinny rail has enough room for a red dot and magnifier if you use the right mounts.

This one is about 4 months old and has 400 rounds through it. Not a single jam or malfunction and that's with budget ammo. Has been cleaned religiously. Dead balls accurate. 

And you can pick and choose your accessories. I can leave it with all the extras and sell it for $675, and then add the pictured ammo as much or as little as you need for $5 a box (total of 480 rounds). Total cost for everything is $800

Or I can strip all the upgrades off and it's yours for $550. It came with one P-mag and the magpul flip up rear sight.

Here's a list of upgrades/extras:

Magpul Slimline forend $40 with MOE Picatinny rail 4"" $10
Authentic FAB defense PTK pointer angled foregrip $30
2 30 round promags $10 each
1 metal 10 round mag (great for sighting in off a lead sled) $10

How It Works: The installation is just a matter of a few minutes and you can do it yourself. Field-strip your handgun and install the Lasermax LMS-2261 Internal Laser sight. With the high-visibility pulsating laser beam you can experience enhanced awareness of muzzle direction. The Internal Guide Rod laser remains functional from dusk till dawn outdoors and 24 hours indoors. The Internal Guide Rod laser for Sig Sauer P226 comes permanently aligned from the factory for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards and it will never budge. You are not required to re-zero your laser sight after changing batteries. The 1911 models provide room for adjustments to accommodate variations in frames from different makers. The internal laser sight is in close proximity to the bore of the handgun and this forms a reliable association between your point of aim and point of impact over all shooting distances. The LaserMax Guide Rod laser sight LMS-2261 is highly preferred if you are aiming at objects in motion. The guide rod laser sight is turned on by pushing the takedown lever in. You may push IN from either side for activation of the laser sight and you need to place the switch pin in the middle position to deactivate it.CLICK HERE TO PURCHASE"

Now there’s a Rossi rifle in the popular .30-30 Win. caliber the Rio Grande is awfully similar to the Marlin 336 (some might even go so far and say it’s a clone). The Rio Grande offers accuracy, performance and practicality for a lifetime of fast, lever-action shooting. Authentic buckhorn sights and a beautiful hardwood finish make this model look like the classic, but the new Rossi design performs like a state-of-the art rifle.

Built this up with the goal of running it in carbine courses and having a solid home defense gun, but decided to sink all my money into my mini-14 (I know, I know...). 

Ships with regular pistol grip and bullet button installed.  Includes hammerhead grip and regular magazine release.

Total weight as assembled: 6lbs, 4.2 oz


Upper Receiver: BCM (Bravo Company)
Barrel: BCM Hammer Forged 14.5"" midlength light weight profile
Muzzle Device: Parallax Gen 2 Paracomp Muzzle Brake, permanently attached
Handguard: Magpul MOE
Bolt Carrier: BCM
Charging Handle: BCM Gunfighter, Mod 4 (medium latch)
Lower: Mega Gator Forged, 7075-T6 
Parts Kit: Daniel Defense 
Buffer: BCM milspec tube, spring and H-buffer
Stock: Magpul MOE Carbine

The goal with this build was to have a rock solid reliable carbine that could be run with a bullet button OR featureless. This started with BCM's amazing midlength upper assembly (google the ""Filthy 14"" 40,000 round torture test), with a Parallax Paracomp muzzle brake permanently attached (by the armorers at Wild Built Tactical in La Mesa) to bring barrel to 16"". Mega Gator lower receiver with a top-of-the-line Daniel Defense parts kit, and BCM buffer assembly. Magpul MOE handguards and carbine stock.

The Paracomp muzzle brake was chosen because it is not only an excellent muzzle device, but because it is designed as a brake, not a flash hider. That means this rifle can be easily transitioned to a featureless build, and even includes a hammerhead grip and regular magazine release. The Magpul MOE carbine stock was also chosen specifically for this purpose, as you can remove the latch mechanism but still operate the telescoping stock with a tool, rather than having to permanently pin it in a fixed location."

Make: Marlin Glenfield

Model: Model 30A 

Serial Number: 20055155

Year of Manufacture: 1973 - 1983 

Caliber: .30-30 Ackley Improved. 

Action Type: Lever Action Rifle, Magazine Tube Fed 

Markings: The left side of the barrel is marked “GLENFIELD MOD. 30A”, “THE MARLIN FIREARMS CO. / NORTH HAVEN, CONN., U.S.A.”, “CAL. 30 – 30 WIN”

Barrel Length: 20” 

Sights / Optics: Nearly new Bushnell scope (Bore Sighted)

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are walnut stained birch with impressed designs and checkering on the pistol grip and forearm. The butt stock has a shallow cut about ½” long on the front right side of the comb. There is a brown Pachmayr buttpad and also a sling swivel. The forearm cap has been fitted with a sling swivel. The LOP measures 14” from the front of the trigger to the rear of the recoil pad. The stocks rate in about Fine overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Blue 

Finish Originality: Original

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the Micro-Groove rifling is sharp. There is no erosion and the barrel crown is unmarked. 

Overall Condition: This rifle retains about 90% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows thinning, brown patina and some bare metal where the bluing has worn through. The area around the rear sight dovetail shows some tool marks. Please see the photos. The markings are clear. Overall, this rifle rates in about Very Good condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. I have fired this weapon 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: Bushnell Scope 71-3946C waterproof 3x-9x40 scope 

Our Assessment: The Marlin Glenfield line of rifles were made to the same standards as the standard Marlin rifles with the exception of wood, and cosmetic appearance. This rifle has a half magazine and impressed decorations and checkering. It is marked on the barrel as a Model 30A, although in Brophy’s book on the history of Marlin, he states that the Model 30 became the 30A when the half magazine was replaced by a full magazine. Perhaps this is a rare transition model or special factory order. In any event, it is a classic deer rifle that you wouldn’t be afraid to carry in the field and is already equipped with sights that are adequate to the range of the cartridge."

Equipped with the GripZone, the XD Mod.2 applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand. Enter the GripZone: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and pistol. Within the GripZone, thereare three distinct features, each engineered for a specific purpose.The GripZone doesn't stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand grip relief and High-Hand beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol's felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you'll want to pick up the new XD Mod.2 Sub-Compact.SPECIFICATIONSCALIBER: 9MMHEIGHT: 4.75"" w/ Compact Mag, 5.5"" w/ X-TensionGRIP WIDTH: 1.19""RECOIL SYSTEM: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSLIDE: Forged Steel, Melonite FinishFRAME: Black PolymerSIGHTS: Fiber Optic Front, Low Profile Combat RearBARREL: 3"" Hammer ForgedMAGAZINES: 1-13 Round Compact, 1-16 w/ X-Tension, Stainless SteelWEIGHT (WITH EMPTY MAGAZINE): 26 ozs. w/ Compact Mag, 27ozs w/ X-TensionLENGTH: 6.25"""

Included with the rifle is it's original box, A2 carry handle, 1 10 round magazine, 2 Magpul gen 3 10/30 magazines, Sightmark adjustable/changeable red dot sight, and 240 rounds of SS109 5.56. 

If you want everything BUT the ammo, I'll let it go for $700.

I'm looking to sell it all for $800 FIRM. Buyer pays all applicable fees. I'm willing to trade it for a Galil, HK93 clone, or possibly a AK-74. PM me for more details.

OVERVIEW:

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

For 2010, our new Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

I have for trade only, a Tapco SKS Receiver Cover Scope Mount with BSA 4x32mm Scope, the Scope Mount has a tunnel through it that you can use to see you're stock sights. It came on my Russian SKS and I DO NOT want it, I'd like a standard receiver cover.

So with that, I'm wanting to trade it for a standard SKS receiver cover, would prefer a Russian as that is what mine is, but it doesn't matter if it's a Norinco or Yugo.

Would also be willing to trade the Stock and Handguard, it's all Tapco T-6 Intrafuse, for a Standard Wood Stock with Wood Handguard for a Blade Bayonet.

If you have any of this and want to trade, sent me a Text REDACTED or Email.

An excellent shooter or case-collectible, this gun is an interesting piece of interwar design and essential to any military or 1911 collection.  I was recently gifted a piece with some definite background, so I'm selling my duplicate Ballester.
Looking for cash, but WILL trade for a matching Nazi-marked Star 9mm. Old stuff gets my attention, so if you want to trade, that's the area! 

EMAIL FOR PICS!  I have plenty, and can only upload several.

An Argentine improvement on the venerable 1911, Argentina produced the Ballester-Molina from the late 30s to the early 50s. I bought this specifically because it dates to 1945, and was a part of my World War collection. 

The Ballester Molina often gets called a 1911 Copy, but it's not internally. The mags, spring, and barrel are all interchangeable however, so there IS some custom options available if that's your bag. Unlike a 1911 or many strict copies, this doesn't bite a bit: the beavertail does its job admirably, you'll like shooting this pistol! It's all original too (except the mag, but you can find old BM or old 1911 mags easily, they fit), it just came to me with the black mag. I don't buy anything for myself that's been refinished/replaced or 'bubba'ed. 

DESCRIPTION
Blueing - Worn. All writing is legible, and the assignment mark (Buenos Aires Capital Police) is crisp and very visible. It clearly shows holster wear, as the blueing is pretty much at <15%, and IS import-marked under the spring housing. 

Grips - 8.5/10 Great shape original Argentinian grips and screws. No aftermarket nonsense. 

Barrel - 8/10 Very accurate, and less 'defined' grooves are indeed typical of BM barrels. Don't worry, she'll hit what you aim at! No rusting, cleans to a mirror. I am not the best or most dedicated bore-photographer, so the photo is as photo does. 

Internals - Everything works. Shot it many times, trigger is pretty nice. All machining is crisp, not too much internal wear. Outside is definitely rougher than the inside!

Open to shipping or face to face, as long as buyer communicative. Also available to meet in DC/MD/VA area, as I frequently travel there for business.

The laser is able to function independently or in concert with the flashlight (and vice versa). It comes with all of the paperwork, etc. that was included new as well as two spare bulbs. 

Attached is a picture of it mounted on my gen 4 G19. The GTL series lights are AWESOME and the styling/ergonomics are the best available for the Glock pistols in my opinion. The reason for the sale is I also have a GTL-10 light (without the laser) that suits my needs perfectly.

The one picture I am demonstrating the three different modes of the light. The top is light only, middle laser only, and bottom light/laser combo (which is hard to see but you should be able to make out the laser at the bottom of the center of the light circle). 

I see these lights going for $225+ on ebay so I figure $175 shipped should get it moved quickly. I am located in Chestnut Hill area and pickup is fine by me!

1 Mag through it. I am military and was stationed in KC area last year, moved to Alexandria in June, it has been a safe queen since since purchased. Great rifle, just looking to see what's out there. It has a bit of safe/moving wear; but nothing extreme. 

Comes stock as it would brand new, FN SCAR mag, Magpul G3 window mag (never fired) and MagPul vert grip. (Sorry no box)

$2200 is the cheapest you can find on Armslist or GB...so looking for $1700 cash, $2k trade value


Not interested in wheel guns or hunting rifles unless the rifle is unique, I can ship, I would rather not, but just a heads up shipping is expensive, you pay for shipping to your FFL.

An excellent shooter or case-collectible, this gun is an interesting piece of interwar design and essential to any military or 1911 collection. I was recently gifted a piece with some definite background, so I'm selling my duplicate Ballester.
Looking for cash, but WILL trade for a matching Nazi-marked Star 9mm. Old stuff gets my attention, so if you want to trade, that's the area! $550 is starting offer otherwise.

EMAIL FOR PICS! I have plenty, and can only upload several.

An Argentine improvement on the venerable 1911, Argentina produced the Ballester-Molina from the late 30s to the early 50s. I bought this specifically because it dates to 1945, and was a part of my World War collection.

The Ballester Molina often gets called a 1911 Copy, but it's not internally. The mags, spring, and barrel are all interchangeable however, so there IS some custom options available if that's your bag. Unlike a 1911 or many strict copies, this doesn't bite a bit: the beavertail does its job admirably, you'll like shooting this pistol! It's all original too (except the mag, but you can find old BM or old 1911 mags easily, they fit), it just came to me with the black mag. I don't buy anything for myself that's been refinished/replaced or 'bubba'ed.

DESCRIPTION
Blueing - Worn. All writing is legible, and the assignment mark (Buenos Aires Capital Police) is crisp and very visible. It clearly shows holster wear, as the blueing is pretty much at <15%, and IS import-marked under the spring housing.

Grips - 8.5/10 Great shape original Argentinian grips and screws. No aftermarket nonsense.

Barrel - 8/10 Very accurate, and less 'defined' grooves are indeed typical of BM barrels. Don't worry, she'll hit what you aim at! No rusting, cleans to a mirror. I am not the best or most dedicated bore-photographer, so the photo is as photo does.

Internals - Everything works. Shot it many times, trigger is pretty nice. All machining is crisp, not too much internal wear. Outside is definitely rougher than the inside!

Open to shipping or face to face, as long as buyer communicative. Also available to meet in certain parts of Connecticut, as I frequently travel there. There are no returns, I have had bad experience with broken returned pieces. Will answer any and all questions though! It is relisted in Connecticut  FYI, so that is *with* my knowledge/intent.

Thanks for looking!"

Fun gun and EXCELLENT at what it does. Firing from the bottom cylinder really does tame .38 SP and even .357. Makes .38 feel like 9mm and .357 Mag feel like .38. Virtually no muzzle flip and dramatically reduced recoil and follow-up shot time. I have enjoyed shooting it over the past few years but I prefer the .44 Magnum. Weird how you gravitate towards certain guns over others.

Pictures coming soon but it's the standard black model with a leather OWB holster included from the factory.

Will include quality defensive rounds and 100 rounds of .38 Special. Can include more if you want.

Virtually no muzzle flip and dramatically reduced recoil and follow-up shot time. I have enjoyed shooting it over the past few years but I prefer the .44 Magnum. Weird how you gravitate towards certain guns over others.

The Rossi tradition of firearm design and manufacturing started with the founding of the company in 1889 by Amadeo Rossi. Over the last 115 years, that tradition has grown along with the company. Over the years, Rossi firearms has led the way in design and engineering. At the same time, it has always been important to produce an affordable product without sacrificing quality or accuracy. In 2008, Rossi was acquired by Taurus and together the two firms work to improve products and create new lines.
The Winchester Model 1892 was a lever action repeating rifle designed by John Browning as a smaller, lighter version of his large-frame Model 1886– which replaced the Model 1873 as the company’s lever-action for smaller dual-purpose rounds such as the 44-40. Cowboys on the frontier found it convenient to carry a rifle and a revolver chambered with the same ammunition. When asked by Winchester to design an improved pistol caliber lever action, John Browning said he would have the prototype completed in under a month– or it would be free. Two weeks later, Browning had a functioning prototype of the Model 92.
The Model 1892 has become an indelible icon of Western mythology through its use in hundreds of motion pictures and television shows. Even though Winchester ended production of the Model 92 in 1938, Rossi continues to manufacture a faithful reproduction of this historic rifle to this day.
