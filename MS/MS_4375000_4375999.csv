9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue grips in black provide maximum grip and a distinctive look."

I want you to be comfortable with the deal so I'll do what I can to minimize your concerns.  Send me offers!  Who knows, you may offer me something I didn't know I wanted!"

216,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4375216,For Sale:  Mystery Ranch BDSB backpack  very large pack,"Jackon, Jackson, Tennessee",$ 300,"Listed On: Thursday, May 28, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here I have an excellent condition Mystery Ranch BDSB that is an amazing Bug out bag. MSRP was $630.  I dont know that it has ever been sweated in.  It has sat in my truck for last 6 months or so. It is one of the best bags you will find by one of the best manufacturers in the industry. Mine even has some extra pieces like the two side pouches and the extra day pack pictured- I would guess these ran another $150.   

Excerpt from a review: 
Product: Mystery Ranch BDSB (Big Dana's Special Blend) backpack
Manufacturer: Mystery Ranch Backpacks (URL: www.mysteryranch.com)
Capacity: 7400 ci (120 l)
Color: Titanium/castor grey (see review regarding other colors that are available) 
MSRP: $630

The BDSB is a top-loading, internal frame expedition backpack designed for use by U.S. Navy SEALs.
MR does a substantial defense business (there's a separate section of its website devoted to military products), and at time, the BDSB was its largest pack and was modified for the SEALs.   
Its main compartment is loaded from the top and has an apron that is cinched at the top with a toggle.  This can either be one very large compartment or separated into two by use of a detachable divider about three-quarters of the way down.  There is a zipper at the bottom for separately loading a sleeping bag or other gear into the lower section.  Compression straps can be used easily to flatten the lower section when it's not needed, to reduce things moving. 
On the back are two large vertical pockets with side zippers running from the top of the pack bag to the top of the lower compartment, for stuff needed in a hurry.  A top section with two zippered compartments (900 ci, 15 l total storage space) serves as the ""lid.""  

Just in case 7400 ci isn't enough space, the BDSB has straps on the each side and at the bottom for attaching extra gear outside the pack.  (My pack has the accessory pockets that are easily attached to the sides.)  There are five daisy chain loops between the vertical pockets in the back and two larger loops just below the. The compression straps allow cinching up loads in the main and sleeping bag compartments for stability.

The BDSB has several features not found on DD packs.  The most useful is the addition of one stretch pocket (made of Spandura, a Spandex-Cordura cross) on each side of the pack.  A radio pocket on the frame inside the main compartment provides a perfect fit for a 100 oz (3 l) Camelbak bladder. 

The pack bag is made of 500d/1000d Cordura, in a special manufacturing run that includes waterproofing inside and out (according to MR's website, a ""polyurethane layer of waterproofing inside, and a outer layer of Teflon HT"").

Bag, buckles and straps are all titanium/castor grey, a color the SEALs selected to reduce contrast and visibility."

If you'd like to know more details I'd be glad to go further in depth with serious buyers. The rifle has seen in the range of 200-300 rounds and is in perfect cosmetic shape.

Creek runs thru the property north to south. There is a small lake for fishing and a camp site (nice but no electric).
This is a new venture so you will be in on the ground floor. We will develop as we go. Rules are simple: obey Georgia Laws (except 3 does per season) and treat the other hunters like you want to be treated. Remember this is going to be FAMILY FRIENDLY.
10 members will be $1000 each. If we decide to go with less hunters, the price goes up accordingly. I am paying full price as well.
Still hunt only, Georgia State rules for now. Plenty of Deer, hogs are starting to show up and a few bear are on the property. Small game and fishing.
Only charging enough to cover lease. Once established, we can decide on food plots, club stands (or not) etc. It will be family friendly. This should go quickly, so dont put off making the contact.
This is really a nice piece of land and will take very little effort to hunt it as is. Any modifications (food plots, club stands etc) would be easy and only add to the quality of the hunting experience. 
If you are interested, please contact me by email and we can set up a time for viewing. I am retired so any day of the week is good for me.

It converts from 22LR to 22 magnum with the change of the cylinder. The cylinder falls to the right side of the revolver when the cylinder pin is pulled forward to release it from the frame. With the cylinder to the side, the cylinder pin actuates an ejector star to eject spent cartridges. The addition of these new features to the Sidewinder has increased the weight of the revolver by only a fraction of an ounce in comparison to the standard .22 Mag. mini, but reloading will be a much faster and simpler process. The first Sidewinders off the line were chambered for .22 Mag. only, but .22 Long Rifle conversion cylinder assemblies followed and now we have the convertible. Other features include a stainless-steel frame, laminated rosewood grips, a bead front sight and a newly developed cylinder shroud."

Contact Governor Hassan’s office and ask her to sign Senate Bill 116 into law-- a constitutional carry bill and is supported by the majority of Granite staters’. Be very respectful and clearly underline the salient points that no legally able NH resident should have to ask the government for permission to exercise their God given constitutional right! Please contact her now even if you have in the past; calls and faxes! Contact her again next week before it is to late and again in the days/weeks leading to this critical vote. Governor Hassan’s vote is the only obstacle remaining to pass constitutional carry. Please do not sit back and only “pray”. Please do not think if you do not take action “your neighbor will”, please take initiative now! Take action, contact her office now and keep contacting her office in the weeks and month to follow and then pray for good measure.
Please call ask politely for her to sign the bill into law and verbalize you are a voter and a vote against this bill is a vote against her and the democratic party! It is much easier to fight for something while you still have the right versus fighting insurmountable odds once those rights have been taken away. If you are from Mass, California, D.C. etc. you would know why I urge you to fight now.  Thank you and please make your views known to Governor Hassan, spread the word urging your friends, family and neighbors to contact her office to pass this bill now and truly be “Live free or die”.

There is no erosion or pitting damage to the forcing cone from shooting hot +P loads and no flame cutting to the underside of the top strap from same. The left hand side of the original grip panel showed a lot of wear which tells me that the officer assigned this revolver was left handed. He/she had the action slicked up and the original grooved service trigger replaced with a smooth target trigger.  I have put a new set of Hogue grips on it. It has a very smooth action and light single action trigger pull.

These have always been on the rare side and are considered to be curiosities or collector's items today. Rumor is they are still made, but brand new examples are very hard to find. This pistol uses a helical 50 round magazine that sits on top of the action. It uses a roller-locked action similar in type to the HK MP5 but it ejects spent brass downwards out of a bottom ejection port. The pistol is surprisingly light weight for its large size and magazine capacity. This is the latest Liberty III generation of this pistol which features the redesigned safety lever and a cutts style compensator. The older pre-ban M950 version has neither of these features.

The pistol uses traditional three dot sights, the rear sight being installed on the magazines. Sight adjustment is performed on the front sight. The pistol is most definitely ""different"" and is completely unlike any other pistol on the market.

Pistol is in like new shape and is fully functional with only minimal handling and storage marks. Included are four (4) 50 round magazines (each magazine by itself is rare and typically sells for $100+ apiece) and the magazine loader tool (itself also rare). Three of the magazines include original Calico cardboard boxes and instructions.

The rifle is in good condition, there are a few scratches on the barrel and still some dust on it from its last range trip that I'm having a hard time getting to. It's chambered in .243 AI which means it fires both regular .243 ammo and .243 AI ammo perfectly and accurately. In fact all I've fired have been regular .243 ammo.

It has about 400 rounds through it and it's easily sub 3/4"" at 100 yards. Some loads performed more closely to 1/4"". I have over 100 rounds loaded up for it using new Winchester Brass and Nosler Custom Competition bullets as well as about 100 pieces of new Winchester Brass. And about 2-300 pieces of once fired (fired only in this gun) brass. Somewhere I also have about 5-600 Hornady 105gr vmax, 1-200 105 gr Nosler Custom Competition and 300 87 gr Hornady vmax bullets. 

The Scope is a Millet TRS-1 4-16x50. It's a great scope, incredibly clear with a Mil Dot (Hash) reticle with both half-Mil and full Mil marks. The bipod is a Harrel's Swivel.

If you're looking for a good long range semi-custom gun this is the one for you. It's easily a 1000 yard gun. There's easily $1400+ worth of gun and accessories here. It's running the 105gr Nosler's at about 3000-3100 fps with factory .243 brass with moderate loads thanks to the long 28"" barrel. This thing will easily keep up with a .300 Win Mag with probably 1/2 the recoil.

Great size to carry!  This is a all stainless steel gun not plastic or polyomer so it has some weight to it which helps absorb the recoil. Comes with everything you see or what you would get from a dealer.  The gun is brand new, never fired.  
I did order what I thought were some more aggressive, attractive grips for it, originals included in mint condition.  These grips have a very aggressive feel to them!  If you don't like the grips and just want the originals, I will sell it with just the original grips for $700

For those of you that don't know Para Ordnance was just purchased by Remington.  Para's used to be hand made in North Carolina and known as a quality gun.  Remington has already started moving the assembly plant to Alabama which I can imagine there goes that quality handmade part I loved so much. Not positive but that's my guess. 

 My guess is since these are the last of the ""real"" Para's these are going to be in high demand in the near future. 

This was one of Para's most popular models, that's why you can find many other models but not this one, and the plant is being moved.

Price is $700.00  with Original wood look grips pictured on the side.  OR   $730  with the new awesome looking grips in my opinion.  These are getting harder to find now especially this size!  I am not a desperate seller.  I don't NEED to sell!  I am also not accepting offers at all! NO TRADES!!!

Please note: In the pictures shown here, the new grips are on the gun.
If this ad is up then it is still for sale.  NO TRADES!

It has a slide length of 6.06 inches with a 3.39-inch barrel length. This makes it only slightly larger than the 13.76-ounce Glock 42, which fires the .380 Auto. Both have slide widths of .87, but the Glock 43’s slide is longer. The Glock 43 is perfect for backup, special assignments, and off duty carry. It’s been rumored that the Glock 43 is fairly comfortable to shoot, even with potent loads. What does this all mean to law enforcement professionals? I have been tracking a five-year trend of marked improvements in the effectiveness of the 9mm duty round. Foremost is the greater consistency across the board in after barrier performance, where bonded bullets prevent jacket/core separation. I am more comfortable carrying a 9mm than I was five years ago."
