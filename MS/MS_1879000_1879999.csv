26,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1879026,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR.

Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."

The Eclipse model has a two-tone appearance making it very nice to look at.  The black is a very matte Kimpro II finish.  The rest is a smooth, almost brushed steel look.  This gun has been detail stripped and thoroughly clean and properly lubed.  The trigger with the C&S reduced sear spring makes the trigger very light, but still very safe.  It breaks nicely and resets beautifully making very accurate and quick follow up shots.  If you want to use this for a defensive gun, put the stock sear spring in..which isn't bad either..i just have a habit of putting in trigger weight reducing parts.  Even if you have bad fundamentals, this trigger press will not cause you to move the gun resulting in surprisingly accurate shooting.

Also, the serial number ends in AAA, which means it was one of the very first guns made after Interarms but before Smith moved operations to Houlton, Maine, so this pistol was made by Ranger Manf. located in Alabama.  Ranger only made 1 blued gun out of 25, all the rest were Stainless.  This is a great conceal carry gun.  The Blueing has just a little holster wear and a little fade, but everything else on the gun is excellent.  Comes with an extra magazine, but sorry no original box or test target."

The Sig Sauer P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as Sig's entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy Seals, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 Sig or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

What is that??? That is the most common thing that my customers say when they see their target for the first time.
Ultimate Targets are made with the highest quality AR500 steel on the market. They are built with care and attention to detail and are built to last for years. Used properly, a target from Ultimate Targets will outlast the shooter. Do you have a concept for a target? I can work with you to make it a reality!
GONGS:
Gongs are made from AR500 and are rated for ammo at 3,000 fps and slower. A stand and all harware to hang it is included. The entire unit disassembles and stores completely flat for super easy storage and transport. Sizes go from 2""- 20""
DUELING TREES:
I offer trees for pistol and rifle ammunition. I also offer trees for .22 rimfire ammunition only as well. The legs and target paddles are removable to make them easy to transport and store. Stakes are also provided to secure it to the ground. The AR500 paddles are 6"" round and 3/8"" thick. 
STATIC IPSC SILHOUETTE & STAND:
Silhouette is AR500 and 3/8"" thick and is also rated for all pistol and rifle ammunition @ 3,000fps or slower. 1/2 scale, 2/3 scale available. Target stands right at 5' tall. The legs remove to make transporting easier. 
ROUND STATIC STANDS
Round static targets are 3/8"" AR500. Sizes go from 4""-12"". The base accepts a standard 2x4 board that you supply. These are very light weight and easily portable. 

These targets will withstand tens of thousands of bullet strikes. If you are building a shooting range, I can help you get the most targets for your budget! I can offer discounts on package deals. I can do custom builds to fit your exact needs. The sky is the limit to what I can build. We can customize a range to your exact specifications and needs! The ONLY way to reach me is by text or call 931-312-912two. DO NOT email through the site from this ad. I never check this account. TEXT MESSAGES ONLY!!!

Every target from ULTIMATE TARGETS is made by American hands! No robots, illegal immigrants or communist mass production junk! Every target I build is made one at a time, with care, to ensure every target is built RIGHT! I guarantee all of my work. I've never had a target returned for any reason. You can buy these with the confidence that you will get a very well built target that will last you a very very long time.

MORE INFO:

http://heavybuffers.com/ar10rifle.html

 Reduces felt recoil and makes the gun operate more smoothly. Many customers use this buffer in .308 ARs to make shooting more comfortable for their spouses and youngsters. Great for use with suppressed weapons. Also popular with those shooting magnum calibers. 
I strongly recommend this buffer if any of the following conditions apply:

•If you will be shooting with a suppressor. (Your gun will still run fine unsuppressed with standard ammunition.)
•If you will be shooting hot handloads or very heavy bullets.
•If you want maximum recoil reduction.


I recommend using ArmaLite AR10 rifle buffer springs with these buffers. OEM springs from other manufacturers or aftermarket springs may cause malfunctions. 'Flat-Wire' springs are not recommended.

It's one of the original Waffen Werks stamped from when they were importing through Tennessee.  Only 78 of these models were produced with the WW stamp and my weapon was procured directly from Keith at Waffen.  Comes with 7 clips (I might have 8, missing one somewhere), the quick loading tool for the clips, Caracal locking case and MFG brochure/manual.  It's a very nice and complete set. It's seen very light duty at the range due to the current scarcity of ammunition.

Look around only and you will see it's almost impossible to find one of the original Caracal imports and when I spoke with the new distributor they said all the original WW stamped were being collected for service, melted down and replaced by a brand new weapon.  Those who wanted to keep the WW stamped edition and just have the existing gun serviced have to wait till September 2013.  When I asked the rep said she'd estimate over 50 WW Fs had been received and melted down so its unclear now many of these are still in existence.  

Now that Caracal has hired JJ Racaza as their spokesman and the new lines are launching later this year with a big marketing push, the collectability (and price) of these ultra rare editions will only increase from here.

Hello,  I have a Springfield range officer 45apc pistol for sale or trade. I just got in trade for another gun and I don't really have much of an interest in keeping it. It has a small blemish on the slide other than that it is in perfect firing condition and shoots wonderfully. Has adjustable sights, box, and everything that came with the gun when it was new. Looking to either sell or trade, it doesn't matter which to me. Only bolt guns I want are .308. I am open to other bolt gun offers, worst I can do is say no. Must have smooth action and good condition barrel.

I put on a knoxx op recoil reducing stock and a 18.5 in barrel. I've kept the regular stock as well as the 22in rifled barrel. These are included, as well as a couple boxes worth of buckshot and birdshot if you want them. 

I've put maybe a thousand rounds through it in the 5 years I've owned it which is why I'm selling it. I just don't take it out as much as I'd like and I figure someone else might use it more.

This model is designed for use with the .22LR round or high-end adult airguns.  Most rimfire rifle scopes have a standard parallax setting of 50 yards.  However this scope has a parallax setting of 100 yards and an adjustable objective lens for greater focus and accuracy at longer ranges.  Other scope features:  Dual-X reticle, 3.6"" eye relief, 11.5"" long, weighs just 12 oz, and most importantly it comes with a lifetime warranty.  

Item #2 selling with the scope is a brand new, in-packaging Burris P.E.P.R. 1"" scope mount.  P.E.P.R. stands for ""Proper-Eye-Position-Ready.""  It's design allows an additional 2"" of eye relief, allowing you to mount your scope as far back as possible on your top rail, which is excellent when rail space is an issue.  This model #410343 has Picatinny AND smooth ring tops, both come in the package.  It is very simple to install and will mount to any flat top, military style rail system and has a lifetime warranty.  

I encourage you to look at the Amazon.com reviews for these products, as both are rated outstanding by current owners.  Current retail price for these items is $235.99 for the scope and $75.99 for the mount.  I am selling these items together for $200.00, which is $125.00 less than current retail+tax.  Prefer face-to-face transaction in the greater Kansas City area, but will ship with a verified PayPal payment and buyer pays the transaction fees and shipping costs.  Local buyer can choose to pay by credit or debit card too as I use PayPal Here on my smartphone.

Used 90% condition British military version of the FN FAL (British military flash suppressor, bayonet lug, inch pattern, etc.). The Right Arm Of The Free World. The FAL has been adopted by and still the main battle rifle of over 70 NATO countries. Bore is bright and shiny, no rust on bore or anywhere on the rifle. Canadian receiver. OD green furniture. Accepts inch and metric FAL mags. Rifle comes with (4) 20rd mags and removable bipod. This is a very nice battle rifle, built before Century made junk. Very accurate, big downrange punch, it has never failed to function, and 20 rounds of .308 is FUN no matter who you are! The only reason I’m selling is to finance another (expensive) multi-firearm purchase and I'm asking less than it's worth so please respect that. This rifle is already banned in CA, so it's sure to be at the top of ""the list"" if a ban happens, IMO, because this is one true military type rifle that can 'take care of business' (BTW I spent most of my life in CA and have personally experienced the violation of an ""assault weapons"" ban so I tell ya folks...a ban CAN happen in the near future. Keep fighting for your 2nd amendment rights or we will lose them!).

Item Description:

The Kobra is a truly unique pistol, and one of Ed Brown's most innovative firearms. Unique with the Kobra series pistols is the innovative and popular snakeskin metal treatment. It is a directional pattern, meaning it is smooth to slide your hand up, but bites in for a snug grip the other way where you need it. It's easier on the hands than checkering. This no-nonsense design has an elegant simplicity that has yet to be matched. The Kobra is an innovative masterpiece, and a serious tool for those who want something a little different. We are sure you'll be charmed by the Kobra!

The Kobra features the following:

5"" Government model slide, single stack government model frame. The John Browning traditional design for the ultimate in reliability and accuracy. Weight: approximately 38 ounces with an unloaded magazine inserted. Exclusive snakeskin treatment on forestrap and mainspring housing. A beautiful, unique, and snag free gripping surface.

Out of stock everywhere, but I have one left!! (Actually, I have one 4.5 inch 9mm, one 4.5 inch .40 caliber and two 3.8 inch 9mm in the XDM family. Look for my other postings if this is not the exact right gun for you!) 

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)®match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots

The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

 All XD pistols include the XD Gear System, which consists of a XD Gear belt holster, XD Gear double magazine pouch, XD Gear magazine loader, two magazines and a cable lock. It's more than a new set of features; it's about raising your expectations of what a polymer pistol should be. It's about creating a new standard in value.

I bought this Browning for my father and we meant to make another trip to South Dakota for him to use it...unfortunately, my dad died unexpectedly 6 weeks ago and we won't be taking that trip.  My mom insisted that I take the gun back and I have decided to sell it and use the funds to replace the sign in the country cemetery where he is buried.  No B-S story here - too sad to keep the gun, and I have plenty already so I would rather pay tribute by showing respect for all those buried in Lone Pine Cemetery near Bancroft, WI by putting up a new sign to replace the old 9-inch by 5-foot one that is falling apart there now.  Call me - take a look at the gun and make me a fair cash offer.  PTP, Photo ID copy, and signed Bill of Sale required.  Phone calls preferred please - thanks.  Kevin  REDACTED"

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory® explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches precision engineering like Springfield Armory. Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)®match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots

The modified contour of the new XD(M)® grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip. The new XD(M)® Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR™ Mag X-Tension™ (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)® is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the .40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.

 All XD pistols include the XD Gear System, which consists of a XD Gear belt holster, XD Gear double magazine pouch, XD Gear magazine loader, two magazines and a cable lock. It's more than a new set of features; it's about raising your expectations of what a polymer pistol should be. It's about creating a new standard in value.

Also included are two turrets, (I swear I had three, If I find the third it will be shipped free of charge to the buyer) three shell plates #1 - 38 Colt S&W 357, #4 - 5.56 223 Remington 222,etc. and #19 - 9mm Luger, 40 S&W, 10mm Auto respectively.

There are a couple small cosmetic blemishes to the paint and two very small ""tool"" marks at 180 deg. from each other where the previous owner used vice-grips or pliers on the top of the indexing rod. This does not affect the function in any way and actually sits inside the center of the turret casting when it is in place. The press operates as it should and is being sold as is, where is. I personally express no warranty or guarantee but Lee has been very prompt with any issues I have had with any of their products and would receive an A+ rating for customer service from me.

It is 'The Sportsman'. The poly choke was built with the gun in 1936...it is not an add on. It is Full, Modified and Improved Cylinder. Wood is great. The bluing has wear but no pitting or rust. A great classical hunting gun. This gun is the clone of the Browning A5. I have more pics to email if you wish. The Remington Model 11 was not made either by or for Browning. It was manufactured by Remington, under designs patented by Browning. The same is true of the 'Browning' Auto-5 produced in Belgium (by Fabrique Nationale) and Japan (by Miroku).

John Moses Browning had licensed exclusive world manufacturing and sales rights, with an arrangement for royalties to be paid to him, for his Automatic Shotgun to F.N. in 1902.

John M. Browning negotiated with F.N. to cede to Remington the U.S. manufacture and sales rights, resulting in the introduction of the Remington Autoloading Shotgun in 1905. The F.N. and Remington guns were practically identical, with many parts being interchangeable.

Prior to America's entry into WWII, when F.N.'s production facilities fell into the hands of the advancing German army, Remington produced a version which was marked ""Browning Arms Company, St. Louis, Missouri"", which remained in limited production until after the liberation and rebuilding of the F.N. facilities following the war."

Made in 1878 and converted to 6.5mm in WW1.  This rifle is in excellent condition considering its age.  The barrel and receiver retain 90+% of bluing while the lower housing is at 60-70%.  The bore is amazing (sorry, couldn't get a clear picture).  There are NO import marks on this rifle.

I have not fired this rifle but it appears to be 100% in working order with an excellent trigger, strong mainspring, and all around nice action.  The cleaning rod is slightly bent and doesn't always want to screw in on the first try.

PLEASE NOTE: Firing this rifle with modern, full strength ammunition is NOT reccommended. With other rifles of this type there have been instances of gas and particles being blown back into the face of the shooter when using full strength ammo.  Other owners have reported that these rifles function just fine with reduced-load rounds so I suggest that if you do want to shoot this rifle, you have a reloader remove some of the powder from modern 6.5 Carcano ammo (Hornaday, PRVI, etc.)

This rifle is an antique so it may be shipped directly to the buyer. Shipping charges will be extra and determined after purchase. DEAR SCAMMERS: DON'T BOTHER. I WILL NOT BE SENDING YOU OR ANYONE ELSE MONEY FROM AN OVERPAYMENT!
