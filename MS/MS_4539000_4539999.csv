It is in pristine , mint condition and has only been shot, maybe, 14 times, if that. It doesnt have one scratch on it..like new. It comes with original box, manual and one magazine. The only reason that i'm selling it is that I just dont carry it or shoot it...although it is an awesome carry piece. Spare mags for this gun are very reasonable and readily available, I just never got around to getting one since I never carried it. It is a light little .380 and the few times that I shot it I noticed that it was extremely accurate at reasonable combat distances (15 to 20 yards). If you have your carry permit and are looking for a really great little pistol to carry ....or just like Sigs dont miss this one! It was thoroughly cleaned (inside and out) and put away in my safe in the original box. I am pretty firm on the price. In this condition this Sig is well worth the asking price.  Thanks for looking."

I have been assigned to a new duty station and need to free up some space. I have not put one round downrange on any of the components and everything is factory new. This is one of the most badass firearms I have owned and hate to see it go. The major upgrades include:

1. Custom Gun Rails

2. Geissele Tavor Super Sabra Trigger...a custom trigger that offers a crisp break and reduced pull. Also an aluminum housing which is an upgrade over the stock plastic

3. Magpul AFG-2 Angled Foregrip and Polymer Rail

4. Gear Head Works Custom Tavor Modular Forearm, FLEx Swivel, and Razorback Rail

5. Elzetta Tactical B335 Light integrated into the forearm with pressure switch

6. Leupold Mark 4 HAMR. The HAMR is a tough as nails optic designed for close to medium range engagements. It is made of 6061-T6 aircraft grade aluminum and built like a Battleship. I chose the duel optic version, which features a 4x24mm magnified optic with a top mounted DeltaPoint 1x optic designed for fast acquisition of closer targets. To switch from magnified to non-magnified, simply raise the cheek weld slightly and the cage protected, DeltaPoint triangle reticle comes into view.

This is a pretty crazy package and as stated above, everything is brand new. What you see in the pictures is what you get minus the PMAG. All of the original parts are included in the case. Not looking for trades and no lowball offers. Feel free to ask questions or request specific photos.

Thank you for looking.

This company has been in business for over 130 years and is one of the largest suppliers of NATO when it comes to small arms

I bought this a year ago and barely used it ( not even broke in yet ) perhaps 50 rounds down the pipe ( chrome barrel )
no failures of any kind using ( junk ) Tula ammo , highly impressive accuracy even with subpar ammo ...

I know I brag this up a lot you you must be wondering why I want to sell it or trade it ...
well its simple I just do not use it as I also have the Sar B6p compact that is use as my every day carry
( 2500 rounds through it not 1 failure with the same junk ammo ) so they are a very reliable handgun but also very hard to find

CZ75 like but IMO better build quality , take it apart and see for yourself ...

Polymire frame with all chromed steel components 17+1 capacity

will trade for ? ( must have a hammer and be small in size ) Astra A70 + cash ? or maybe a Star Firestar M43 and a little cash ?

or maybe you have something else in mind , let me know

-Original polymer buttstock and forend with action bars. ($65)

I also have a rare knoxx copstock recoil reducing folder. These recoil reducing stocks cut felt recoil in half. This model of stock was made before blackhawk took over. 
Unlike current production ""specops"" folding stocks this one was made specifically for the M500A. 
Most importantly it was designed specifically as a folder. I bought this stock because the new specops stocks are ugly and cumbersome, as the folding hinge creates a gap and extra long protrusion from the rear of the receiver. According to blackhawk the new folding stocks are built this way to reduce production costs by increasing parts commonality between the folder and telescoping fixed stock.

This rifle shoots almost as well as my GAP bolt gun. It's been a consistent 1/2 moa rifle and when the weather conditions are good it will shoot 1/4MOA. I have shot both 168gr and 175gr from this rifle with equal success, it's not a picky eater. I attached a few pics of targets to show off the rifles capabilities. The 1.8-10x US Optics scope makes this rifle the perfect DMR rifle. I have taken this rifle, with current optics setup, to 1165yds with success. Ringing steel at 1k is boringly easy with the rifle. Purchaser will be provided with reload data for the rifle as well.

Here's your chance to own the single best semi automatic .308 platform in the world, bar none. I know we're all fans of GAP 10's and JP's on this forum (including myself) but I would have a shootout with any of those top manufacturers using this rifle and not feel the least bit intimidated. This rifle is the real deal.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns ... lemme know and i'll fill in any blanks you might have. More pics available upon request. For fastest contact feel free to give me a call or a text at my cell, though I will try and login frequently to check my inbox. REDACTED"

Essenital Arms J-15 lower. E.A. closed up shop in louisiana in 93, the last of their lowers was sold to DPMS I believe, this one with the E.A. indicates such, but because of its low serial number indicates it was made and sold before the 94' ban took place.

In some states such as New York and Connecticut these lowers are sought after highly, just a lower itself from a gun shop charges 800-1000 dollars. On the gun market in such states they generally go for 700ish give or take. This one comes complete with telescoping rifle buttstock.

It's only been shot from what he had told me no more than 300 rounds have went through cleaned bi-Daily by the both of us since having.  I have shot no rounds out of it as I'm more of just a collector who likes to maintain its up-keep.  The gun does need some minor polishing if you are about having a perfect looking firearm.  Nothing is loose nor does anything need any working.  Everything is still in tip top shape.  Included with this will be a case (not the original smith and Wesson case) a genuine leather pocket holster, and 52 .38 rounds I'm asking $300 which I believe to be a very very fair price.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with."

I have a very nicely maintained Ruger Sr-762. I love this gun, but I want to move in the direction of a big bore AR-15 instead. There is only one thing that could even be construed as a con on this gun, it's got a homemade camo job on it. Outside that it's completely awesome. For a full-price offer I will throw in a gen 1 night scope, 8 p-mags, and a nice set of reloading dies as well.

Currently doesn't have a buttstock (has buffer tube, just no stock), I will either adjust price accordingly or provide one with a full price offer. This IS a standard milspec buttstock, just about anything fits on it."

This company has been in business for over 130 years and is one of the largest suppliers of NATO when it comes to small arms

I bought this a year ago and barely used it ( not even broke in yet ) perhaps 50 rounds down the pipe ( chrome barrel )
no failures of any kind using ( junk ) Tula ammo , highly impressive accuracy even with subpar ammo ...

I know I brag this up a lot you you must be wondering why I want to sell it or trade it ...
well its simple I just do not use it as I also have the Sar B6p compact that is use as my every day carry
( 2500 rounds through it not 1 failure with the same junk ammo ) so they are a very reliable handgun but also very hard to find

CZ75 like but IMO better build quality , take it apart and see for yourself ...

Polymire frame with all chromed steel components 17+1 capacity

will trade for ? ( must have a hammer and be small in size ) Astra A70  or maybe a Star Firestar M43 maybe a Bersa Thunder 9 ?

Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it. The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/xd-s-3-3-45-acp/#sthash.RaDc07DE.dpuf Caliber: 45ACPRecoil System: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide RodSights: Fiber Optic Front & Dovetail Rear (Steel)Weight: (with Empty Magazine)21.5 ozs.Height: 4.4"" w/ Compact Mag, 5"" w/ Mid-Mag X-Tension™Slide: Forged Steel, Melonite® FinishBarrel: 3.3"" Hammer Forged, Steel, Melonite® / 1:16 TwistLength: 6.3""Grip Width: .9""Frame: Black PolymerMagazines: 1 - 5 Round Flush Fitting, 1 - 6 Round With Mid-Mag X-Tension™, Stainless Steel Factory New $450 plus tax        We accept VISA and MASTERCARD"

The gun was shot only once during which I put around 60 shells of varying size and weight through. It handled everything I gave it from 2/34 target load to 3"" 00 LE buckshot with ease. The shotgun is comfortable, easy to takedown and clean and looks pretty cool. I am moving to competition shooting and have no need for this shotgun anymore so I would like someone to get it and actually get some use out of it. Again, the shotgun is practically new. Would be willing to make some kind of trade happen if someone has a stoeger m3000 that they don't want plus some cash but otherwise I am open to ideas or just a straight buy.

This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

Lee Perfect Powder Measure is best for reloading rifle cases, can also be used for pistol cases.

Best for reloading rifle cases.
Throws charges from 2 to over 100 grains. Eliminates Cut Powder and Jerky Action. A soft elastomer wiper strikes off the metering chamber rather than cut the powder. You'll be surprised at how smoothly the rotor operates. More importantly, you will enjoy the most uniform of charges.

Meaningful Calibration 
A micrometer adjuster that reads directly in cubic centimeters. Just multiply the charge in grains by the cc for one grain and you have the setting. So very much better than a meaningless setting as most supply.

Versatile
The metering chamber is the proper size for large rifle charges and the strike off opening small enough to work well with pistol size charges. The Lee Perfect Powder Measure works fine for charges from two grains to over 100 grains."

The Easy Jig™ is a patented device that makes machining your 80%arms lower easier, faster, and safer. Lowers finished with the Easy Jig™ have a better finish and hold tolerances that could not be achieved using any other jig on the market today. You do not need to own a drill press or mill to use the Easy Jig™.  It truly makes finishing your lower a monkey simple process. On top of all this, it’s extremely durable and can be reused for dozens of lowers.

Easy Jig™ highlights:

EasierBuilt in drill/end-mill depth gauge for the trigger and rear-shelf pockets (patent pending)Eliminates the need for expensive measurement toolsQuick verification of depth setting – eliminates slippage issues that can ruin partsEliminates constant measuring to determine depth while millingSaferEnd-mill downward force can’t separate the drill press taper chuckIt is safer to move router by hand than to move the jig around on a drill pressUses Common Hand Tools
The Easy Jig™ is designed to hold tolerances using a common hand-drillNo drill press is required, milling is done with a routerRouters are much more portable than a drill press, easily borrowed from a friendRouters are made for cutting pockets using a templateRouters are cheaper than a drill press (about 75% less expensive).Pocket drilling requires 10 holes drilled once – Traditional jigs require 42 holes to be drilled once, precisely aligned and clamped, then re-drilled to a larger diameterTrigger pocket can be cut in 6 to 11 passes vs 25 passes required with a drill pressRouter cuts pockets 5-6x fasterHand-drilling the trigger group/safety selector holes is faster to setupLower can be completed in 1 hour (instead of 3 hours for the old drill press method)DurableThe Easy Jig™ can be used to make dozens of lowersComponents are Type III hard anodized for extra wear resistance

Also include is a lightly used Rigid (not Porter) 1.5 hp compact router with original box in perfect working order.

these two products work perfectly on 80%arms billet lowers. Get both for half the price of buying them new.

At the moment I've got five old military guns I'm looking to trade.

Starting from left to right, the first is a non-refurbed M44 Mosin. It's a 44 izshevsk in its original mid-war stock. The bolt and magazine floorplate do not match. It has an excellent bore, not counterbored

Second is a Type 99 Arisaka series 35 Toyo Kogyo arsenal. All numbers appear to match. The bore is dark with some light spotting, but I'm sure it would clean up nice. 

Third is an RC K98 manufactured 1935 by Mauser AG Oberndorf. Bore on this one is excellent and it's a great shooter. Receiver/barrel/stock all match, everything else is mismatched. (trade pending)

Fourth is a Finnish Capture 1938 Tula Mosin Nagant. All #s appear to match, with the bolt being force matched by the finns. Good bore and great shooter. This one almost rivals my 44 PU sniper with match ammo.

Fifth rifle is a Chinese type 24/Chiang Kai-shek rifle. I can only seem to find serials on the barrel, bolt, and floorplate. The floorplate is force matched to the barrel but the bolt does not match. The bore is pretty terrible on this one
