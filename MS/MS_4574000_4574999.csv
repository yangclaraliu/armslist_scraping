I consistently have the best selection of older guns If you BUY IT NOW you must still contact us for details buy it now doesn't end the sale, it just sends an email telling us you want to buy this gun. A phone call won’t secure a sale! Not home many times, the first buyer by email buys the gun ! Sometimes not home to get calls. Some guns are required shipment to a gun dealer near you for a transfer to you when it arrives. I don’t have a store, and sell on the internet only."

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 5.56x45mm, and feature rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All muzzles are threaded in 1/2 x 28. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy.The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system. The New A-PEG grip also comes standard. This grip was designed to be ambidextrous and places the hand in the corrected position for precision shooting.Specifications:Caliber: 5.56 x 45 mm NATOBarrel Lengths: 14.5”,16.1”,18"",and 20""Rifling Twist Rate: 1/8Barrel Life: 10,000 (approx)Gas System: Direct Impingement with LaRue PST™ port selectorTrigger: LaRue MBTAbout LaRue Firearm Accuracy:LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results.PredatOBR is a registered trademark."

Includes rings scope rail and muzzle brake. As pictured.

I am the second owner of this rifle the fellow who had it before me put the rail and brake on it. I was told it only had 3 boxes of ammo through it, but I have no way of verifying that. The bore looks to be excellent. I think that the stock was also modified above the pistol grip to give it a lower thumb position. I think it was also painted black. I have shot the rifle and can tell you it is incredibly accurate. The muzzle brake ($140?) is worth every penny as the gun has only slight recoil for a quick on target second shot. There are only a few minor signs of handling. Nothing major at all. The scope rail has had a couple of the front ribs ground off and I don't know why. But I was able to mount my Leupold on it with no problem. No scope is included but the new Ruger rings are with it if you prefer to use them. It has the original Ruger 28"" heavy barrel, matte stainless finish. hinged floor plate, no sights, three-position safety, and matching Ruger scope rings. The muzzle brake is a clamp on not a screw on and can easily be removed if desired."

374,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4574374,"For Sale/Trade:  16"" mid-length 223 wylde AR-15, FDE furniture","Cedar Falls, Waterloo, Iowa","$ 1,075","Listed On: Wednesday, September 9, 2015",Rifles,Palmetto State Armory                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is for the complete AR-15 rifle pictured.

This rifle has a PSA mil-spec upper, lower, and bolt carrier group.  Upper receiver has been accurized by having the surface that mates with the barrel extension trued.  Action has been tuned using a high speed camera to select buffer weight and action spring.  No bolt bounce at all.  Action runs like corn through a goose.

Here's some bullet points on the barrel:
• 16"" barrel with heavy tapered profile (34 oz barrel)
• chambered in 223 wylde (5.56 NATO or 223 remington)
• mid-length gas port
• 1:8 twist 5R rifling
• 1/2x28 pitch threaded barrel
• .085"" gas port
• 4150 CMV steel construction
• 4140 CMV steel extension w/ polished M4 feed ramps
• QPQ finish inside and out

For those unfamiliar QPQ finish adds longer barrel life than chrome-lining, is more corrosion resistant, and since it is a salt-bath treatment rather than a lining it doesn't degrade accuracy by affecting the dimensions like chrome lining does.

Furniture consists of a Magpul CTR buttstock, Strike Industries pistol grip (the one that looks like a 'murican flag), and Custom carbon fiber free floating hand guard all finished in FDE.

The stock features a limbsaver buttpad which gives the stock just enough length to keep the sumbitch from pulling out facial hair.  It also takes a gun that barely had any recoil to begin with and makes it a child soldier's dream.

The carbon fiber handguard was cerakoted by Controlled Chaos Arms in magpul FDE and is built using AP Customs hardware.  Cerakote is both to improve the look but also to protect the carbon fiber from any cleaners that might damage the resin.  Needless to say this handguard is extremely light.  It also has the advantage of using a normal mil spec barrel nut and features an AP customs QD sling socket on the left side.  Very cool one-of-a-kind handguard.

Other parts include YHM front sight block, Magpul rear MBUS sight in FDE, polished Milspec fire control group.  Muzzle device is a beat up cavcomp taken off an older rifle but it keeps her shooting flat.  All other parts have fired just 80 rounds to tune the action and ensure reliability.  This is a thoughtfully assembled rifle intended to meet or exceed the accuracy and reliability required for any role an AR-15 might be used in.  Rifle was originally intended for a good friend but he's moving someplace where awesome guns aren't welcome.  His disarmament is your gain."

Springfield Armory PB9108LP 1911 Mil-Spec 45 ACP 5"" 7+1 Cocobolo Grip Parkerized

The 1911 Mil-Spec is built on a full-size frame and slide with a match
grade, stainless steel 5"" barrel. The slide features rear slanted
serrations. The mainspring housing is the original arched style found on GI
issue 1911-A1s, but it includes the Springfield Armory I.L.S. The pistol
also has a standard spur hammer and standard grip safety. The single-sided,
non-extended thumb safety and short military combat trigger are true to the
original 1911-A1 design. The combat 3-Dot sights are fixed, and the
ejection port is lowered and flared. Each Mil-Spec comes with a beautiful
pair of cross-cannon emblazoned Cocobolo grips that are held in place with
slotted grip screws.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe SR-25E2 APC is the latest evolution of the dual role 7.62mm NATO Carbine. The APC is equally adept at putting rounds on target past 800 meters or rapid multishot engagement at close range, with a barrel and bolt life to support the training regimen necessary to master these skills. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offers the lefthanded user the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15 based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternate methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The Drop-In 2-Stage Trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range.

The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel.  The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier.  Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX 4 keymod handguard, 10.75 inches in length.  The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster.  The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections.  One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle.  The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods.An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case.*NFA rules apply, must ship to an FFL dealer with an SOT.Included:  Knight's Armament SR-15 E3 CQB Rifle (7) Keymod rail panels, black GI aluminum 30 round magazine with Knight's Armament follower (where legal) 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section Knight's Armament logoed padded hard case (2) KAC QD sling swivels Magwell block with lock Owner's manual   Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: KNIGHT'S ARMAMENT SR-15 E3 CQB MOD 2 GUN, 11.5"""

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comKNIGHT'S ARMAMENT SR-15 E3 SBR MOD2, 14.5""The Knight's Armament SR-15 IWS E3 Mod 2 SBR may be based on the Eugene Stoner designed operating system but the similarities nearly end there.Features include a 14.5 inch chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel that is manufactured to military specifications.  Attached to the muzzle is the Knight's Armament 3 prong flash hider.  New on the Mod 2 is a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil.  The gas block no longer uses taper pins or set screws but is held on by a castle nut which allows for an air tight seal.  Keeping with the air tight theme, the unique gas tube uses a compression fitting where it meets the gas block.  This is very similar to what is used in automotive hydraulic brake lines.  With these two features you won't have to worry about gas system leakage which can cause malfunctions, especially with lower powered ammo.  On the opposite end of the barrel is Knight's Armament's proven E3 round-lug bolt which both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. The bolt is desigend to outlive the barrel.  The E3 bolt rides in a full auto carrier.  Surrounding the barrel is Knight's new URX 4 keymod handguard, 13 inches in length.  The extended length handguard allows for a forward grip which makes moving from target to target much faster.  The keymod handguard will accept all standard keymod accessories such as hand stops, rail covers, light mounts or picatinny rail sections.  One 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section is supplied with the rifle.  The URX 4 handguard design increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods.An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case.*NFA rules apply, must ship to an FFL dealer with an SOT.Included:  Knight's Armament SR-15 E3 14.5"" SBR Rifle (7) Keymod rail panels, black GI aluminum 30 round magazine with Knight's Armament follower (where legal) 5 slot picatinny keymod rail section Knight's Armament logoed padded hard case (2) KAC QD sling swivels Magwell block with lock Owner's manual  Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: KNIGHT'S ARMAMENT SR-15 E3 SBR MOD 2 GUN, 14.5"""

Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.

Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.

The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand."

I bought this pistol last year and upgraded a number of parts in order to make the gun more reliable from the standard MIM parts Colt is using now. I would estimate the pistol has around 700-900 rounds down the pipe which is nothing and is around 85-90% in finish quality. The pistol also has Novak sights installed (front dot, blank rear) with a .120mm wide notch rear. I am selling this gun to raise some funds to buy other toys, the gun has been 100% reliable and more accurate than I am. I have carried it in the woods and been to the range with it so there is some wear on the finish as mentioned above but its nothing bad. I will take any additional photos if requested and I will ship to an FFL but the buyer will have to cover the fees associated with shipping.

I have for sale, a used RCBS Partner reloading package for sale. This is a great beginner press, if you are unsure if you really want to get into reloading or not, or if you just want to reload one or 2 calibers, especially pistol cartridges. Doesn't have the power of their full size presses, but it doesn't have the price tag either! Comes with the press, which does have some rust in spots, especially on the handle, but it is complete with the primer catch tray and both primer seating punches. An MTM powder funnel set. A universal loading block. An RCBS Case lube pad, and a partial bottle of lube for use when you are resizing with standard steel dies. All told, if you were to buy all this stuff new, you would have over $140.00 invested depending on where you buy the items. I will sell the package, shipped to your door, for $75.00."

The action is buttery smooth, the trigger has zero creep and breaks like glass at around 3.5 lbs, and the 6-24x44 Hi Lux brings the target super close. I shoot 1 MOA all day with BH 55 grain and Sub MOA with 69 grain match ammo. There's nothing like ringing 10"" steel everytime at 300 yards and this bad boy always makes it happen. I unfortunately have to sell to buy a car for my wife. Lower is a billet Shadow Ops Weaponry multi-cal and the rail is a Trinity Force- not super fancy but does the job great and is very solid. Rings are Nikon P series and the other furniture is Magpul. Barrel is a 20"" CHF straight fluted Bear Creek with rifle length gas and a Jerry Miculek brake. I am looking for $600 OBO and can throw in a steel bipod and a soft case for that price as well. Thanks for taking a look.

Did you know that you can have this weapon fully loaded with a 100 round drum magazine, resting on the passenger seat of your car LEGALLY?

Are you familiar with the difference in lethality between a rifle cartridge and a pistol cartridge?

If not, let me start by saying that only about 1 in 13 people actually DIE when shot with a pistol caliber weapon. And that death, if you're lucky enough for it to happen, is most commonly the result of a long term ""bleed-out"" rather than the result of the instantaneous death associated with the concussive trauma that a rifle cartridge causes.

The reason for this is that pistol cartridges don't offer the sufficient velocity to kill a threat reliably. Weapon platforms that utilize pistol cartridges are known as ""secondary weapons"" by the military -- but are more commonly known as ""side arms"" by the general public. 

The reason that guns which support pistol cartridges are known as ""secondary weapons"" is due to the fact that they were never intended as a primary means of killing a threat. They were invented, solely and only, as a means to (when a solider is separated from his/her primary weapon) fight your way BACK to your primary weapon platform. THAT is the main reason why secondary weapons exist at all.

So when you consider the size, the weight, and the classification of an AR Pistol, you are dealing with a weapon system that is by FAR more accurate and deadly than ANY other ""pistol caliber"" platform can EVER hope to provide. 

It is for that reason that you should consider this high-level, customized, and barely used AR15 Pistol platform. This is unequivocally the most deadly weapon on earth that you as an american can carry on your person or fully-loaded, chambered, and in your car due to it's classification as a pistol and not a rifle. 

However, I hope you realized that this gun, while classified as a pistol, accurately fires a rifle caliber projectile which, due to it's velocity, offers up FAR greater lethality than ANY pistol on the market (revolver or otherwise) can hope to match.

Send a PM for all of the custom parts included in this package.

I took this to the range, cleaned after every shooting. It shoots dead center so you dont have to compromise accuracy with conceal-ability.

With that said, im throwing in an inside the waist band conceal holster, and a fobus holster specifically designed for the PO7.

The kit comes with two 15 round magazines, adjustable grips, cleaning rods, and magazine extenders. 

Go ahead and google top 10 9mm pistols, cz will most likely be number 1.

The pistol has a safety lever that can be switched out with a decocker. I personally keep it cocked and locked when i carry. Lastly, I have replaced the sights with tritium night sights. They gather sunlight and illuminate when you aim somewhere dim!

My loss is your gain!"
