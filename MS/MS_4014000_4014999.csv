Tell me what you have , I'm looking to invest $100 or so in a few to test , shoot enjoy, text to REDACTED tell me what you have brand model caliber, picture would help. I'm also interested in ammo boxed, full or part boxes. Even in bags . I prefer pistols but would consider rifles and shotguns on the $100 price range , all depends on what you have. Thanks for looking."

Own a piece of Specials Operations and Navy SEALS history.  Originally developed for US SOCOM, this is one of the very first 1997 civilian production Mark 23 in fired but amazing shape.  It has a KH date code and two ""io"" mags (see link below).  This piece came out within the first year or two they were available for civilian purchase.  It was fired a few times and put in a safe.  It has the glossy or maritime finish as some call it and the original camo case and 2 magazines from a 1997 production run.  Serious buyers only, I can send better pics upon request.   See link below about date codes and other specifics of an early model like this.  

$2100 obo, would possibly trade for a high end 1911 or original parts ak or another collectors piece.  Would also trade for multiple pistols, rifles, or ak47 lf equal value.  Make me an offer.

I only shot 7 rounds out of it. I originally bought it with the intent of making it my everyday carry gun but it is so nice that I kept it in my safe. It has been my ""safe queen"" for a year or so. It is intended for carry, thus the completely rounded edges. There isnt a sharp edge on this pistol. Completely melted! It came with two 8 round mags and I purchased two of the Sig extended mags that hold 10 rounds. So this pistol comes with 4 magazines. It also has a Siglite night sight on the front and a white vertical bar on the back sight & it is very easy to see in dim light. This Sig is practically a new pistol. It is put together in the Sig custom shop and has the custom shop logo on one side of the slide. If you've ever wanted a Sig custom shop piece, this is a PERFECT specimen. It is a great shooter and has the DAK trigger, which is much like a Glock trigger pull. I think Sig calls it the ""Double Action Kellerman"" trigger. It has a short reset too, which makes it very fast on double taps. The 2 ten round mags have an extended plastic piece on the bottom for your fingers to grasp. It also comes with a set of Hogue rubber grips. I have only actually shot with one of the magazines so the other 3 are completely unused pieces. Im not really wanting a trade on it but I might consider a partial trade with some cash included. Thanks for looking and message me if you have any ?'s. God bless :)"

I am selling two items for the 10/22 22LR rifle: a wood stock for the 10/22 rifle and a standard sized (carbine) barrel for the 10/22.

The wood stock has been modified with sling studs so that it will accept most rifle slings. This is ideal for Appleseed shoots. There is minor discoloration near the fore-end stud. This can be easily re-finished. Other than that, the stock is fairly new and in good condition.

The standard barrel is the stock 10/22 barrel that came with the rifle when first purchased. It includes the rear and front sights. The barrel has only been used with less than 100 rounds and cleaned prior to dis-assembly. The fore end of the barrel has minor aesthetic chipping that does not affect performance or accuracy. (note: standard barrel NOT bull barrel).  $60

The barrel will fit into the wood stock and other stocks designed to fit a standard 10/22 barrel. I am also throwing in a 1 inch width super sling. $60

$60 for the stock and sling, $60 for the barrel. $100 for all items.

Please, serious buyers only.

Thanks,"

It has never been scrubbed or sanded in any way and still retains that perfect patina.  The cartouche is still visible and under a magnifying glass it reads 1882.  The circle P cartouche is visible and legible under the wrist.  

This rifle has an amazing history to it.  It was owned by a famous civil war vet.  Obviously this is not a civil war rifle, but it was used on the American frontier.  I can fill you in on the history of it.  I received this rifle from the great grandson of the civil war vet that owned this rifle.

Excellent overall condition as can be seen in the pictures and functions and shoots great! I just installed all new Wolfe springs in it. I took it out yesterday and shot 50 rounds of 230 ball amm through it and it was flawless and held a 2"" group at 15 yards without a bench rest. Included are 3 original factory Colt magazines and a nice Colt carrying case (not original). I bought a new Colt Series 80 that has a long trigger and flat MSH that fits my hands better so, I am selling this one. If this one doesnt sell, I'll just switch out the tyrigger and MSH nad keep it. Id rather pass it along to someone that wants a nice vintage Series 70. I am asking $1000.00 for this Colt but will consider some trades or partial trades for certain .45acp and 9mm handguns as listed below. I am not interested in rifles/shotguns/or junk.  Thanks!

I have all the original turrets and caps as well as the Tasco instruction sheet.
The scope base is marked Leupold; I suspect the rings are likewise Leupold.

Condition is 97% or better. When I drag it out of the safe I'll give it a careful review. It really is a beautiful example of the good M700's back before they screwed with the triggers.

It has the checkered stock. Jeweled bolt. Gloss blue metal. A-series serial number, PO barrel code which I think is June 0f 1977. I've owned it since around 1992.

You can have some reloads for the brass and a set of dies if you'd like.

I also have the factory Remington owner's manual. 

You must be 18 or older, produce a CHL or TDL, be a legal owner, non-felon, and sign a Bill of Sale that I will provide.

Price is firm. If I receive no ‘I want it’ responses, then clearly I will need to lower the price if I want to sell it. I will do so if necessary. And if you see this listing, the gun is still available.

I will ship at my cost.

And folks, if you don't have the money and or need to ask your spouse, for the love of all that is holy, be adult enough to repress the urge to say ""I'll take it""; you'll save us both a lot of time as you dance out of your commitment for the next week. 
I am really easy to deal with if you honor your commitment. But over the last month, far too many of you guys have said ""I want it - please hold it for me until Saturday""...and I've done that, only to be told Saturday that a) your wife is unhappy, b) your daughter is in the Emergency room, c) your car engine blew up, d) well ""something came up"".

So here's the deal: If you commit, then call me Saturday morning with some weasley excuse because you don't want to drive from Katy, then I'm going to add your phone number, email and name to the top of this listing.

Prices change depending on the color you want. Black and coyote brown are the basic price. Any other solid colors raise the price by $5.00, camo patterns raise the price by $12.00 and kryptek patterns raise the price by $15.00. This is due to higher material cost. **There are a few other factors that may change the price that we can discuss when you tell me the options you would like.**

Email me with the details on the holster you would like, along with the make and model of your gun. I can send you a color list. We can then figure out the price and what holster will work best for you. If you are local to Columbia City and are able to pick it up, cash payment is best. Shipping can be arranged at your expense with payment through Paypal."

The finish was a limited edition they did in 2011 called Aqua Terra. It's has been flawless and makes cleaning a breeze. as you'll see in the pictures, even on the barrel where all Glocks get worn, the finish is just slightly rubbed. 

Slide has the correct height supressor sights so that you can co witness the irons and red dot (I believe this is a necessity having shot RMR handgund that didn't have this). 

The barrel was made by the same company and if what I'm told is true, is a rebranded Storm Lake. I can say for sure that it is much more accurate than a stock Glock Barrel. 

The trijicon RMR is not included and you'll have to get one elsewhere. I will include the correct length screws because the ones they come with are too long and will make the slide malfunction. 

I'd rather not sell the barrel because I want it for another project but I will sell it as a package. I WILL NOT SELL THE BARREL SEPERATELY. It will either be sold with the slide or I will keep it. 
I have an IWB Dale Fricke Holster designed to fit and protect the RMR that I'll inlcude for an additional $50 or for free if you buy the slide and barrel.

Light crisp trigger, tactical stock, Mueller 4 - 25 x 44 Mil-Dot scope. As shown with bi-pod and sling.   The 6.5 140 grain bullet pushes at just over 2700 fps.  Very flat shooting.  Sighted in at 300 yards it is 4"" high at 100 yards and 2"" high at 200 yards.  6.5 x 55 is well know for its accuracy and power, it is just more popular in Scandinavian countries than here in the U.S.  Has more knock down power than a .308 at longer ranges.  The tubular Savage Axis action does not flex as much as the model 10 action and is a lot less expensive.
