The Sabre was made here in Nashville but they are no longer in production, thus making this a very scarce rifle these days, especially in this condition.

Koftgari is a technique of hand-inlaying 24K gold into a tool steel frame.

Our range of woods rank among the rarest and most spectacular in the world - hand selected for premium figure, color, and durability.  Where applicable, we stabilize the wood with acrylic resin, to provide additional protection.  Wood is a natural material and can shift, expand or contract over time.

 Luckily for us, South Carolina has minimal to no knife laws so as long as your old enough you can buy any of the autos or otf's. Prices are firm trades possible but really looking for cash. (Medford Praetorian may get my attention) These things are sharper than most and really pieces of art in my eyes. Don't let that fool you...they will have you looking around confused as to why your bleeding in a split second, trust me I know.

I intended this rifle for long range and have put hundreds of dollars (about $550) into it in upgrades, but I'd rather shoot a 308 for long range due to a better selection of components.  That said, it is a good shooter and is plenty accurate for intermediate ranges.  I am also selling the whole kit - rifle, ammo, and reloading dies.  Here are all the specs on what is for sale

Rifle:
- Tula M91/30 with hex receiver, made in 1935
- barrel shortened to 18.5 inches and threaded with 5/8-24 thread

Upgrades:
- walnut sporter stock, custom painted with black-on-green tiger stripe pattern and matte finish.  Looks super bad ass
- pillar bedded on Rock Solid Industries pillars 
- recoil lug and rear tang glass bedded in Devcon plastic steel
- Karsten adjustable comb
- Limb Saver 1"" recoil pad
- 2 sling swivel studs
- Rock Solid Industries MI-24 rail - extra long picatinny rail that allows you to use a variety of optics or sights
- Bolt handle modified for scope clearance by Rock Solid Industries
- Timney trigger with side safety.  This trigger is - excuse my French - fucking incredible. This Mosin now has a better trigger than most modern factory rifles
- AK74 style muzzle brake.  Together with the recoil pad, felt recoil is extremely light even with heavy 182 grain ball loads

Ammo: only an approximate count.  Will update when I count the rounds exactly.  heavy ball ammo I have is VERY hard to find
- approx. 200 rounds Bulgarian yellow tip 182 grain heavy ball.  Brass cased. Made in the ""10"" factory in 1955.  These are berdan primed, but if you are handy, you can convert the fired brass to take boxer primers by following the link below.  I intended to do this.  

http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?143855-Converting-Berdan-primer-pockets-to-Boxer

- approx. 100 rounds Russian 182 grain heavy ball.  Steel case berdan primed.
- approx. 40 rounds Russian/Bulgarian light ball.  Steel case berdan primed
- 10 rounds PPU 182 grain match
- 30 decapped and cleaned PPU match cases

Dies:
- RCBS 7.62x54r FL 2 die set
- RCBS primer pocket swager for converting primer pockets.  Not really looking to sell this, but if you intend on converting the primer pockets, I'll sell it.

Price is for Everything!  Not really looking to sell things separately unless you make me a good offer.  Looking to get at least $800 for the whole kit.  No low balls.

Does not come with bipod.  I may sell the scope for an extra $100.  Tasco varmint 6-24x with high Burris rings

The patented axial mechanism also provides easy one-handed-opening of the knife. Simply grip the button between your thumb and forefinger and squeeze, the handle is then released to rotate freely away from the blade into the open and locked position. Reversing this procedure will close and lock the blade. Paul® knives are simple to use, elegant in design, extremely strong and safe.

This was a SLED gun I picked up locally and have decided to sell it. The gun is in perfect working order and has not been fired much at all. It has some honest wear in the polished blue finish and a couple of dents and nicks in the furniture. None of it affects function. I detail-stripped the gun and cleaned it. I also stripped and refinished the wood with boiled linseed oil. I hand rubbed ten coats and it has a nice, rich, red color."

The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shootingManufacturer: CZ ( Made in Czech Republic )Model: 75 SP-01Barrel: 4.5""Caliber: .9mmCapacity: 18+1Action: SA/DA"

My Brand New  Springfield Armory Range Officer which only had 50 rounds fired through its barrel is up for sale at a superb price. I had to reduce my armory of pistols as the Summer vacation beckons and needed some additional cash. This  pistol is built with the same components as the high end TRP which cost 1,400+, so minus the TRP's cosmetic enhancement ( night sights, Armory Kote and grips) you are actually getting a quality and custom built  pistol that is  the same as the TRP in almost all aspects such as the National Match barrel,frame,slide,trigger and all internal components . At this price point for a brand new pistol, this is not just a bargain but a steal as it's selling for 850+ without taxes or S/H ( Check out Gander Mountain's price) . As a bonus, you get a free 100rounds Federal boxed brass ammo so you can bring it to the range right away. For home defense, the range and competition, the Range Officer is an excellent pistol. I can  meet potential buyers at a safe meeting place for a FTF transaction. I can only sell the pistol to 21years or older with a valid TX ( only TX) DL or CHL. FOR TODAY ONLY, 04/16/15, IF BUYING BOTH PISTOL AND THE BULK AMMO ( Check out my  other listing for the discounted 45ACP brass  bulk ammo ), I will further lower the price to reflect a package deal that is truly unheard of. Send me an email for inquiry and I'll give you the discounted price for both the pistol and ammo. I can guarantee that my package pricing will be hard to PASS and that no one can match . So send me an email and inquire. Thanks."

I am selling because my wife and I are planning on having another baby and I need to get rid of some of my toys. I set this gun up myself and it shoots .5 MOA @ 100yards. The gun is the AAC model with the 1:10 twist 20"" inch heavy barrel with threaded end for suppressor. 700 action with Timmney trigger right around 2.5 lbs on the trigger very crisp and clean just like a Timmney should be. The stock is a Bell & Carlson "" the hook"" fiberglass stock with full length aluminum bedding block. I also glass bedded the action and free floated the barrel. The stock has PTC bottom metal with removable 5 round magazine and will accommodate the 10 round mag as well. It has a Harris BRM bipod with a s-lock to lock the bipod much better than the factory knob. The scope is an SWFA SS 3-15X42 First focal plane mil/mil tactical turrets. 20 MOA EGW HD I piece picatinny rail. Burris Extreme Tactical scope mounts. The scope is very high quality. In my honest opinion it is one of the best scopes for the under 1000 dollar range. The glass clarity is excellent the turrets track great and it's FFP. Which is highly desired for long range shooting. I have a lot of ballistic data for it and have about 45 Federal Gold Match 175 BTHP that this gun absolutely loves. That's almost 100 dollar value right there. The rifle also comes with the pelican case. I'm asking 2000 OBO I have a lot more than that in it but need the money more so first one with cash in hand gets it. This gun has all the best stuff I could get on it. I have every cofidence that a good shooter can reach beyond 1200 yards with this gun no problem. I can answer any questions you may have.

The SLP MK I also offers a 22"" barrel with a 3"" chamber and a hard-chromed bore. Checkered gripping panels on the forearm and grip, interchangeable recoil pads for individual length-of-pull fit, interchangeable comb inserts, and two steel sling swivel studs add to the shotgun's functionality and its extended magazine tube gives it a full 8 + 1 capacity. In addition, the Tactical MK I comes standard with a pistol grip, a forward-mounted MIL-STD 1913 Tri-Rail mount, and a top-mounted cantilever weaver-pattern accessory rail. The sighting system consists of a low-profile, adjustable folding rear blade and a red fiber-optic front.

Features:
Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.
The four-position chrome-plated gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance. The gas system may be closed completely for manual operation during training or when using a suppressor*.
Folding backup iron sights include a windage adjustable rear sight and an elevation adjustable front sight. These sights provide a solid, reliable aiming system that can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock* is mounted on a Mil-Spec diameter tube.
Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity.
Fluted barrel (for reduced weight and improved barrel cooling) features an SR-556®/Mini-14®-style flash suppressor* mounted with a 5/8""-24 thread.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand."

877,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4222877,For Sale/Trade:  Magnum Research Desert Eagle .44 Magnum,"South Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina","$ 1,500","Listed On: Wednesday, April 8, 2015",Handguns,Magnum Research                                                                                ,44 Magnum,no type,no type,"What’s that? You’re looking for the “Desert Eagle”. Well, I just so happen to have one that I possibly could part with.

I came across this wonderful relic of Jewish technology while on the quest for the “Ark of the Covenant” with Professor Jones. You know that crazy whip wielding archeologist. 

It was lying in a dusty glass box with “Nazi Skinner Mark VII” written above it. As I slowly opened the box, I heard trumpets sound in the distant sky and shimmer of satiny silver came from the box. As I reached for the hand cannon, like Mjolnir to Thor, this Desert Eagle flew to my hand. I knew at that time that I was meant to wield this formidable weapon.

(This could possibly be an embellishment of the facts.)

That was nearly 15 years ago. Since then I have acquired 2 more of these beasts. I have an original Mark I and another Mark VII with multiple caliber and barrel lengths. I don’t have a real need to get rid of this “Hammer of Israel” but I need to make room and am thinning out the herd. 

This is not a .50 AE; I was never one for that caliber, so I never purchased one. But this is however one of the original ones marked “Made in Israel”, and is in the caliber .44 Magnum. 

And in my opinion the most fun to shoot. My favorite has always been the proper .44 Magnum Desert Eagle. 

When you have one of these guns, one of your favorite things about owning it is this. The face of people who hold it, and if they are lucky, get to shoot it for the first time. 

This gun makes peckers hard and kittens wet. Pulling the trigger either makes you smile or makes you cry. Just tell people it is twice as powerful as a 22, that’s why they call it a 44. 

Stand back and prepare to upload to youtube. 
This gun is an absolute joy to shoot. 

Let me know if you have anything interesting to trade. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Update - For those that are interested. This gun has been traded recently. Consider this to be a warning of individuals out there. The gun I traded this for was a 629-1 and a 45-70 rifle. 

The problem was that the individual Daniel R. Rivers at REDACTED or REDACTED completely misrepresented the 629-1. Upon closer inspection when I got home and after I disassembled the gun. It became evident that some of the internals on this gun had been glued together to replicate proper function. I attempted to contact Mr. Rivers in an attempt to make this right and he refused to respond to my emails, texts or phone calls. 

He is a perfect example on how not to do business and gives the honest folk on this site a bad name. And dishonors his fellow cadets at the Citadel."

The M&P is in good shape, and will come with all of the factory stuff, box, backstraps, two factory 17 round magazines that came with it and an extra for 3 magazines total.  Also has factory night sights on it with plenty of life left and it has had some trigger work done on it, so it is a bit smoother and lighter and breaks much better than a stock M&P trigger.

Absolutely no problems with it, I'm just wanting something a bit more compact for carry purposes.  I would like to trade for a similarly equipped Gen 4 Glock 19 with night sights and a like number of mags.  Would still consider a Gen 3 if it has the features mentioned above.  May look at one without night sights if you have extra mags or ammo to offset the cost.  Might also consider an XDm 3.8 Compact in 9mm.

Would prefer to trade, but if you'd rather buy I'll sell it for $525.  With the night sights, trigger work, and extra mag I'm pretty firm on price.

I intended this rifle for long range and have a lot of money into it in upgrades, but I'd rather shoot a 308 for long range due to a better selection of components. That said, it is a good shooter and is plenty accurate for intermediate ranges. I am also selling the whole kit - rifle, ammo, and reloading dies. Here are all the specs on what is for sale and trade

Rifle:
- Tula M91/30 with hex receiver, made in 1935
- barrel shortened to 18.5 inches and threaded with 5/8-24 thread

Upgrades:
- walnut sporter stock, custom painted with black-on-green tiger stripe pattern and matte finish. 
- pillar bedded on Rock Solid Industries pillars 
- recoil lug and rear tang glass bedded in Devcon plastic steel
- Karsten adjustable comb
- Limb Saver 1"" recoil pad
- 2 sling swivel studs
- Rock Solid Industries MI-24 rail - extra long picatinny rail that allows you to use a variety of optics or sights
- Bolt handle modified for scope clearance by Rock Solid Industries
- Timney trigger with side safety. This trigger is incredible. This Mosin now has a better trigger than most modern factory rifles
- Wolff extra power firing pin spring
- AK74 style muzzle brake. Together with the recoil pad, felt recoil is extremely light even with heavy 182 grain ball loads

Total for gun: $500
bipod, scope, and rings not included

Reloading Components:
* some numbers are approximate.  I will update this add with an accurate count shortly

-360 Hornady 303 cal .312 diameter 174 grain BTHP match bullets.  3 unopened boxes of 100 and one partially loaded box with 40 left:  $95

-20 Hornady 303 cal .312 diameter 174 grain round nose interlock bullets:  $5

-approx. 150 brass berdan primed cases.  These were pulled from surplus Bulgarian heavy ball.  Case mouths have been chamfered and deburred.  Again, they are berdan primed, and probably corrosive, but after firing you could convert them to boxer primers and have reloadable brass by following the steps in the link below... :  $30

http://castboolits.gunloads.com/showthread.php?143855-Converting-Berdan-primer-pockets-to-Boxer

- 40 Norma 7.62x54R brass.  13 are loaded with a 174 gr BTHP over IMR 4064 at about 2450 FPS from the short barrel.  Case mouths have been chamfered and deburred.  The rest are once fired: $45

-40 PPU Match 7.62x54R brass.  9 are loaded with a 174 grain interlock over IMR 4064 at about 2300 fps from the short barrel.  The rest are once fired: $20

Dies:
- RCBS 7.62x54r FL 2 die set.  Like new.  Only about 100 rounds loaded:  $35
- RCBS primer pocket swager for converting primer pockets. Not really looking to sell this, but if you intend on converting the primer pockets, I'll sell it.  Never used : $30
