By far the best shooting 9mm I have ever shot. It is perfectly balanced. This one is also super clean. Each gun has original case and factory mags. Also have 2 32 round mags and ammo for each. My trade value for the full size is around $500, and for the compact is $1000. (I know what you're thinking, but there is A LOT of money into the compact) so let me know what you got if you're interested!"

2 summers ago the entire front end was replaced including ball joints, tie rods, wheel hubs, cv joints, rear axle oil changed, transfer case flushed/changed, and brakes/rotors all around.   Last summer the engine was redone with head gaskets, intake gaskets, rebuilt heads, plugs, coils, exhaust manifolds, alternator, belt, power steering pump and hoses, thermostat, etc. The only thing that could be done to it at this time is replacing the windshield. It cracked last fall and I just haven't had it replaced yet. 

It comes with brush guard, fiberglass box lid for the winter, and aluminum tool box for the summer.  

I trust this truck to drive my family all over the state. The only reason I'm selling it is to get a truck with more room for my family of 5.

10k gold: 1.155 grams 
12k gold: 16.700 grams 
14k gold: 85.810 grams 
16k gold: 4 grams 

Calculated down to melt value of pure gold in ounces: (weighed with a standard scale, this is not Troy ounces, just standard ounces.) 

10k gold: 0.0154. $17.94 
12k gold: 0.2683. $313.56 
14k gold: 1.6070. $1,878.11 
16k gold: 0.0858. $100.16 

Total market value: $2309.77 

For a cost of about $100 it can be smelted down to a bar of pure 24k gold in the weight of about 1.9756 ounce. Market value of it is about $2300 depending on when you do the calculations. 

With gold value always changing I'm setting my trade value at $1600. If I get a chance to take my gold to the smelter before trading it off the price will change. I just wanted to try listing it before I smelt and sell it outright.  I can acid test it in front of you to show purity

No I will not just sell the gold as is. My plan is to try to trade it or next week I'm going to smelt it and have it poured into a solid 2 ounce bar.

Shotgun is in stock configuration and comes with original box and all paperwork as purchased new. Also included are 10 rounds of Federal 3"" 00 Buck 12 ga. ammo.  

The shotgun has been owned for a few years and was a bedroom gun the whole time. It's only been to the range once or twice and still looks great. There aren't any major issues with the finish, just some slight scuffs from handling and regular operation. The action tube was slightly damaged around the threads when the original handguard was removed to install a surefire, but the nut still makes up tightly and is secure. I have a new action tube on order for it. 

The gun was purchased from Town Police Supply in Chesterfield several years ago for $475. They are selling new for around $550 online now. 

The original intent was to turn this into a home defense SBS. Times and tastes have changed, so it is time to sell.

 Who Am I:
 My names Chris. I have done countless Glock Trigger/Slide jobs on my own Glocks as well as many others people Glocks. I also do other weapons including Handguns and Rifles. I am legally allowed to possess a Handgun, I can show you my CCP and Mil ID so you know I'm not a felon. I do not own a shop, I do this as a hobby and to help people with cost. I will however do the same if not better job then you will get at a gunshop for a fraction of the price, you can pay over $100 for a polish job at gunshops! I enjoy gunwork and I do this as a hobby, I have been for many years and I am very familiar with Glocks and many others, just shoot me a message with what gun you have. Turnaround is 48hrs, however in most cases it is ready for pickup next day, I say 48hrs for a 1 day buffer in case I have something going on with work. Cant beat that! Also I can install what ever custom parts you have purchased on your own. There will be a ""Pre"" and ""Post"" work form to fill out stating what services will be provided and that your giving and taking back possession. A copy will be made for you to keep.
 -------------------------------------------------
 Why Polish Internals?:
 Polishing is like waxing a floor. Less friction equals smoother surface, which in our case equals a physically smoother operating gun and a smoother feel to the user. It will remove most/all of the grittiness in your trigger as well as making a smoother pull and reset. Glocks come stock with a 5lb trigger pull which in reality is closer to 6lb, sometimes slightly more, due to all the friction from factory coated parts. Polishing will bring it to where it should be with stock parts which is roughly 4.5lbs-5lbs, thus making the trigger pull feel lighter then your used to. I also offer two parts to further reduce trigger pull and enhance smoothness, that when coupled with the polish job will make your Glock operate as smooth as possible and make the trigger pull break like glass every time....Pull the trigger on one of my glocks before you commit and see for yourself!
 -------------------------------------------------
 What I offer:
 I will completely disassemble the gun(slide and frame), clean the entire gun(bore at your request), polish all friction prone internals, oil and reassemble. Can also polish Barrel Feed Ramp at your request with no additional Fee.
 Price $25

 I will Remove the Factory 5lb Connector and replace it with a POLISHED 3.5lb connector. This reduces the trigger pull to roughly 3lbs-3.5lbs.
 Price $15

 I will Remove the Factory 5lb Trigger Spring and Replace it with a 6lb Trigger Spring. Why heavier here? The Trigger Spring actually assists the Trigger in Pull/Reset, a Heavier one will make for a Smoother pull and Smoother Reset.
 Price $5

 I will refinish your scratched/worn barrel by slightly sanding, degreasing and applying an even coat of Black DuraCoat DuraBake which is a heat treated form of Duracoat making it hard as nails once its heated.
 $15

 For any custom parts you would like installed, please let me know and I will give you a quote. I can install parts you bought or I can order them for you at a discounted rate and save you some money.
 -------------------------------------------------
 Turnaround is 48hrs, however in most cases it is ready for pickup next day, I say 48hrs for a 1 day buffer in case I have something going on with work. Cant beat that! Also I can install what ever custom parts you have purchased on your own. There will be a ""Pre"" and ""Post"" work form to fill out stating what services will be provided and that your giving and taking back possession. A copy will be made for you to keep.

 Feel free to contact me to setup a time, thanks.

Has original case, manual, Smith keys and gun lock. Night Guards are hard to find, but the 327NG 8 shot wheel gun is by far the most desireable...well along with the 310NG in 10mm. I have fired a few cylinders of .38, probably 5 cylinders of +P and 5 more cylinders of .357. The single action and double action are both friggen awesome!

That being said, here she is. Fires like a beast, timing is dead on, chambers and bore are mil spec clean and the night sight glows bright. The scandium finish and SS cylinder are in excellent+ condition with very minor handling marks, nothing that detracts from the gun.

I added the S&W combat grip, and am including the original Pachmayr grip as well. I also have a custom speedloader and custom double cylinder night stand ammo tray included.

But if you  have an older Smith & Wesson or Colt revolver I could have some interest in a trade.  I have many revolvers so I'll be very picky when it comes to a trade.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

Available for all popular sizes of semi-automatic pistols, Barrel Plugz is an inexpensive, easy to use innovation in gun safety. Performing trigger reset exercises, and clearing procedures for type I, II, and III malfunctions, in complete safety are now possible. “Aspect Correct” training functionality is maintained in an inert training environment. Can also be used as a home safety device.AS A TRAINING DEVICE: The Plug can be used to execute trigger reset exercises. By pushing the tip of the plug against a hard surface, the slide will cycle and reset the main spring allowing the trigger to be reset and pulled again.   MALFUNCTION EXERCISES: The Plug can be used for type I, II, and III malfunction clearing exercises, with the plug correctly installed clearing procedures for each malfunction type can be practiced in safety.   IN THE CLASSROOM: With the Plug correctly installed in each students pistol, the training environment becomes entirely inert, safely allowing “Aspect Correct” training with full functionality of each pistol.   IN THE HOME: Personal pistols with a plug installed are rendered inert, requiring disassembly and correct reassembly before a round can be chambered. Additionally a lock of appropriate shackle size can be affixed over the lock notch adding keyed access to the safety features of the plug. The plug affords parents the inert status necessary when providing instruction on the proper use, care and handling of a pistol.

Ammo shoots fine (hence the odd number of rounds) just dont want deal with corrosive primed ammunition anymore. 7 unopened boxes of 15, 2 opened but full 15 boxes, and 8 loose rounds.

NOTE: This ammo is corrosive. This means you must flush your bore after EVERY use. The potassium chlorate in the primers turns to salt that attracts moisture from the air and causes rust to form and pitting (if left unchecked). Flush the bore with warm to boiling water after each range trip, followed by dry patches, then an oil or clp to coat the bore. Youtube has videos on the subject if interested."

 Remington 700 7mm Rem mag. Excellent condition camo furniture matte finish steel. Low round count and an absolute tack driver with enough power to take any game on this continent. This rifle does qualify for the voluntary recall. I have had it checked by a licensed gun smith and she passed just fine. Not to mention the strap it to the 4 wheeler gun rack with one in the pipe and yet to have a accidental discharge test. Again it passes every year with flying colors. I will include 74 rounds ammo the scope in the pic is negotiable but I'd like to hang on to it."
