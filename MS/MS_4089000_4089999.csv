SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to meet the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows for change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

This gun was a duty weapon for the South Carolina Highway Patrol.  It is in great condition considering it's age and the fact is was just recently taken out of service as a duty weapon.  There is some minor wear and scuffs on the gun frame and the slide as can be seen in the pictures.  The walnut stock and forend also have some normal wear but overall the gun is in great condition.  This gun comes with an 18 inch barrel, bead sight and is chambered to handle 2 3/4 or 3 in shells.  It has a 4+1 capacity.  The police magnum comes with recoil pad and upgraded internals as noted below.

Police – Chambered in 12 gauge only.  These models feature a stronger sear spring, carrier latch spring, and a forged steel extractor (as opposed to the MIM extractor found on Express models). Receivers are stamped ""Remington 870 Police Magnum"" as of 2014.

They are equipped with Police-specific walnut or synthetic stocks which are fitted with sling mounts. Walnut stocks lack checkering as found on the Express/Wingmaster models. 870P models come with matching walnut or synthetic forends that are shortened to prevent interference with most vehicle-mounted rack systems. The shortened forend also allows quick visual inspection of the magazine regardless of what position the forend is in, whereas the lengthened sport-type forend on other models partially blocks the loading port when pulled to the rear.

Police models are available with 18"" or 20"" barrels, with or without rifle sights, and have a standard capacity of four rounds.  All police barrels come with an Improved Cylinder choke.

All sales done in accordance to Federal, State and Local laws.  Must be 18 to purchase and sign a Bill of Sale.

The bolt itself at sometime was refinished and the serial numbers on it have been removed, but The eagle in swastika remain on the inside of handle. The stock cartouches aren't that visible and it's likely the stock has been sanded at one time, but there trace is still visible. The sling itself is an original k98 that's in relatively good shape. The rifling shows it's age but still a shooter and the frosting is even through the barrel with no major pitting. It also has a very nice trigger drop (2) stage that feels custom like and it's one of the nicest stock trigger on any Mauser I've felt. The top handguard has 2 repair spots that initially drew my appeal to it. It has everything your Mauser would need (no cleaning rod). Original K98 slings alone can fetch 100$+depending on condition. The front sight hood is a k98 original (not repo). 650$ has to be the PRICE!!!! The$$$ like most is being applied at a upgrade for my desired collection. If it's NOT 650$....it's NOT for you!

It has not been fired for the past 30 years. This is my Dad's gun and unfortunately must be sold to help with some medical bills, make no mistake this is NOT a fire sale. I'm offering it up here to local collectors, before listing it on gunbroker. We need every dollar we can get right now, I cannot accept any trade offers. CASH only.

Now with dissertation out of the way, I have a very nice Smith with the box and all original papers and cleaning rod. This has everything that came with it new, the box itself in not perfect but still in good condition considering its age. Also there is a warranty card that shows the purchase date as 8/26/77.
This is the Target model, it has the target hammer, trigger, and grips.
6 inch barrel. It does have a turn ring on the cylinder, and some wear in the bluing at the muzzle. As a kid, I used to shoot this weekly on a PPC league at the Gun Room, an indoor range that used to be in Beech Grove. So it is a used gun, but as stated above, I have not fired it in 30 years or more.
I will be listing more of his collection as time permits.

Also please cut me some slack if I do not get back to you immediately, I do work a full time job, have a family and am spending a lot of time taking care of my Dad.
Thanks for understanding. I will get back to you, it just may not be as quick as you like, but I will do my best.

I purchased this revolver about a year ago and it has been sitting in my safe! It is a very, very nice Harrington & Richardson Arms model 900! This revolver is in excellent condition. The action has been polished and Teflon coated and the main spring/guide rod assembly upgraded by a gun smith. When he looked at it and he said it was produced in 1969 or 1970 and is in the best condition he has ever seen for a gun of it's age as it almost looks brand new out of the box. The gunsmith also said that the gun probably only had a couple hundred rounds through it, the rifling is sharp, trigger release is crisp, and the entire action is very smooth. There is no rust or corrosion of any kind, the bluing looks great, the grips are also in great condition. It is a double action, in DA the trigger is not overly heavy and very smooth, SA is very nice for range and target shooting. Despite the short barrel there is almost no kick due to the nice solid weight and feel of the gun, and it is extremely accurate. It can shoot .22 short, long, and long rifle. This is the more sought after version of the 900, short barrel, short grip. The value of this gun in this kind of condition is worth well over $400!

I have accumulated many guns over time and I have some duplicates. I am not looking to sell all my pistols, but I am going to attach a list by brand, model and caliber, and would entertain selling off some of them. I have (28) 9mm, ( 9 ) 40s and (16) 45's with (14) of the 45s being brand new 1911's. All pistols are semi automatics and most of the guns are new in the box and unfired except at the factory.

I am absolutely not looking for any trades. Cash only. Face to Face only. Be over 21, a non felon and have a current Florida Drivers License. I will definitely do a Firearm Bill of Sale on any weapon sold.

If you are interested in something that I have listed, please email me and we can go from there. I did not post pictures because I did not want to run a lot of ads. You can google any of these guns with the info provided and see what they look like

Just so you know up front, I am not desperate to sell any of them and if none sell, then I am fine with that. I will be fair on my prices, but will not take a beating either. Again, no trades. I want to ween down, not add more weapons.


All guns below that have a NIB = Brand New in the Box
The ones that have nothing after it means they have been fired a few times and all look brand new or in excellent condition. I do not own any beat up,rusted,worn or abused guns.

Guerrilla grip with integrated bullet button release tool is a must for California AR platform firearm enthusiasts. They are made of durable rubber which will stretch to fit over all standard length rifle magazines. These grips enhance magazine control during mag changes, protect the base plate from damage while dropping empty magazines, and provide a stable shooting platform when using the magazine as monopod. The grips can be used with or without the integrated bullet button tool which is made of an unbreakable polymer positioned on the bottom of the grip for the most ergonomic and fastest mag changes you can preform with a bullet button installed on the rifle. By having a guerrilla grip on each of your magazines you never have to worry about fumbling around for a tool one will always ready for you to use. Guerrilla grips are sold in packs of 3 and available in standard tactical colors as well as bright colors for quick magazine identification, hunting, and competition.

This gun was a duty weapon for the South Carolina Highway Patrol. It is in great condition considering it's age and the fact is was just recently taken out of service as a duty weapon. There is some minor wear and scuffs on the gun frame and the slide as can be seen in the pictures. The walnut stock and forend also have some normal wear but overall the gun is in great condition. This gun comes with an 18 inch barrel, rifle sights and is chambered to handle 2 3/4 or 3 in shells. It has a 4+1 capacity. The police magnum comes with upgraded internals as noted below.

 Police – Chambered in 12 gauge only. These models feature a stronger sear spring, carrier latch spring, and a forged steel extractor (as opposed to the MIM extractor found on Express models). Receivers are stamped ""Remington 870 Police Magnum"" as of 2014.

 They are equipped with Police-specific walnut or synthetic stocks which are fitted with sling mounts. Walnut stocks lack checkering as found on the Express/Wingmaster models. 870P models come with matching walnut or synthetic forends that are shortened to prevent interference with most vehicle-mounted rack systems. The shortened forend also allows quick visual inspection of the magazine regardless of what position the forend is in, whereas the lengthened sport-type forend on other models partially blocks the loading port when pulled to the rear.

 Police models are available with 18"" or 20"" barrels, with or without rifle sights, and have a standard capacity of four rounds. All police barrels come with an Improved Cylinder choke.

 All sales done in accordance to Federal, State and Local laws. Must be 18 to purchase and sign a Bill of Sale. 

Gun must be transferred and shipped from my FFL dealer to your FFL dealer at your expense.  Approximately $50 to transfer and ship.

I have accumulated many guns over time and I have some duplicates. I am not looking to sell all my pistols, but I am going to attach a list by brand, model and caliber, and would entertain selling off some of them. I have (26) 9mm, ( 8 ) 40s and (16) 45's with (14) of the 45s being brand new 1911's. All pistols are semi automatics and most of the guns are new in the box and unfired except at the factory.

I am absolutely not looking for any trades. Cash only. Face to Face only. SHIPPING only as a last resort, and I would be going through my FFL to your FFL. I will not ship without going through my FFL so please don't ask me. He charges $10 plus shipping and you will pay his fee and shipping. It will not be deducted from my sale price of the gun.  USPS money order is the only way. Once cashed, okay will be given to my dealer and he will ship immediately.  Be over 21, a non felon and have a current Florida Drivers License. I will definitely do a Firearm Bill of Sale on any weapon sold.

If you are interested in something that I have listed, please email me and we can go from there. I did not post pictures because I did not want to run a lot of ads. You can google any of these guns with the info provided and see what they look like

Just so you know up front, I am not desperate to sell any of them and if none sell, then I am fine with that. I will be fair on my prices, but will not take a beating either. Again, no trades. I want to ween down, not add more weapons.


All guns below that have a NIB = Brand New in the Box
The ones that have nothing after it means they have been fired a few times and all look brand new or in excellent condition. I do not own any beat up,rusted,worn or abused guns.

Hi guys, considering selling my brand new ptr 18in bull barrel match grade piece of art. I bought it last month and sent the trigger unit out to be modified and is mega crisp no over travel perfection at 3.8lbs I have only shot 50rds thru the gun and the first 25rds were very slow and arduous breakin and cleaning and it immediately started to group 1-1.25 Moa at 200 and 300yards with 150gr tulammo which is mainly what I intended to shoot and put 5-10k rds thru it this year on my property and possibly a 3gun comp for fun with my other heavy hitters. Im ABSOLUTELY certain it is a .5moa gun with match ammo or handloads!

The gun ONLY comes as a package I will not break it up, the ammo may go down or sell seperately since I will try to shoot the gun more when my broken rib and other issues heal. I have a shooting range on my property and this gun has never left my living room or concrete patio and doesn't have a single scratch on it, your welcome to come adn test it with cash in hand. 

The followings included:
-500rds of tul 150gr
-100rds of nATO xm80 ball
-60rds of 168gr AMax 
-15rds of 168amax subsonic which shot .7-.8moa @200 suppressed
-top of the line Harris swivel spring loaded bipod
-custom bottom rail and bipod adapter
-AAC foregrip
-Brand new vortex viper HS 2.5-10x44 
-millett percision scope rings
-custom made metric to 5/8x24 thread adapter for brakes/suppressors
-custom made 4in brake that makes it feel like shooting an ar15 no joke!
-standard g3a3 muzzle brake
-10 HK G3 magazines
-hard carrying case and manuals
-my professional advice for any future mods or shooting lessons
For $2200 SHIPPED anywhere in USA or without any ammo for $1850

Only selling because my health sucks and I have ""gun ADHD""  I will get better at some point to get back into long range shooting where I can lay prone but I woudlnt mind letting someone else enjoy my lucky and perfect setup. BTW, the groups I mentioned were mainly verticle spread which means the ammo has inconsistent FPS, the horizontal margins are similar to a rifle with .25moa like my custom 1000yrd bolt gun shoots. Like I said this is a lucky batch of parts with a good barrel brake in and shoots absolutely un-fricken-believeable.

Only trades considered are AUG a3 m1, ps90, threaded barrel 1911, FNX45 tactical that's IT folks, I have everything else! Seriously, not interested in ANYTHING but money or those items thanks tho!

Also selling my custom 1moa 300blackout in all FDE check my listings!


Please feel free to text me for questions pics or a walk around video, if you want to drive out to my farm your welcome to shoot it off my patio and test it, she is a masterpiece!
absolutely no low ballers or criminals. I will sell local without hassling you at a gun shop etc, stick cash in my face and were good to go.

Action is Springfield Armory, rifle has new parkerizing and stock....
When I received it , I took it to the range, the rangemaster was a former military armorer, 
he said the barrel was brand new ( not sure if they were aftermarket or GI at that time) , since then I put maybe 40 rounds through it before it went into storage...anyway, he loaded up 3 rounds of commercial reloads and  put them into 1.5"" at 100 yards ...
I believe this would be closest to what they are now calling the RM1SPECIAL, although the stock looks more like birch than walnut....

Rifle is offered in a package  with  a total of 350 rounds  of 150 grain ball ammo in which are fresh loads in surplus military brass cases.....there is no manufacturers name on the box ...there are 15 boxes of 20 rounds plus 50 loose rounds of the same ammo...the 350 rounds are valued at .80/rd based on online pricing with shipping ( or retail purchase plus tax ) ...in addition there are  27 en bloc clips

I have fired this using light loads . I used it for skeet and did very well with it .The barrels are 25''  fixed choke cylinder and cylinder and I think it might be from the 60's through the 70's.The shotgun is in very good shape it almost looks new but it does have a hair line crack I took a picture of it hopefully it can be seen from the picture with that said I think that's the only flaw but its not bad.

Reason for selling is that I have two other primary optics for my AR, and i dont need this one laying around. Hope someone can put it to good use.
All electronics and LED work great, no issues. The lenses are in great condition due to the protector. I recently changed the AA battery and have an extra one thats not been used yet. 
The optic IS used and does have some camo-style markings on it. Feel free to ask any questions. 

I paid $800+ tax, brand new, about a year and half maybe two years ago.  
Im open to trades as well. Shoot me an offer price...worst I can say is no."

I have just opened the doors to Vexxer Munitions(metaphorically; we don't actually have doors), and to celebrate I am posting the current stock of ammunition on Armslist, three weeks before our scheduled 'opening' ceremony, here in lovely Portland, OR. I should note right off the bat that this is an online-only store; we do not have a physical office address for one to come pick up ammunition, at least not yet.


All ammunition is priced and sold in sets of 100 rounds, at $30 per 'brick' of 100 rounds. Shipping will be determined based on location and amount of rounds you want; buying more will end up saving you money, as I can pack them all into a single box, instead of 100 rounds per small box.

I also offer a 'penny-round' discount for orders of 1,000 rounds or more. At the 1,000 round mark, I take off a penny per round. It's not a massive discount, granted, but if you are planning on shooting a lot anyways, it will save you a fair bit of cash. Because it makes my end logistically easier, and cheaper, the savings fall directly to the consumer. You are free to mix-and-match, the discount applies when you reach a total of 1,000 rounds or above.


While I do not yet have ALL calibers yet, I do have the most commonly shot rounds in America. I chose to maintain healthy stockpiles of common calibers, rather than create a single brick per caliber, and have to fight to keep them stocked.


I currently have stocked:


-Tula .45ACP


-Wolf 7.62x39mm


-Silver Bear .223/5.56 NATO


-Winchester Super-X 12GA, Buck-shot


-Bulgarian 7.62x54R, Silver-Tipped [CORROSIVE]


[A quick word on the corrosive ammunition; I am a huge Mosin fan, if you need any advice or assistance in keeping your Mosin pristine(the secret is boiling water), don't hestitate to send me an email]


I will be taking special notice of obtaining 9mm especially, as well as .22LR, .308, 10GA rounds as soon as possible, I know that I am missing these very common calibers. I wanted to maintain an inventory rather than sell out too quickly of a given item, so more calibers will arrive soon.



PROCESS:


To order(while our website is being constructed, at least) is very simple; email me with how many rounds you would like, of what caliber. I will require a state or military-issued ID as proof of age. From there, I will send you a shipping quote, NOT an estimate. There is an important distinction there; estimates can change, quotes will not. Most ammunition companies use an estimator, and charge you the final price halfway through the process, whether or not the estimate was correct. I do not use this system; if I make a mistake, I will eat the cost; what I quote is what you pay, no exceptions. I'd rather lose money and keep a customer.

Once we have the final cost, I will send you an invoice via Paypal. After payment is received, you will receive an email from Paypal with the tracking number, as well as your order's current status. Unfortunately, as many of you are no doubt aware, munitions by law MUST travel via ground. Factor in at least a week for shipping. That being said, I will ship the same day generally that your order is placed. Please note I discount Sunday completely as a 'shipping' day, as no shipping company works on Sundays.


[For the unfamiliar: Paypal is an escrow service that watches over the transaction, protecting both you and I in exchange for a small fee from me. It is a completely free service for you, and takes about 5 minutes to create an account.]


From that point, all you have to do is wait. Your package will arrive(please notify me if something is amiss; if there's any sort of problem, I want to know about it), and then all you need to do is go out and have a blast!



Building A Better Business:


Before I wrap up this ad, a word on pricing. I am fully aware that the prices are high, and I am working on it. The bottleneck at this moment is waiting for the various munition factories and distributors to analyze and accept my business identification. Prices and ammunition availability are different for licensed businesses and private citizens. Expect to see prices drop slightly within a month, and drop significantly within 7 months.


Feel free to email me with any questions, comments or concerns you might have. I hope to have a long business career supplying Americans with all their favorite calibers. 


And, as a squeaky-clean, brand-new company, I would be remiss in my duties if I did not ask the customer; if you have any ideas or thoughts on how to cut down on shipping time, make the overall process easier for the customer, etc, please, my email is always open. I would also love to hear your opinions on the 'brick' system, as well as my 'can' system that will go into effect next month. If I may tug on your ear a moment longer:

-I plan to have two basic types of product; bricks of 100 rounds, and ammo cans(with number of rounds dependent on caliber). So for example, 300 7.62x54R rounds fit perfectly into a .30 caliber ammunition can, and pricing would be based on how many rounds are included(the cans are free, a thank you for your business). In that specific case, one 'can' of 7.62x54R would be $105. The cans are all brand-new, un-stenciled; I chose this method to allow you to use them for other rounds and not have confusing stenciling on each box(claiming your ammo can full of 9mm is in fact 40mm explosive rounds, for example). When ordered, the caliber inside will be listed via a sticky-note tacked to the hinge, easily removable once you've shot the ammunition, and want to re-purpose it for another use.


If you have any comments on those two products, or if you have an idea that's even better, please email me. I am always open to customer suggestion. I hope to implement a quasi-forum on the store website for just this purpose, but for now emails will suffice.




Cheers Armslist, and happy hunting!

This stock has a high Monte Carlo style cheek rest for use with a scope.  It has some fancy inlay and is made of a very nice looking piece of tiger stripe hardwood.  The sling and mounts are the same vintage as the stock which is early 1950’s.  It also has a vintage “White Tail” butt pad and grip caps are also the same vintage and style.  This is a remarkable stock in WONDERFUL condition.  I have a Springfield 1903  rifle but this stock will not fit it because it’s for a 1903-A3 and I refuse to cut on it to make it fit.

The trigger creep is minimal and the reset is very short and very crisp.  This 1911 operates more like a good Colt rather than a run-of-the-mill Taurus.  The original magazines have been fixed so you don’t experience FTF or failure to hold the slide open.  I have put 500 to 600 rounds through this pistol without a cleaning and it operated without a flaw.    This 1911 is a far cry from what came out of the original box.

You’re also getting two original magazines with an additional 2 Kimber Magazines with this pistol.  Please don’t tell me how you can go buy one of these for less than I am asking because you can’t and still get the about of performance work done and wait weeks or months to be able to use it.

I am selling my Davis Industries Model D38 Derringer. This pocket gun is chambered in .38 special caliber and is an ideal gun for concealed carry...the derringer is small enough to slip in your front or back pocket for easy concealment. Derringers like this Davis Model D38 are safe and reliable (this gun has two safeties: half cock & actual safety button pin you can push to engage the safety).

This derringer is in great working order and it has only been shot a handful of times. I am also including an Uncle Mike's pocket holster. It will look like you have your wallet in your pocket, not a gun!
