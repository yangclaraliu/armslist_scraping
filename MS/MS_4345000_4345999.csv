Here is some additional info found on the web:
The Springfield Armory GI Micro Compact 1911 isn't actually a replica of the WWI and WWII pistols, as 1911 pistols this small weren't produced until late in the 1990's. However, the Micro Compact is an excellent carry pistol that also has a nostalgic feel to it.
The Micro Compact G.I. has a 3"" barrel and a frame that's smaller than an Officer's size frame, giving it a weight of just 33 ounces, and making it ideal for carry.
The frame and slide are forged steel, and are parkerized. The 3"" bull barrel is fully supported and ramped, and is also parkerized. Parkerizing gives the pistol a finish that's much tougher than anodizing.
The reddish-brown hardwood grips are stamped ""U.S."", and contrast attractively with the black parkerized pistol. 
The sights on the pistol are original G.I. style, with a low profile notched rear sight and low rounded front sight blade.
The grip safety is flat, just like the old G.I. 1911's, as is the trigger. Trigger pull on the Micro Compact G.I. is five to six pounds, which is a good pull weight for a carry pistol.
The Micro Compact G.I. 1911 is a pistol with a lot of character, and one that can fit in the palm of your hand. It comes with a lifetime warranty that's good even if you're not the original purchaser.

Every Springfield Armory 1911 pistol is equipped with a trigger locking device. A key inserted into a hole in the rear grip strap positively locks the trigger, making it impossible for a child to accidentally discharge the gun. This system gives you a choice as to whether or not you need to lock your gun. Unlike trigger locks on other brands of guns, the keyhole is small, so that it doesn't ruin the looks of the gun."

Cleaned it up and put it in the safe and there is has sat.  I don't have a lot of interest in this rifle.  Initially purchased to add to my Fabrique Nationale collection (a project that I have since abandoned).  Rifle is very clean.  Internal components look great and the finish is outstanding for a gun of this age.  I have OCD and this weapon does not match my C&R collection and therefore must go.  Feel free to make reasonable offers.

If you are not familiar, this rifle was designed and produced by Fabrique Nationale under contact for Egypt.   Chambered in 8x57 Mauser (8mm).  Rifle is gas operated and holds 10 rounds.  Price is relatively firm.  Please do not low ball me.  I know what the weapon is worth and I'd rather keep it in the safe then give it away for a unreasonable offer.

I am selling (or possibly trading) my MG36 .22LR. This gun started it's life as a Ruger 10/22, and the Archangel kit was attached later. I also went ahead and replaced the foregrip with a MG36 style foregrip with built in bipod for support. The scope on top is a cheap scope (I think 4x20), so I can't guarentee the quality of it, but I will throw it in for free. If you want, I can try to find the origonal G36 style sights to go back on the right (front and rear iron sights). Comes with everything you see pictured! The stock does also fold like the 5.56 G36 rifle! The selector on the G36 is astetical only, and the safety and magazine release on the Ruger 10/22 are to be used in this rifle.

Package includes:
Ruger 10/22
Archangel G36 Kit (installed)
One OEM Archangel G36 magazine
Three Ruger 10/22 magazines
Scope

Gun is a great shooter, and tons of fun!

Here is how I arrived at my value.

Gun used is around $350-380 on here most of the time.
Night sights I paid $160 for including install, so say 70% of that is $110
Holsters, one is $35 new one is $90 new.  So say $50 together.

That is a little over $500 which is a lot of money for a shield I understand.  But if you are going to buy one and put these night sights on it and buy a holster like this you are going to pay around $600 on the low end.   

So if you want to get this exact package and save $100, this is your deal. 

The gun also has talon gun grips on it which can be removed easily if you do not like them.

Rifle is in very good to excellent condition. I am selling it to fund another project. The price is 1400.00 firm I will not negotiate this price and I do not want any trades so please do not ask. These rifles sell new from 1550.00 to well over 1750.00 plus sales tax so my price is fair. I do have a pay-pal account for those who wish to pay with a debit or credit card and you can make the payment when you pick up the rifle. I will only sell to Indiana residents with a valid drivers license or will consider shipping to your FFL if you live out of state but buyer pays shipping cost. 

The scope obviously does not come with the rifle for this price. It is zeroed and I do not want to remove it until the rifle is sold. If you are interested in the scope it will add 500.00 to the price. The scope is a Leupold 3x9x40 VXR fire dot it has a Custom Dial System for 168gr bullets. The knob can also be easily change to your own choosing.

Get on target fast with the SPARC II. Ultra-compact and lightweight, the SPARC II (Speed Point Aiming for Rapid Combat) is equally at home mounted on an AR-15 or shotgun. Digital rear facing controls for powering on/off and adjusting the 2 MOA daylight bright red dot brightness at ten intensity levels—automatically returning to the last dot intensity used when powered up.

Cabelas scope

Caliber-Specific Rimfire Riflescopes are built to match your favorite target and varmint calibers. The caliber-specific EXT bullet-drop reticle takes the guesswork out of long-range shooting with crosshairs precisely calibrated to the bullet drop of a specific caliber. Once you've determined the target range, simply take the corresponding crosshair, put it on target and squeeze the trigger. The enhanced multicoated optics feature a wide field of view, amazing clarity and efficient light transmission. They are also water-, fog- and shockproof. Low-profile turrets provide a streamlined profile. 1/4-MOA adjustments."

When I received the rifle covered in cosmoline the number on the stock was matching but was a very faint impression in the wood. By the time I cleaned it, did a light sanding, and stained and sealed it the numbers all but disappeared. You can see that the markings are there, but I can't really make them out now. Just want to be up front about that in case it's a deal breaker for someone. This was an actual military issue battle rifle. The rifle does not carry any country of origin markings. These are commonly referred to as sterile or ghost rifles. I purchased it from Classic Firearms. I did refinish the stock, but tried to leave that original worn battle look to it. I have installed a Tech Sight T200 rear peep sight on the rifle, which is adjustable for both windage and elevation. I will also include a new never installed Tapco 20 round detachable magazine. Looking for $350. Would consider a partial trade + cash. Interested in a Vortex Strike Fire 2 red dot scope to put on an AR build."

This is my first one and was originally intended for personal use. I have no need for it so I'm thinking of selling it after a few months of not using it. This is the only one I'm going to sell with a 10/20 legal magazine.

No serial number, no marks or bullets have gone through it. This firearm is probably only going to start being for sale anytime starting July. That's only when I have free time for selling this weapon.

It is legal for me to sell this gun without the FFL and paperwork because it is a homemade firearm, and it was originally intended for me.

With no FFL, I still have my own rules of selling this firearm. Legally, when selling this firearm in my situation there is no need for any paperwork, but I still can't sell to any previous convicted felons or anyone under 18 years of age. If you are one of those people, stop reading. If you don't seem well educated in firearms laws or firearms in general, I can and will stop communicating with you.

I will require a picture of your driver's license or an identification card before speaking with anyone. The only time I will answer without the picture is if you have any questions. (I might be adding a case or iron sights by then, or not, questions like that)

I will also require that you give me your phone number under your message to me by email. My email is REDACTED

I will not ship.
I will not accept trades.

Transaction will only take place near me. Probably on a random block or in public. Not at your house.

Transaction would be done in cash. It would be half for the upper. The next day or so the other half for the lower. I will not part out anything. The price is set.

I can terminate the transaction at any time. We may sign a paper saying that on a certain day I will give you the lower for the other half of the money. (so you won't feel like I'm robbing you with the upper receiver)

This is an early post because I get very busy. I should have more time during the summer weekends. If you are still reading more than likely you've met all of my rules! Please contact me with any questions you may have. Thanks!"

I am saving for Air Force OTS and I have to let this go if I'm gonna keep my priorities in line. I bought this originally from classic firearms in October of 2013, back when you could still get them. This is an original PU Sniper, with the serial number of the scope stamped to the receiver of the rifle. I've fired it a handful of times since then and added a few extras onto it. I've added a reproduction scope cover, rubber butt pad, and aluminum shims for added accuracy and to lighten the trigger pull. All of these additions are obviously not permanent and I have all original hardware. This is consistently a 1.5-2.5 MOA gun and has always performed beautifully. I had plans of putting a timney trigger in a replacement stock and making this a fine hunting rifle. But, such is life. 

Optic: 1943 Progress 3.5 power scope. Force matched serial to the rifle. This scope was mated to the rifle at the armory and the serial number of the scope was stamped on the reciever. The glass is clear and the turrets are fully functional. The gross elevation adjustment screws are a little worn but they are locked in place. 
Stock: The stock is typical mosin fare. Stamped with numbers and letters all over. Visibly beat up with handling marks and dings. It is however straight and true. I have sanded down the fore-end to float the barrel and remove points of contact. 
Metal: The Blueing is 100%. The import marks are nicely tucked away on the underside of the barrel. 
Bore: The bore on this rifle is as good as any mosin is going to get. It looks as it did leaving the factory. Rifling is crisp and mirrored. Lands and grooves are sharp and bright as a brand new rifle. See Pictures. 

Along with the rifle I have 45 rds of conventional corrosive surplus, 28 rounds of LVE match grade brass case ammunition, two pouches with the original mosin cleaning kit, some targets, muffs, eyewear and targets. I even have the original box, wrapping, and manual the rifle came with. You really get a complete package with this. Feel free to text or email me with questions. Everything you see in the picture is what you get.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, so I will be pretty picky on trades, basically, the deal will have to make sense.  If offering a trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Below are items I will consider.  I already have several firearms in the platforms and calibers listed below along with plenty of ammunition for all, but again, I may trade if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise I will wait for cash.

Would not mind another quality 16""-18"" AR 5.56 upper, ideally a 1/8 twist, but will consider 1/7 or 1/9, medium fluted barrel(will consider others) with quality rail and BCG.  Going for best possible accuracy while keeping overall weight down.

AR-15 & AR-10 quality lowers and parts, stripped lowers is fine as I would replace any Mil-Spec FCG in the lowers.

Semi-auto rifles, AR-15 & variants, AR-10 & variants, AK-47 & variants.  

Pistols in 9mm and .45ACP(HK, Beretta, XDM 5.25"", maybe the 4.5"", depending) maybe .357 Sig or 10mm, but may consider others, revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag., maybe others.

Before further reading, I will only sell to TEXAS residents, and will NOT ship.

I have for sale a CMMG .22LR AR-15 Upper paired with an Anderson Lower. I originally bought this gun in 2012 just to have fun shooting .22s all day long at the range, while saving my .223/5.56 ammo for serious shooting. I have since purchased a variety of other small caliber rifles and no longer use this one as much. I have fired near 1000 rds through through this rifle. I will say that this platform works best with CCI (Mini-Mag/Velocitor/AR Tactical), Winchester ( SuperX), and Remington (Golden Bullet) in that order. I have experienced a few failure to feed/failure to ejects, that was really only the case when using cheap and dirty bulk 500 ct boxes or low-velocity ammo. Let me say however that I have polished both the feedramp and the chamber, and it has made a significant improvement. Minimal issues thereafter. I am selling the rifle for $450 CASH OBO. At this point I am not interested in parting out this rifle. If you have any questions at all please contact me and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Bill of Sale must be completed to take ownership, meeting place of sale will be at my chosen public location at a local gunrange. You can text me at 361-730-(five-four-three-three)

To register, click on this link: http://nrainstructors.org/SignupStudent.aspx?id=317052

We have four spots still open.

This NRA Basic Pistol Shooting Course is being taught by my, Marcos Avellan, and I'm a certified NRA Instructor who has also trained under Navy Seal Jared Ogden and Green Beret Grady Powell (both as seen on National Geographic's Ultimate Survival Alaska)- and most recently I got to train with former Navy Seal Team 6 member Zak Jackson. This is an 8 hour course (includes range time) that teaches basic handgun knowledge (both for semi-automatics and revolvers), gun handling skills, shooting fundamentals, positions, gun maintenance and much more. 

The price of the course is only $125. There are no range fees - but ammo is not included. We provide guns at no charge.

To register, click on this link: http://nrainstructors.org/SignupStudent.aspx?id=317052

Minimum age to attend the class is 13 years old and all minors must register along with a parent or legal guardian. You do not need any experience to take the course - and experienced shooters alike will learn from this course. You do NOT need to own a gun to participate, we do provide loaners pistols for those that need it.

Finishing the course also meets the state of Florida training requirements towards getting your concealed weapons permit (so you don't need to take a concealed weapons course after).

Lastly, if you have aspirations of being a NRA pistol instructor, this class is a prerequisite towards doing so.

I'm the first owner, bought it last week, have original receipt to show everything (purchase date, price, seriel number, my name etc). THIS IS A 2015 POST RECALL MODEL. This rifle is absolutely brand new unfired, not a single round through it. The gun has everything that came from the factory (box, papers, original magazine, lock etc). I also bought a brand new leupold scope rail and new Harris bipod for it when I purchased the rifle, so this rifle is already set up ready to go when you buy it, all you need to do is slap a scope on there, both the bipod and scope rail can be taken off in 30 seconds if you dont want them on there. This gun is a week old so obviously there isn't a single scratch/mark/wear on there, never even loaded or chambered. If you are interested in this Remington 700 then you already know how bad ass this gun is, this is the exact same rifle issued to Marine Snipers (USMC M40 weapon system). I'm sure you've watched plenty youtube videos on this gun, so no need for me to explain what this is. Taking a loss and selling it for $600 (I paid $900 for everything and have the receipt to show), this is the best price out there I've seen for a brand new unfired Remington 700 SPS Tactical with accessories. At this price for a brand new unfired post recall R700, I guarantee you will be extremely happy with this rifle, one of the most reliable and baddest Bolt gun that exists. Text me at REDACTED, located in Gainesville. I have summer classes in the morning so I'll be free after 3 p.m. everyday. Thanks for your time and interest.

Taking a loss and selling it for $600 (I paid $900 for everything and have the receipt to show), this is the best price out there I've seen for a brand new unfired Remington 700 SPS Tactical with accessories. At this price for a brand new unfired post recall R700, I guarantee you will be extremely happy with this rifle, one of the most reliable and baddest Bolt gun that exists. Text me at 352 328 6522, located in Gainesville. I have summer classes in the morning so I'll be free after 3 p.m. everyday. Thanks for your time and interest.

At some point in its life the adjustable rear sight was broken and was recut. The sights are usable, but no longer adjust. I was told that the original owner was a security guard, and that fits with the condition of the gun. Carried much more than it was used. Comes with a Blackhawk holster.
