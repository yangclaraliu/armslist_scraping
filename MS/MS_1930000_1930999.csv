The reviews of the gun are fabulous and they are well known for digesting any ammunition that you put into the clip. It has a great single action trigger and basically functions like a polymer 1911. I love the gun but have to sell due to a back injury.

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition, however it has a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself). You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (KY CCDW okay) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping out of state. Just email me with any questions. Serious inquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

 -- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

 "" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features. The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip. A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out. Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked. Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked. When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced. Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly. The striker serves as the ejector. ""

 Gun comes with the following:

 - 70 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (50rds of American Eagle FMJ and 20rds of Speer Gold Dot hollow points)
 - 2-7rd aftermarket mags (brand new, cost $40 each, not pictured)
 - 1-brand new reproduction firing pin (not pictured)
 - owner's manual (original)

This is exactly what the state wants you to do. They cannot imprison and felonize all holders of ""Assault Rifles"" - it's physically, financially, and legally impossible to do so.

Do not register them either - common sense and history proves that this registry is for confiscation down the road. Irrefutably guaranteed. So why do it?

You're going to let your state or government tell you that you can't defend yourself with 30+ rounds of continuous semi automatic fire in the event of an emergency or national/global disaster? That's just silly. It's your life, you should be able to adequately defend it.

Just remember, it will be DHS walking around with ""Assault Rifles"" in the event of a national disaster - do you want to be under-armed if they are not operating ethically towards you or your community? Let me be more clear - do you want them raping, pillaging, and stealing without an adequate ability to resist these actions? A lever action rifle, shotgun, or pistol is not adequate against military-grade, semi-auto rifles.

The out of state FFL's are taking you guys for a ride by undermining the prices of these guns when they purchase them from you. They have to make money as a business, but they also understand you're desperate to sell them because you don't want to be a ""felon"". Never mind that the state can't even felonize all the ""assault rifle"" owners.

You're all so worried about unethical laws - you won't be worrying about any law if you find yourself in a situation where you do actually need your ""Assault Rifle"". Think about it.

Stop the nonsense. Stop selling your ""Assault Rifles"". You might need them one day - and you won't know when that day comes till it's at your doorstep."

The 357 is a man stopper for sure, look it up, has a hell of a rep for putting people down who are shot by it.  I have two holsters.  One for your pants pocket. And another which is just a nylon.  I used to carry it in my pants pocket.  Also have two speed loaders, just in case.  Not interested in any trades, as I'm trying to come up with the money to buy a guitar.  Cash is king.  Once I find the cash for the guitar I wont' be selling this gun as I really love shooting it.  I can't take a photo as my camera is broken.  Here is a link to a photo of one above.

The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra Weapon Light features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light, more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it submersible to 22 meters. The X300 Ultra is also versatile and can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its integral ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation. Optional DG grip switches are available for use with a pistol, and an XT07 tape switch permits the X300 Ultra to be activated when attached to a long gun without altering your grip on your weapon.
Fits: Handguns and long guns with Picatinny or Universal rails. Adapter mounts available for several non-railed handguns

Not much ammo but can throw in a mag full (13) of hollow points. Feel free to reply to this add or call/text 623/888/1474. Has very minor holster wear as can be seen in pics. I haven't even put 500 rounds through it."

It has a 16 inch barrel with a training/fake suppressor. I have used it for about 8 months and shot a little over 1000 rounds through it and have had only one or two stovepipes which was probably due to the fact that I was shooting bulk ammo. This is the most reliable .22 on the market (yes even better than a 10/22). It is very accurate and very easy to clean. The bolt can be removed just like an ar-15. 

I am selling it because I bought it to train for an ar15 platform and now that I have, I want to build an ar-15. There are a few MINOR blemishes on the aluminum ""suppressor"" but otherwise it is in perfect condition. It also includes the BUIS that are on it (I have an extra back sight I can throw in). It is just as accurate and reliable as the day I bought it and it still looks brand new. I will ship directly to anyone in WI, if you are out of state I have to ship to a dealer.

I bought this pre-Clinton ban rifle NEW from Outdoor America firearms in Oklahoma City, in 1994.  I removed the blue plastic band from the trigger guard since I intended to shoot the rifle, but I never did.  So, the blue band is included with the original box.  

If you are familiar with older Springfield M1As you know they built some in .243,  7mm-08, 30-06 as well as .308.

It is the Standard grade barrel, nothing upgraded about the gun, just a very rare chambering, in the popular flat-shooting 7mm-08.

The gun is on consignment in Tulsa at the 2A Shooting Center, 4616 E. Admiral Place, REDACTED, if you want to inspect it.

The buyer will have to fill out a yellow form at 2A Shooting Center, even though it is a private seller offering, as they put the rifle on their books while in their possession."

I recently put a good bit of time into polishing the barrel and the guide rod. Gives the gun a very sharp/clean/intimidating look. I did NOT do mirror finish because I think the brushed aluminum look is very sharp and a bit easier to keep looking clean. The feed ramp has been well polished to a mirror like finish and ammo slides into position VERY easily. Ejects ammo beautifully as well. Has been well cleaned (ask me for pictures of my other weapons and you will see the OCD I have. I am also INCLUDING x2 magazines of ammo which is 26 rounds. This is 230 grain 45 FMJ ammo. I have not experienced any jams, FTFs, FTEs, or any other complications while shooting this gun. Shoots very well and the trigger pull seems even lighter than the 5.5lbs it claims. 

The XDm features: grip safety (1911 style; I prefer this to the Glock angled grip), loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator (This feature is NOT on a Glock), MATCH GRADE barrel, Major Grasp serrations (front and back of slide), minimal reset trigger (one of the smoothest I’ve felt on a 45) and fixed dovetail white 3-dot sights. 

Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, 26 rounds of 230 grain 45 ammo, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". The polishing of the barrel and guide rod is a bit expensive addition @ $50+ from someone and the extra 26 rounds (approx. $10) make this deal very fair. No rush to sell."

The retail of this backorderable item is over $200. For now, I am not very flexible on the price, but I would like to sell asap.

Please contact me with any questions or interest. My cell is 98O-O573. I will be unavailable July 30th through August 4th - please email or leave a voicemail message. Thanks for looking, Adam."

Springfield’s M1A traces its roots to the M14, adopted by the U.S. military in the late 1950s. That legacy of distinguished service continues today. Cabela’s offers three modern versions of the venerable M1A that blend all the fine attributes of this firearm’s past with the latest technology.
Available:
M1A Scout Squad™ – Fast becoming a law enforcement favorite, it has a forward-mounted optical sight base. Sights mounted forward in a scout-rifle configuration vastly improve target acquisition and provide unobstructed access to the receiver mechanism. The quick-handling 18"" barrel has six-groove rifling with a 1-in-11"" rate of twist. The two-stage military trigger is factory set at 5-6 lbs. The front sight is a national match .062"" military post, and the rear sight is a military aperture sight adjustable for windage and elevation. Also has a proprietary muzzle stabilizer and black synthetic stock. 10-round parkerized magazine included."

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.
