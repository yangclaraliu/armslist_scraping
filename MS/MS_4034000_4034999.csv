Here's the breakdown:

-DTA SRS Gen I chassis
-OD Green
-monopod

-.308 kit:

-22"" fluted barrel
-factory brake
-bolt
-1 mag
-Exactly 380rds. 168 and 175 FGMM only

-.338LM kit:

-26"" fluted barrel
-factory brake (not shown)
-thread protector
-bolt
-1 mag
-Zero rounds. I am the second owner of this rifle. It was purchased from a friend. I have no reason to doubt him. I have never even installed it.

-EXTRAS:

-custom bolt knobs from a member here. One of each kind he made. Originals included.
-custom butt pad from a member here
-Atlas bipod with QD lever and custom, sharp as fuck, SS feet.
-DTA factory soft case with shooting mat. Mint (except for some cat hair. Sorry)
-Operators Kit

-Some other factoids:

-Rifle was sent back to DTA when I first bought it to have the monopod installed. While it was there, they went through every screw and spring and replaced anything that looked out of spec. The trigger is very nice.

-As some sharp eyed members might notice, I had a small section of the top 1913 rail 
professionally machined off . When I had my S&B 5-25 mounted in a Spuhr mount, the objective bell touched the rail. It looks fine, like I said it was professionally done by my gunsmiths. The rail is of course, easily replaceable.

-The rifle has a couple of safe marks but is in very good shape. I'd rate it 95%.

I know it's Gen I. You all know it is still heavily supported. And as long as you don't try to install the barrel like you're dropping clothespins into a milk bottle (I may have dated 
myself), the pin system is fine.

-I actually love this rifle. It was my first high end bolt action as I am relatively new to the hobby. But I just got my first Surgeon Scalpel and I have an EDM .338LM/.408CT, so I really don't need this. I am not a collector, I'm more of a get the one, best gun I can for what I want to do. That said, if I never sell it, no big deal. It's that nice.

-TERMS:

-NO TRADES at this time please
-MUST go from me to your FFL . NO exceptions.
-I will NOT separate anything at this time, especially the little goodies I know some of you are eyeing. ;)
-If for whatever reason you purchase the rifle and are not satisfied as to the stated 
condition, just return it and I will refund you all of your purchase price plus your return 
shipping and transfer fees. I know that's still a PITA but life is too short to get upset over metal and polymer. Fair as I can make it.
-I ship UPS Ground with tracking number to your FFL. Insurance and/or upgraded 
shipping is extra.
-I do not mind shipping all of the accessories directly to you separately. Some times, 
goodies get ""lost"" at gunshops. Like a black hole.

PRICE IS $4250.00 firm. Payment method is certified funds in the form of bank check."

The upper is a PSA premium upper with a free floated 16"" 1/7 inch twist, A2 profile, cold hammer forged, chrome lined bore and chamber barrel made by FN.

 Class is limited to 16 students; cost is $55/student.

 In order to obtain your concealed handgun license (CHL) in Texas, you must take a class consisting of 4-6 hours of classroom instruction, a multiple choice exam, and a live fire demonstration. If the thought of sitting in a classroom for 4-6 hours of state mandated training reminds you of everything thatâs wrong with defensive driving classes, youâve come to the right place. Texas CHL classes from Hooten Armory are fun. The instructor is passionate about firearms, safety and proficiency. Our training philosophy is that if you are enjoying yourself, you will absorb more information, youâll retain it longer, and youâll be more willing to continue your education. As the saying goes, time really does fly when you are having fun.

 The course begins in the classroom and covers four topics: Handgun Use, Safe and Proper Storage of Handguns and Ammunition, Non-Violent Dispute Resolution, and the legal Use of Force. This is followed by a 25 question multiple choice exam. We will then break for lunch and meet at the range for the firearms proficiency demonstration. 

 Class will start at 8:00 AM and we should wrap up around 2-2:30 PM.

I have done extensive modifications and maintenance on this vehicle. I am selling it due to the fact that I would like something newer, and as a 2nd vehicle is no longer needed. It currently has 192k on it, will go up since it is a daily driver. It has the the straight 6, 4.0 liter engine coupled with the AX-15 5 Speed manual transmission. It has a working 4wd system that is amazing in the snow and poor weather. I originally bought this vehicle in 2014 to use as a poor weather vehicle when my other vehicle was stored. After getting into the off-road scene and seeing how expensive and time consuming it is, along with my multiple other hobbies. It was not feasible to have multiple very expensive hobbies. This vehicle has only been to the badlands once and seen mud deeper than 6 inches a hand full of times. It has never left me stranded and is in 100% perfect mechanical order. I am a Master ASE Technician at my full time job and take care of every one of my vehicles to the fullest extent. Here is the (very) long list of recent upgrades and maintenance items.

Turn signal/wiper stalk

Kicker 8"" Sub w/ box and amp will be included

Now with a vehicle that is almost 20 years old there are some known issues that I will list here.
Oil filter adapter leaks 1 drip per night
(Will include new oring)
Front fenders are smashed due to my old set up and too big of tires
Front brake lines, front bump stops and 1"" coils need to be installed for it to be functional off road
Will include bump stops, hardware and coil spacers
Floor boards are starting to rust
Rocker panels are still solid
Valve train makes a little bit of noise (normal for 4.0 liters)
Windshield is still cracked-been cracked for over 5 years, does not leak
Left front sway bar disconnect will not tighten, will make noise while turning (have tried multiple attempts to try to fix, will stay tight for a short period of time then loosen back up)
Other parts include, stainless steel rear extended brake line, spare ujoint, other misc. parts that I will 
include with the vehicle purchase. I have well over $6k in receipts not including my labor. This vehicle is far from perfect but I made it as perfect as I can with what time and money I have put into it. I would have no problem getting into it and driving for another 100k miles. There are some issues with the vehicle but nothing to hinder you from daily driving it. Don't expect a perfect vehicle. 

I am sure I am forgetting quite a few things that I have replaced. Do not hesitate to contact me for further questions or wanting to drive the vehicle. If you can't drive a stick shift then don't bother to ask me for you to test drive it. No test drives unless cash is in hand. I will only accept cash or we can go to a bank and you can have the money wired to my account. I have made this into an amazing vehicle over the past 2 years and I want to make sure it will go to a good home. Low ball offers won't even be entertained. Once again, do not hesitate to contact me and thanks for looking at my advert.

Notched safety so you can lock the bolt back. 5- 12 round drums (over $350) that run perfectly. Weapon functions great on any shell 1300fps or faster including bird shot. Example I used Estate brand cheap birdshot at 1300 fps and never had a jam. Use the super cheap shit at 1000 or 1100 fps and expect 10 to 15% FTE's. With OO buck I would not hesitate to use for home defense...she will fire.

The bad: it's not terrible. The buttstock needs replaced. Screw hole is stripped in stock. Gun is fine. I placed a couple drops of gorilla glue just to hold screw in. Easily replaced. Get a different style! That small metal butt plate wasn't any fun anyway. Stripped stock or not that thing needed to go. Other thing is the 20 round drum I got used and it falls out of the gun shooting if you don't hold it. Maybe you can fix it but some genius who had it before ground on the lug that locks it in. It might be fixable though. Regardless it's free and not factored in the price.

All in all the gun just needs a stock and I would bust out the Krylon and do a 2 tone or camo  job on it...maybe cerakote. Something to really set it off looks wise. The gun works well and priced right. Well travel but not far, prefer pickup with your CPL in hand. I'm a stickler about who I would sell a gun too. We can't have them in the wrong hands anymore than they already are. Any questions please text 517 662 94 zero 9. Thanks for reading.

Comes complete with travel case, 5 new, unused OPUS Nasal Mask kits, 5 hydration chambers (4 used but clean, 1 still in sealed packaging), 5 ClimateLine hoses which are heated hoses and are unused and in sealed packaging, and 2 power supply setups. One is the standard 115V and the other is a 12V DC setup where you can plug directly into an automotive 12V DC socket or connect directly to a 12V automotive or marine battery. This unit is great for camping, just bring a good 12V battery. I used this unit in 2012 on an elk hunt in SW Colorado. It can get pretty chilly in late October at 8000 feet. The heated hose stops condensation inside the hose and allows you to sleep without having to clear water out of the line every couple of hours It is also very useful to have the 12V capability if you live somewhere subject to overnight or long-term power outages. I value all this at $600. Will sell for $500 cash. What have you got in terms of guns for trade?"

PLRF15C's specifications and features mirror those of PLRF15's yet PLRF15C also includes Vectronix' industry-leading 3-dimensional, 360Â° digital magnetic compass. The handheld is a small, compact, lightweight handheld laser range finder that provides target range up to 3,000 m. The additional compass capability provides azimuth, elevation, and cant angle as well as horizontal distance and height difference - not only between the observer and an object, but also between two remote objects. These capabilities in a small, lightweight, easy-to-use handheld allows users to multi-task while remaining in a constant state of readiness.

PLRF15C also contains crystal-clear optics, operates in multiple environments, and is water resistant.

Only thing I would take for it would be a tactical rifle in .338 Lapua (Accuracy Intl, Barret, McMillan, Sako TRG ... etc. No Savage)

Pay by money order and I can do this though my FFL if you don't fell confident. Or in person with cash. E-mail me directly at bignickshooting at gmail dot com.

Parents are both excellent hunting retrievers. The sire is a Fox Red Labrador with a Master Hunter Title and is the son of a 2x Grand Hunting Retriever Champion (Fox Red shown in pictures). Every dog in the sire's 3 generation pedigree has a title for either Master Hunter, Field Trial Champion, or Hunting Retriever Champion. Dam of the litter has a calm/affectionate temperament ideal for the home, yet she is as birdy as can be when she takes to the field. She began retrieving for live hunts at the age of 10 months and has made hundreds of retrieves in her first 2 hunting seasons. 

Litter is expected to be born at the end of February, and puppies sent to their new homes mid-late April. 
$800 for either gender. 
$200 deposit reserves a pick in the order of deposits paid. 

Puppies will go fast once they hit the ground. Reserve your pick ASAP.

I had the bolt group blued by a gunsmith to prevent any rust or unneeded shininess. Trigger has also been worked and smoothed out. Bore is CHROME LINED and looks amazing. Virtually no kick and shoots straight as an arrow, and being an SKS it is built like a tank. Also will come with a muzzle break in 1-14LH thread brand new but i never got the threads cut on the barrel. I love this rifle just want to see what kinds of cash or trade offers i get. So send me one, who knows i may take it. And no I will not take anything close to $500 cash, sorry for that i am happy keeping it. Located in hutchinson, but for the right deal i can meet anywhere in kansas. Respond to the email link provided. Thanks. Will take trades + cash or may trade up to your rifle + cash on my end. Just send me am offer."
