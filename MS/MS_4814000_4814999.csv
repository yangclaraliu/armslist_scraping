Nice Swedish Mauser that has been converted to a sporter. 6.5x55 caliber. All numbers match. No import marks which is an extra plus.

I am assuming it originally was a model 1938 looking at the straight grip on the stock stock and 24"" barrel. What is a huge plus is the stock disk has no Swede armorer markings for 1, 2, 3 bore condition, meaning the bore is perfect. Very tight action for a Swede, meaning it has not been shot alot. 

The custom work done is as follows. New bolt handle that is also blued, fixed high steel rings mounted directly in the receiver for a stronger scope mount, (looks to be quality Leupold rings), and a trigger job. The chrome looks to be polished too. The military stock is really nice with a nice heavy and even gloss finish. Has a sling stud for the back, but not for the front. I myself would install a sling barrel band a few inches in front of the end of the stock.

Also comes with an extra Boyd custom stock. The Boyd stock is $150 new shipped and that is unfinished. This one is finished with a nice even satin finish, including the inside. A few small nicks here and there, but nothing major. The Boyd stock also has sling studs. VERY QUALITY stock.

$375 FTF or $425 shipped CONUS. 

Honestly, this is really a nice sporterized Swedish Mauser with some time consuming work done on it. And either stock fits great as I like the way both feel.

NO TRADES PLEASE.

Thanks.

This rifle was manufactured on December 30th 2005 and is definitely one of the better actions. The trigger has been worked and is extremely crisp and fairly light. This rifle prints SUB MOA groups. It has the HS Precision green webbing stock, not the cheaper Bell and Carlson. It is a safe queen and has had maybe 200 rounds put through it. The pictures do not do it justice. The Nikon Monarch scope and sling are NOT included, but the 20 MOA Weaver base is. This caliber is no longer offered by Remington in this model and the ones on Gunbr*ker are asking more than mine and have the cheaper Bell and Carlson stocks. Notice the larger palm swell on the HS Precision stock in the picture. Stocks alone sell for $400.  Several folks have asked and yes the barrel is fluted and 26"" in length. 

Might take a partial trade, interested in the 22-250 caliber. 

Thanks for looking

This was my personal rifle that I took to shows to show off my work/products. Due to a broken transmission in my wife's car,  I am selling this rifle. Here's a quick rundown: American Spirit Arms non reciprocating side charging upper w/ bcg. Custom billet lower. Spikes Tactical cold hammer forged 16"" barrel. Unique AR's 15"" Skulls & Wings handrail. LaRue RAT stock with internal cleaning kit. B.A.D. ambi safety. Odin Works EMR mag release. BCM grip. Done in a Tombstone Gray and Cherry Red Duracoat! I will sell this unfired custom rifle for the cost of discounted parts only, if paying with cash. Which is $1000.00. If you are trading, it will be retail parts price of $1300. Either one of these is an excellent deal! But CASH is preferred! If trading, I am not interested in antique guns of any  sort. No Hi Point. No Taurus. etc.... The gun can be seen at my AR-15 accessories shop in Fairview. Any part that I have in stock that you would like to add or change can be arranged. I will not meet you. You will need to come here if interested. I will also consider 60 day lay-a-way on the $1300 price with 1/3 cash down. So in all, I'm trying to make this a very reasonable offer. Yes I know the AR market is flat! Yes I know you can buy a DPMS or Bushmaster for $500! But you can't find one like this for that price. And if you buy one of them and build it like this one, you'll have more into it. So if I haven't scared you away by now, come take a look at this rifle. Thanks everyone, and have a great day!

If a long enough time passes without interest I will lower the price myself.

Hogue uses a cobblestone (stippled) surface on this grip instead of traditional checkering for a modern feel and excellent grip control in any condition. The finger grooves on the front of the grip are an affordable alternative to front strap checkering and are preferred by many competition shooters for rapid, accurate shooting. The material is solvent and oil resistant which means it will not deteriorate or dissolve due to cleaning your firearm. Specifications: - Fits: Sig Sauer P238 with Finger Grooves - Color: Black"

Some Electric Airsoft Rifles come with semi-automatic fire. That means that when you pull the trigger only 1 BB will come out at a time. Other Electric Airsoft Rifles come with full-automatic fire. This means that when you pull the trigger multiple BBs will come out at a time. The longer you hold the trigger down the more BBs come out. Check the description above to see which kind of gun this is and if it is right for you. Electric Airsoft Rifles don't require any pumping or cocking, just simply point and shoot. This is a High End Electric Airsoft Gun. Please only use .20 gram high quality BBs with this item in order to keep it in proper working order. Using anything else as ammunition for this gun will void the warranty and may cause it to jam. Also, to keep your Electric Airsoft Gun working properly, do not fire the gun when there are no BBs in it as it may cause damage to your gun.

This is Mossberg’s 464 Lever Action descendant of John M. Browning’s 1894 Winchester. Type is lever action repeating carbine. Manufacturer and warrantor is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, TX. We believe its production utilized Winchester Machinery; Winchester closed in 2007, and the 464 appeared in 2008, only 9 miles from the Winchester plant. Construction is blued steel metal, with polymer cartridge follower and tang safety button. Shell carrier is contoured milled steel, a vast improvement over the stamped carriers from 1960s Winchesters. Forend and buttstock are satin finished smooth hardwood. Barrel is 20 inches with six groove 1:10 right hand rifling; chambering is .30-30 Winchester caliber. Tubular magazine holds six rounds, so 6+1 capacity. Front sight is dovetailed steel blade, with brass tip. Rear sight is blued steel windage and elevation adjustable cantilever folding leaf type with white diamond inlay, no step elevator needed, and 94 Winchester elevators frequently got lost in the woods anyway. Action includes the traditional lever safety, where the hammer will not fall without the lever being firmly gripped; it also includes a tang safety that prevents the hammer from contacting the firing pin while it is engaged. Receiver has a steel connector section that is drilled for a Weaver 403 scope mount base, front and rear, or similar rail. Hammer is drilled for a screw in spur, not included. Trigger is two stage .270 smooth face steel, and pulls in a crisp 5 pound vicinity with negligible felt creep. Buttstock is classic straight tang 1894 Winchester type, oil finished hardwood; its length of pull measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 1/2 inch lined rubber recoil pad. Buttstock cant is mild, less than 3/4 inch right hand, so this rifle is relatively southpaw friendly. Weight empty is 6 pounds 12 ounces, with center of gravity at the breech face. This 464 and its mates come to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. They served light duty, likely with Mossberg’s reps and writers. We call them factory demos. Each one has the letter U stamped near its serial number. Surface detractions are minimal, really no more streaking and faint edge whitening than what one sees on many new display guns in stores. Each 464 comes in a relabeled factory box with lock and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement. If it has been fired at all, we estimate it was fewer than 20 times. No more than 1 in 5 of its mates left any green copper on our cleaning patches. We rate them as Excellent, 90 to 95 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. Replacement pricing is $530 on mossberg com. Replacement pricing on a Japanese 1894 Winchester is $1200. We’re offering the Mossberg 464 Blue & Hardwood Lever Action in the photos, however, for only $ 319.00. Any ammunition or personnel showing in our photos are Not included.

This rifle was purpose built for precision and has been nothing but exactly that. The 2lb Two stage trigger, Vortex scope with parallax adjustment and the 20"" Wylde barrel come into play when attempting to tag targets or game at farther distances. Maybe has 200rnds through it and has been a bench rifle, no rough usage. This gun is clean inside and out and the nickel boron bcg helps keep it that way. I love this rifle but I am leaning down a different avenue and sadly she has to go. The Vortex Crossfire 2, 20rnd Pmag and the Strike Industries muzzle brake will be included on the weapon."

Easily over $2K in this build. I'm asking $1100 (dropped the price to $900 for a quick sale). It has four mags through it. There are no dents, dings, or scratches on the rifle. It's a backup for a backup so it doesn't get much playtime. I'm getting into other platforms so some fat has to be trimmed. 

The Aimpoint (Comp M4) pictured isn't included in the price. If you want it I'll do $250 for it. It's got some battle scared places (mostly on the mount knob). It has a tour in Afghanistan on it. It functions perfectly, no scratches on the glass.  I'd trust it with my life.  If you want it with the rifle I'll do $150.
