The Rossi Princess Revolver      
 Rossi Princess - Model 25 
 There is virtually nothing in print about the Rossi Princess revolver.  It does not appear in the Bluebook of Gun Values or the Standard Catalog of Firearms.  I could find no mention of older Rossi firearms, such as the Princess, on the company’s U.S. or Brazilian websites.  I find the gun first listed in Gun Digest in 1966, where it is described as the Rossi Ladysmith, imported by Benet Arms.  Most examples I have seen are stamped FIREARMS INT’L CORP., WASHINGTON, D.C.  Rossi firearms were later imported by Interarms, but I don’t believe they ever imported the Princess. 
Externally the Princess is a copy of the third model Smith & Wesson Ladysmith, but the lockwork is quite different.  It has coil springs instead of flat springs and features an Iver Johnson-style transfer bar and a rebounding firing pin.
Pete Dickey’s article in the September 1982 issue of American Rifleman states that the Princess’s frame is die cast from “Zamak,” a zinc-based alloy which incorporates aluminum, magnesium, and copper.  Zamak is often denigrated as potmetal.  However, it has been pointed out to me by an engineer friend that Zamak is a family of alloys and that the strongest one, Zamak 2, is substantially stronger than commonly-used high strength aluminum alloys.  
The Princess was manufactured from 1957 through approximately 1985, but was only imported into the United States from 1965 through 1969--another victim of the Gun Control Act of 1968.  From the serial numbers I have seen, it looks as though close to a million were made.*  The Princess was available with a 2- or 3-inch barrel, in nickel finish only.  The 2-inch barrel version was designated by Rossi as the Model 25, and the 3-inch barrel version was the Model 13.  The model designations are rarely used in the United States.
When the gun first hit the U.S. market it seems to have been called a Ladysmith by default, but another trade name was needed for it and some marketing genius decided on “Princess.”  A less-macho appellation could not have been had, but I suppose some similar name was inevitable given the gun’s diminutive size and resemblance to the Ladysmith.
The serial number is on the base of the grip.  My gun is marked on the left side of the barrel AMADEO ROSSI & CIA, and on the second line SÃO LEOPOLDO R.B.  The right side of the barrel is marked .22 L.R.  The right side of the frame is stamped MADE IN BRAZIL and features the Rossi trademark.  Beneath the cylinder on the right side is the importer’s name and address:  FIREARMS INT’L CORP., WASHINGTON, D.C.   The grips are cheap checkered plastic with the Rossi name in a circle at the top.

The examples of the 2-inch barrel Princesses I have seen all have a ramp front sight, whereas all the 3-inch barrel versions I have seen have a Rocky Mountain style blade with an integral base.  I have noted three different grip plate styles--two in brown plastic, one style small (that doesn’t cover the rear screw on the right side) and one large (that partially covers the screw), and another large style in pearlite plastic.  I have also noted two different logos on the right side of the gun.  The first is a monogram of the company initials, “ARC,” in a circle, which seems to appear on guns with five-digit serial numbers.  The second, and more common logo, is the word “Rossi” in a circle.

I would estimate 95% condition for its age, but there are some little pits on the very edges of the slide. Look more like from pocket cary than corrosion. Fully functions and runs through rounds cleanly. Every once and a while when just cycling rounds without firing one will get a little hung and you will have to put a little power behind pulling the still stiff slide. That's pretty common with these small Italian made calibers, as the specs for modern 25 ammo isn't as tight as it was in the 50s. No issues at all when firing, but I've only put about 20 rounds through it. Just got a baby browning so looking to sell or maybe trade for something interesting.  Comes with 1 clip and I can probably scratch up a 50 round box of 25 auto ammo, pretty hard to come by these days."

So I have decided I want to sell or trade my colt diamondback, some info on the gun, overall it looks to be in great shape, original grips, has the box and papers (box is not original). It does look like it has been fired but from the looks of it very little. Also has a faint turn line on the cylinder and some slight wear on sharp edges of cylinder it's not bad but it is there. Now for the blemishes, has a faint scratch behind the horse, and another below the hammer. Looks to have some slight wear on front right side and is pictured below, very hard to even see need the right lighting to even tell. Overall the condition of this gun is good, it's not flawless but for a gun made back in 1978 it is great. Please ask for more pictures, I could only get three to post but I have many I can email you. The gun is honestly in good condition I'm just trying to be extremely thorough incase I have to ship there will be no surprises.

On a side note if you have a colt python 357 with a 6 inch barrel and it has been used as a shooter. Let me know I'm sure we can work something out. 

All reasonable offers will be responded to. Multi gun trades or partial trades will be considered as well."

Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts. Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG-2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control.

Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock. Made in U.S.A. ITAR International Traffic in Arms Regulations Controlled Product.

Fitting to a carbine with a collapsible stock will require a rifle-length receiver extension tube, rifle buffer and spring (not included). The PRS AR10/SR25 stock may be used on AR15/M16 rifles to provide additional charging handle clearance. Stock is not compatible with Bushmaster BAR-10 and Rock River Arms LAR-8 due to additional charging handle to cheek riser interference issues. * Optional PRS Extended Rubber Butt-Pad, 0.80"" adds 0.50 in. LOP and 0.07 lb. vs. standard pad.

WAY BACK. I know they are at least 45 years old but the ammo looks fine. One box of Hornady Frontier 50 round box with 30 still in it. One box of Federal 30 carbine with 12 still in it and they look fine. Still has the K Mart price tag of 1.82 on it. Boy have times changed. The Western Super X box is just as old it has 4 silver tip 30/30s in it and they look fine. Make any reasonable offer and come and get them before they go in the trash tomorrow.
