This pistol is in fantastic working condition. Highly maintained and has a ""D"" spring installed. This also has the slightly shorter 4.7"" match barrel. These Vertecs make the Beretta 92 fit smaller hands and are amazing to hold. I'm the original owner of this particular pistol. Round count is around 800 total. It has some wear on the rail from constant on and off tac light use, and very small holster wear. otherwise it's in great shape! It has 5 mags all factory Beretta. 3 15rd mags and 2 20rd mags. Barrel/bore and chamber are chrome lined, Trigger is very nice and crisp with the D spring installed. :P Will come with extra recoil spring and stock hammer spring. Action is BUTTER SMOOTH!

Has a nice new monte carlo stock and scope mounts.  When the rifle was re-barreled the magazine well was not modified from the original 7x57 round.  Therefore the shorter 7.62x39 rounds must be inserted at the front of the magazine well to function properly.  It is a solid rifle in a very popular round that is one of the lesser expensive ones.

For sale is the ultimate .40 package.  Below I've listed everything in the package.

The Kel-tec Sub 2000 has about 1200 rounds through it and it runs great.  It has an OD green Houge Grip, Upgraded cheek rest, TactEdge green/red dot, upgraded shoulder pad, and AFG grip.  You usually can't add an optic to these rifles and have to use the terrible plastic sights from the factory.  I've modified this rifle so you can use the optic and still break it down for easy storage.  I've run about 750 rounds through it in this configuration and it works really well.

The Glock 23 is a GEN 4 and has about 600 rounds through it.  It has bright green Tru Dot nights installed currently.  It also comes with it's original box.

I purchased this shotgun last year and shot it only a handful of times before I received another 20 gauge. I shot about 215 rounds through it, and they were nearly all 3/4 oz. light skeet loads. I patterned it with 5 turkey rounds, 5 goose rounds, and shot 5 goose loads on one early season hunt, so it has barely even been broken in. Because I mostly shoot skeet, I shoot my O/U all the time now, so I am going to let this one leave the gun cabinet. It is a great gun and I honestly hate to lose it, but it literally just sits there and needs someone to shoot it. I bought some aftermarket chokes for hunting as well. It is a great shooter, has never failed to cycle, and is a nice soft shooter and a great upland and waterfowl gun. Perfect for someone carrying it all day, young shooters, or female shooters. I put a 1/16"" cheek eez comb pad on the stock to offer a better cheek weld and raise the comb just a bit. It can be easily removed though (I have done this to other firearms and have had no marks or issues with removing it). The firearm comes with factory IC, M, and F Invector Plus chokes, as well as 5 Carlson's extended sporting clays chokes in SKT, IC, LT Mod, M, and IM, and also a Pattern Master short range/decoy choke and a long range choke. I also have an interchangeable HiViz fiber optic front sight on it with optional red, green, or white bead. I have the box and all the papers as well. New, this setup cost me $1384 + tax, I'm asking $1125 O.B.O.  Thanks for looking, and if you have any questions feel free to ask through armslist or call or text: (Six one 6) 55 zero - 37 two zero. I also have more pictures.

And on a side note, if you think a 20 is light for geese, I'm here to tell you it works great. The PatternMaster long range and 1oz. of HEVI-Steel #2 dropped every goose on one shot at 30-35 yards. I do take my 12 most of the time, but I had no better success with my 12 than I did with my 20."

Magpul CTR stock
Magpul AFG
Troy ambi mag release
Troy ambi bolt release lever
ALG Defense trigger
BCM Gunfighter charging handle
Troy QD sling adapter

LWRC sets the standard for the AR-15, and this example is no exception. It is accurate, reliable, easy to clean – all thanks to the piston system. Shoots like a dream, and with the ALG Defense (sister company of Geiselle) trigger, it feels even better. The fit and finish on an LWRC is second to none - the high standard of quality is apparent throughout this rifle.

I took off the typical SOPMOD stock because that stock amplifies the sound of the buffer/spring in your ear. The Magpul CTR is rock solid with no annoying noises. 

I have added a couple of ambi controls, a QD sling adapter, an AFG, and a BCM charging handle all simply for ergonomic reasons. They all work, and they all work very well.

The Trijicon ACOG (TA31RCO-M4CP, red chevron reticle) is an amazing 4x optic, with clear glass, and fiber-optic illuminated reticle that never needs batteries. It is nearly ideal for this rifle, because the optic was designed around a 14.5in barrel and this rifle has a 14.7in barrel (straight from the factory with a pinned/welded A2 ""birdcage"" device to comply with the law). The optic is zeroed at 100yds for 55gr ammunition.

This is the pride and joy of my collection, but I am selling it to put the money towards a Rifle Dynamics AK and my own build projects."

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.
RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

This thing is a blast to shoot and has been 100% reliable with every part I’ve replaced and every ammo choice I’ve ever put through it albeit with a low round count (less than 150).

I adjusted the trigger to have as little pre-travel as possible while having a solid, reliable reset (you can adjust it to whatever your preference is). Trijicon night sights like the ones on this Glock are on nearly all of my pistols at this point because they work and are top-notch quality. The Sprinco recoil buffer and spring assembly makes the .45 ACP round a joy to shoot, and the extended mag release is a must-have in my book for the full-size, larger-caliber Glocks."

The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided.

Beretta 92SB Compact. This is a rare version of the Beretta that was made specifically for the Air Force during handgun trials to determine the replacement of the 1911. 
It comes with 2-13rd mags and a holster. 
This pistol has the safety/decocker as well as a half-cock ability. This is a compact version of the full sized 9mm and has very manageable/low recoil. It is perfect for women with it's smaller grip and ease of shooting.
It has some bluing wear, is missing the PB medallion on the left grip and has a small chip in the left grip as well. Replacement wood grips are still available for this pistol for the original look/config or, you can add Hogue or plastic Beretta grips to your liking. 
I prefer FTF in the NOLA area but will ship on the buyers dime, about $30, to an FFL. ID required that shows proof of age.

Power aside, what really sets the Solo apart is quality, dependability and 1911 ergonomics that ensure comfortable shootability regardless of hand size. This all comes together to put Solo performance in a class by itself.

With a barrel length of just 2.7 inches, Solo pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Many of the features borrowed from 1911 pistols also make them exceptionally safe. A manual ambidextrous thumb safety, checkered slide release and ambidextrous magazine release button enable fast and intuitive operation. Then there is the single action striker-fired trigger pull–even and smooth.

Solo frames are machined from the finest aluminum and finished in KimPro II, a premium finish that is self-lubricating and extremely resistant to salt and moisture. Slides and barrels are cut from stainless steel. Edges are rounded and blended, slide serrations are deep enough to really work and the dovetail-mounted 3-dot sights are quick to target. No other small pistol can compare."

Offered here is a French Berthier ""Mousqueton de Artillerie Modèle 1892 Modifié 1916"". Marked Châtellerault. This rifle is dated 1916 and is marked with the ""N"" on the receiver. Stock, barrel, and trigger guard match. Lock-up is tight and I have personally fired this weapon at 100 yard range and determined it is just as the little carbine is known to be -- very sturdy and accurate! A real pleasure to shoot. The bore is good and I have found no rust or pitting. Rifling is strong. 

Here is a link to comments on my rifle. One estimate of value was 300 Euros ($315) for the rifle alone.
http://forums.gunboards.com/showthread.php?389846-New-Addition-Berthier-M-16

These guns are not too often found in America. 

Small cut located at bottom of stock is not someone's attempt at making a sporter, but is the site of a French-done wood repair that must have fallen out over the years. This is very common. Also, slot in bottom of stock is not missing sling swivel by accident, but was removed by the French for the Artillery carbine and just never sealed up. Overall, rifle has that nice battle-damaged appearance while still offering a completely strong and serviceable rifle. A piece of history straight from WWI! 

Comes with 4 original 5-shot Mannlicher clips and 48 rounds of black primer (best in my experience) 8mm Lebel ammo. 

Thanks for your time and shoot me an email!

Designed as a more compact alternative to bulky, full-sized Beretta M92F service pistols, the 8040 series handguns offer a good compromise between concealability, ease of carry, accuracy and firepower. Beretta has been able to develop an ergonomically advanced pistol, compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges with great fire capacity and extraordinary long life. The unique 8000 Series rotating barrel channels part of the recoil energy into barrel rotation and partially absorbs the barrel and slide recoil shock through the central block before it is transferred to the frame allowing Cougars to achieve unusually low felt recoil. The 8040 is calibered for .40 S&W rounds."

This was a project gun from when I had a surplus of fun-money. I put approximately $1200 into the rifle from start to finish, but I understand that I'll never get that much back out of it. I'll be funding a new project, however, so I'm moving on from this one. Here are the specs:

Archangel stock in black
5-round removable magazine
Free-floated barrel
Timney trigger pack (amazing trigger!)
Custom bent bolt (made from original bolt)
Barrel cut to 16"" and threaded
Muzzle brake
Duracoat in FDE
Drilled and tapped receiver
Rail attached over receiver
Scope is 6-14x50, illuminated reticle with 3-color options and 7 brightness levels

If you're looking for a great custom rifle that's already tuned and ready to go, you'll love this one! Feel free to make an offer, as I understand that this is a custom rifle and will have more value to some than others. Contact me through e-mail, or at 7 seven 5 8 4 eight 5 6 nine 3. Thanks!"

See my other listings.  Pics here are only a SAMPLE of the firearms.

I will be removing all posts after Sunday evening.

Prices are on each post, HOWEVER:  Take them all and save a lot!  

Remington 700 .30-06 with Redfield 3x9 scope:  $475   Scope isn't in great shape so consider it a 'freebie'.

SKS - Perfect condition - No issues.  Will throw in a generic branded ""Sniper"" short scope:  $400

Parker Hale Model 1200 Super - .30-06 with Nikkor (Nikon) Scope:  $425

Glock 36 - Gen 3 - Like New:  $425

Glock 21 - Gen 3 - Excellent+ Condition:  $425

Savage Model 93R17 .17 HMR with BSA Sweet 17 scope:  $275

The prices I've listed are well below the going rates for all of these.  If you bought them all individually from me, you'd spend $3000.

If you want them all together, I'D SELL EVERYTHING TOGETHER for  $2300 AND throw in (free) a Winchester Model 12 Shotgun (also in excellent condition!)  (Safe is not included in this).  Your total value will exceed $3000

Why am I doing this?  It's simple.  I have 3 safes FULL, I'm moving out of state and I'm not moving all 3!

I'm cleaning out firearms which I don't really need (safe queens).   If you'll watch my ads closely over the next 2 weeks, I'll also have a safe for sale:   Cannon Safari 36 gun (electronic lock) for $400.  Note:  the safe won't be available for you to pick up until 23rd of May."
