It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap.The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.  We currently have this firearm in stock, and have it priced to sell quickly for just $539.

You can convert the rifle that you range to cost pennies a round instead of 40 cents a round to shoot.  Just pin the upper to your favorite lower and feed it QUALITY ammunition and you will have a great time. You do have to clean it, lubricate it and feed it a diet of good 22lr ammunition for best performance.

This upper feels like a quality component - it has good weight and feels almost exactly like shooting a normal AR upper without the cost or the recoil.  Great for women or children.

As you can see from the pictures it is mounted on a full mil-spec lower.  I am NOT selling the lower with the upper.

This is a great deal.  Comes with bolt carrier group, charging handle, cleaning brush, the barreled upper and the original box and 26 round magazine.

This is an original, not a century or arsenal rebuild. I have worked the harmonics down as far as I can, as well as worked the trigger a bit. It’s all original, just shoots really well. At 200 meters, surplus ammo is almost going thru the same ragged hole. I’m also including 50 rounds of new manufacture 185 grain ammo, and a translated Soviet Mosin Nagant sniper manual. This is the original manual issued to Soviet troops, just translated into English, not the U.S. Army manual created for U.S. troops. I can also include the original cleaning gear, cleaning rod, bayonet, sling, etc. to answer a few questions that have risen, the import was thru Century, the serial number was electro penciled (stamping was rare as the impact of the hammer and stamp could severely damage the optic), and all serial numbers match (receiver, stock, furniture, bolt, and scope mount). The serial number on the scope mount matches, but is in Latin letters, not Cyrillic, indicating it was built for the Ukrainian territory (remember, Ukraine used to be a soviet satellite state), and was certified as a soviet built sniper rifle by the Ukrainian government. I also, have no problem meeting, and allowing anyone to test fire the rifle, I understand it can be an investment, and I respect that. I used to do ww2 reenacting, and am having to resign my commission as a German Officer due to family obligations that take precedence. I am asking $800, but am open to non-insulting offers.

I got this from a long time collector. He has been collecting for over 60 years. He never let's anything go. He is now 86 and his wife said it's time. My dad purchased springfield 1903 and I purchased the Smith Corona. This rifle was purchased over 30 years ago and have been in a safe ever since. This has never been fired by original owner neither did I. Took the bolt apart and the bolt was absolutely clean. Still had some of the old brown grease around the spring. It has light handling use and everything functions as it should. The rifle is dated 1943. It has all the original cartoushes. Never been sanded, never been reblued or parkarized. Took it to a guy that is also a collector for many years and is also a dealer. He checked this rifle all over. No Remington parts all smith corona. He said this has never been altered in anyway. He rated it out of 1 through 10, meaning 10 fresh out of a box, 1 being the worse shape. He rated it a 8.5. He said the barrel has 4 grooves, which is early. There is nothing bad about the rifle, 100% correct. The trigger dust cover has some marks. I have a few ar15's and I like assault rifles. This style rifle even though beautiful I'd rather have another AR. I would like to find a Colt green label or blue label AR15 A2 HBAR. With bayonet lug ( MINT) must be mint. I would like to find one like I carried. Doesn't have to have the box. As long as it has not been altered in anyway. I have seen A few smith corona 1903a3 's listed on Guns America and Gun Broker web site ranging from. 1200 to 1600 and still not as nice as mine. Also wanted to add this rifle is not sporterized, nor imported or a NRA   purchase. This is the real deal. Anyway, would like a colt sporter HBAR like new. Let me know if interested. We can talk.

Rifle is in good shape. I went through and cleaned it up round count is at about 700-1000. I added Magpul MOE handguards with a Magpul Vertical grip. It also has a Blackhawk pistol grip and standard Sig Sauer collapsible butt stock.   It shoots great but like I said not feeling it. I'm more of a bolt gun kind of guy.  

 Trade offers welcome but please realize this was an 1100 gun without the optic :-) been looking at getting in to a P229  or a .308 AR or nice bolt action gun. Cash is king. Call/text with any questions.

The gun is in perfect mechanical and cosmetic condition. Hard carry case, lock, two 7rd mags, and all factory literature are included with this handgun. The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.Calibers: 32 AUTOWeight unloaded: 6.6 oz. 186gLoaded magazine: 2.8 oz. 81gLength: 5.1"" 129mmHeight: 3.5"" 89mmWidth: .75"" 19mmBarrel Length: 2.7"" 68mmSight radius: 3.8"" 97mmMuzzle Energy Max: 200ft-lbs 270JCapacity: 7 + 1 roundsTrigger Pull: 5 lbs 23NCome check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

Dealers and organizations may take any extras we have on hand at the same per-rifle price and with no additional shipping charges. Mossberg’s 4x4 rifles entered the field in 2007, after the company’s 40 year hiatus from high powered rifle manufacturing. Mossberg got it right, and here is the 4x4’s offspring, the Mossberg Patriot with American Walnut Stock chambered in the venerable .30-06 Springfield caliber. Manufacturer and warrantor is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT, and Eagle Pass, TX. Type is bolt action high powered rifle with detachable magazine and 75 degree bolt throw. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, and receiver with polymer trigger housing, and removable internal polymer magazine. Chambering is .30-06 Springfield, with 4 shot magazine, so 4+1 total capacity. Barrel is 22 inch fluted, 1:10 right hand six groove button rifling; completely free floating, with counter bored or recessed muzzle crown. Outside barrel diameter is .620 at the muzzle and .730 at the forend tip and end of the flutes. Metal finish is non glare matte blue, with matching bolt face, handle, and gas deflecting cowl; and with spiral fluted matte finish steel bolt. This rifle comes furnished with mounted Weaver Scope Bases, #51 front and #36 rear, that measure 4 1/4 inches between their closest slots; screw spread is 4 5/8 inches. Safety is very quiet, mounted on the right side behind the bolt handle. Stock is classic satin finish American Walnut, with Monte Carlo and lateral stippled panels on the forend and pistol grip areas. Sling swivel studs are QD blue steel. Length of pull is 14 inches from the LBA Lightning Bolt Action trigger face to the end of the 1 inch decelerator type recoil pad. Weight empty is 6 pounds 14 ounces, with center of gravity 1 inch back of the bolt lugs. Trigger is factory LBA type, set on its 3 pound vicinity off the line setting, with negligible felt creep. This Patriot comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, where it likely served light duty as a showgirl for Mossberg’s sales team or with their publicity writers. It has the letter U stamped near its serial number. Surface detractions are minimal, principally faint contact marking on the stock and barrel. We rate it as Excellent, 90 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. If this rifle was ever fired, it was no more than 50 to 100 times. Fewer than 1 in 5 of its mates showed any green copper on our cleaning patches. It comes in a relabeled Mossberg factory box with lock and instruction manual that contains Mossberg’s warranty statement, two years on the Patriot. Replacement pricing on walnut stocked rifles from competitors Remington and Browning is in the $1000 range.

The newest .223/5.56mm 30 round Improved Magazine from Brownells delivers a significant increase in reliability for the battle-tested M16, M4 and AR weapon systems. The Improved Magazine effectively reduces the risk of magazine-related stoppages by more than 50 percent compared to the older magazine variants. Identified by a tan-colored follower and coveted by U.S. soldiers, Government Agencies and sought after by civilian shooters alike, The Brownells 30 round Improved magazines are renowned for reliable feeding and flawless performance in any Mil-Spec AR-15 compatible platform. These magazines are comparable to the newest Okay Industries magazine called ""SureFeed®"", with their newest retail version selling for almost twice the cost. The Brownells magazines are 100% made in the U.S.A. with components that meet or exceed demanding Mil-Spec requirements. The magazine bodies & floor plates are made from lightweight aluminum and heat treated to Mil-Spec for strength and durability. All magazines are hard coat anodized with a Mil-Spec dry film lube grey finish. A four-way, anti-tilt, self-lubricating non-hygroscopic resin follower and high performance Mil-Spec stainless steel spring keep rounds properly aligned and tensioned for flawless performance. I have personally fired well over 1500-1600 rounds through these without a single malfunction. These magazines will not be shipped to California, Colorado, Hawaii, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, District of Columbia, Connecticut and some parts of Illinois. Please do not purchase this magazine if you are having your order shipped to one of the above states. 35$ shipping via USPS Priority mail. Payment via credit, debit or money order. Please contact me for greater quantities if available. I will also sell 20 magazine lots for 180$ and 20$ shipping. Please no trades or partial trades. Not interested in a cubic zirconia, used scopes, Xbox 360's and 150$, thank you! Face to face purchase is fine as long as a time and location is not dependent on the alignment of all of the planets!

This isn't just a off the fly transaction we will be waiting about a week to week and a half so we can pay some bills before she buys.

She is not really wanting to spend more then 300ish. Needs to be compact given her hand size. she will prefer a 9mm but she will take a .380 if rightly priced (she wants 9mm but I told her should start off with .380 untill used to shooting.)

NOTE: Given her lack of knowledge in firearms and her wanting to start to go shooting on her own I will handle talks about price given the last ass hole tried to just screw her over. 

Also to those of you trying to peddle used guns at full retail price.... I am aware guns retain their value HOWEVER given new laws requiring background checks if we wanted to pay full new reatail price with cost of background check ILL JUST TAKE HER TO A DAMN FFL DEALER AND BUY NEW.

I have never shot this rifle, but the previous owner used it to hunt, he used a sabot bullet and I believe he was hitting high because he dripped plastic on the front sight (which I removed) to bring the shot placement down. this could be better fixed by replacing the front sight or by shooting a heavier bullet and developing a good load. I included a link to a site with discussion about the rifle.

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.
