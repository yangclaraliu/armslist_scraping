I purchased this recently, however I wish to buy a .308 rifle and I need to raise some funds for that. This rifle is in good condition, and so are the surplus parts used in the build. The receiver is parkerized and the serial number is on top of the rifle, which means that it is from a batch of rifles that was built perfectly fine. I myself have not fired the rifle, and I don't think anyone else has. I have had the rifle disassembled to clean and oil it. I have not measured bolt gap. Everything does feel nice and tight though.

The rifle will come with one 40-round surplus magazine, and four 20-round polymer Pro-Mag mags. These mags fit out of the box and I didn't have to fit them to the rifle. It will also come with a HK surplus leather sling.

Asking $450. Located in NE Philadelphia, can do a FTF sale with a PA ID. Only trades I'm interested in are a C308 rifle, a PTR, or a Colt AR and I will toss in cash with the trade. PM if interested."

It was produced by Norinco for export to the U.S., it is not a military surplus gun. It functions perfectly and all numbers match, including the number that is on one of the magazines. The gun does have a aftermarket muzzle brake installed, but the factory barrel bushing will comes with it ( it takes 2 minutes to change ). 150 rounds of modern production PPU ammunition and a flap holster is included with the gun. The last picture shows a 7.62x25 round beside a 9mm luger round as a point of reference.
Would be a good companion gun for someone who owns a SKS or AK-47.

I have taken this rifle out to the range twice. Shot the rifle about 250 rounds. Absolutely zero problems starting from round one.

Receiver End Plate
Forward Grip

Beauty lies in the eye of the hunter.The first thing you notice about the X-Bolt Synthetic Gray Hunter is its stealth looking appearance. Its tough, gray composite stock sets it apart from other composite stock models. After all, it's a Browning. Like all other X-Bolt models, it has the basic-plus features that help you bring down big game like elk, deer, hogs and bear. The Feather Trigger is simple, and simply the best, allowing no trigger creep, travel or take-up. This single feature alone can make all the difference in putting meat in your freezer this year. Selecting this model of Browning X-Bolt sets you apart from the crowd. At first, this and a few other Browning rifles may not resemble the Browning rifles we have all come to know: High gloss finishes, deluxe wood, deep blueing, fine fitting parts and well-made designs. This rifle looks differently, but there is no difference in its lineage or its features or performance. Try it out. It is a Browning through and through, and always, the Best There Is.

All Daniel Defense cold hammer forged barrels are made from start to finish in our state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with our heritage of not cutting corners, all cold hammer forged barrels feature a forged chamber and heavy phosphate exterior coating. They are all MP tested on-site and are available in multiple configurations which includes barrel only (stripped); barrel with Front Sight Base; barrel with Low Profile Gas Block; and barrel with Front Sight Base, gas tube, and delta Ring assembly (Complete). These barrels will prove themselves to be more accurate and last longer than a barrel that has cut or button rifling. Barrel Configuration Stripped Barrel Length 16"" Manuf.

This barrel is tuned to lock back on the last round using subsonic 220 and 208 grain ammunition with a sound suppressor. The firearm may not lock back with subsonic 220 and 208 grain ammunition without a sound suppressor. Also, the subsonic 300 BLK ammunition is more susceptible to a malfunction due to carbon fouling and adverse conditions than supersonic ammunition. The barrel is tuned to operate correctly with the back pressure provided by the AAC 762-SDN-6 using an H2 buffer, or a Surefire 762K suppressor and an H buffer. In the development of this barrel, we found evidence that the suppressor may require a symmetrical baffle stack as found in the AAC Cyclone K, 762-SDN6, and Surefire 762K suppressor. Suppressors which cause off axis turbulence, such as those with K type baffles, may cause baffle strikes and/or point of impact shift, and may damage your suppressor. Noveske Rifleworks LLC and Operation Parts will not be responsible for damage or injury under ANY circumstances. Consult you suppressor manufacturer to determine if your suppressor is suitable for this application. Barrel installation should be performed by a qualified gunsmith.

Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comThe SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: SUREFIRE HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINE, 60 ROUND ALUM GRAY"

Out of all the research I have done I believe this to be that weapon. I inherited it from my father who passed away from cancer July 30th, 2015. I am not dead set on selling it but if the right number comes along I would be willing to talk to the family about it.

It is in fantastic condition. It cycles and looks to have been well taken care of. The rifling is still visable and the stagecoach on the cylinder is still visible. The wood on the grip is in very good condition. Does not look to be refurbished in anyway, ever. I did not post the serial numbers on purpose. They are all matching. Every gun dealer I brought this to has thanked me for letting them see it. Truly a fine piece of American history and hard to let go. With Colt about to go out of business I am sure the price will go up after that.

Don't be scared to text me and tell me about the pistol or what your offer is. I will write down all offers and bring them back to the family for consideration.

All products are new and in original packaging unless otherwise indicated. We do not accept any trades. All listings are for SALE ONLY. All sales are online only and can not be picked up in person. This allows us to offer you the best prices possible. Thank you for your business and we look forward to fulfilling your order directly via http://operationparts.comBLUE FORCE GEAR PLATEMINUS ARMOR PLATE CARRIERPLATEminus was designed from the ground up to be the lightest plate carrier available. Perfect for low profile / low-viz work, PLATEminus eliminated all of the unnecessary bulk enabling it to be worn under outer garments while still being fully MOLLE compatible. PLATEminus’ plate pockets are constructed from color matched CORDURA® for maximum signature reduction - eliminating black plates showing through the MOLLEminus front or the need for separate plate socks or painting.  The back of the plate pockets are Tweave to allow some “give” for various plate sizes or shapes.PLATEminus’ shoulder straps are fully adjustable for length with hook and loop closures that can accept the LMAC™ Enhanced Shoulder Pads. The straps feature sewn in One-Wrap for cable and hydration routing. The shoulder straps are edge stable and can be cut to length by the end user in order to trim additional grams and bulk.PLATEminus’ side straps are constructed with 1” webbing with elastic expansion sections to buffer movement and allow for room to breathe during strenuous activities. The side straps are secured with side release buckles for fast and easy donning and doffing.Size PLATEminus™ based on the plate size:      Small - 8.75"" wide x 11.75"" high x 1.25"" thick - For Small SAPI / ESAPI plates      Medium 9.5"" wide x 12.5"" high x 1.25"" thick -For Medium SAPI / ESAPI plates      Large 10.25"" wide x 13.25"" high x 1.25"" thick - For large SAPI / ESAPI plates      Extra Large 11"" wide x 14"" high x 1.25"" thick - For Extra Large SAPI / ESAPI plates    ***For non-standard sized plates, order the smallest, closest size.  Other plates may or may not fit.***MOLLEminus Technology starts with Blue Force Gear’s proprietary ULTRAcomp™ laminate material which is half the thickness of a dime and 4 times as abrasion resistant as 1000d CORDURA® fabric. The ULTRAcomp laminate is laser cut to create a fully MOLLE compatible matrix of slots and voids that greatly reduces weight, complexity, and potential failure points compared to traditionally constructed MOLLE platforms. As with all Blue Force Gear, it is made with excellence in the USA and carries a limited lifetime warranty. Fits:  SAPI/ESAPIs with soft armor backers Other armored plates may fit. Fully MOLLE compatible Increase weight savings by using pouches with the Patented Helium Whisper® attachment system  Sizing: (Size according to SAPI / ESAPI plate size)      Small - 8.75"" x 11.75""     Medium - 9.5"" x 12.5""     Large - 10.125"" x 13.25""     Extra Large - 11"" x 14""  Build:  MOLLEminus™ Technology Contructed from ULTRAcomp™ ITW GhillieTEX™ Low IR hardware Aerospacer Mesh   Available colors: Coyote Brown and MultiCam.Check availability and purchase right from our online store via this link: BLUE FORCE GEAR PLATEMINUS ARMOR PLATE CARRIER"

Selling my interpretation of the holster and belt rig worn by Cullen Bohannon on AMC's series ""Hell on Wheels"". Complete with wide skirt and barrel sticking out the bottom. This holster should fit an 1860 Army, 1851 Navy, or Single Action Army Colt, Ruger, Uberti, or Pietta. It should fit similarly-sized guns--however, I don't have an 1858 in my collection so can't guarantee the Remington will fit, but the pictures show it with an 1860 and a .45 Single Action Army, which I believe are of comparable size. 

The belt is made for up to a 52-inch waist. I left it blank without holes, so you can tell me your size and I can punch holes for you, or I can leave it blank and you can make your own hole. If you're skinny enough, you can leave the excess belt length on and tuck it under like Bohannon does on the show.

Hand made in the spirit of the Old West; this rig has been given an aged finished to look old, but it’s newly-made from thick, 10-oz veg-tan leather. Perfect accessory for cowboy action shooting. Holster only; the gun is not included! Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I do leatherwork as a hobby, so each piece is one-of-a-kind. The pictures shown are the actual holster you’ll receive."

This pistol features an alloy frame with 4.5"" barrel, fixed sights, checkered grips, European mag release on bottom, and decocker. This gun, as I understand the SIG history, was brought out in 1975 to replace the P210, which was too expensive to manufacture for military use. It was the predecessor to the P226 (1984), which came about due to a demand for higher capacity. The P220 line was subsequently altered to .45 ACP, which is today's standard chambering. This is a very rare gun, in overall excellent condition, with original box, owners manual, and four mags. Great Gun!"

This is a like new handgun. This gun is extremely clean. Look at the pictures of it taken apart. If you are buying a used gun always ask for pictures of the internal components to verify the stated condition is true! If a seller refuses do not buy the gun, they are hiding something! 

I purchased this gun march 2015 and after taxes and transfer fees paid, it was close to $600 from Cabelas. Taxes add up quick when you buy a gun new! 

There is no fouling, the gun is well oiled and it has been cared for well. The gun comes with a free carrying case,  lock, stopper, two 17 round clips and a few grip adjusters (backstraps).

I am willing to consider trades. Feel free to shoot me an email. 

Please Local Buyers only - If you have cash and are over 18 the gun is yours, it is that simple. I'm asking 450 or best offer. No additional tax or hidden fees! 450 flat, and this remarkable American made, time proven reliable pistol is yours.
