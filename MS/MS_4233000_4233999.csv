Make Offer,"Easley, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, April 16, 2015",Rifles,Saiga                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"***PLEASE DO HOMEWORK BEFORE MAKING OFFER. THIS RIFLE HAS HAD MAJOR CUSTOM WORK AND IS POSSIBLY THE ONLY ONE LIKE IT FOR SALE IN THE UPSTATE AREA. MAKE OFFER*** 

Considering selling my Definitive Arms Saiga .223, which has the rare and outstanding AR Magazine conversion. This weapon may be one of the only of its type in the Greenville area, and very likely the only one you will find on the Greenville Armslist. The waiting list for these is very long, and they are very hard to find. This rifle spent the better part of a year in Florida waiting for the work to be done by definitive arms. 

The AR Mag conversion alone will run around 700 bucks... Add that to the fact that the (now banned) Saiga 223 rifles prices are shooting up and you can see that this rifle's value will certainly rise 

The weapon has only been fired in testing. It works flawlessly and accepts any major AR mag. It has a rifle dynamics buffer tube adapter on it right now with FDE Magpul furniture as it was a unfinished project, and it may or may not come with that depending on the offer. I will of course include the original Saiga furniture either way. As you can see in the photo the back half of the rifle has upgraded furniture, but I hadn't got to the front end yet. 

I am a big AK guy, and this rifle is outstanding. The only reason I am even thinking about selling it is because with the Saiga import cutoff I know it has become more desirable, and I would like to fund the purchase of a compact .556 bullpup for my wife to use in home/property defense. 

The weapon has a 20 inch 1/7 twist chrome lined barrel, an idea length for the .556 round. This rifle had groups that were extremely tight at 100 yards for the AK platform. 

To reemphasize, I am not sold on selling this, so I will need a fair deal to go forward. 

Email or text me at REDACTED. Serious cash or trade in hand inquires only. If you need information to help you decide to purchase, fine, but I do not want to be bombarded with questions about the platform just because you are curious (like the last time I listed a weapon like this...) Open to offers, but no low ball stuff. 

Thank you"

The P239® Tactical is the same pistol that was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 tactical is available in 9mm."

AtlanticFirearms.com has this rifle for sale for $789. I am asking $750 firm for this unfired rifle. I am not interested in any trades at this time. Buyer and I will split the cost of a transfer fee.

I also have 200 rounds of high quality Santa Barbara surplus 7.62 NATO if the buyer is interested in that with the rifle for an additional $100 ($.50 a round).

I am located in Oak Harbor and would be willing to meet anywhere on Whidbey or around Mt. Vernon/Burlington. I'd be willing to meet halfway if you're out farther than that, depending on how far I'd have to be driving."

The Country Living Grain Mill was also rated best by Financial Security Magazine.

Gun is very clean and shows little use. The receiver gluing has a little bit of fade to it but the rest of the gun is in respectable shape for it's age.
The serial number is an ""AC"" prefix which gives the rifle a year of manufacture of 1967. 
That would make this an original Marlin and is in fact JM stamped. 

The gun comes as you see it and with a scope base with the 4 mounting screws.

The year of manufacture is unknown, but it has older Firearms International cast markings “FIREARMS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION / WASHINGTON D.C. 20022” which suggest that it was imported prior to the 1968 gun control act.

So-called skeleton rifles became popular in the late 1800’s among cyclists, giving them the name “Bicycle Guns”. These rifles were not for the protection of cyclists, but it was common for someone to ride their bike to their favorite hunting spot. The lightweight and compactness made for a perfect companion. Now these rifles serve as great survival rifles with their solid robust design and compactness stashing away nicely in the truck, camper, or boat. These unusual little rifles don’t come up often, so don't wait too long.

Model: Paratrooper
Caliber: .22LR

This is a very unique item: For a very short time, Luigi Franchi, the famed shotgun maker from Brescia, made a very limited amt of .22 rifles called the Para Takedown. It was to commemorate Italian Paratroopers and was made in very small numbers, something in the neighborhood of 3000, and only a small number were shipped to the U.S. It is a tube fed, 10 rounder, semi auto. It is known to be very accurate, VERY VERY RARE, and very collectible. I purchased this rifle back in 1991 and am the second owner. I have put maybe 300 rounds through it and not sure how many with the original owner. Originally the whole package contained a case, scope, sling, owners manual (in french) and the rifle. The previous owner lost the scope, case and owners manual unfortunately but I have the sling. (Better than nothing) I'm selling because of health issues (back surgery) so I hope to find someone who will appreciate this fine gun!
For those that are lucky enough to qualify for a Class III suppressor, this is already threaded at 1/2-20, same as the CZ 452, or you can get an adapter and converted it to the common 1/2-28 threading for the typical American made suppressor/muzzle brakes.

You won't find a better deal if you tried. I have 1 mag full of defense ammo in the pistol now. PMC Starfire brand 45 ACP defense ammo 7 rounds but that's 7 people who won't be walking away in a self defense situation.

There's an open recall on the trigger assembly, but I've not had a problem with it. The story is that there's excess glue or something on a couple of the triggers they made, but as far as I know, this particular year and model doesn't have any recorded malfunctions. I never use it so I don't feel like bothering with it. You can either ship it yourself to get Remington to fix it free of charge or you can get a smith to do it so you don't have to go without for a few weeks. Either way, I'm knocking a few dollars off what I hope is fair asking price to make up for the inconvenience--$400 or best offer, or see below for trade options."
