It shoots great and is very accurate considering that it is 73 years old. The finish is average for the year, the grips are metal backed plastic and are correct for the year and model. It comes with two 7 round magazines.Below is some historical information on the Model 1934.Model 1934       Beretta Model 1934 9 mm Short (.380 ACP) is a blow-back auto pistol introduced in 1936. Extremely compact, simple, reliable (the gun is composed by only 39 parts) Model 34 was adopted by the Italian Army as its standard sidearm during the WWII in place of oldest Glisenti 1910 pistols. This gun was assigned mainly to officers and selected troops and used on all battle-fronts in Africa, Europe, Russia. 34s made during the ""Fascist Era"" were marked not only with the year of manufacture but with Roman numerals indicating the year of the Fascist calender (starting from 1922 as 1st year). 34s were built after the war for some time (until the appearance of Model 1951). In the 90s Beretta manufactured with spare parts a batch of some 2000 pieces for collectors. Model 1934 is of all-steel construction with plastic grips. The sights are V notch rear dovetailed to slide and blade front integral with slide. The safety lever (that also has the function of a dismounting latch) has to be rotated 180 degrees like the Nambus. This can easily be done with the thumb of the shooting hand. The magazine has a heel type release and incorporates a lip that not only aids in withdrawing the mag but in gripping the gun more firmly.Specifications Calibre: 9 mm Short (.380 ACP) Length: 150 mm Width: 30 mm Weight with  empty magazine: 660 gr Barrel length: 86 mm Line of sight: 106 mm Magazine: Single line, 7 rounds Operation: semiautomatic, blow-back Hammer: exposed, single action Rifling: R.H., 6 grooves (pitch 250 mm) Sights: front: blade  rear: V notch Safeties: - manual hammer-block safety  - half-cock position of hammer Finish: - polished blue finish  - plastic grips Special features: - lanyard ring  - a heel type magazine release Vo: 240 m/secSHIPPING IS AVAILABLE FOR ONLY $25.00 TO YOUR FFL DEALER."

The Civilian was developed in response to a request from a U.S. federal law enforcement agency whose agents were regularly involved in undercover narcotics operations. In many cases, their undercover status made it impossible for them to carry firearms, so they wanted a knife that could serve as a potent defensive weapon when wielded with gross motor skills and a minimum of training. Spyderco's founder, Sal Glesser, designed the original Civilian to meet this need and in the process earned a patent on its distinctive Reverse ""S"" edge profile. The sinuous edge shape maximizes the cutting potential of the blade by forcing the material being cut to move longitudinally along the curves of the edge as pressure is applied with the blade.The Civilian design evolved over the years, but as a limited-production item and one of the world's most visually dramatic folding knives, it always attracted great interest. In the late 1990's, Spyderco's South African distributor requested a more economical version of the Civilian. Due to the high crime rate in South Africa, he felt it would be an ideal personal-defense tool. Spyderco responded by mating a Civilian-style blade to the fiberglass-reinforced nylon (FRN) handle of the popular Endura model. The result was the first Matriarch and yet another ""instant classic.""The original Matriarch was produced with both gray and black handle for several years before being discontinued. In 2010, a flat-ground, brown-handled ""sprint"" run (a limited one-time production run of a particular variant) of the Matriarch was produced, once again igniting interest in the design an prompting its return as a regular production model: the Matriarch.SpecificationsBlade Length: 3-5/8"" (92 mm)Cutting Edge: 3-1/4"" (83 mm)Blade Thickness: 1/8"" (3 mm)Overall Length: 8-15/16"" (211 mm)Blade Length: 4-7/8"" (124 mm)Hole Diameter: 15/32"" (12 mm)Blade Steel: VG-10Weight: 3.6 oz.

This is a great field to be in. With the election year coming next year the gun and ammunition business will go crazy again. This is great as a side business or if you chose to really dedicate to it it can become a full time gig. 
The business comes with the following:
-over $55,000 in product in inventory
-over $10,000 in equipment (which includes a custom set up of Dillon loaders capable of loading 2000rds an hour with one operator. This is not BS. The system is proven to load consistently 2000rds and hour with just ONE OPERATOR. This is customization and innovation that no one else has. More info will be given to interested buyers only)
-name brand that is registered with the state of AZ and federally. (more info as well as the brand will be disclosed to interested buyers only)
-this is the highest quality Ammo and we only make the highest quality. It is premium grade, match grade ammo that is comparable to HPR or Team Never Quit. 
-the business comes with all of our connections and suppliers of ammunition components. This is a priceless resource that took us over 2 years to build     
-professional logo design
-our packaging is revolutionary in the sense that it is new on the market. No other company that you see in stores used it. It is clear(see through) packaging so you can see the product inside. Is is dust proof and water tight. 
-This is a start up company so there is not a huge track record. However we have a few solid relationships with companies around the valley that look promising and will bring constant business and further recognition. 
-promotional material, including a High Quality professional promo video.
As an example at one of the gun shows in Phoenix a couple months ago we sold 10,000 rounds of ammo. This was one of our first shows only.

I have a 3 gun and a 4 gun case that I bought to shoot Bullseye competition. I find myself rarely using the 4 gun case so instead of keeping both cases I decided to sell the 4 gun case. This is where I bought the case from http://www.bullseyegear.com/bullseyepistol/product.php?productid=372&cat=44&page=1 .  As you can see it cost me $255.99 plus the magnet to hold the Magazines. I also attached a elastic cord across the magnet to assure the magazines don't fall in transportation.
This case is in perfect condition and will last you many many years of shooting.

Make me an offer....  I can also remove the decals if you like"

The gun has received top reviews from many professionals (search online, you'll finds lots of great reviews) and has a very durable Nitride coating. The Nitride coating is an upgrade from stainless and is the best thing going right now in the muzzle loader market! Additionally, I researched and bought a very well matched scope for this gun, a Vortex Diamondback for $169, also new in box (bought both at same time).The scope is the same, excellent reviews from the pro's. It is a perfect match for this gun being a 1.75x-5x, 32mm and very bright (more than $700, 3x-9x scopes), so it works extremely well as the sunlight fades to night.

I have receipts for about $650 total for the gun+scope(+ shipping).

I've owned this for about 5-6 years, and have only put about 200-300 rounds through it.

The box and original paperwork are included.

I'm also including a Homak electronic wall safe.  It's in great working order, but I no longer have the instructions, so you'll have to find those online.

Now for the interesting trade part.....I'll accept cash for this, but what I'd really like is an Olympic weight set.  Preferably with a lift cage/bench, but that may be pushing it.  If you have any Olympic weight set you'd like to get rid of, this might be the perfect trade for you.

It is blued, 6-1/2"" barrel, wood grips, serial# puts it at 1984 production date.

The gun is in excellent condition except for some holster wear in one spot on the cylinder only - it is shown in the pictures.  Anything else that looks like wear is just light reflections.

I am looking for $500 or reasonable offer.  I also have some high quality ammo that I can throw in if my price is met.  Otherwise I will sell some of the ammo at a good price.

Ammo is Winchester 175 gr silvertip hollow point which retails around $31 for a box of 20. I'm not interested in selling the ammo separately without someone buying the gun.

I am looking to sell the gun quickly to get up money for a different revolver, so if the gun I am looking at gets sold this deal will get pulled and I will keep the gun.

If your interested speak now or forever hold your peace!***

Here it is, Arms List... My completed Definitive Arms 5.56 AK. This weapon has been permanently and professionally converted to accept any STANAG magazine, and is chambered in 5.56. Additionally it has been equipment with a Bolt Release and Last Round Bolt Hold-Open. This was all done by Definitive Arms in Florida, and it wasn't cheap or fast. I waited months just to get the weapon back, and that was BEFORE the panic thanks to the Saiga ban. This is a rare and desirable weapons system. I don't even have to look to know it's the only one for sale or trade on the Gville armslist and I would bet it's the only one for sale in Greenville period. 

Problem is I am not motivated to sell! I love this thing! So I am back to see what trade offers I get, or what cash offers come in. Don't low ball, I've had enough of that over the months using Armslist. Know about this weapon before contacting me, it doesn't take much research to know this is a unique weapon. 

Pictures show it with full Magpul furniture, a Rifle Dynamics AR style buffer tube (Mil Spec) A midwest industries optic mount, and a AFG. I removed the optic that I am not selling but left the Bushnell canted mount red dot. Probably will keep unless the offer was right. 

This thing kicks ass. Fired only at Definitive Arms for testing. 

Let me know what cash or trades you got. 

SERIOUS offers only may text REDACTED. Don't text me if you aren't serious or lowball."

AXIS® A patented Benchmade exclusive, AXIS has been turning heads and winning fans ever since its introduction. A 100-percent ambidextrous design, AXIS gets its function from a small, hardened steel bar which rides forward and back in a slot machined into both steel liners. The bar extends to both sides of the knife, spanning the liners and positioned over the rear of the blade. It engages a ramped, tang portion of the knife blade when it is opened. Two omega style springs, one on each liner, give the locking bar it's inertia to engage the knife tang, and as a result the tang is wedged solidly between a sizable stop pin and the AXIS bar itself."
