 Apex M&P Polymer Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit 

 The Apex Polymer Forward Set Sear and Trigger Kit features a solid polymer trigger body, with center pivoting safety. This kit will set the trigger break point farther forward than the factory trigger assembly as well as, significantly reduce the uptake and over travel. It produces a trigger pull very similar to that of a 1911 but in a polymer frame striker-fired pistol. The Polymer Forward Set Sear & Trigger Kit boasts a smooth trigger pull throughout the break. The rounded trigger face provides the user with a comfortable surface for the firing finger. The kit comes with two (2) trigger return springs; one designed to produce approximately a 4.0 lbs trigger pull (silver spring), and one to produce a 5.0 lbs trigger pull (green spring). These two options give the end user the ability to customize their trigger pull for their specific needs.

 Expected Results 
– Reduced trigger pre-travel and over travel to produce a feel similar to a single action fire control system 
– A smooth trigger pull all the way through to the break 
– Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety values 
– 4.0 lbs (silver spring) or 5.0 lbs (green spring) trigger pull weight, depending on which trigger return spring is installed

 Apex Trigger:
 Features & Specifications 
– Lowers trigger weight to approximately 4.0 lbs (silver spring) and 5.0 lbs (green spring)
– Smooth uptake and reset 
– Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety values 
– Works with all Smith & Wesson M&P pistols in centerfire calibers (excluding the Shield) 
– Easy to install 
– Requires use of sear housing block designed for large size sear plunger and spring"

This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail.."

The XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact Model is an amazingly slim and ergonomic pistol that packs even more amazing capacity. Featuring the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry.
From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2™ .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.
Like all XD®s, the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.
And of course, GripZone™ ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2™ apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2™ Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry.

The extended range of the Seek XR sees objects twice as far away with the same clarity and resolution as the original Seek camera, and can focus on objects as near as 8 inches for precise, close-up macro imaging. The Seek XR allows you to literally see heat, making it possible to spot people and animals in daylight, total darkness, or in obscured visibility conditions. This true thermal imaging camera uses the data from over 32,000 thermal pixels to create a visible image on your smartphone. Prior to the Seek Thermal camera, this type of resolution was only available in cameras costing $3,000 and above. A few common ways to use the Seek XR:Hunting: Scout terrain, track game, and follow bloodtrailsBoating: Detect and locate harmful objects on the water at nightSafety and Security: Scan a dark parking lot or around your home for dangerHome Inspection: Reliable, non-contact testing and thermographyElectrical Engineering: Inspect components, circuit boards and assemblies.  http://www.thermal.com/ Android Version Technical Specifications: Adjustable Focus Works on most Android devices running 4.3+ with a mUSB port supporting USB On The Go.

For correct usage the USB port should be located on the bottom, with the widest portion of the port aligned with the back of your smartphone. Many LG and HTC devices orient the connecter in the opposite direction, and many devices from Sony and Motorola often position the port on the side. In these cases it is recommended to use a microUSB cable extender or adapter to allow proper aiming and positioning of the camera.

Last time I shot this, it had a couple failures to extract, which were remedied by cycling the action again. I haven't investigated further to see if it was the ammo (Winchester from Wal-Mart) extractors/springs, or just a dirty gun. It got a thorough breakdown and cleaning, but hasn't been shot since, and probably won't for a while since I bought a Franchi Affinity.

Features:
The milled gas block is located at a carbine length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low glare surface.
The handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.
The front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A-2 Style F-Height allows co-witness with many optics. The Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability and is a solid, reliable aiming system when coupled with the elevation adjustable front sight. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
The six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.
The 16.1 inch medium contour barrel is cold hammer-forged providing ultra-precise rifling for exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8 twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided and the ½""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.
The ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow for gloved shooting.
The chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.
Includes one 30-round Magpul® PMAG® magazine.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward, HERA arms OD Green Front Grip. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard."

These hard to find, high end 1911 have features found on pistols costing thousands of dollar more.

Includes everything from the factory including 3 magazines, 2x stainless steel and 1x matte black.  Original factory grips are included but black satin ALUMAGRIPS are installed. In like new condition with less than 50 rounds fired and meticulously maintained.

Custom Shop features include meltdown treatment for rounded and blended edges, KimPro™ premium finish on frame, Tritium three dot night sights, ambidextrous thumb safety, hand-checkered double diamond rosewood grips, Premium Aluminum Trigger and special Custom Shop markings and serial number.

The Ultra Elite has a three inch spherical cone match grade bushingless bull barrel design with a dual-captured low-effort recoil spring system. Working together, the twin recoil springs soften recoil and ensure flawless function. At the same time, manual slide operation is comparable to a full size 1911. Also unique to the Ultra Elite is a special beveling treatment at both the front and rear of the ejection port that prevents ejection jams common to other small 1911-type pistols.

As with all Kimber pistols with lightweight aluminum frames, the Ultra Elite frame is cut from a solid aluminum brick and machined to the same precision tolerances as our steel frames. We use only 7075-T7 aluminum, the finest and strongest available. The slide is machined from a solid stainless steel forging. Even the front strap checkering on these pistols is a special pattern. By using 30 lines per inch on the horizontal axis and 20 lines per inch on the vertical, it grips the hand firmly yet doesn’t break skin like standard patterns that form sharper points.

The Ultra Elite weighs just 25 ounces. Magazine capacity is six rounds

Meltdown treatment-all corners rounded Tritium night sights KimPro finish Checkered front strap (30 LPI horizontal & 20 LPI vertical) Premium aluminum trigger Ambidextrous thumb safety Hand checkered double diamond rosewood grips Special markings & serial number 

Each pistol incorporates standard Kimber features including match grade barrel and chamber, beveled magazine well, tactical ejector, high ride beavertail grip safety, match grade trigger group and beveled slide serrations. 

Equaled only by custom pistols costing thousands more, the Kimber Special Editions are the finest production concealed carry 1911’s ever manufactured. 

With a three inch spherical cone bull barrel, meltdown treatment and lightweight aluminum frame machined from solid bar stock, this 25 ounce powerhouse is the ideal carry or backup gun. Kimber’s unique design has special beveling at front and rear of the ejection port to prevent jams common to other small 1911’s. The KimPro finish, the hardest thermally cured finish available, gives the frame extra protection. The Ultra Elite is reliable with a variety of ammunition, including premium defense loads. 

Special Custom Shop features include everything listed plus: 

KimPro finish on frame Stainless small parts on frame Satin stainless steel slide 

Ultra Elite Barrel Length (in.) 3 Finish - Slide: Satin Frame: Kim Pro (black) Sights: Tritium Three Dot Sight Radius (in.) 4.8 Appx. Weight (oz) 25 Overall Length (in.) 6.8 Mag Capacity: 6 Grips Hand Checkered double diamond rosewood

The Strike One pistol is quite possibly the most revolutionary advancement in firearms technology in the past 100 years, featuring a new locking system that greatly lowers the bore axis of the Strike One's barrel, resulting in easier to control recoil and quick follow up shots.

This rifle is chambered in 5.56 nato. These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a very attractive specimen of Mossberg’s All Purpose 12 gauge 500 series. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500 All Purpose. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with weather resistant, recoil absorbing black synthetic stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered blued steel 28 inch Ventilated Rib. The Barrel is marked Modified, probably under the influence of waterfowl pressure. Muzzle diameter, however, is actually a .715 vicinity Improved Cylinder, steel, slug, and buckshot permissible. This is a fixed choke barrel, it will not accept choke tubes. Sight system is 12 post serrated top Ventilated Rib with brass center bead and ivory colored front bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity about 1 inch forward of the receiver. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Replacement pricing on mossberg com is upwards of $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates, for only $ 199.00.
