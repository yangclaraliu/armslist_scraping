Perfect mechanically. Perfect walnut factory grips. Perfect Bore. Very slight exterior wear. I'd rate this gun at 98%+ and I'm a tough judge.

The difference I've seen between the Sig and Kimber compacts is the Sigs don't go back to the factory for adjustment. This gun has been fired and enjoyed.

Includes Factory Box, Manual, 2 Factory Mags. (Will also take full size 1911 mags.)

$650 (Well below Dealer Cost.) May trade for similar handguns, revolvers - especially .45 ACP, .357 Mag or .44 Mag revolvers. Will not trade for shotguns.

The lower receiver is comprised of polymer with steel reinforcing inserts. The CT Carbine has a skeletonized fixed stock, pistol grip and a very distinctive magwell that doubles as a forward grip, providing additional control. The ambidextrous fire/safe selector switch is located just above the grip for quick and easy operation. The magazine release is located near the magwell housing, protecting the magazine from inadvertent releases."
204,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4882204,"For Sale:  Ruger Super Blackhawk, .44 Magnum","Fairfax, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 540,"Listed On: Friday, November 27, 2015",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,44 Magnum                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Parting is such sweet sorrow, especially with this sweet Ruger Super Blackhawk, .44 Magnum/.44 Special. I bought it at an auction five years ago but never took it for a spin.  It deserves an owner who will take it to the range and more importantly let it breath in the great outdoors. I am proud to own it but ashamed I have never shot it.

Description: Ruger Super Blackhawk, .44 Magnum/.44 Special, blued, non-fluted cylinder, 7.5-inch barrel. The prior owner did shoot the revolver but I do not know how many rounds.  There is minor wear on the left side of the muzzle, most likely from holster wear, and minor wear on the cylinder.  My best estimate is that this firearm is in “NRA excellent condition” but take a look at the pictures.

This sale is for 1) the Ruger Super Blackhawk, 2) suede zipper case, and 3) 154 rounds of Winchester Super-X .44 Magnum, 240 grains, which I acquired with the Blackhawk.  Look at this way: The ammo is worth at least $120 so you get the Blackhawk for $420.

A little bit of history: In the 1950’s Western movies were popular but Colt had stopped producing its famous Single Action Army revolver. Ruger recognized the demand for cowboy-type revolvers and in 1953 introduced the famous Single-Six.  The .44 Magnum Super Blackhawk was then introduced in 1956.

Note: Based on the serial number, this revolver was produced in 1973, the last year the Super Blackhawk was produced without a transfer bar.  A collector may want this as an example of a transition, in which the firearm is the last of its kind before a major change.  A purist may want this because it is mechanically closer to the Old West revolvers.  If you do want a transfer bar, Ruger will retrofit a revolver with a transfer bar at no cost other than shipping.  They will also return the original parts so the revolver will be considered “complete” as a collectible. 

Verification/how to transfer:
If you live in Virginia, there are three options for transferring: First, if you have a Virginia-issued Concealed Carry (CCW) permit and a standard ID, we can meet anywhere and make the transaction. If you are current law enforcement or military, that will work in place of a CCW.  Second, if you don’t have a CCW or substitute, we can meet at a gun store, which may charge a small fee.  Third, I can ship the revolver to a verified FFL holder, which may also have a transfer fee.
If you live outside of Virginia, I have to ship it to a verified FFL holder in your state.
Transaction and shipping fees are split 50/50.

As a legal note, there is no agreement to sale until we agree on a price, method and location of transfer, and meet the standard legal stuff (21 years of age, etc.).

The barrel has been cut down to about 23.5"". There are some small scratches in the stock and some light surface rust on the metal. Nice classic shotgun similar to the Browning A5. This shotgun only accepts 2-3/4"" shells. There is no choke thus it is a cylinder bore. I am asking $175."

I've got about $400 to put toward it, and based on prices I've seen used, I'd expect somewhere in the $375 to $425 range. The G model, with decocker only is my preference. I might be open to a 92FS (not F) or 92G if it fits the price range, but I haven't seen one below $500. I'd also be open to a 96A1, but again, I don't think it will fit in my budget.

Just FYI, I'm not looking for any D or DS models, I'm looking for the standard DA/SA trigger. I'm also not interested in the 90-two model. 

If you've got one available, contact me on this site and plan to send some photos so I can look it over. I'm an OR resident, looking to meet within the PDX Metro area. WA seller is fine too, but you'll have to come to an OR FFL for the transfer.

This VZ24 Mauser rifle was made in Czechoslovakia for the Imperial Japanese Navy. It is in great condition, bluing is good and so is the bore/rifling. Comes complete with the original cleaning rod. This rifle is NOT import marked anywhere, likely a veteran bring-back from WW2, although I do not have documentation. The receiver ring has no crest, only the date of 1937. The side of the receiver reads “CESKOSLOVENSKA ZBROJOVKA, A.S., BRNO” with “V.Z. 24” below it. The bolt serial number does not match the receiver. The serial number on the receiver and stock match, but the stock serial number has a “C” prefix. C and P prefix serial numbers are indicative of Japanese use. The jury is out as to what the serial number prefixes mean. Some say the P-prefix rifles were made for China (which were subsequently intercepted and used by the IJN), while those with C prefix were made for Japan. Others say that the C and P prefixes represented which Czech factory made the rifle. Most Japanese-used VZ24’s you see will exhibit the P-prefix serial number, but research indicates that C-serial numbered rifles were used by the Japanese as well. The NRA museum agrees with me, see the link below. The only way to tell for sure if the rifle was used by the Japanese is the presence of capture papers from WW2 or a sling marked with Japanese Kanji letters. This rifle has the original sling marked with Kanji letters, which are white and vibrant. Placing a value on this rare rifle is difficult as not many are offered for sale. Rock Island Auction estimates the price of a P-prefix rifle that is missing the cleaning rod and sling to go for $950-$1600. See link below. While I think this price is a bit optimistic, it indicates that this is no ordinary run-of-the-mill VZ24 rifle. My price is $700 OBRO. I prefer to deal locally, but can bend. Don’t miss this opportunity to add a very rare Mauser rifle variant to your collection!

It also has Spanish cedar shelves, which are recommended for aging cigars, a digital hygrometer, around 20 boveda packets, both opened and unopened, and I'll even throw in a few nice colibri cigar cutters and a large porcelain 5 Vegas cigar ashtray.

There are around 200 cigars in total; all premium, hand-rolled. A majority have 90+ ratings by cigar aficionado. Upmanns, Don Pepin's, Alec Bradley's, Gurkhas, Gran Habanos, Black Pearls, Nestors, 5 Vegas, siglos, and loads more.

The stainless steel heavy barrel makes this gun an absolute tack driver. It was a limited edition and these are very hard to find. With this Nikon scope you can shoot 600 without adjustment. It has a mil dot for every 200 yards. The Garris bipod works perfectly and comes in handy with this heavy barrel. I also have 600 to 700 rounds of ammo that can go with it for an additional $150.

Yes there are others in the country that are less $$ but take a look at the front sight location if it is forward of the gas block at all then it is the unlined barrel. To some this may not mean anything but it allows you to shoot corrosive ammo with impunity and if you purchase this one with the front sight located where it is you can get a tax stamp and SBR it in about 2 seconds. These where also built with Tapco trigger groups making it one of the best shooting ak's that I have owned. I will include your choice either a  30 rd mag or 2 twenty rd mags not both these are steel mags and the 20's work better in my opinion due to the location of the fore grip. Cash price is firm and the only trades being considered is 7.62x39 ar platforms
