The Diamondback—loaded with features! First, the solid one-piece aircraft-grade aluminum alloy construction makes the Diamondback riflescope virtually indestructible and highly resistant to magnum recoil. Argon purging puts waterproof and fogproof performance on the agenda, and advanced fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. Look for all this and more in a riflescope you'd expect to cost quite a bit more-but doesn't. We can live with that.
2-7x35 Diamondback is designed for close to medium range use on centerfire rifles and shotguns."

The Firearm has had 50 rounds of 230g ball ammo shot thru it to test out functions of both the firearm and the magazines.

The gun comes with the original box, paperwork, lock, pouch, and 6 Magazines. 2 Ruger (original) 2 mech-gar, 1 Kimber, and 1 Ed McCormic Powermag (8 round). I will also throw in a funky plastic box that I use to store the extra mags.

It also comes with a brand new, never worn, Alien Gear IWB Supertuck II holster. In the bag, with the kit to adjust the tension and cant to your liking.

It's still legal in Oregon to sell privately till Aug 1st. I'd prefer a CHL holder, but Oregon ID is necessary. A bill of sale can be provided on request if you want it. I can drive out to about the Henderson or La Grande area, but that's about my limit. So about an hours drive from Pendleton or so.

Please email me for any questions, or more photos. Like I said, this gun is less than 2 months from purchase, and has had one box of ammo thru it with no stoppages or anything. This is the Commander model. That means it has a 4.25"" barrel on the full size frame. This whole setup is perfect for Concealed Carry if you wish, as it comes with a great IWB holster. The price is pretty firm, and at this time I am not accepting any trades.

After Aug 1st you will have to go thru an FFL transfer to buy guns from a private seller, and that will add 40 USD to the price or so for transfer fees, paperwork, and a background check.

Please email for any questions."

Cons:
*Neither windows roll down(motor makes a sound though so probably off track)
*Window is cracked towards the passenger side
*A couple big dents(Would make a great work truck)
*Radio doesn't work, needs a new one
*Needs headliner
Pros:
*Starts right up
*AC actually works
*extended cab
KBB says around $2300 in fair, but I think its a $1700 truck the way it sits. I purchased it yesterday and steam cleaned it, vacuumed it, and washed it. The guy that sold it drove it from an hour away and it seems to run just fine, starts right up. Nice tires and rims. The problems aren't expensive repairs(Safelite charges $181 for a new window and that's the most expensive thing). Don't expect a ""prom queen"" truck. The only reason Im selling is Im a college student and didn't really think about gas mileage and honestly would rather have a 4 cylinder single cab."

Vision and hearing protection are required for Day 2, as well as a concealable pistol with a minimum of 50-rounds of ammunition. We will shoot at Gat Guns in East Dundee, IL. If you do not currently own a pistol, you may rent a pistol from Gat Guns for the shooting portion of the class.

open to discussion  because it needs a barrel we can discuss the price

[b]Will ship (Y/N): yes, on your cost 


What actually happened and why it needs a barrel:

The rifle had feeding problems only with 10 rounds aftermarket magazines so me and a friend of mine had the GREAT idea to grind in the bottom of the barrel to create a feeding ramp .
The rifle is still functional and I shoot it but I definitely recommend the barrel to be replaced. I got a quote for the barrel and is $306+ shipping from McGowen Precision Barrels what includes the chambering, contour based on the blue print and nitride, process that makes the rifle even more accurate and corrosion resistance.

This is my second vepr and the only one left (I had 2), I was going to get it fix but lost interest and have different project going on.

I purchase this rifle NEW and I am the only owner.

Here are some details what is equipped with, all parts purchased brand new also:

I decide to sell my Vepr rifle generation 2 with square back, integrated sights, chambered in 762x54r made by Molot in Russia
I purchase the rifle new and then was taken a part and modified in tactical stile with top quality accessories, I never had in mind that I will sell this rifle to be honest.

Mods made: I will start from the front of the rifle

glock The Glock 26, often referred to as the ""baby Glock,"" has created a true and practical auto pistol alternative to the standard five shot snub nose revolver. The ""safe action"" system consists of three (3) automatic independently operating mechanical safeties which are sequentially disengaged when pulling the trigger and which are automatically re-engaged when releasing the trigger. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services."
