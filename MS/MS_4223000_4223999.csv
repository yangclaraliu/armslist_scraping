These are amazing rifles. Comes in factory box with one magazine and factory paper work. From the factory: The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines. We must have a copy of your dealers FFL with your payment or we can not ship this rifle. Payment can be made with Postal Money Order/paypal"

Kershaw Survival knife system with saw tooth back on the blade, Model 1005. Trade Value $300. Cash $275.
NIB Benchmade Auto APB 6800SBK for $275 trade or $240 cash.

It is 12-5/8"" overall, is in mint condition with original sheath and all accessories. The blade is as new with a few rub marks showing up in the matt finish. It comes with a full-size Brunton compass and all the original survival gear. Very well done and my favorite of the factory hollow handle survival knives from the 1980's.

Knife is at least 26 years old and a unique piece of Kershaw history. Everything is in excellent or better condition, including the knife and sheath. This is a great and I mean really great building block for an outstanding survival knife system. The sheath is almost as important as the knife because of all the pockets and heavy-duty grommets built in to it help you organize, protect and carry your gear.

It was rated number three in a review of survival knives in the world back in the late 80's, but I do not remember the magazine or the other knives in the review. They were last made in about 1989. That makes this knife at least 26 years old and a unique piece of Kershaw history.

The last time I saw one this good was about 9 years ago, and it sold for $350.

The following is from the 1989 Kershaw catalog:  

Kershaw's fixed-blade Survival Knife provides and added measure of safety in a multi-purpose knife designed for situations in the forest, outback, tundra, or anywhere a big knife for tough jobs can make the difference. It combines the sought-after features you need in a functional, durable knife.

Its machete-shaped survival blade is made of Kershaw's AUS 8-A high-carbon stainless steel, sandblasted to a smooth non-reflective finish, and shaped with strong tang to assure a solid lock-up between the blade and the handle. Double cross-cut saw teeth on the back can saw through tough jobs such as wood, bone, and even metal.

The handle itself is a steel pipe covered with Kershaw's Task Force™ polymer rubber grip, which is contoured with finger grooves for positive control. The Task Force handle provides a solid non-slip grip in all conditions. The butt can be used as a hammer without damaging the knife. Its threaded butt cap features ""O"" rings to seal a water-tight storage tubing in the handle, which can store emergency items, such as matches and fishing hooks and line.

The oversized Cordura sheath provides two storage compartments, one for a full size compass and waterproof survival cards, which are included. This heavy duty sheath features wide loops for use with belt or leg straps, a fold down strap with quick-release clasp, and heavy-duty grommets.

The instructing waterproof survival cards are maybe the best and most helpful. Some of the things they show and explain will save your life but you may not like doing them. But as they say ""at the end of the day you are either alive or dead."""

Superior versatility is available with this high-performance, 10mm AUTO pistol. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20SF, the subcompact GLOCK 29SF is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29SF 10 mm with a 10 round magazine capacity standard. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control?especially to shooters with smaller hands"

This pistol was my starter pistol given to me as a gift for completing my CHL. It has only been fired a dozen times. It was well kept in its case and kept clean.

My Aunt is a retired Texas State Representative and is the #1 pioneer for the Texas Conceal and Carry Law passed in 1996. Her testimony convinced the Texas Senate to pass the bill and subsequently named it ""Suzy's Bill,"" after my Dad's Sister. She went on to serve 12 years in the State Legislature, as a National Spokeswoman for the NRA, as well as consult many other states in the passing of similar laws.

I grew up with a great appreciation and pride in the 2nd Amendment and our RIGHT to carry. I have taken great care of this pistol and it's accessories, which include a pistol lock and keys, case, 2 Magazines, a box of ammo and all in the original case!

This pistol is light, small and easy to carry in a purse, pocket or holster. As a woman I found it to be perfect to carry in even my smaller handbags.

I have a Sig P226 chambered in 9mm that I am looking to sell or trade. The Sig was converted to Double Action Only and is no longer DA/SA. The Sig will come with the Sig box and 2-Magazines. It has some carry wear from use but not abused condition. The P226 can be converted back to SA/DA but I do not have the original parts to do so. I am looking to trade for one of the following and cash can be offered to make up any difference.

The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment.Manufacturer: Rhino by Chiappa ( Made in Italy )Model: 40DS Barrel: 4""Caliber: .357 MagFinish: Black"

492,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4223492,For Sale:  DL 44 Han Solo Blaster (7.63 x 25mm),"South Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee","$ 2,900","Listed On: Wednesday, April 8, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"DL 44 Heavy Blaster - Han Solo / A New Hope Version

NOTE: THIS IS A REAL FIREARM, NOT A TOY OR NON-FIRING REPLICA.

This is a custom, all-metal, fully functional, firing DL 44 Blaster nearly identical to the one used by Han Solo in the original Star Wars movie (A New Hope). It, like the movie version, began as a vintage 7.63 ""Broomhandle"" C96 Mauser. The upper and lower receivers are from two different vintage C96's. The grips are original to the weapon. Over 40 hours of work went into the production of this weapon. The firing pin and recoil spring have been replaced with new ones. It has been blued, the other parts chemically blackened and then distressed/battle-worn (complete with ""mystery disk"" on the left side of the magazine housing). A permanently mounted bull barrel sleeve has been installed. Scope mount studs have been welded to the receiver. A limited edition, all-metal parts kit has been used to complete the build. The scope is hollow, with brass and glass fittings, but is non-magnifying and has no internal reticle. The blaster has no sight greeblies attached to the top of the bull barrel (Star Wars guys will understand that). There is enough photographic evidence (in my opinion) that they were not present during much of filming, so I did not add any. I said that it was ""nearly identical"" earlier in the description, and I said that because the lanyard attachment point on this grip is set at a different angle than the screen-used version. Other than that, it's spot on.

Being a real weapon, it will only be sold to adults. If shipping is required, it will only be shipped to an FFL holder (shipping is flat $25 via UPS only to contiguous US).

This weapon is fully-firing and functions perfectly using standard 7.63 x 25mm Mauser rounds (also known as 30 Mauser).

Serious inquiries only. No trades.

The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme.

Caliber: 300 AAC BLACKOUT

Length: 16"" Barrel

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system (patent pending) with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.  A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, five-pound DAO trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.Manufacturer: DiamondbackModel: DB9 EXO Barrel: 3""Caliber: .9mmCapacity: 6+1"

I have had this uniform for about 2 years and only worn it a handful of times and was bought from At The Front.com. It was worn strictly as a dress uniform for reenacting. After buying an M42 uniform I have no use for the early war uniform and wish to sell it. All awards and unit marking including the sleeve swastika and cuff title have been removed to be politically correct. So you can do it up however you wish with whatever unit you wish, or it would make a great display item. With 4 pocket military jackets being very fashionable it would also make a trendy semi formal jacket. I'm asking $85 or a reasonable offer. I am not interested in a trade unless it is for any other German WWII item reproduction or original. //CASH ONLY//

Italia- Cal 6.35 BRE. VP (Vest Pocket). This is an older well made Italian Semi-Auto 25 ACP in Good Condition. Gun functions perfectly and is a nice little piece for a collection. I have the original box and paperwork from December1958 including the first original bill of sale to the original purchaser in 1959

 Bernardelli entered into the gun business in 1631 first making barrels in Gardone Val Trompia, Brescia Italy. In 1865 Vincenzo Bernardelli founded the company which still exist today. In the 1920's Bernardelli also manufactured componets for Alfa Romeo aircraft engines. In the 1930's they made an Italian service revolver know as the System Bodeo, Model 1889. They are also known for crafting very high-end shotguns. After World War II, Bernardelli introduced its first self-loading pistol, the VP (Vest Pocket) Model, which was based on the Walther Model 9.

 The Bernardelli VP is a very small blowback-operated striker-fired .25 caliber (6.35 mm) pistol with a barbell-shaped takedown latch at the rear. It has a full length slide that covers the 2"" barrel, with an external extractor on the right side, an internal connector on the left side; a 5 shot magazine that incorporates a magazine safety."

726,http://www.armslist.com/posts/4223726,For Sale:  BARNETT VENGANCE REVERSE DRAW CROSSBOW,"Northeast, Wichita, Kansas",$ 700,"Listed On: Sunday, May 3, 2015",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"New, never cocked. Complete package with crossbow, quick detach quiver, three 20” arrows and an illuminated 3x32 Multi Reticle Scope. These cross bows are compact, handle extremely well and shoot great. Reverse draws are the way to go! Lists for $999.

Draw Weight – 140-lbs, Energy – 118-ftlbs. Limb pockets are moved closer to the trigger assembly and the limbs face forward on the bow, thus shifting the center of gravity closer to the shooter’s body. This drastically reduces the weight at the front of the crossbow, which is essential for a well-balanced shot. The CarbonLite Riser removes approximately 43% of weight from the riser, which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. The combination of the reverse draw design with the CarbonLite Riser allows the Vengeance to provide the steadiest and most accurate shot possible."

Everything included is shown in pics.  I purchased this pistol used for $420 a few months ago.  It has a failure to feed problem and so I am selling it at a reduced rate because of that problem.  The guy that sold it to me did not disclose that problem nor would he take it back, so I’m selling it with that problem disclosed.  Basically, after racking the slide the first time it shoots the first round, ejects the spent brass, but then the 2nd round does not get fully seated properly in the chamber.  If I rack it back half way and let go, it will then position the next round correctly.  I am not sure how to fix it, and that is why I am selling it.  There are no other problems and cosmetically it is in great condition.  I am open to trades.  I would like to get a semi-auto rifle (.308, AK-47, SKS) or a .40/.45 pistol."

This is one of the most accurate AR-15's you can find at the $1,000 mark. It shoots sub-MOA with PPU 69 grain match ammo and is 100% reliable. The upper to lower fit is extremely tight with no wobble for the best accuracy. The takedown pins must be removed with a punch, however they will get easier over time.

Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part."

The Can Cannon is currently configured for launching full, un-opened 12oz soda cans. When used with standard mil spec blanks and fired at an optimum angle it can reach an average distance of 105 yards! Why launch soda cans instead of drinking them? Because you can! Projectile options are only limited by your creativity and local laws. Our BATFE approved design is not considered a Destructive Device or firearm. Each unit is sold as an assembled upper with receiver, headspaced and mounted ported barrel, and pressure tube. The system is compatible with any AR-15 mil standard bolt and most piston bolts.

""This is the much requested short stroke trigger bar upgrade for both BG380 and MP380 pistols.

-Custom made to our specs this will shorten your pull and reset by 35%.
-Made from high grade alloy steel and fully heat treated for long service life. 
-It does not lighten the pull but shortens it, making staying on target easy and follow up shots faster. No factory safeties are affected. 
-After the early break the trigger will stop about 1/8 past break. 
-Drop in design requires no modification to your hammer or other trigger parts.
-Now includes the Edge trigger. The trigger ads adjustable stops to remove unneeded pre-travel and over-travel for the ultimate performance setup.
-**Now includes the reduced power firing pin return spring, reduced power blocker spring, and heavy hammer springs for complete package.
