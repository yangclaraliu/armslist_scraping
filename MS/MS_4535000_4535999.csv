The Eliminator Laserscope is the perfect hunting companion for any rifle and any load, from rimfire and centerfire to muzzleloaders and slug guns. As an affordable ballistic technology riflescope, you get ranging capabilities out to 800 yards and trajectory compensation that works on high power magnification. Program the Eliminator with your specific cartridge information and be confident the illuminated aiming point is exact for your precise distance. Take the guesswork out of hunting and just range, aim, and eliminate."

Original JP Fire Control Kit

This kit for .154 small pin receivers consists of a JP trigger with engagement and overtravel screws and disconnector spring installed as an assembly, disconnector, instructional video, and our standard array of springs: yellow reduced power trigger spring both yellow and red reduced power hammer springs.

Spring Selection Guide:

Competition/Recreation
The yellow/yellow combination may be used for competition and various recreational applications with hand loads or domestic-manufactured, non-military ammunition. It will result in a release weight in the 3.0-3.5 lb. range on most receivers.
Enhanced Ignition Reliability 
The yellow trigger spring combined with the red hammer spring will yield a release weight of 3.5-4.0 lbs. on most receivers and offers increased reliability for (5.56 NATO) or foreign-manufactured ammo with low sensitivity primers. The yellow-red springs must be used for any large-frame AR installation to ensure 100% ignition reliability. This is also the minimum acceptable combination for tactical duty (LE) installations and should be used only with domestic-manufactured ammo in this application.
Duty/Defense
The tactical spring set includes a full powers (grey) hammer spring (purchased separately) and yellow trigger spring. It may be required for agencies that mandate a trigger release weight of over 4 lbs. This set up also insures 100% ignition reliability on both AR-15 and AR-10 type rifles.
CMP
To meet NRA Service Rifle Competition rules of a 4.5 lb. release weight, the CMP spring set (purchased separately) includes the full-power hammer spring and a custom trigger return spring, which will allow you to tune to a release weight just over 4.5 pounds to lift the NRA weights.

(Berger 168 VLD, Barnes 120 Tipped TSX, 140 Tipped TSX, Barnes 168 Long Range X...everything I've shot out of it shoots well). I ordered this rifle from Cooper via First Stop Guns, SD and am the original owner. With the upgrades it goes for way more than its selling for. I have a Leupold VX6 3-18x50, fine duplex, CDS mounted on it. If you want it with the scope add $900. Comes  with the talley bases and 30mm rings that are shown in the picture, hard case and leather sling."

My total cost into everything listed is $3872.85. I originally purchased 200 rounds of ammo and have 160 left so only 40 have gone down range. I did not like the original sights I put on the rifle so I just recently swapped them out for the Magpul MBUS pop-ups but haven't been back to the range to zero them. This is a mid-length gas system with a rifle length JP silent buffer and to be honest, I don't remember which spring is on the buffer. It very well might be stock. The rifle operates flawlessly and have never experienced any failures. She's got some kick and you could probably stiffen up the buffer spring to take a little more recoil out. I had originally built it with a standard mil-spec buffer and spring and after putting the silent buffer in my AR, I don't think I'll ever build a rifle WITHOUT that system again. What a difference!!!

Acquired from a collector who had purchased it himself in poor condition. He paid a gunsmith to make some repairs which reportedly are: a new buttstock, forestock, hammer, barrel bands, pivot plate, front & rear sights, and some internal parts. 

Original Colt parts include the frame, barrel, receiver, cylinder, trigger, trigger guard, buttplate, ejector & rod, saddle ring, rammer/tamper, and some internal parts. 

Trigger guard is stamped “56 CAL” - under the barrel and on the strap under the cylinder is stamped with the serial number “6368;” the trigger guard and lower tang are stamped with serial number “6944.” I do not know if these parts were replaced by the factory or if they were part of a later, private repair."

The new TP9SA is a 9mm single action, striker fired pistol. The TP9SA is the next evolution of the popular TP series pistol. With a new trigger and frame assembly, the TP9SA has been redefined for the American shooter. The TP9SA features a striker decocker that allows for safer disassembly as the trigger does not need to be engaged to field strip the pistol. This feature gives the operator added reassurance of a safe platform. The added safety feature of not engaging the trigger is a huge benefit for the civilian and law enforcement market. The TP9SA also has a cold hammer forged barrel and the slide is cerakoted with 3-dot steel sights.

The new frame design of the TP9SA contains several upgrades inspired by the feedback of military and law enforcement. The grip panels and front and rear grip have two different stippling styles to fully engage the shooters hand under any adverse condition. A longer trigger guard enables the operator to use the TP9SA while wearing hand protection. The grip design allows a slimmer feel while still containing an 18+1 capacity in 9mm."

These guns are extremely hard to find in all steel from what I've read as little as 80 have been imported to the U.S. They were a special contract done for the Israeli police/military and some of the surplus guns were imported to the us and sold this is one of them. As you can see it has been cerakoted in burnt bronze and black and is in outstanding shape. I am willing to consider trades but I'm not sure what kind of value to put on mine as I haven't seen another one for sale so feel free to make me an offer. A normal used cz 75d with the aluminum frame normally goes anywhere from $500-$550 so I figure with this one being what it is it should be worth quite a bit more.

No cracks in the kelvar, just some of the paint is chipping off, no big deal. The DH-132A is the second generation of the CVC DH 132 helmet designs. From what I've found on the internet

DH132- Is just a bump helmet
DH132A- Is a Kevlar helmet and has ballistic protection and is lighter than ""B"" Model
DH132B- Is thicker and heavier than the ""A"" but provides slightly more ballistic protection

I bought this wanting to make a SOHAH / FAST Helmet but I had the time or the money to do so. If you google CVC conversion or DH132 Conversion, or variest keywords you can see how it is done. I recommend using a OCC-Liner Kit either by the HK Air Soft Company FMA or getting the real deal Ops-Core one, but you can use a ACH/MICH . If you're a serious buyer I can send you links of what you'd need to do it, along with accessories like a ARC rail and VAS NVG Shroud. If you purchase I can give you a few tips I learned from the extensive time researching on the internet.

I'm looking to get $150 (this is FTF pick up off i205 and mill plain) out of it, that is how much I paid excluding shipping. Open to trades, tactical gear etc, let me know what you have.

The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin.

PROTECH Tactical Body Armor (size Medium) with Type IV plates (front, back, and sides). The vest is bullet-proof body armor (not just a plate-carrier vest) and is stated to protect against up to .45 caliber rounds. The Type IV plates protect against armor-piercing rounds and significant protection from virtually all angles of receiving fire.

This exact model hasn't been sold directly to civilians (though it is legal), but the closest I have found for comparison sake is at the link below:

http://www.chiefsupply.com/protech-tac-ar-modular-webbing-carrier.html?gclid=CjwKEAjwla2tBRDY7YK9uKXe8R8SJAAhG6LGKIActmB25sm5OLFhovWolJwJzBt2SnxidkXJL6a-jhoCzQPw_wcB

That one is currently listed at $304 (just the vest armor). The one here sold to D.o.D. for $560.

The Type IV plates were manufactured by BAE Systems, distributed and stamped by PROTECH. The front and back plates sold for around $600 a piece and the sides sold for $470 each.

That said, this entire package cost about $2700. I'm aware this is well outside the average folks' cash to spend, thus I am asking what I believe to be a reasonable price for an incredible armor system.

Also an Eotech 512 and a Noveske KX5 1/2-28 5.56mm Flaming Pig Flash Suppressor. That's about $600 retail for the add ons. And from what I can see, the Flaming Pig is pretty hard to find!!

Might consider separating the add ons for the right offer. But I'm looking to sell it complete.

If you've been looking for an AR15 pistol, LOOK NO FURTHER. This gun will not disappoint and with the sight and bungee sling, it's very fun to shoot. 

Sold as-is. No trades. Cash only. All local laws apply and buyer is responsible for transfer fees. 

I'm in south Denver and can meet within a reasonable distance at an FFL."

This gun is basically brand new with extras. I added a Holland Muzzle brake $200 (brake can be removed if desired)and a 20MOA solid one piece base $80 and it comes with Warne 30mm Tactical scope rings $80. This is by far the sweetest firearm I have ever owned and I already regret selling it. I have shot less than four boxes of ammo through it for the break in period. It is a tack driver. The recoil is so light my 9 year old son shoots it with ease. I have friends with other heavier long range rifles that were puzzled when they tried this A7. Although the A7 is substantially lighter than their rifles, the A7 has much less felt recoil.
I cant think of a better long range gun it has an aluminum bedded fiberglass stock. A flited heavy 26″ barrel a 3 locking lug bolt with 70 degree operation and it comes with two factory magazines.

This is easy a sub MOA gun having achieved .75″ minus groups during break in, if someone taylored a load for it I am certain it would be a .5 minute gun. It is capeable of 1200 yard shots with the right scope.

I am selling this rifle because I just don’t have the time anymore to do the long range thing. I don’t see myself hunting elk or larger game much in the future and I really cant justify just storing such a fine rifle in the safe.

Call or text Kyle at REDACTED. Please don’t low ball offer. The price is firm. I purchased this gun for 1300 plus tax and have put about 400 more dollars into it. The listed price is a great deal for what you are getting.Thanks for looking.

This is the first of a new line of Centerfire rifles for Rock Island Armory. It's intended for mid-range use with a mounted scope and is perfect for varmint hunting. We've created this beauty to be exclusively chambered in Armscor's signature caliber, .22TCM - which happens to scream at over 2,800 fps. The 5 round mag can be interchanged with the 17 round .22 TCM pistol mag, turning this into a high-capacity rifle.
