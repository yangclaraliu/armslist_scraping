Buy any 5.56 ammo you can find and use a small bottle of testers green model car paint to paint the tip green.
Seriously, I talked to my brother in NC and he told me that some guys have been caught doing that exact thing to make money of off the penetrator scare. They were buying any 5.56 ammo and painting the tips green with model car paint. So my ""REAL"" tip is be wary of the ammo you buy !!! make sure you didn't buy it form someone who has a hobby making model cars."

My loss is your gain. 
       The Sig M400 is a true AR-platform tactical rifle, designed for use in law-enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field, as well as in competitive shooting. A 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel provides superior corrosion resistance, and a 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability that users come to expect from Sig Sauer. The M400's dependable direct-impingement gas operating system uses a rotating locking bolt. The Enhanced version of the M400 is designed for use in law-enforcement, military operations, and the sporting field, as well as competitive shooting. Features include a hard coat anodized upper and lower, Magpul furniture, A2 front and flip-up rear sights, ambidextrous quick detatch sling mounts, and a collapsible stock. Olive drab finish. 30-round magazine. 

It also includes a Drago tactical carrying bag and also an additional magpul rear sight and a magpul front handle. 
I purchased this rifle close to 1500.00. Right now they are running from 1200-1400 brand new but are difficult to find plus in the end you will have to pay extra for taxes. I am asking 1150 firm.

I have an Armalite upper receiver group for sale. This upper comes from their new defensive sporting rifle line off a Defender 15F model. The upper receiver is a forged flat-top with 1913 rail made from 7075-T6 aluminum. Barrel is a 16"" 1:7 RH Twist rated for 69-80gr 5.55/.223 ammo. Barrel is chrom moly vanadium with double lapped chrome lined bore. A2 front sight base. I was hesitant with this purchase at first but was pleasantly surprised. It is very accurate, consistent, no issues. I've put about 400 rounds through it so it's barely even broken in. Cleaned after every range session. Does have some show of use and maintenance as seen in the photos, but it functions flawlessly. Overall I'm impressed with it. Selling it to fund a new upper receiver project I want to do. PLEASE NOTE: purchasing this rifle does NOT I repeat NOT include the accessories in the picture. You are NOT purchasing the rail system, the optic, back up sight, or grip. You will be getting the flat top upper receiver group with A2 handguards and bolt carrier group/charging handle. Asking $300 firm. NOT looking for any trades of any kind. Must be willing to meet face to face and also sign a bill of sale with drivers license number even though it's not a firearm."

Unlike some .22 lrs, this one is not picky about ammo. I have cycled 100's of rounds of cheap and expensive ammo through it without incident. Unlike pickier models like my M&P22, or from what I have heard and read - the Mosquito and P22, the Beretta Neos U22 cycles all kinds of .22lr ammo.

It has come to my attention that Beretta Neos U22 was recalled to fix an issue with the safety. I have never used the safety and was unaware of the recall. I have checked into it and Beretta with send UPS out to pick it up, make the repairs and ship it back at no cost. If it has not sold by the end of the month, I will pull this ad and send it back to have the repairs made, but it will go back to it's original price if I do - $275.

To avoid any more confusion,  yes you can bid on a new 6"" barrel U22 for $259 on gun brokers. And if no one out bids you and you win the auction with a bid of $259, you will pay an additional $25 for shipping, $30 at your FFL for the transfer/background check. Then you will have to find and purchase 2 new magazines at around $25 each and a cheap lockable gun case for $10. So for $374 and a little patience you could have a new 6"" barrel U22 with two extra magazines and a case to put all in."

If you are thinking about building a longer range AR 15, this is a great way to start IF you don't care about weight and can afford to own more than one AR. The muzzle brake does seem to do as advertised. The magpul ACS stock with the battle line industries cheek riser is a real treat. The scope and mount are decent as well. The heavier stock should help balance a heavier longer barrel a bit better. For my purposes my rifle became too heavy, so I stripped it down. I'll never be a long range shooter anyhow! lol It was fun at the range though, looked like "" The Tank"" of AR's."

This is a German-marked and produced VZ-24.  From the research I've done and information I've been able to find, this rifle was produced shortly after Germany obtained control of Czechoslovakia.  As they took control of the country, they also took control of the arsenals and weapons plants.  This rifle is a product of that.

You can see the German proof marks pictured.  From what I've found, this is a predecessor to the German G24(t) that was produced in the Czech plants.  The Germans used up the parts in stock, then switched over to the German design.   This appears to be in the first year of production, first run of 10K of the German produced rifles in Czechoslovakia being built in 1941. The subsequent runs of 10K had a suffix to the SN.

The bolt and stock do not have matching serial numbers. I obtained it in a trade with the sporter stock (included and pictured) and put it back into it's original form with a replacement stock (not SN matched, either) and metal.  Both stocks go with this rifle.

Open to trades and offers.  Willing to ship to C&R or FFL for actual cost of shipping.  I have a C&R, so I will request a bill of sale."

I bought this shotgun because some friends who do 3 gun had recommended it. The thing is absolutely awesome and priced extremely well in comparison to its competition in the tactical semi auto class. This shotgun is modeled off the Mossberg 930 and designed in cooperation with one of the greatest shooters alive, Jerry Miculek. With all of that being said, I do not shoot 3 gun. I also do not need a home defense shotgun as I own several semi auto rifles. Long story short, this firearm gets no use. I took it to the trap range in naperville and put no more than 200 rounds of target loads through it shooting clays. Its a great gun, I just have no use for it. I recently decided to try and compile money toward a higher end 1911, so it has come to the point that I recover the money invested in this shotgun to go toward that project. This gun its essentially new. I cleaned it thoroughly after use and it has been stored in either a safe or soft case. The gun is in excellent physical and working condition.

This pistol will include the original factory box, Houge grips, the original factory grips, 3 8 round magazines, Taurus lock, and an sight adjustment tool should you ever need it. Since this is my only .45 at the time, I will also include 115 rounds of ammo containing both FMJ rounds and more then enough Hornady Critical Duty +P ammo to fill all of the magazines.

This handgun is in like new condition, with only the most minor scratch or two to the receiver which were there when I purchased the gun.  This gun is 100% Zastava, with no US parts, as being a pistol there is no 922(r) to comply with.  I originally bought this for a SBR project after WA legalized them, but have never gotten around to it.  Always oiled, rust free, with a round count of exactly 150.  Modifications are a tasteful refinishing of the wood and the addition of a Rapidfire Technologies sling mount.  This is the good one which goes in front of the trigger guard so you can never pull it off on accident.  Wood was carefully sanded and oiled with ""teak"" (tung) oil.  Amazing blonde color, but you could easily do what you want to it should the look not be your favorite.  Comes with a shitty, but useable, single/double point sling.  Also four magazines (one surplus Yugo bolt hold-open, and three Korean) and a Yugo four-magazine pouch are included.

Any person can own and carry concealed a flare pistol without a permit in all the states of the U.S.A. because it is a signaling safety product. I have for sale is a German 26.5mm all-steel flare pistol. This flare pistol was made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly-limited quantities in the early 2000s. This is when many retailers sold them inexpensively. However, today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion this German flare pistol is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to the U.S.A. during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol, however unlike this German flare pistol , the only steel part on the HK is the barrel, as the entire frame is plastic. The lighter HK also have a very strong recoil that is painful to fire with .45 caliber barrel inserts. This German flare pistol is in very good surplus condition and made of heavier steel. That's what keeps the recoil down. There is no license needed to buy or own this flare pistol! 26.5mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapters allow 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired. There are also .22 MAGNUM, 9mm, .40 and .45acp adapters available. The 26.5mm to .22LR insert is for the most inexpensive use. The 26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter allows the less expensive 12-gauge flares to be fired. Optional front brass bead sight, green fiber light sight, one synthetic nylon front/rear sight with bottom tactical rail and recoil pad are available at an extra costs. *Note: One FREE insert is sent with pistol. The other insert adapters are not included with the sale of this flare pistol. I have photos of these adapters to show what this flare pistol is capable of firing. I sell this flare pistol with one FREE 12 gauge flare barrel insert and your choice of extra OPTIONAL barrel inserts. Original German holster I offer is $25 dollars. One of my photos in this ad shows an optional sight base attachment assembly with tactical flashlight. The tactical flashlight is available on Amazon's website. I sell the optional sight base attachment assembly for $95 dollars.

There were only a LIMITED amount of this model ever made!!! It is considered a HISTORIC PRODUCT on Browning's website. 


Steel receiver with nitride finish and high-relief sculpted engraving • 3” chamber • 20 gauge 28"" lightweight contoured barrel• Invector Plus™ FIVE choke tube system (F, M, IM, SK, IC) • Grade II/III Walnut stock with oil finish • 525 Field stock dimensions • leather/canvas hard case included 


28"" invector plus barrels. 3 triggers. ***Mint condition***only 5 rounds ever shot from this beautiful gun. 

Comes with browning lockable leather case.. This gun has only been taken out of the case one time. Case alone is worth over 200 dollars. Velvet/furry interior for superior protection! 

I will ALSO throw in a sophisticated looking authentic wooden gun cleaning kit! {pictured last}

 it CURRENTLY retails for 3,035$ new. I purchased it in 2005 for 2650$. In ten years this particular Citori's value has gone up a little over 400$!!!!!
 THIS GUN WILL ONLY APPRECIATE IN VALUE OVER TIME! My loss and need for money at this point in my life is YOUR GAIN. Again this suggested retail is without the case. You not only are saving over 1200$ by purchasing through me right off the bat...but essentially over time even more $ saved due to limited production, especially 20ga. I have 86 shotguns that I personally own and this is one of my all time favorites. It's saddens me to see it go. Unfortunately, life events and hospital bills are making money tight for me right now! However, come get it while it lasts!

Not sure if anyone is in to high end 10/22 builds, but considering selling my new build new fund another project. Price is $950, which is a lot less than I have in it. Before you try to dog on my price, be sure to visit KIDD's website and check prices. Everything is brand new except the stripped receiver and target laminate stock, details listed. You can not build this gun as I have for less money, so don't BS me! I am located in Hartford City. Would sell without the scope for $850, but not parting it out.

This DVD video explains an easy way of how to convert the very popular semi-auto RUGER 10/22 .22LR rifle into a true full-auto sub machine gun. The free Full-Auto template makes the conversion faster to complete. Only two simple inexpensive rectangular parts can be obtained from your local hardware store or machine shop. The two rectangular parts are then easily installed into the RUGER 10/22 rifle's trigger housing. There is no modification to the rifle's factory original receiver, bolt face, hammer, trigger, sear, disconnector or any other part of the trigger group. This is a non-permanent conversion. The full-auto RUGER 10/22 can be easily put back into its original semi-auto mode of fire. You do not need to have the skills of a gunsmith to make this full-auto conversion. This full-auto conversion functions similar to that of the UZI, MAC-10 and M3A1 sub machine guns. Gun Slinger Videos full-auto conversion for the RUGER 10/22 .22LR rifle and has been tested and proven reliable. All other full-auto RUGER 10/22 conversions suffer from bolt-bounce / light-strikes that cause many malfunctions.

I trust my life to this gun, and you should yours.  This is one sale I will regret, and my price is firm.  If this doesn't sell for asking price I will sell something else.

Anyways, this gun has around 1500 rds through it, and it has never, ever, jammed.  I've carried this on and off for five years, shooting occasionally to make sure the firearm was still in good shape and to keep myself familiar with the platform.  Cleaned often, always oiled, and 100% rust free.

Besides the normal finish wear on the barrel and guide rod from shooting it enough to be broken in, this gun looks brand new.  It has only ever rode in my pocket alone in a holster, or at home in my safe.  No keys or change rubbing against it, ever.  Zero scratches, zero damage, 99% exterior (besides normal wear of the slide rubbing on barrel).  I take maintaining my firearms seriously, and you won't be disappointed.

This gun is broken in, vetted, in excellent condition, and comes with 22rds of Hornady Zombie Max (Critical Defense with a green tip, makes it nice to differentiate between this and critical defense/duty in a different caliber), 50rds of mostly magtech and some federal FMJ, and a DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster.

Master Mineral Solution - Why has this Product Become so Popular?

This amazingly powerful compound, commonly known as the Miracle Mineral Supplement or MMS,  has been very prominent in the alternative medicinal arena for close to a decade. The reason it has stood the test of time is because it works - & works well!  The man who is responsible for its discovery & bringing it into the mainstream is Jim Humble.

 Who is this man Jim Humble?...

It all begun back in the mid 1990's whilst Jim was on a mining expedition deep within the jungle's of the South Americas. When one of his party was suddenly struck down by the Malaria parasite, Jim struck upon a amazing discovery - a revelation that has since altered the lives of many! Learn more...

What did Mr. Humble discover? Chlorine Dioxide Molecule

Upon returning to the States, Jim began testing in earnest - & what he found was that the active component within his simple water purification formulation formula was absolutely deadly against the Malaria parasite  - the very same parasite that is responsible for millions of deaths each & every year.   Needless to say, this warranted further investigation! Learn more...
As time progressed, it was becoming increasingly clear that the chlorine dioxide molecule was not only deadly against the malaria parasite, but also a wide range of fungi, bacteria, cancers & parasites - interestingly enough viruses as well!

Unfortunately, there is an ever increasing push from various regulatory bodies the world over that are attempting to shut down this product - so the question is how long will this amazingly effective compound will remain available, this is the question.

Turpentine has been used medicinally since ancient times and are still being used as folk remedies up to the present. They were used in ancient Babylon to treat stomach problems, inflammations and ulcers. The process was first described in the ninth century in Persia.

The use of natural products is most widespread in poorer countries, including Russia, Eastern Europe and Africa. A recent study in Nigeria found that about 70 per cent of the population used natural products medicinally. The most common applications are for infections and infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, cancer, arthritis and rheumatic diseases in general. 

Turpentine distilled from different varieties of California pines is almost pure heptane, as in light petrol. Other varieties of pine produce mainly chemicals called terpenes, as present in fragrant oils.

Turpentine: Another Cure-all Therapy

In addition turpentine was previously used as a cure-all. Natural turpentine, commonly sold as ""pure gum turpentine"", was commonly used in lower doses. It was especially treasured for its antiseptic and diuretic properties and as a treatment for intestinal parasites. According to Wikipedia: ""Turpentine was a common medicine among seamen during the Age of Discovery, and one of several products carried aboard Ferdinand Magellan's fleet in his first circumnavigation of the globe.""

To expel tapeworms, a powerful dose of one to two tablespoons of turpentine was given, usually mixed with the same amount of castor oil and taken floating on  milk. This was repeated every second or third day until the fragments of the worm ceased to appear in the stool. For children, the prescription was less drastic: one teaspoonful of sugar, three to four drops of turpentine and one teaspoonful of castor oil.

Jennifer Daniels, MD, discovered that American slaves had a secret remedy that kept them free of diseases: a teaspoon of turpentine mixed with a teaspoon of white sugar, taken for short periods several times each year. She adopted this as a successful Candida therapy: Slowly pour a teaspoon of turpentine over sugar cubes or a rounded teaspoon of white sugar to soak it all up. Then chew the cubes or soaked sugar and wash the mixture down with water. Dr Daniels generally recommends doing this twice a week for several weeks, but initially daily with long-term Candida. Continue until the problem is fixed - which can happen surprisingly quickly. On Internet forums, I found some testimonials showing that this therapy indeed worked for these people.

Product Detail:
These gum spirits of turpentine and pine gum rosin are derived from slash pine trees (pinus elliottii) growing in south Georgia, USA, using sustainable forest practices. We harvest the raw pine gum ourselves. Then, we fire distill the raw gum right here on our farm using basically the same methods used for hundreds of years. Finally, we bottle, label, package, and ship our turpentine all by hand. Attention to detail is paramount in our business. Our goal is to maintain the historical integrity of pure gum spirits of turpentine and pine gum rosin while also providing our customers with premier products they can afford. 

This turpentine is not to be confused with ""rectified turpentine,"" which is a by-product of the pulp and paper industry and contains sulfates and other impurities. This turpentine is 100% pure and organic.

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.and with the voodoo barrel and flash hider u no longer haver to take off the flash hider to get the gas block off and the vdi barrel is one of the best barrels on the market,

We currently do a break in procedure on all our barrels prior to leaving so no further break in is required by the end user.

I dont have a 45/90 to check it but it shoots 45/70's great. Very accurate for a rifle made in 1895 (S/N 908xx). Stock has been refinished and is a little low in spots. The barrel is 21"" and has been shortened as far as I can tell. The rifle did have a full size mag at one time as there is a grove on the bottom of the barrel. I have shot this rifle plenty and it out shoots every 1886 I have seen. Bore is an 8+ with some shine and sharp groves. Beautiful red color in the stock. Was probably case hardened when new but looks like blue was applied a long time ago. Lettering is still sharp and clear. I am cuting my winchesters back a little and you wont find a better deal on a 1886 antique than this one."

This WOA AR15 match rifle upper has all the features needed for the HP competitor without the compromises of mass produced uppers or the steep price of a custom one.  The 26"" barrel is turned from a match grade Wilson 1:8 blank, with the last 1.5"" of the barrel turned to .750"" diameter for mounting a front sight base.  The precision chamber is ideally suited to across-the-course high-power competition.  The fore-end is machined to accept high quality Aunschutz accessories, as well as most American style hand-stops.

    Barrel twist 1:8, length 26"", M4 feed ramps, 11 degree target crown
    A4 receiver, includes complete bolt carrier group.

    Modified gas system delays the unlocking of the bolt.  This reduces the stress on your brass, aids in longer case life, and also helps ensure proper functioning with heavier bullets and slow burning powders."

I have the original box and paperwork from December1958 including the first original bill of sale to the original purchaser in 1959

Bernardelli entered into the gun business in 1631 first making barrels in Gardone Val Trompia, Brescia Italy. In 1865 Vincenzo Bernardelli founded the company which still exist today. In the 1920's Bernardelli also manufactured componets for Alfa Romeo aircraft engines. In the 1930's they made an Italian service revolver know as the System Bodeo, Model 1889. They are also known for crafting very high-end shotguns. After World War II, Bernardelli introduced its first self-loading pistol, the VP (Vest Pocket) Model, which was based on the Walther Model 9.

The Bernardelli VP is a very small blowback-operated striker-fired .25 caliber (6.35 mm) pistol with a barbell-shaped takedown latch at the rear. It has a full length slide that covers the 2"" barrel, with an external extractor on the right side, an internal connector on the left side; a 5 shot magazine that incorporates a magazine safety."

With extensive research on the form and function of the tactile-enhanced grip, the operator will find the design enhances control, while providing consistent hand placement. The flared magwell aids in fast and reliable reloads while the extended magazine base pad provides a secure grip during loading, handling and shooting the DB FS Nine. Diamondback has incorporated a trigger safety and firing pin block safety with a short, positive reset, minimizing trigger travel for faster cycle times. A cocking indicator is located at the rear of the slide, providing visual and tactical recognition. For quick target acquisition, fixed, three-dot sights are mounted onto the stainless slide. Both front and rear tactical serrations provide firm engagement between the user’s hand and the DB FS Nine's slide, allowing for a better grip during manipulation. The dust cover has an integrated MIL-STD1913 Picatinny rail for tactical lights, lasers and other accessories, extending its versatility for everyday carry, home defense, training or use on the range. The 4.75” Chromemoly barrel on the DB FS Nine provides a long, 6.25” sight radius, aiding the overall accuracy of the pistol during practice and competition. Not interested in trades."

It's a fantastic gun and a great trainer for your AR platform. The M&P is an exact copy of the full AR-15 controls and regarded as one of the better functioning .22 rifles out there as well. 

There were a few (3 or 4 I think) FTEs in the first 75-100 rounds while breaking in the action, but flawless since. It also may have been the ammo I was using (extra Thunderbolt I had laying around which has mixed reports of working) - I switched to Federal Automatch and have never had any issues with it.

The gun comes as pictured:
- Threaded barrel 
- Muzzle break
- Adjustable iron sights
- Sing and needed picatinny mounts
- 3 x 25-round magazines (likewise lightly used, purchased new at same time as rifle)
- 6 position adjustable stock

I had assumed it was a stainless model, however, after speaking to the Custom Shop Director and Senior Gunsmith at SIG SAUER learned it is in fact a low-glare nickel variant of which very few were ever produced. As you can see it does not have the contrasting controls as the models produced today, instead it is all nickel.

It is super clean, functionally flawless, and remarkably accurate. No stains, scratches, or blemishes of any kind. If it is not a rare piece, it is certainly hard to find. Zero defects. Comes with hard plastic carry case and three factory mags."

151k miles but will go up as its my daily driver. Im driving farther for work and just bought a diesel.

I don't want to sell but have too many cars and no place to park them all (you will understand when you get here)

priced for quick sale and cheap due to issues below.

good:

-stylish, looks great for its age
-low rust, was garage kept by previous owner
-interior is in great shape
-not horrible mpg for its size
-excellent handling, the turning radius is great for its size
-reliable (I drive it an hour each way to work and back every weekday)
-safe
-stops and goes as it should
-quite interior (my favorite thing about this car)
-cruises great down the highway, wouldn't hesitate to drive anywhere

bad: (I'm no mechanic but plan to be as honest as I can)

-has single misfire at in town speeds

-check engine light is on (I don't own a code reader, probably a misfire code). Passed emissions just last fall.

-buddy said its a coil or wire..said coil is common failure. Said he could hear sparke discharge with AM radio on?

-tail light switch failure, another common issue. Original failed after a long life. Autozone replacement failed just after a couple of months..I was warned to only buy the MB part and now beleive that to be a good idea. Have bypassed it for now as life has kept me too busy

AC works but comes out of passenger side? no idea of cause but it kept us cool no prob in the summer.

upgrades:

-projector beam headlights
-cd/USB mp3/aux input radio
-led taillights replaced common MB failed units
