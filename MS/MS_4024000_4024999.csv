HL1-C-TN This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three white LEDs, two red LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the red secondary LEDs serve the same purpose in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body available in tan. Tan model attaches to any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) via an included ambidextrous mount with 20 preset positions that allow the light to be rotated 360 degrees when attached. Once either mount has been attached to the helmet, Helmet Light can be quickly and easily slid on and locked securely in place. Pressing a lever on the mount unlocks the light, allowing for quick removal for servicing or transfer onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest."

Steel Frame w/ Picatinny Rail
The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard."

I suspect the motivation for that has nothing to do with the rules of Armslist (and everything to do with trying to prevent others from learning how to simply and legally build their own AR-15 lower). 

In case there is some legit concern - this isn't some multi-state listing. I am local to ABQ, the Mayor's name is Berry and the Republicans just took control of the State House of Representatives for the first time since 1953. 

Here's what I am offering: an unfinished AR-15 receiver. The price is $100. That's a little higher than you can find online. But, you can buy it, locally, in cash and avoid the paper trail. Part of the point of finishing your own firearm is to avoid what many people believe are unconstitutional lists identifying gun ownership. It also prevents gun grabbing by the ""authorities."" Think that doesn't happen? http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/08/national/nationalspecial/08cnd-storm.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0

But, I am also selling the carbide drill bits and endmills you need to complete the receiver. All bits/mills purchased from https://www.mscdirect.com/ as recommended by CNCguns.com - and one more part: the steel jig that you need to make everything line up properly. The whole package costs $375. I will buy the tools and the jig back for $275 (assuming normal use and not abuse). I am not renting the tools, if you want to keep them then they are yours. If you want to sell them back, cool. BE WARY of anyone who offers to ""rent"" tools to make a firearm. The ATF has decided they will prosecute people for that. http://www.atf.gov/sites/default/files/assets/Firearms/FirearmsIndustry/atf-ruling-2015-1-manufacturing-and-gunsmithing.pdf

It is legal to make your own firearm (as long as it is for yourself and you aren't prohibited from having a gun and you aren't making it with the intent to transfer it). http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2014/03/26/80-ar-15-receiver-determination-letter-atf/ It isn't all that difficult: http://www.thefirearmblog.com/blog/2013/05/02/billet-rifle-systems-80-receiver-part/ 

If you don't think people should be able to build their own firearms, great: you are entitled to your opinion. But, this ad isn't spam, it isn't violating any rules of armslist, and maybe you should let everyone make up their own mind about whether this is something that they want to buy? Just a thought. As for the individual who emailed the rant about unserialized guns-- actually, I am a democrat. I just believe in the rights afforded to everyone by the Bill of Rights.

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto standard pressure loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

Item 27E/20 is a 100gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,000 fps out of my 3.75 inch BDA (Browning Double Action). We've used a flash suppressed powder for all three of our 380 auto loads so that you wont be blinded by your own gunfire if you have to shoot in the dark and since around 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, the chances that your own gunfire will blind you while you are trying to save your life, are good - we've eliminated this variable by using flash suppressed powder. We've also chosen a flat nosed solid bullet. The flat on the nose ensures that the bullet will cut/smash its way through flesh and bone and do much more destruction than typical round nose FMJ bullets. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities recorded from my personal 380 auto pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not exaggerated speeds produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo, is truly what you get in the ""real world"", where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight-line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 380 auto pistol and the trade-off is that you are now going to have to stay alive with that pistol and over penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

Before I dive in, if you're not familiar with this brand (like I was), you can dig around the web to find that they are a Reputable manufacturer from Spain.
Their .45 caliber pistols are highly praised (The two 1911's carried by Samuel Jackson and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction are actually Star 1911 Clones), and the other bored models are made to the same standard.




This is the M43 Compact pistol, available in 9mm/.40SW/.45.
Mine is the single stack 9mm, 7 rounds +1, included is a spare mag.
It's an ""all steel"" gun, with an inside the frame slide, this combo makes it an accurate little automatic. The heft absorbs recoil, and from what I've read, will stand up to 9mm + P ammo. 
>>Very quick repeated shots with this overall setup, the grip, slide/body, and trigger.
The LOCKUP is tight, and the BORE is in good shape:
The RIFLING edges are pronounced, has a shine to it still, I don't think it has been used extensively.

It's single action only and can be carried in either:
CONDITION 1 (round in the chamber with the hammer cocked and the safety on), 
OR
 with a round cambered and the hammer released to a half cock. When the hammer is down, the safety will lock the slide in place.

The TRIGGER is in a nice middle ground between the very stiff and very light.
On one hand it is just at the point that it takes a deliberate finger pull to fire,
 and on the other hand: the trigger reset is short and it has an almost two-stage feel.
 When pulled back, it comes to a tangible rest just before the break.
>>Very quick repeated shots with this overall setup, the grip, slide/body, and trigger.

AMBIDEXTROUS SAFETY, just like on a 1911. The beaver tail grip and indent under the trigger guard give you a surprisingly solid GRIP on the gun. If you have *big* hands, you'll probably dangle a pinky.



Included is the original Star FireStar CARRYING CASE,
 a SPARE MAGAZINE stainless 7 round,
 a Galco Leather Inside the Waistband IWB Locking HOLSTER,
 and ONE BOX of econo-target range AMMO I have leftover.

I have found a great web page for this gun, and have a PDF copy of the original MANUAL, I'll have that printed out for you.

This gun needs to be kept clean and lubricated to work properly, and it prefers quality ammo due to it's stiff recoil spring. The hotter, the better.




I'm asking $310 for the lot, I can meet anywhere public, I'd prefer to meet at a Police station (they won't be involved in the sale, however they don't mind for our safety).

I've personally put around 100 rounds down range, but I have no idea how many have been down the barrel before I owned it; the rifling is strong and the gun is very accurate.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

The orange sight is still in perfect condition too. There is even engravings from the factory on this one, on both sides, everything is in spectacular shape functionally, as everything works like silk. There is slight surface rust, from the previous owner keeping it in a bag I figure, but nothing that is off the bat noticeable. The actual wear of the gun is remarkably little. You can tell it was kept in the open position, but the slide pump arm has very little wear on it. I've kept it very clean, and only shot a box through it, and of course cleaned it after. It'd be a great gun to show off, hunt with, fun shoot with, anything really. The kick is surprisingly little, and its inctrdibly lightweight, making it a great gun for men, or women or kids even. it is very hard to find this great of a gun, this old, especially in 16 gauge.

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

 Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the firearm. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

I am getting into a new business venture so I need some capital. I am not hard up for money. I just want to protect my savings and not be undercapitalized in a new venture.
Here is what is on the chopping block
1) SKS M model paratrooper. Cleanest used one you will ever find. Looks new
2) SKS M model paratrooper in Shermic Gunworks Bullpup stock
M models are the ones that accept AK mags from the factory
3) Clean SKS with trench art. Very cool pice I got just for a wall hanger but functions as it should
4)Marlin Camp 9mm. Extra mags and spring kits to use +p ammo
5)WASR-10 with tactical furniture and bump fire stock. Fun as hell to waste 30 rds in 10 seconds
6) Polish underfolder
7) RPK AES with carry handle
8)Egyptian Maadi with thumbhole stock
9)CBRPS Bullpup Mosin w hex receiver
10) M44 Mosin in Archangel stock
11) Saiag 7.62x39 in Kushnapup stock
12) Saiga &.62x39 rifle in unfired condition
13) Russian AKM kit with receiver and American made barrel
14) Romanian PSL
15) VEPR 7.62x54R 16"" barrel. Tactical version. The most expensive thing on this list

I have other files I may list tonight. Make an offer. All guns are in good functional condition. Email to request pics. This is not a fire sale. I know what my guns are worth. If you are the guy looking for a $450 AK, don't email me. I don't have any $450 Aks and haven't for quite a few years now.
I just rattled this list off the top of my head. I will put some prices on them when I get time this evening."

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trijicon Night Sights Installed. I could also throw in the latest new kind of LW .40-9mm barrel for the right price.

Heckler & Koch P7M8 9mm pistol, I am selling this pistol as a used gun since I did not receive this from Heckler & Koch or a distributor directly, but this pistol has never been fired and I have taken plenty of photos that strongly suggest this is a brand new gun, this pistol has had one owner which I purchased from a nearby town's retired police chief. The gun pictured is the exact gun you will receive, any questions"

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trijicon Night Sights Installed. I could also throw in the latest new kind of LW .40-9mm barrel for the right price.

He added custom tactical parts, and this shotgun is in very good condition.  This appears to be a 3 gun competition build.  I see a few very light scratches, and believe this man did not own a case for the firearm. The shotgun has an Archangel adjustable stock and pistol grip (104$), fiber optic front sight (20$), and a 9 round magazine tube (75$).  I was originally looking for a tactical shotgun that could be used for hunting.  If you want to hunt with this shotgun, simply insert a dowel rod of appropriate length in the tube to make it legal in states like PA.  I am selling due to moving into a state where a shotgun is not useful for hunting."

It was special ordered from the Winchester Custom Shop in January of 64 by a family member. It is a transitional gun and has both Pre 64 features and Post 64. According to the Winchester historian it is one of the first post 64 rifles made. The custom shop features are as follows.
1 Grade 3 wood instead of the grade 2 that was standard on Super Grades.
2 Winchester Island Express Safari Sights no longer made due to cost.
3 Kickeez recoil pad.
The stock has fantastic figure and color contrast with just minor handling marks to the wood. The bluing is perfect with one minor rub on the floor plate. The bore is perfect and the rifling looks like it was cut yesterday. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than 50 times since new and very well cared for. Comes with the original dealer hanging tag and owners manual.
Will also come with a Browning hand fitted safari case model 1915 that was purchased in the early 70s from the same dealer as the rifle. The case is in mint condition and comes with both locking keys owner's manual and care card. I have seen some of these sell before but never with both keys and all paper work. Will also come with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased at the same time as the case. Also one box of vintage Winchester Western 45 solids and one box of empty's. You will not find a nicer 458 African Super Grade any where. Thanks very much for looking."

The exterior of the barrel under the shroud and the shroud itself need to be cleaned; I was told it was a preservative (Cosmoline), but can't confirm this, either.
One of the famous/infamous guns banned numerous times and numerous places.
It is a pistol, so would need CHP or PPP.  FTF in Greensboro, not looking for any trades."

Credit Cards are gladly accepted but do incur 3% fee.   Thank you! Arms To Bear LLC Salem, Oregon REDACTED www.ArmsToBearLLC.com----------- Pico - The Most Concealable .380 for Personal Defense and Home Protection At only 18mm wide, the Pico is the thinnest .380 semiauto handgun on the market, making it a best in class for concealed carry and home defense.  Besides being light, small and concealable, it offers easy use, adjustable sights, an ultra-reliable low-recoil mechanism and a tough, durable finish that--with proper care--will give you a virtual lifetime of service. Comfortable to Conceal and Carry Weighing only 11.5oz unloaded, this double-action-only (DAO) pistol is comfortable and unobtrusive to carry, no matter your preferred mode. The Pico's flat profile and snag-free lines make it perfect in a pocket holster, while its smooth sides and controls also make it ideal for inside-the-waistband carry--coupled with its extra-durable stainless-steel/polymer construction that is highly sweat-resistant. It will literally disappear even in a small purse, while thanks to its flowing design it will always be easy to draw from concealment when every second counts.  Soft-recoiling and Absolutely Reliable The Pico is soft-recoiling and makes target recovery lightning-quick after every shot, thanks to its minimal barrel tilt. This feature also makes feeding utterly reliable, even with more open hollowpoint designs or the hotter .380 commercial loads. This means that when you need it for concealed carry or home protection, the Pico will always deliver the performance you expect of a Beretta.   Easy to Disassemble and Customize, Loaded with Features, Made in USA Like its slightly bigger brother the Nano, the Pico is engineered to be easy and intuitive to take apart and reassemble. Its heart is a serialized modular chassis, meaning that the frame can be easily swapped to accommodate the user's preferences. Shipped with a storage case and two 6+1 stainless steel magazines (one flush, one with grip extension), the Pico features adjustable, quick-change sights with no gunsmithing required. It also offers ambidextrous magazine release, as well as a super-low-profile slide-release lever to keep the slide open when desired. The Pico is made in USA and brings all the reliability and quality of Beretta as the leader of a new generation of concealed-carry firearms."

SPAS 12.  Luigi Franchi.  Pump/Semi.  Tactical Shotgun.  Chambered in 12 Gauge.  21.5” Barrel, 8-Shot.  This shotgun operates as a semi/auto or pump action for increased versatility.  Overall condition is Excellent-New.

New in Box.  New Never Fired.  Has been a Safe Queen, since it was banned from import.  

The SPAS-12 is a combat shotgun that was manufactured by the Italian firearms company Franchi S.p.A. from 1979 to the Ban.  The SPAS-12 is a dual-mode shotgun, meaning it can be calibrated to cycle either semi-automatically or through pump-action.  The SPAS-12 has sold well to military and police users around the world, well as to the civilian market.  The appearance and intended purpose of the weapon initially led to it being banned from import to the United States due to a lack of ""sporting purpose"".

The rifle has about 120 rounds through it.  No barrel break-in procedures were observed with this rifle (I'm not a believer), just a few patches before shooting it the first time.

This gun has shot ~0.220 moa with Nosler 165gr BTs (luck?  I don't know.), 1.2 moa with 150gr Hornady FMJ handloads, and 0.80 moa with 180gr Federal Soft Tip hunting ammo.  All of these groups were shot prone off a bipod, while the rifle was still wearing the crappy hogue stock that comes with it; the rifle only had about 50-70 rounds through it at the time.   

Currently the rifle is wearing an FDE AICS 1.5 chassis and has a Badger knob.  Haven't done any groupings with the chassis yet, but I'm quite sure they'll be better since the original stock was in contact with about 2"" of the left side of the barrel.

The bolt has been polished with Nev'r Dull and Flitz to make it smoother.  It was also periodically soaked in Ballistol, which leaves a smooth film after being wiped off.

-----> I'm currently not home, so I don't expect payment until I'm able to actually ship it out, which will be Monday the 23rd soonest.  For now I'll make a list of those who want it.
