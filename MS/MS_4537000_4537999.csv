Bushnell Elite Tactical SMRS 1-6.5x 24mm BTR-1 SFP

The Bushnell Elite Tactical Rifle Scope 1 â 6.5X Variable is a tactical shooters dream. Designed with the demanding shooter in mind, it features the illuminated BTR-1 Reticle for the perfect combination of quick target acquisition in close and longer range precision. Great choice for 3 Gun Competition, Recon or Recce style builds. The quality of the glass is amazing and the SFP reticle will be the same size throughout the magnification range. First Focal Plane reticle is almost impossible to see at 1X in my experience.
A rugged 30mm, one piece tube makes the Elite Tactical impervious to inclement weather and extremely durable under any conditions. Fully multi-coated lenses with RainGuard HD coating produce a vivid sight picture in adverse lighting conditions to keep you shooting when other scopes fail.

Ultra Wide Anti-Reflective Band Coating is engineered for every lens element in the optical path in order to optimize brightness and color transmission across the entire light spectrum.  

Small size, low to medium power with high performance delivering maximum results at close quarter or medium range.

True 1x power for lightning-fast target acquisition; features a Second Focal Plane BTR-1 reticle with 11 illumination settings.

Aero Precision lower with SAA-installed LPK with m4 commercial buffer tube collapsible stock. Magpul bad lever, Magpul oversize trigger guard (poly) and anti walk hammer/trigger pins installed by me.
Aero precision a4 upper with Nickel boron auto BCG, matech US Army surplus Rear sight, Magpul PTS front sight, fully cowitnessed with Aimpoint 7000SC red dot, UTG machined aluminum high-profile QD mount (has held Sub MOA Zero going on 3 years now through about 500 rds). Aluminum VFG and UTG bipod (connects with a QD rail to bipod connection). Ambi-oversized charging handle. Blackhawk! 2 point sling
Daniel defense chrome-lined, polygonal rifled 1:7 5.56/.223 M4 profile barrel with mid length gas system. YHM low profile gas block, rifle length aluminum free float quad rail. YHM phantom comp/flash hider.
This particular build was built mid 2012 and all the parts reflect that stylistically. this was my fifth build and it was flawlessly put together. A torque wrench was used to tighten the barrel nut to 65 foot lbs, all screws installed with blue locktite.
This rifle has been used at the range and has minor scuffs from transport and range use. It is sub MOA accurate, and I can reliably hit a steel target standing/sitting at 200 yards with no professional training. It's a phenomenal rifle for someone who wants a ready-to-go package. A long range optic turns it into an SPR, essentially.
I've put about 1500 into it (not counting panic markup on some components. 500-600 rounds through it. Appx 9.5 lbs as configured. It will reliably eat anything. I've shot practically all brands through it without a single malfunction, save for a couple double-feeds from a piece of shit aluminum magazine that I threw away. All accessories are QD.
I'm asking $1000. Price is firm. This is a ready-to-go rig and requires no adjustments to start schooling your buddies at the range. Currently zero is set to 150 yards.

Thanks for looking."

AR Pistol:
This pistol is a pretty basic configuration on a budget, but was well assembled.
SAA lower with lpk installed, but KAK industries pistol receiver extension was installed by me. Has a bad lever and standard a2 pistol grip. This lower is 'sig brace ready' if you're into it. I have a cane tip on it currently.
Upper is an armalite a2 (integral carry handle, rear sight post... these are actually pretty expensive to buy new. Came from an old build). Classic firearms heavy 10.5"" barrel, standard a2 birdcage comp, carbine gas system, Magpul MOE handguard. There is no VFG on it, but the OAL length is over 26"" (27.5"" excluding a2 birdcage). I do have a vfg I am happy to throw in if you are ok with surfing the 'firearm vs pistol' legality issue. Standard Auto BCG from SAA.
It was built this year, and I range tested it for function. Put 200 rounds through it without a single malfunction. You'll want to dial it into zero, as I was only interested in getting it on paper when I took it out.
Price is $650..

Up on the block first is a Daniel Defense M4v7 (not LW) rifle. I'm beginning to think that AR15 rifles just aren't my cup of tea. I bought it for $1375 plus tax so my loss is your gain. The rifle still has the packing grease on it from the factory. Obviously since I just got it the factory padded case, docs, 30 round Pmag are still with it. For this price please meet near me.

Second on the block is an unfired CZ 2075 Rami pistol in 9mm. Nothing too much to say here, very solidly built pistol with an alloy frame, no polymer here. For those unfamiliar with this pistol, you can use it in traditional DA/SA or it does have a safety so you can carry condition 1 if you prefer single action. Internal slide to frame fit makes the CZ's one of the most accurate pistols around. Comes with the box, docs, lock, and all the mfg goodies. Also comes with a 10 round flush fit magazine, 14 round magazine with grip extender, and 16 round magazine. This pistol can also take standard CZ 75 mags as well as others. It is a great little pistol from what I've felt and read, but just a bit too small for me. I paid $640 for the whole package so again my loss is your gain. Geez you guys are getting lucky today.

S&W Model 15-3 4"" .38 special with pinned barrel. The serial number dates this fine Combat Masterpiece to 1971. The finish is the carbona bluing found on older M15's and 19's and is no longer produced by S&W on their newer models. The finish is in very good condition, you be the judge and please request the many photos I have of every detail of this revolver. I removed  all oil residues and applied Renaissance Wax prior to taking my photos using a digital camera. This process will magnify any blemishes and there are very few, the most obvious being the wear at the tip of the barrel on the right side which to the naked eye is barley noticeable but I did a close up for full disclosure
             The mechanics are excellent and is what I have come to expect of model 15's with beautiful trigger action, a clean shiny bore and great rifling.
             The grips are not numbered to the revolver but none the less are period correct and near perfect condition for the older style checkered magnas with the old style black washers on the inside of the grips. Beautiful

Reliability has always been a longstanding hallmark of Remingtonâ autoloaders. The Model 11-87â¢ is no different. Its patented pressure-compensating gas system is the biggest reason why. The same gun you use one day on the skeet range can be used the next day in the goose blind. And while many have tried to copy its dependable performance and versatility, none have come remotely close.

Take the time-honored, all-weather dependability of the Model 11-87 action and combine it with the capability to handle high-payload shotshells. Now prepare to rule the flyway. Ultimately versatile for today's varied waterfowl (or any other) hunting situations. Its patented self-cleaning pressure-compensating gas system, delivers reliable shell cycling with virtually any load. Impressive."

I have a nice street legal dune buggy/sand rail I just don't use.. The buggy runs and drives good and is powered by a VW engine and transmission. I just had an oil change done, much of the lighting/wiring is new, and the tires are in good shape. The buggy has an aluminum front end, rear cutter breaks, and dual weber carbs. I am really not much of a mechanic so I won't start talking about stuff I really don't know about. The buggy also comes with some extra switches, lights, and a hitch to pull it with. I have a clear Kansas title. Serious buyers only, No joy riders and I am NOT looking for trades. Call REDACTED for more information."

Sale will be conducted through an FFL.   

The Taurus PT709 âslimâ is a single stack 9mm with an almost identical take down process to a Glock 43, but with a 7+1 capacity.  (Included: 3 magazines, Galco holster, ownerâs manual, and hard case) The nickname âSlimâ is definitely appropriate measuring less than one inch wide at both the slide and frame.  The 709 is well suited for concealed, purse, or ankle carry, being both big enough to shoot and handle well yet small enough to hide easily.

Despite its small dimensions, the 709 is large enough to have traditional full-size pistol features. All controls are standard, with a left-side mounted slide release, magazine release, and thumb safety.  The 709 also features a loaded chamber indicator on the top of the slide that is easy to see or to feel in the dark.

Taurus pistols are well constructed of quality materials. The 709s trigger face has an integrated safety lever, similar to those of Glock. For additional peace of mind, all Taurus pistols are backed by a lifetime warranty that extends to all subsequent owners. It also has Taurusâ patented security system for storing. 

I am not aware of any other 9mm sub-compact pistol that delivers this level of quality and performance for less than $400. This pistol is well crafted and has been maintained to the highest levels.  If you are in the market for a sub-compact 9mm, the Taurus PT709 Slim is definitely worthy of serious consideration.

The Barrett 82A1 stands at the pinnacle of firearm design, and has been proven in long-range accuracy, ruggedness, and dependability in any environment (military or civilian). The low recoil and self-loading action of the 82A1 created itâs own hallmark! If you are anything like me, the more that you research the engineering that goes into the Barrett Model 82A1, the more you will be inspired by the close tolerances and meticulous engineering that has gone into every single part of this gun. It is unparalleled.

I was so overwhelmed by Barrettâs development of the Model 82A1, that I got this rifle to hold onto. I am the sole owner, and this rifle has remained new and unfired, to this day. It has been well maintained and stored in climate-controlled conditions with thorough cleaning and lubrication regularly. I NEVER intended to sell this beautiful gun, but must now due to financial necessity.

If you are unfamiliar with the Barrett Model 82A1, please watch some of the You Tube demonstrative videos of this rifle. There simply are NO Comparables.

The Swarovski Optik high-performance scope is made in Western Austria by Swarovski; a family business that was established in 1895 after Daniel Swarovski invented the first electric grinding machine for jewelry stores. In 1935, Wilhelm Swarovski pursued his passion for astronomy and built far better optics for telescopes than the world had ever seen. This gave rise to Swarovski Optik, a company that still stands firmly behind their products. I believe this to be the best scope, atop the best rifle.

The Pelican 1750 case for the Barrett Model 82A1 is built like a tank, and is specially designed for the 82A1. It is watertight, crushproof, and dustproof, and comes with a Lifetime Guarantee of Excellence. It measures 53â Length X 16â Width X 6.12â Depth, and is made of polypropylene with stainless steel bearings. It comes with a side handle, end handle, and roller wheels.

I cannot bring myself to piece out the gun, so I am selling it with all of the accessories. EVERYTHING IS IN NEW CONDITION. This includes everything detailed in the attached photos, including:

The barrel is finished inside and out with a highly durable and corrosion resistant Black Nitride, a treatment that produces an extremely hard, slick surface on the steel that resists carbon adhesion for easier cleaning and maintenance. The Nitride process converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside a barrel's bore.  This 16"" barrel features a 1 in 7"" twist and is threaded 5/8""-24 at the muzzle for easy installation of flash hiders, muzzle brakes, and/or sound suppressors. It utilizes the versatile carbine length gas system, a good choice for this cartridge if various weights and types of ammunition are to be used. Most subsonic and supersonic loads, fired from either a suppressed or unsuppressed gun, are compatible with this configuration. However, some subsonic ammunition may not always cycle reliably under adverse conditions or in a severely fouled firearm without a sound suppressor attached to provide extra backpressure. Barrel assembly includes a carbine gas tube, low profile steel gas block, barrel extension and locator pin. Also includes a AAC Blackout 51 tooth Flash Hider for Flash Suppression or Quick attach/ detach of AAC suppressors. A $105.00 value.Â  Requires barrel nut for installation (not included).
