For sale today, we have a very early Yugoslavian SKS PAP M59 rifle.  This is a 5-digit C-serial model, C-41786.  That puts it at almost the beginning of the Yugoslavian SKS dates.  http://www.sksboards.com/smf/index.php?topic=81.0

The configuration of this rifle is a standard setup with blade bayonet, no grenade launcher, and standard length.  The stock has minor marks, as seen in the pictures, but it doesn't appear to have any major damage to it at all.  The serial numbers are stamped and electro-penciled.  I didn't find any arsenal marks at all, which is in-line with it being a very early Yugoslavian SKS.  The barrel looks excellent.  This model should not be chrome-lined, but the bore and crown are extremely clean, making it look chromed.

(Note about chroming: Chrome-plating protects bores from corrosion, which was a concern with old ammo.  It also protected against oxidation.  However, early chroming was generally uneven, leading to a reduction in accuracy.  This bore is clean and non-chromed, meaning that you can shoot new non-corrosive ammo and clean it as normal, and it should provide outstanding accuracy.)

Internally, it doesn't seem to have much wear at all.  I doubt it saw any action at all, and it doesn't seem to have been abused by any prior owner.  Because I believed this to be a good example rifle, I didn't modify it in any way.

The rifle is as shown in the pictures, and it does not include the cleaning kit, but it does include the rod.  I have torn this rifle down and not found any conflicting serial numbers.

I'm asking $550 (Edit: Lowered to $499.)  I am willing to ship to your FFL for an additional fee.  Thank you again for looking.  If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to ask.

We have another run and gun event coming up soon!  Many of you know who we are, but here is our website for the newcomers out there: http://rac-frag.weebly.com/

Here is a video of me running one of the courses we set up last summer. This will give you an idea of the type of shooting we are doing.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDcMGPO6uKM

We are RAC FRAG- Responsible Armed Citzens, and this is Fun Run And Gun.  We offer a fun and unique experience to allow you to train with your weapons in a way that many of you are not able to do.  We set up a course that involves engaging multiple targets at different shooting stations.  You are required to run from station to station with your rifle and hit targets at ranges of 20 yards to about 150 yards, with a few handgun targets along the way.  

So come out and join us for a day of shooting fun!  We are a great bunch of guys to hang out with. Please don't be shy.  None of us are professional competition shooters. We just enjoy shooting guns and practicing.  All skill levels are welcome to our events.  Even my dear old dad hobbles through the course with us at 60 plus years old, so it really is for everybody. It is just plain fun all around, plus you get good training that you could never get at an indoor range. We also have a plate rack and a dueling tree for people to entertain themselves with while they aren't running our course. We will have a grill on site if you want to bring some meat to toss on it for lunch.  We will also have an outhouse on site.

You can register for our events on our website.  Please feel free to call or text me if you have any questions.  I don't live on my computer so I may not respond to emails promptly. Thanks for reading!  Cody REDACTED"

If you are brave and have a lot of patience you can try reloading this ammo as well. The brass is very strong but they are Berdan primed and you have to drill the military-style primer out from inside the case to create a flash hole (Berdan primed brass does not have a conventional flash hole) and then either drill out the primer from the outside (carefully) or use a punch from inside the case, one at a time. A boxer deprimer pin from a 2- or 3-die set will not do the job."

The G43 is Glock's subcompact, slimline, single stack, 9mm pistol. The G43 is the answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate, and fantastic for all shooters regardless of hand size. The grip has a built-in beaver tail design which allows the shooter to acquire a high and tight grip. The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other Glock pistols.

The atf announced today that it will not move forward with its proposed framework to ban commonplace 5.56 M855 “green tip” ammunition at this time while it reviews the record number (more than 80,000) comments it has received so far. ATF will continue to accept comments through March 16. NSSF, as the trade association for the firearms industry, looks forward to engaging in a dialogue with ATF to address this issue that led to the now withdrawn proposal. Our industry members hope to meet consumer demand in bringing alternative ammunition products to the market and to continue to sell the popular M855 rifle target ammunition. NSSF continues to strongly urge ATF to grant 32 long-pending petitions to exempt alternative rifle ammunition designed and intended for the hunting market

I am well aware of the supply and demand market and what the current average price is. Because I go through 2500 rounds every year in my rifle matches and the steep fee I have to pay to have thousands of rounds shipped to me, the max I can pay for Portuguese or S. African ammo is $0.50 per round. The max I can pay for Hirtenberger Austrian ammo is $0.60 per round. I will pay the fee to ship FedEx ground service."

The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

FEATURES • 30” barrel with 1 in 15” twist • Barrel free-foated within vented fore-end • Bolt action: left bolt / right port, for faster cycling of action • Magpul® PRS adjustable buttstock with LimbSaver® recoil pad • Disassembles like an AR-type rife for cleaning and maintenance • MIL-STD 1913 rail on receiver and vented fore-end • Lower receiver machined from T6-6061 aluminum billet • Steel bipod with folding legs • ErgoGrip® Deluxe Tactical pistol grip • Manganese phosphate finish on steel parts • Hard anodized black finish on aluminum parts (Mil-Spec) • Ships with Storm™ deployment case, two 10-round magazines, and eye protection..
 As you can see from the pictures it is in great shape. It has only fired 28 rounds of American Eagle, no tracer or API, APIT rounds have been fired (even though i do own some). It goes together like an AR, just 2 pins and you install the bolt handle with the included hex wrench. It has all the extras that came with it new, a lock, cable, owners manual, 2 hex wrenches, tinted glasses, I did use the ear plugs and I would suggest using both ear plugs and ear muffs when shooting this. Check out my other auctions for the 50 BMG ammo and other guns. I am selling off a few safe queens to finance another gun purchase. Thanks

Rifle has maybe seen 500 rounds in all the years.  Sat in a safe with rem oil on it to keep it in good shape.  Good condition.  Well maintained.  This rifle was my graduation present and only saw the range a few times because of a college budget.  Wanting to sell because I recently purchased a BCM which does not have a carry handle on it.  Looking to purchase an AK once this sells.  Sad to see it go but I never shoot it...  Transfer fee and travel can be negotiated.  Willing to entertain offers"

Has some cosmetic wear but in excellent mechanical condition, hasn't been fired much.  Will come with two 13 round magazines.

Fun gun to shoot but I picked up another compact handgun so I don't use it much.

I'd like to trade for a pocket gun of some kind, primarily interested in a snub nose 38 revolver of some kind, primarily a S&W J frame or maybe Lcr. Would also like a S&W Bodyguard or LC9s.  No Kel Tecs or Taurus please.

Please Note:
- This is a ""PACKAGE DEAL"" SALE ...
- I will NOT separate anything from this package deal.
- I will only accept CASH in a FTF sale, in or near the 21220 zip code.
- I am NOT negotiable on the price...

PRICE is $300 CASH ONLY...and NOT NEGOTIABLE ONE PENNY, and that includes everything listed above!!

In other words....$300 FIRM

Would entertain the idea of trading for either as compact 9mm semi auto pistol or HiPoint 45 caliber carbine..

I also have a almost new .45 caliber Springfield Armory XD-45 Mod.2 pistol for sale (to Maryland HQL holder) and will make a package deal on BOTH offerings.
