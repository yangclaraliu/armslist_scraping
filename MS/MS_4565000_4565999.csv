This is a beautifully crafted English rifle.  The bluing on the metal is just phenomenal!  The stock is ambidextrous and it's a side-lever action repeater with a 10-shot rotary magazine.  

One of the most unique features of this rifle is the power adjuster.  You can shoot it on high-power and get 30 good shots at 935 fps with JSB Jumbo pellets.  This equates to almost 31 foot-pounds of energy.  If you're shooting closer targets you can turn down the power and easily get 60-70 shots before filling it with air.  The rifle is fantastically accurate.  Check out the target photos.  These 10-shot groups are at 100 YARDS.  Did you think a pellet gun could ever be this accurate a this distance?!?!

If you're not familiar with PCP air rifles this site gives a good description of how they work:

I have a Hill Mk III hand pump to fill the rifle.  It takes less than 5 minutes to pump it up from my low pressure (125 BAR) back up to my high pressure (180 BAR).  You can read reviews on this pump here:

I can also add a set of Magpul BUIS sights that are in like new condition for $70 more and a BCM Gunfighter Mod 4 charging handle for $25. So $770 for the whole package.

I'm asking for a local meet in the Hendersonville/ Asheville area and I am not interested in trades on this one. 

I will put a link and the description from the Adams Arms website below. 

http://www.adamsarms.net/14-5-mid-tactical-evo-upper-pinned-xlp

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 14.5"" Upper is a short barreled upper with a pinned Manimal Flash Hider for legal length that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12.37"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs.Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer tan any other AR upper you own.

I have a Savage Axis II XP bolt action in 308, the gun is brand new it literally has 8 rounds down the barrel. Zero complaints about this gun its light, reliable, and chambered in one of the best rounds out there.

I also have a Mossberg 500 Waterfowl in 12 gauge, I have put quite a bit of shells through this and it goes bang everytime. Its a good used Mossberg 500 nothing else to say.

Last I have a Mossberg Maverick 88 Security in 12 gauge, this pump action like my Savage is brand new I have put 5 shells through her, then sadly she sat in the safe.

The reason for these going up is because like my hand guns I have multiples or others similar and know want to see something different.

The size, high capacity and 45 ACP makes this the perfect personal defense / carry pistol. The fact that its so rare makes it a very collectable pistol. Those facts combined together means that the value of this pistol will do nothing but keep going up. 
It shoots amazing, the ported barrel and slide GREATLY REDUCES the muzzle flip and recoil (its basically like shooting a 38, 380 or 9MM). 
The size makes it very concealable for carry.  I have 3 - 10 rounds Springfield mags that work perfectly and 2 Pare 12 rounds mags, one works great the other one ""not so much"". Not that you buy a pistol because its look cool, but this one COOL and always gets a lot of attention. Its not perfect but in very good condition. The original grips and grip screws where customized and looks great on the pistol. The 1911 V10s single stacks are few and far between, BUT this is a LOADED 1911 V1O ULTRA COMPACT - HIGH  CAPCiITY / DOUBLE STACK IN STAINLESS with a 3 1/2""Barrel . they are very hard to find.  asking $950.00 OBO

It is the shortest rimfire silencer on the market, has the quietest 10-round average of any silencer in its class, and can go 2,000 rounds between cleanings. Patented Multi-Part Containment (MPC™) technology facilitates ease of disassembly and reassembly – an essential function of .22LR suppressors. The internal MPC™ construction uses two half tubes that pull away from a monolithic core, which ensures that the Sparrow 22 will remain easy to clean after extended periods of use with notoriously dirty rimfire ammunition. The Sparrow 22 is compatible with multiple calibers up to 5.7mm and is rated for full auto fire.FAMILY:Sparrow SeriesMODEL:22 SparrowTYPE:NFA - SilencerFINISH:Black OxideTHREAD PATTERN:1/2-28DIAMETER:1.062""ATTACH METHOD:Direct ThreadCALIBER/GAUGE:22 LROVERALL LENGTH:5.08""CONSTRUCTION:Alloy Steel, 17-4 PH SSDB REDUCTION:41 dBCAN DISASSEMBLE:YesADDL INFO:Multi-Caliber RatedADDL INFO:17HMR, 22LR/MAG/HORNET, 5.7X28ADDL INFO:MPC Technology"

It is a great little takeoff on the Beretta model 21, the Taurus PT-22 Pistol chambered to hold 8 + 1 rounds of .22 Long Rifle ammunition. It is full time double action, yet it has a positive lock side safety. It has a keyed internal mainspring lock. For added security, this Taurus is equipped with a Magazine Safety, meaning that it cannot be fired even with a live round in the barrel and the main safety off, not until the magazine is re-inserted. An added safety feature is the Beretta type tip-up barrel that allows easy loading and unloading without racking the slide, something many of our fellow boomers are no longer able to do anyway with the onset of Arthur – itis, that is. Add the light weight, 13.5 ounces empty, and a person has one of the best small autos you can buy. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus, S.A., of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Importer and warrantor is Taurus International of Miami. Construction is steel slide, barrel, internal parts, .220 smooth faced combat trigger and matching bobbed hammer.

The aluminum frame is extremely light weight thanks to it being skeletonized and the fore grip is constructed entirely from a very high quality carbon fiber, which further adds to it being super light weight. The foregrip also allows the barrel to be completely free floating, which as you know, increases accuracy. There is no flex in the carbon fiber. The buttstock is full adjustable for cheek weld and length of pull. The rubber pistol grip fills your hand very well. The barrel is 26 inches and has been crowned with a 12"" twist. The barrel is a thick heavy contour barrel. Free shipping for police or former military. Email call or text anytime. My cell is 678 314 3135. No trades. I will ship it to an FFL near you

I put a longer, heavier barrel on the original rifle, so built a new one out of the damn fine parts I had left over. 

The used parts: 

Daniel Defense CHF lightweight profile barrel 1:7 mid length, has seen 200-300 rounds total in its entire service life. Almost new, barely broken in. Barrel is capable of at least 1 MOA accuracy, I've never tried to shoot it with a good enough optic to go more precise than that 
--this was broken down off another rifle that used all DD parts, the entire barrel assembly was transferred intact to the new rifle (minus taking down the gas tube of course) 
--barrel extension and barrel nut lubed with good moly grease and torqued to within accepted tension range (three times to 30 lbs to season the threads and even out the grease, then set to 80 and take to next point where gas tube aligns--I estimate final tension between 50 and 60 lbs) 
--F-marked A2 front sight gas block, stainless steel mid length gas tube, properly aligned A2 flash hider 
--Magpul handguard with custom installed QD attachment point and two rails already installed 

https://danieldefense.com/16-5-56mm-mid-length-1-7-lw-profile.html 

Daniel Defense bolt and bolt carrier group and charging handle 
--this is unmarked, but it is the matched bolt carrier out of the original DD rifle that the barrel was broken down off of, and has seen exactly the same service life, ie, it's still almost new 
--the gas key screws have the cleanest, most precise staking of any bolt carrier I have ever seen 
--milspec charging handle

The new parts: 

Anderson Arms matched upper and lower receivers 
--multi cal marked 

Rock River Arms Lower parts kit with single stage trigger and RRA branded Hogue grip 
--all parts properly installed and fully functional 
--RRA produces one of the highest quality LPKs. Very good parts. 

Palmetto State Armory 7075 milspec buffer tube, spring, and carbine weight buffer 
--installed with moly grease to prevent future galling, torqued to proper tension 
--I have not staked the end plate in case future you wants to install a qd end plate (highly recommended), but I will stake it at no extra charge at buyer's request (not recommended). 

Magpul folding rear sight 

Stock! Buyer's choice of: 

B5 Systems Sopmod Brave stock in factory original Mandrake camo 
-or- 
Tactical Intent M4 style stock--same basic size and shape as a milspec M4, but with a few nice upgrades such as integral ambidextrous QD sling mounts--super high quality manufacturer 

I test fired the upper (5 rounds--1 spent casing and test fire target will be included with rifle) on my duty lower to confirm proper function, ran flawlessly. I did not zero it, and it has been very thoroughly cleaned and lubed. 

Asking $800 plus actual cost of shipping and insurance. Face to face transfer to KY residents with valid KY drivers license or CCDW, must ship to FFL out of state.

ACP, manufactured in Suhl during the 1920's before the rise of the NAZI Party, these were the preferred hide-out guns carried by elite Officers of the Wehrmacht and SS, as a backup weapon for their Luger sidearms. Designed by the same man who designed the infamous German MP40 Submachine guns and later refined by Heinrich Vollmer at the Erme Werkes.

This particular gun was made for German use. The later guns made for export around the world had ""Made in Germany"" stamped on the slide, this one does not, thus proving this was in use during WW2 in Germany.  It is the early First Variant Model 1, and the most sought after by collectors now, as it was for the Wehrmacht & SS in WW2.

These pistols are the smallest, most reliable pocket guns of all the German pistols, that were pressed into service during WW2. Highly concealable, accurate and deadly at close range. Slide it into your vest pocket, and you'll forget you're even carrying. It has a minimal imprint signature when hidden.

This one is an un-refinished gun with a beautiful plum-brown wartime patina in very good+ condition, with a nice bore, excellent grips, original correct magazine, all matching numbers and clear proof marks, and will make a fine investment grade addition to anyone's collection who enjoys German weapons of that era.

There is also finish wear on the frame beaver tail due to lightly sanding down the corners; it would cut your hand after a few mags through (alloy frame, won't rust).

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

Also has a brand new Lone Wolf 9mm conversion barrel thats threaded, havent fired it yet.  This one is ""blind marked""  so it doesnt have the big Lone Wolf logo on it that some people dont like.  Don't have any dedicated 9mm mags yet, however it will feed and fire 9mm from the .40 mags.  Will of course come with the stock .40 barrel and Glock case.  Will not trade/sell the conversion barrel without the gun.

Just interested in other quality 9mm handguns right now.  Particularly interested in a Walther PPQ, HK VP9 or P30 SK, Sig P226, maybe a Beretta 92a1 or M9a1 or XDm.  Not really looking for other .40's right now, but you can try me.  No Taurus's or long guns, thanks!
